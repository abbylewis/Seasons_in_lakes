Therefore, this study is aimed at analyzing the flood period segmentation and optimizing the staged flood limit water levels (FLWLs) for a multi-purpose reservoir, the Longtan Reservoir, China. The rainfall seasonality index (SIP) and the runoff seasonality index (SIR) are used to evaluate the feasibility and rationality of the flood period staging. The fractal method is then used to segment the flood season. Finally, the design flood is carried out to optimize the staged FLWLs. The results show that the SI is an effective indicator for judging the feasibility and verifying the rationality of flood segmentation. The flood period can be segmented into the pre-flood season (12 April-29 May), the main flood season (30 May-3 September), and the post-flood season (4 September-9 November). The FLWLs in the main flood and the post-flood season can be raised by 2.05 m and 3.45 m, and the effective reservoir capacity is increased by 5.810 billion m(3) and 6.337 billion m(3), according to the results of the flood season division.

Namely, it is designated as a tourist destination. What is perhaps even more important is that its surplus water ends up in Lake Ludas, a significant habitat for migrating and aquatic bird species, and it is a RAMSAR site. The conducted analysis points to the major conclusion that the reasons for very high Chlorophyll-a values can be found in considerable anthropogenic pressures exerted on the studied area. Due to these pressures, the lake is not in ecological equilibrium. To support this conclusion, an in-depth analysis was conducted using water quality measurements for 9 years, from 2011 to 2019. The data was subject to principal component analysis (PCA) and machine learning classification algorithms that identified a seasonal character regarding the lake's water quality. Water quality indexes (WQI) were determined using two approaches to provide a more general insight into the lake's overall quality. Keeping in mind the large number of data gathered monthly within the Palic-Ludas Lake system, fitted models for estimating certain water quality parameters were also developed. This was accomplished via multivariate regression, resulting in a number of equations that can, using a few basic input parameters, predict values of ammonium nitrogen, Chlorophyll-a, and 5-day biological oxygen demand. The fitted models were obtained for relatively homogeneous periods within a year identified by cluster analysis.					; Horvat, Mirjana/AAC-4480-2020; Pastor, Kristian/AGN-9085-2022	Horvat, Zoltan/0000-0002-4605-099X; Horvat, Mirjana/0000-0002-7700-024X; Pastor, Kristian/0000-0003-0890-8171													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2021	193	7							410	10.1007/s10661-021-09195-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09195-8								34114096					WOS:000757352900023

This study examines the temporal and spatial variability in CO2 and CH4 surface water concentrations and diffusive fluxes from an Amazonian reservoir using an original data set combining both a high temporal (1 central site x 22 years) and spatial (44 sites x 1 season) resolution monitoring. The gas concentrations at the central site decreased over time and suggested reduced bioavailability of C in the initial flooded soil but exhibited strong seasonal variation. Not accounting for this variability may result in uncertainties in estimates of annual concentrations (ranging from -68.9% to +260% for CH4 and from -71.5% to +156% for CO2) and thus in estimates of diffusive gas emissions. Gas concentrations and diffusive fluxes exhibited high spatial variability in the reservoir, 24 years after impoundment. In particular, diffusive fluxes were higher in littoral and transitional areas than in open areas, suggesting a large contribution of allochthonous C to current gaseous emissions. Not accounting for this spatial variability in diffusive fluxes may underestimate the total emissions expressed in CO2 equivalents from the whole reservoir by 50.7%. Our study stresses the importance of well-resolved temporal and spatial monitoring to provide reliable estimated of C emissions and a comprehensive understanding of the processes involved; both of these inputs are needed to support decision-making for developing energy strategies.					; Vigouroux, Regis/IQV-7846-2023; Daufresne, Martin/JGE-5174-2023	COLAS, FANNY/0000-0002-5485-6715; Vigouroux, Regis/0009-0006-7887-8333; DAUFRESNE, MARTIN/0009-0004-4604-4903													0886-6236	1944-9224				DEC	2020	34	12							e2020GB006602	10.1029/2020GB006602	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GB006602													WOS:000603665500005

Risk assessment of heavy metal pollution in water, sediment and plants in the Nile River in the Cairo region, Egypt	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												Samples of water, sediment and two native plants (Eichhornia crassipes and Ceratophyllum demersum), collected seasonally from eight sites, were analyzed to investigate the level of contamination with metals (Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb and Cd) in the Nile River in the Cairo region, using heavy metal pollution and contamination indices in the case of water, and the geoaccumulation index, the pollution load index, the enrichment factor and the potential ecological risk factor in the case of sediment. The results clarified that the levels of metals among three compartments were in order: sediments > plants > water. The Nile water in Cairo is not critically polluted by the studied metals and the metal pollution index for most sites does not exceed the critical limit (< 100). Sediment samples showed a clear accumulation of Mn, Ni and Cd when compared with benchmarks cited by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), especially during low flow seasons. The contribution of Cd to the ecological risk assessment was about 80%, while the contribution of Ni was about 10%, reflecting that these elements originated primarily from anthropogenic sources. Eichhornia crassipes and Ceratophyllum demersum have a higher accumulation capacity for Mn, Cu and Fe compared to the other studied metals.

Here, we describe seasonal population densities and associated annual population changes of ten wildlife species (elephant, giraffe, zebra, wildebeest, waterbuck, warthog, Grant's gazelle, impala, Thomson's gazelle, and Kirk's dik-dik) in four protected areas in northern Tanzania over eight years and test two hypotheses: (1) annual wildlife population changes are positively correlated with conservation status; and, (2) relationships between annual population changes and protected area status are mediated by species' body mass. We carried out wildlife surveys from late 2011 to the end of 2018 and estimated wildlife densities in a line distance sampling framework. The majority of species occurred at high densities in fully protected areas, and larger-bodied species occurred at low densities or were absent in the least protected area. We estimated annual species- and area-specific population changes with generalized linear mixed effects that accounted for seasonal variation in this ecosystem. Using mull-model comparisons, we did not find evidence that annual population changes were correlated with body mass. However, species- and area-specific population changes appeared to vary by species and area, but were not consistently associated with protection status. Wildlife populations in Tarangire National Park and two human-dominated areas showed mainly stable or positive population trends, whereas wildlife populations in Lake Manyara National Park appeared to decline during the study period. This ecosystem- and long-term monitoring indicates apparent context-dependent differences in protected area performance within one ecosystem and exemplifies the need for, and challenges of, long-term monitoring in protected areas to guide effective conservation.					; Kiffner, Christian/F-4088-2012	Kiffner, Christian/0000-0002-7475-9023; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2020	110								105903	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105903	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105903													WOS:000507381800065

The average concentration of phenol was the highest in water samples as well as in sediment samples during the wet season, 101.68 ng/L and 127.76 ng/g, respectively. 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) was not detected in some sampling sites. Shitou Koumen Reservoir and the neighboring area were the severest areas of phenolic pollution. The lower reach was more polluted in three water seasons than the middle reach and upper reach. Phenol had ecological risks in sediment during three water seasons. 2-Nitrophenol (2-NP) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) had ecological risks in sediment in both the normal and wet season. The concentrations of five phenolic compounds from high to low were in the wet season, normal season, and dry season in water and sediment, respectively. There were middle risks in water of total concentrations for five phenolic compounds in several sampling sites. Total concentrations for five phenolic compounds in sediment had high ecological risks in all sampling sites. However, there was no human health risk in the Yinma River Basin.

Reynolds: what future merits the approach may hold?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												River phytoplankton has been studied to understand its occurrence and composition since the end of the nineteenth century. Later, pioneers addressed mechanisms that affected river phytoplankton by "origin of plankton", "turbulent mixing", "flow heterogeneity", "paradox of potamoplankton maintenance" and "dead zones" as keywords along the twentieth century. A major shift came with the recognition that characteristic units in phytoplankton compositions could be linked to specific set of environmental conditions, known as the "Phytoplankton Functional Group concept" sensu Reynolds. The FG concept could successfully be applied to river phytoplankton due to its close resemblance to shallow lakes phytoplankton. The FG approach enables one to separate the effects of "natural constraints" and "human impacts" on river phytoplankton and to evaluate the ecological status of rivers. The FG classification has mainly been advocated in the context of how the environment shaped the functional composition of phytoplankton. It may be further developed in the future by a trait-based mechanistic classification of taxa into FGs, and by the exact quantification of FGs on ecosystem functioning. These improvements will help quantify how global warming and human impacts affect river phytoplankton and corresponding alterations in ecosystem functioning.

In thermokarst lakes, sediment and water are two distinct but highly interconnected habitats, harboring different bacterial communities in terms of taxonomic composition. However, the co-occurrence networks of these bacterial communities remain unclear. Here, we investigate the co-occurrence ecological networks of sediment and water bacterial communities for thermokarst lakes in the Yellow River Source Area on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results show that the bacterial communities construct distinct co-occurrence networks in sediment and water. The metacommunity network was parsed into four major modules formed by the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) enriched in sediment or water independently, and water-enriched OTUs exhibited much closer interconnections than sediment-enriched OTUs. When considering the sediment and water bacterial networks separately, different topological properties and modular patterns present: the sediment bacterial network was more clustered while the modules less responded to the environmental variables. On the contrary, the water bacterial network was more complex with the OTUs more interconnected and its modules more responded to the environmental variables. Moreover, the results of the structural equation model suggest that, by the influence of environmental variations on individual modules, the water bacterial communities would be more vulnerable under the fact of accelerating climate change. This study provides insights beyond a conventional taxonomic perspective, adding our knowledge of the potential mechanisms structuring bacterial community assembly and improving our prediction of the responses of this fast-changing ecosystem to future climate change.

The effects of climate change-induced melting on the microbial ecology in different glacial-fed aquatic systems have been well illuminated, but the resolution of seasonal dynamics was still limited. Here, we studied bacterial community composition and diversity in a glacial-fed Tibetan lake, Lake Ranwu, to elucidate how glacial-fed aquatic ecosystems respond to the seasonal glacial melting. Obvious seasonal variations of bacterial dominant groups were found in Lake Ranwu and inlet rivers. In April, the majority of OTUs belonged to the Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. The Proteobacteria increased to the most abundant phylum in July and November, while the Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria decreased about 50% over seasons. Most key discriminant taxa of each season's community strongly associated with specific environmental variables, suggesting their adaptation to seasonal environments. Bacterial alpha diversity varied among seasons and exhibited strongly negative correlations with conductivity. Conductivity was the major driving force in determining the seasonal variation of bacterial community composition. Fluctuated conductivity was one of the consequences of seasonal melting of glaciers. This study offered evidence for the unique seasonal dynamics pattern of bacterial communities responding to glacial melting. Moreover, this study may provide a reference for assessing the long-term effects of glacial retreat on glacial-fed aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, XH; Zhang, Q; Xu, CY; Ye, XC				Li, Xianghu; Zhang, Qi; Xu, Chong-Yu; Ye, Xuchun			The changing patterns of floods in Poyang Lake, China: characteristics and explanations	NATURAL HAZARDS												Poyang Lake, directly connected with the Yangtze River, is one of the most frequently flooded areas in China. The frequent large floods have caused huge damages to the environment and economy and threatened the life of approximately 10 million people. Understanding the changing characteristics of floods as well as the affecting factors is an important prerequisite of flood disaster prevention and mitigation. In this study, the characteristics of historical floods in Poyang Lake were identified and examined based on several widely used indices and Mann-Kendall test. The study also analyzed the related driving forces and discussed their relationships with Poyang Lake floods. The results show that the floods in Poyang Lake mainly occurred in mid-and late July. The inter-annual variation of highest flood stages and duration showed a long-term increasing linear trend. Also, a slightly increasing linear trend in the timing of highest stages indicated the floods have occurred later and later during the last 60 years. At the decadal scale, the flood situations were most severe in 1990s while gentle in 2000s in terms of the occurrence frequency and average duration. The climate change was the primary influence factor for changing of flood characteristics in Poyang Lake; i.e., the abnormally large rainfall during the flood season and subsequent large discharges of Yangtze River and runoff inflow from the basin were mainly responsible for the severe floods in 1990s. Also, the smallest storage capacity of Poyang Lake in 1990s due to the intensive human activities such as the great floodplain occupancy and levee construction further increased the severity of floods. While the rare floods in 2000s can be attributed to, on the one hand, the decrease in rainfall over the middle reaches of Yangtze River which caused the low streamflows of Yangtze River and runoff inflow from the Poyang Lake basin. On the other hand, the "return land to lake" policy, intensive sand mining in the lake and the flood control of Three Gorges Dam also played an important role in mitigation of flood frequency and severity.					; Xu, Chong-Yu/B-2941-2012; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Li, Xianghu/0000-0001-9934-1822; Xu, Chong-Yu/0000-0003-4826-5350; 													0921-030X	1573-0840				MAR	2015	76	1					651	666		10.1007/s11069-014-1509-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-014-1509-5													WOS:000350326200034

The total phosphorus (TP) concentration is a vital water quality indicator in assessing surface water eutrophication. This paper predicts the spatial distribution of TP concentration using remote sensing, measured data, and the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method. Based on the correlation analysis, the models were built and tested using the TP concentration and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image spectra. The results demonstrated that the best technique based on band combinations of the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images achieved good precision. The coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), and residual prediction deviation (RPD) were 0.771, 0.023 mg/L, and 2.086 for Sentinel-2 images and 0.630, 0.032 mg/L, and 1.644 for Landsat-8 images, respectively. The TP concentration maps were interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method, and the inversion results obtained from the images were in good agreement. The western and northwestern regions of Taihu Lake, where significant cyanobacterial blooms occurred, had TP concentrations greater than 0.20 mg/L; nevertheless, the central and eastern regions had amounts ranging from 0.05 to 0.20 mg/L. In order to prove the extensibility of the model, the optimal algorithm was applied to the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images in 2017. The optimal algorithm based on Landsat-8 images has a better verification effect (RMSEP = 0.027 mg/L, and R = 0.879 for one Landsat-8 image), and the optimal algorithm based on Sentinel-2 images has moderate verification effect (RMSEP = 0.054 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L, and R = 0.771 and 0.787 for two Sentinel-2 images). The interpolation and inversion maps are in good agreement, indicating that the model is suitable for the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images, which can be complementary for higher temporal resolutions. Monitoring water quality using multiple remote sensing images can provide the scientific basis for water quality dynamic monitoring and prevention in China.

Nonetheless, there is limited knowledge on their abundance in lakes in rural areas. In this study, we surveyed 14 headwater lakes in Muskoka-Haliburton, Ontario, to assess the spatial and temporal variability of microplastics. The average microplastic concentration across the study lakes was 1.78 mp/L during May-June 2019, with limited spatial variability (coefficient of variation = 22%). Further, microplastic abundance was weakly correlated with lake area (rs: 0.469), the number of shoreline residences (rs: 0.399), and watershed area (rs: 0.350), suggesting that diffusive inputs, such as atmospheric deposition, were the dominant source of microplastics to the study lakes. In contrast, microplastics showed a distinct temporal (seasonal) variability, as the average concentration in August 2019 (0.91 mp/L) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared with May and June 2019. While microplastic abundance was generally higher in the metalimnion (0.70 mp/L) and epilimnion (0.67 mp/L), there was no significant difference by stratified layer. The annual percent removal of microplastics in lake sediment was estimated to be 14%, suggesting that for most of the study lakes, sediment burial was not a dominant sink for microplastics. Effective management of microplastic pollution requires an understanding of the nexus between microplastics in the atmosphere, lake water, and sediment. In rural areas, microplastic abundance appears to be dominated by atmospheric inputs, suggesting limited need for spatial monitoring. Temporal monitoring, however, is required to understand seasonal changes and long-term trends in microplastic abundance and delivery.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2022	81	24							551	10.1007/s12665-022-10670-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10670-9													WOS:000898456900001
J	Ozguven, A; Yetis, AD				Ozguven, Ayse; Yetis, Aysegul Demir			"Assessment of Spatiotemporal Water Quality Variations, Impact Analysis and Trophic Status of Big Soda Lake Van, Turkey	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The study was conducted in order to assess the spatiotemporal variations of selected water quality parameters, impact analysis, and trophic status on the Edremit shores of Lake Van. Water samples were collected from 10 representative sampling stations taken from the influent, effluent, and from Lake Van itself in order to analyze the physicochemical parameters in both dry and wet seasons. The trophic status of the lake was determined using Carlson trophic state index. Impact analysis was conducted based on the method most commonly used in management strategies related to surface waters in Turkey. The results of the study show that five factors obtained from principal component indicated that the parameters responsible for water quality changes were mostly related to salts and soda, physicochemical parameters, point and diffuse pollutions discharge, and other organic pollutants. In the impact analysis pH, COD (chemical oxygen demand), BOD (biological oxygen demand), and TP (total phosphorus) (except for EC (electrical conductivity)) parameters were found to have medium impact, while DO (dissolved oxygen) and TN (total nitrogen) parameters had no impact. The pH, EC, SO4-2, Cl-, TP, COD, and BOD values measured at 10 sampling stations were considered to be Class IV according to national regulations. The final trophic status of lake, according to the Carlson trophic index, was assessed to be eutrophic. Understanding this variation is important so as to develop new ways to resolve issues of sustainable water management.

Early Miocene climate and biomes of Turkey: Evidence from leaf fossils, dispersed pollen, and petrified wood	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The early Miocene was a period of major palaeogeographic reorganization in the eastern Mediterranean region, during which time the Anatolian Plateau became subaerial and several intracontinental basins intermittently became connected to the Paratethys and Mediterranean seas. In this paper, we analyse early Miocene vegetation and climate using leaf records, palynological assemblages, and fossil wood at 36 localities from western and central Turkey, most of which have precise age control based on radiometric dating and mammal faunal ages. Using the leaf flora of Giivem (Bes Konak, Kesekoy), Climate Leaf-Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) analyses and Koppen signatures were employed to infer a palaeoclimate typical of modern laurel forest regions. Based on the palynological records, abundance of various pollen-taxa was used as a measure of openness of vegetation and regional presence of major tree taxa. Most pollen floras are dominated by tree pollen (ranging from 85 to 98%) and indicated widespread afforestation. In the pollen diagrams, shifts in dominance from swamp forest elements (Taxodioideae) to well-drained forests (Pinaceae) indicate changes in lake levels or phases of basin development. Such shifts may have been associated with the development of more xeric forest vegetation. Wood anatomical features such as false tree rings further may indicate seasonal climate. Pollen diagrams and macrofossils reflect zonal and azonal broadleaf and needleleaf forest and extrazonal open vegetation. The latter occurred in areas with shallow soils on volcanic rocks or limestone (e.g. cycads, Dracaena), or coastal areas (herb dominance). Taxonomic composition and biogeographic affinities suggest laurel forest as a major forest biome on well-drained soils and ecotones between laurel forest and broadleaf deciduous forest biomes. A comparison with younger floras shows that these are neither more diverse nor more warmth-loving despite an increase in global temperature (Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum) suggesting bottlenecks during previous (Oligocene) cooler times for warmth-loving taxa.					; Guner, Huseyin Tuncay/D-3152-2019; Güner, Hüseyin/D-3152-2019; Bouchal, Johannes/Y-7833-2019	Bouchal, Johannes Martin/0000-0002-4241-9075; Guner, Huseyin Tuncay/0000-0001-9742-1319; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				SEP 15	2019	530						236	248		10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.05.042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.05.042													WOS:000478712100017
J	Gleason, CJ; Wada, Y; Wang, JD				Gleason, Colin J.; Wada, Yoshihide; Wang, Jida			A Hybrid of Optical Remote Sensing and Hydrological Modeling Improves Water Balance Estimation	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												Declining gauging infrastructure and fractious water politics have decreased available information about river flows globally. Remote sensing and water balance modeling are frequently cited as potential solutions, but these techniques largely rely on these same in-decline gauge data to make accurate discharge estimates. A different approach is therefore needed, and we here combine remotely sensed discharge estimates made via at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) and the PCR-GLOBWB hydrological model to estimate discharge over the Lower Nile. Specifically, we first estimate initial discharges from 87 Landsat images and AMHG (1984-2015), and then use these flow estimates to tune the model, all without using gauge data. The resulting tuned modeled hydrograph shows a large improvement in flow magnitude: validation of the tuned monthly hydrograph against a historical gauge (1978-1984) yields an RMSE of 439 m(3)/s (40.8%). By contrast, the original simulation had an order-of-magnitude flow error. This improvement is substantial but not perfect: tuned flows have a 1-2 month wet season lag and a negative base flow bias. Accounting for this 2 month lag yields a hydrograph RMSE of 270 m(3)/s (25.7%). Thus, our results coupling physical models and remote sensing is a promising first step and proof of concept toward future modeling of ungauged flows, especially as developments in cloud computing for remote sensing make our method easily applicable to any basin. Finally, we purposefully do not offer prescriptive solutions for Nile management, and rather hope that the methods demonstrated herein can prove useful to river stakeholders in managing their own water.

Monitoring, modeling, and better understanding their hydrological behavior is, therefore, a key issue. The future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will bring a resolution and spatial coverage breakthrough, allowing the estimation of water levels and volumes in small water bodies worldwide. This paper assesses the potential of SWOT for monitoring water volumes in Sahelian ponds and lakes. This is done by analyzing SWOT-like synthetic data produced using a SWOT simulator developed by NASA-JPL. For the Agoufou lake, water levels were retrieved with an accuracy better than 4 cm, while slightly worse results were obtained for the Zalam-Zalam lake, that has a more elongated shape. In addition, data from the global precipitation mission dual-frequency precipitation radar have been also employed to investigate the backscattering coefficient variability in the same radar frequency band (Ka-band) as SWOT. We have found that, in the study region, the contrast between water and land, dependent on soil type, soil moisture, and wind conditions, is sometime quite small which can be challenging for water masks estimation. Overall, the first application of the SWOT simulator over the Sahel has shown the good potential of SWOT for monitoring the seasonal variability of water levels and volumes in this region.

Many concerns have concentrated on its water quality, which affects the local water security and sustainable economic development. In this study, the water pollution index (WPI), an effective water quality evaluation method, was used to compare the pollution levels among pollution indicators and to determine the major pollution indicators. The regime shift index (RSI) approach was employed to identify the water quality trends. Cluster analysis and Daniel trend test methods were employed to analyse the inner-annual and inter-annual spatio-temporal trends of the typical water quality indicators (e.g., total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved oxygen (DO), and chemical oxygen demand (COD)) in Lake Ulansuhai. The results show that the water quality of Ulansuhai improved from 1998 to 2017; spatial variations in the WPITN, WPITP, and WPIDO followed the order of inlet > centre and outlet, while spatial variations in the WPICOD showed the order of outlet > inlet > centre. TN was the critical pollution indicator throughout the year. In 2017, the dry season and wet season were determined using cluster analysis. The WPICOD was higher than the WPITN, WPITP, and WPIDO in the dry season, while the WPITN, WPITP, and WPIDO were higher than the WPICOD in the wet season. WPI was grouped into three clusters: highly polluted regions, moderately polluted regions, and less polluted regions, However, there is a discrepancy between the three polluted regions that were divided into the dry season and the wet season. The WPICOD was highest among all pollution indicators in 2017. Major sources of pollution that contribute to the deterioration of water quality include inner-annual or inter-annual pollution, agricultural non-point pollution, point source pollution, and internal pollution. This study provides useful information for authorities to effectively manage water quality and control water pollution.					; Xue, Hao/GXV-4717-2022	Zhang, Zhuangzhuang/0009-0004-7115-0708; 														2073-4441				JUL	2019	11	7							1410	10.3390/w11071410	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11071410													WOS:000480632300095

This study integrates existing observation dataset of CO2 flux (fCO(2)) in rivers, lakes and reservoirs in China, to elucidate their spatial-temporal patterns and key influencing factors and to reappraise the significance for regional carbon balance. It showed that, the fCO(2) in rivers, lakes and reservoirs in China presented significant variability with large range of -379.3-4947.6, -160.1-785.0 and -74.0-1603.1 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The median of the fCO(2) in rivers was of 228.5 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), observably higher than these in lakes and reservoirs (26.0 and 28.3 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The fCO(2) in rivers and reservoirs exhibited similar decreasing trend from south to north as a result of universal climate restraint, the averaged fCO(2) in Pearl River and Yangtze River basins showed much higher than that in Northeastern rivers. While, the averaged fCO(2) in the Mongolia-Xinjiang lake district and the Northeast lake district were higher than other lake districts, followed by the Qinghai-Xizang lake district, and the Eastern and Yungui lake district were generally low, contradicting the climatic restriction. The water primary production enhancement resulting from human activities was the main driver of spatial variation in the fCO(2) in lakes. Meanwhile, the fCO(2) in rivers presented seasonal pattern with higher wet season than dry season, while opposite patterns were found in lakes and reservoirs. Seasonal temperature, precipitation and water primary production were main factors. Furthermore, it showed pH was a key factor indicating the variability of the fCO(2) levels either in rivers, lakes or in reservoirs. In lakes, the fCO(2) is closely linked to chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and dissolved oxygen (DO), whereas, the fCO(2) in rivers is primarily associated with organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN), highlighting the diverse controlling mechanisms of fCO(2) in various inland water types. In addition, we found that water body sizes play an important role in regulating the fCO(2) levels, and small waters act as hotspots of CO2 flux. Additionally, widespread urbanization and agricultural activities may enhance CO2 emissions from rivers but potentially mitigating that from lakes. Nevertheless, the comprehensive impact of these factors on CO2 emissions in inland water requires further evaluation. Based on the extrapolation method, we re-estimated that the total CO2 emission of inland waters in China is approximately 117.3 Tg yr(-1), which could offset 4.6%-12.8% of the total land carbon sink in China.

J	Chen, S; Wang, SM; Yu, YX; Dong, MJ; Li, YQ				Chen, Shuai; Wang, Simeng; Yu, Yanxi; Dong, Mingjun; Li, Yanqiang			Temporal trends and source apportionment of water pollution in Honghu Lake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Honghu Lake, the largest shallow lake in Jianghan Plain of China, is essential for maintaining ecosystem functioning in this region. However, water pollution and high disturbance are seriously threatening the ecological security of this lake. To explore the causes of water quality fluctuations in Honghu Lake, the water quality index method (CCME-WQI), multivariate statistical, and source apportionment techniques were adopted to characterize temporal trends in lake water quality (2004-2017), identify the main driving factors of water quality indicators, and quantify the contribution of various pollution sources. Besides, the water periods of the lake have been reclassified due to the seasonal variation of rainfall in the study area. The results of CCME-WQI showed that the water quality in Honghu Lake initially improved over 2004-2011, with better water quality in the wet period than in the dry periods, while the results over 2012-2017 were found to be opposite. Correlation analysis identified untreated industrial wastewater (UIW) as the main pollution source affecting CODMn concentrations in Honghu Lake, while untreated domestic sewage discharge (UDS) was identified as the main pollution source affecting BOD and F. coli concentrations. The main pollution sources affecting nutrient indicators were rainfall and enclosure aquaculture (EA). Principal component analysis (PCA) combined with absolute principal component score-multiple linear regression model (APCS-MLR) further appointed the source contribution of each pollution source to water quality indicators. The results showed that EA in 2012 was reduced by 81% compared with 2004, resulting in the contribution of EA to NH3-N, TP, and TN decreased by 0.2 mg L-1, 0.039 mg L-1, and 0.37 mg L-1, respectively. Compared with 2012, UIW was reduced by 65% in 2016, resulting in the contribution of UIW to CODMn decreased by 1.17 mg L-1. In addition, compared with 2004, UDS decreased by 85% in 2016, and the contribution of UDS to BOD and F. coli decreased by 0.7 mg L-1 and 887 cfu L-1, respectively. Based on the results of APCS-MLR, it was predicted that the concentrations of COD and TP in Honghu Lake would meet the water quality requirements after 2017. However, the rainfall non-point source pollution must be further controlled to achieve the desired level of TN concentration. This study provided an accurate method for analyzing lake water pollution, and the results can provide a valuable reference for optimizing water quality management and pollution control strategies within Honghu Lake.

We identified 43 genera of phytoplankton from 7 phyla in Juehe Wetland Park and 45 genera of phytoplankton from 7 phyla in Xiaoxihu Lake. Phytoplankton communities in the two waterbodies showed significant patterns of seasonal succession. Cyanophyta (Microcystisspp.) dominated in August-September 2017 in Juehe Wetland Park, and Bacillariophyta (Naviculaspp.) dominated in October 2017-July 2018. Cyanophyta (Microcystisspp.) dominated in Xiaoxihu Lake in August-November 2017, and Bacillariophyta (Synedraspp.) dominated in December 2017-July 2018. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the temperature and total phosphorus were closely related to the seasonal succession of Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta.

The extent of such effects for representative concentration pathways (RCP) climate scenarios is unknown. We evaluated projected changes in rainfall and evapotranspiration and related impacts on water availability in the UBN under the RCP4.5 scenario. We used dynamically downscaled outputs from six global circulation models (GCMs) with unprecedented spatial resolution for the UBN. Systematic errors of these outputs were corrected and followed by runoff modelling by the HBV (Hydrologiska ByransVattenbalansavdelning) model, which was successfully validated for 17 catchments. Results show that the UBN annual rainfall amount will change by -2.8 to 2.7% with a likely increase in annual potential evapotranspiration (in 2041-2070) for the RCP4.5 scenario. These changes are season dependent and will result in a likely decline in streamflow and an increase in soil moisture deficit in the basin.																			0262-6667	2150-3435					2017	62	13					2139	2149		10.1080/02626667.2017.1365149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2017.1365149													WOS:000416844300006

Modeling of subglacial hydrological development following rapid supraglacial lake drainage	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes injects substantial volumes of water to the bed of the Greenland ice sheet over short timescales. The effect of these water pulses on the development of basal hydrological systems is largely unknown. To address this, we develop a lake drainage model incorporating both (1) a subglacial radial flux element driven by elastic hydraulic jacking and (2) downstream drainage through a linked channelized and distributed system. Here we present the model and examine whether substantial, efficient subglacial channels can form during or following lake drainage events and their effect on the water pressure in the surrounding distributed system. We force the model with field data from a lake drainage site, 70 km from the terminus of Russell Glacier in West Greenland. The model outputs suggest that efficient subglacial channels do not readily form in the vicinity of the lake during rapid drainage and instead water is evacuated primarily by a transient turbulent sheet and the distributed system. Following lake drainage, channels grow but are not large enough to reduce the water pressure in the surrounding distributed system, unless preexisting channels are present throughout the domain. Our results have implications for the analysis of subglacial hydrological systems in regions where rapid lake drainage provides the primary mechanism for surface-to-bed connections.					; Rutt, Ian/A-6307-2012; Tsai, Victor/J-8405-2012; Hubbard, Alun/R-5085-2017	Jones, Glenn/0000-0002-7691-332X; Lindback, Katrin/0000-0002-5941-6743; Pimentel, Sam/0000-0001-7753-1748; Tsai, Victor/0000-0003-1809-6672; Doyle, Samuel/0000-0002-0853-431X; Kulessa, Bernd/0000-0002-4830-4949; van As, Dirk/0000-0002-6553-8982; Hubbard, Alun/0000-0002-0503-3915; Dow, Christine/0000-0003-1346-2258													2169-9003	2169-9011				JUN	2015	120	6					1127	1147		10.1002/2014JF003333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JF003333								26640746					WOS:000357994400010

We address seasonal changes of microbial communities and DOM in the largest Croatian lake, Vrana. This shallow lake is connected to the Adriatic Sea and is impacted by agricultural activity. Microbial community and DOM structure were driven by several environmental stressors, including drought, seawater intrusion and heavy precipitation events. Bacterial composition of different lifestyles (free-living and particle-associated) differed and only a part of the particle-associated bacteria correlated with microbial eukaryotes. Oscillations of cyanobacterial relative abundance along with chlorophyll a revealed a high primary production season characterized by increased levels of autochthonous DOM that promoted bacterial processes of organic matter degradation. From our results, we infer that in coastal freshwater lakes dependent on precipitation-evaporation balance, prolonged dry season coupled with heavy irrigation impact microbial communities at different trophic levels even if salinity increases only slightly and allochthonous DOM inputs decrease. These pressures, if applied more frequently or at higher concentrations, could have the potential to overturn the trophic state of the lake.

It was calibrated using observed temperature profiles near the dam and the outflow temperatures. Observed daily temperatures at four gauging stations upstream or downstream of XLDR before (2000-2012) and after the impoundment (4 May 2013) were analyzed and fitted with a sine function representing seasonal temperature variation. The fitted annual temperature phase shifts showed no phase delay in XLDR area before the impoundment but revealed a phase delay about 17 days between outflow and inflow after the impoundment, which was not caused by the air temperature variation. The simulated temperatures verified a similar phase delay after the impoundment. The simulated temperatures, water ages, and vertical temperature gradients demonstrated an average metalimnetic deepening rate of 0.49 m/day (average inflow similar to 4500 m(3)/s) while the largest rate due to massive inflow (similar to 15,000 m(3)/s) was 1.67 m/day. The W2 model was run under hypothetic scenarios of different inflow/outflow rates and outflow withdrawn elevations. The results revealed that greater inflow/outflow rate could lead to higher metalimnetic deepening rate and smaller outflow phase delay, while deeper outflow withdrawn could lead to deeper metalimnion and larger epilimnetic depth.

Comparison of co-located ice-core and tree-ring mercury records indicates potential radial translocation of mercury in whitebark pine	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Tree-ring records are a potential archive for reconstructing long-term historical trends in atmospheric mercury (Hg) concentrations. Although Hg preserved in tree rings has been shown to be derived largely from the atmosphere, quantitative relationships linking atmospheric concentrations to those in tree rings are limited. In addition, few tree-ring-based Hg records have been evaluated against co-located proxies of atmospheric Hg deposition or direct atmospheric measurements. Here we develop long-term Hg records extending from 1800 to 2018 CE using cores collected from two stands of whitebark pine located near the Upper Fremont Glacier in the Wind River Range, Wyoming, where a long-term record of atmospheric Hg deposition previously was developed from an ice core. The tree ring record showed that Hg concentrations increased beginning in 1800 CE to a broad peak centered at -1960 CE, before decreasing to present, generally paralleling the ice-core record of Hg deposition.The exact timing and magnitude of the Hg increases in the trees, however, is offset earlier relative to the ice-core record. These discrepancies potentially arise from biotic processes that impact Hg uptake and preservation in whitebark pine, and results from an advection-diffusion model indicate that the temporal differences are consistent with radial movement of Hg within the trees. The forms of atmospheric Hg and seasonality may also impact the Hg record preserved by each archive, but are less likely to affect long-term trends. Further work is needed to assess radial Hg translocation in more controlled studies with larger sample sizes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This work characterizes the hydrological conditions of tropical alpine glacial lakes located in the highlands of Chirripo, Costa Rica, using a unique data set of water stable isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in precipitation, stream water, and lake water between September 2015 and July 2017. A combined dataset of bathymetric, hydrometric, and isotope data collected between July 2016 and July 2017 on Lake Ditkevi was used to calculate the annual water balance of the lake. Evaporation to inflow ratios from three lake systems was estimated using a linear resistance model, the experimentally estimated local evaporation line of Chirripo, and the first glacial lake water evaporation lines in the region. The temporal isotopic variations (delta O-18, d-excess, and lc-excess) confirm variations in the dry and wet season evaporative conditions for the glacial lakes and consistently average annual low evaporation to inflow (E/I) ratios in the range of 2.0 +/- 0.8% and 18.1 +/- 12.2%. Lake Ditkevi's water balance indicates annual steady-state conditions, with an estimated evaporation loss of 650 mm/year (10.0 +/- 5.0% of inflow), a high-water contribution to the catchment (90% of inflow), a residence time of 0.53 +/- 0.27 years, and a catchment scale (0.289 km(2)) water yield or depth equivalent run-off of 278 mm/yr. These results provide novel information about water balance and evaporation losses in tropical alpine glacial lakes, which can serve as baseline information for future isotope-based hydro-climate research in high-elevation regions in the tropics and elsewhere.

GRACE water storage estimates for the Middle East and other regions with significant reservoir and lake storage	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												While GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites are increasingly being used to monitor total water storage (TWS) changes globally, the impact of spatial distribution of water storage within a basin is generally ignored but may be substantial. In many basins, water is often stored in reservoirs or lakes, flooded areas, small aquifer systems, and other localized regions with areas typically below GRACE resolution (similar to 200 000 km(2)). The objective of this study was to assess the impact of nonuniform water storage distribution on GRACE estimates of TWS changes as basin-wide averages, focusing on surface water reservoirs and using a priori information on reservoir storage from radar altimetry. Analysis included numerical experiments testing effects of location and areal extent of the localized mass (reservoirs) within a basin on basin-wide average water storage changes, and application to the lower Nile (Lake Nasser) and Tigris-Euphrates basins as examples. Numerical experiments show that by assuming uniform mass distribution, GRACE estimates may under-or overestimate basin-wide average water storage by up to a factor of similar to 2, depending on reservoir location and areal extent. Although reservoirs generally cover less than 1% of the basin area, and their spatial extent may be unresolved by GRACE, reservoir storage may dominate water storage changes in some basins. For example, reservoir storage accounts for similar to 95% of seasonal water storage changes in the lower Nile and 10% in the Tigris-Euphrates. Because reservoirs are used to mitigate droughts and buffer against climate extremes, their influence on interannual timescales can be large. For example, TWS decline during the 2007-2009 drought in the Tigris-Euphrates basin measured by GRACE was similar to 93 km(3). Actual reservoir storage from satellite altimetry was limited to 27 km(3), but their apparent impact on GRACE reached 45 km(3), i.e., 50% of GRACE trend. Therefore, the actual impact of reservoirs would have been greatly underestimated (27 km(3)) if reservoir storage changes were assumed uniform in the basin. Consequently, estimated groundwater contribution from GRACE would have been largely overestimated in this region if the actual distribution of water was not explicitly taken into account. Effects of point masses on GRACE estimates are not easily accounted for via simple multiplicative scaling, but in many cases independent information may be available to improve estimates. Accurate estimation of the reservoir contribution is critical, especially when separating estimating groundwater storage changes from GRACE total water storage (TWS) changes. Because the influence of spatially concentrated water storage - and more generally water distribution - is significant, GRACE estimates will be improved by combining independent water mass spatial distribution information with GRACE observations, even when reservoir storage is not the dominant mechanism. In this regard, data from the upcoming Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission should be an especially important companion to GRACE-FO (Follow-On) observations.

Publicly available DEMs derived from sub-meter satellite stereo imagery were, up to now, mainly available in the polar regions and High Mountain Asia. Here, we present the Pl & eacute;iades Glacier Observatory (PGO), a scientific program acquiring Pl & eacute;iades 0.7 m satellite stereo pairs for 140 sites from Earth's glacierized areas. The PGO product consists of freely available DEMs at 2 and 20 m ground sampling distance together with 0.5 m (panchromatic) and 2 m (multispectral) ortho-images. PGO stereo acquisitions began in July 2016 in the Northern Hemisphere and February 2017 in the Southern Hemisphere. Each site is revisited every 5 years (cloud permitting), close to the end of the melt season, to measure glacier elevation change with an average uncertainty of 0.49 m (95 % confidence level, for a glacierized area of 1 km2), i.e., 0.1 myr-1. PGO samples over 20 000 km2 of glacierized terrain, which represents about 3 % of the Earth's glacier area. This small sample, however, provides a first-order estimate (within 0.07 mw.e.yr-1) of the global glacier mass change and its decadal evolution.					; Berthier, Etienne/B-8900-2009	Menounos, Brian/0000-0002-3370-4392; Berthier, Etienne/0000-0001-5978-9155; Andreassen, Liss Marie/0000-0001-6494-4252													1994-0416	1994-0424				NOV 29	2024	18	12					5551	5571		10.5194/tc-18-5551-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-5551-2024													WOS:001366412100001
J	Waraniak, JM; Marsh, TL; Scribner, KT				Waraniak, Justin M.; Marsh, Terence L.; Scribner, Kim T.			18S rRNA metabarcoding diet analysis of a predatory fish community across seasonal changes in prey availability	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Predator-prey relationships are important ecological interactions, affecting biotic community composition and energy flow through a system, and are of interest to ecologists and managers. Morphological diet analysis has been the primary method used to quantify the diets of predators, but emerging molecular techniques using genetic data can provide more accurate estimates of relative diet composition. This study used sequences from the 18S V9 rRNA barcoding region to identify prey items in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of predatory fishes. Predator GI samples were taken from the Black River, Cheboygan Co., MI, USA (n=367 samples, 12 predator species) during periods of high prey availability, including the larval stage of regionally threatened lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque 1817) in late May/early June of 2015 and of relatively lower prey availability in early July of 2015. DNA was extracted and sequenced from 355 samples (96.7%), and prey DNA was identified in 286 of the 355 samples (80.6%). Prey were grouped into 33 ecologically significant taxonomic groups based on the lowest taxonomic level sequences that could be identified using sequences available on GenBank. Changes in the makeup of diet composition, dietary overlap, and predator preference were analyzed comparing the periods of high and low prey abundance. Some predator species exhibited significant seasonal changes in diet composition. Dietary overlap was slightly but significantly higher during the period of high prey abundance; however, there was little change in predator preference. This suggests that change in prey availability was the driving factor in changing predator diet composition and dietary overlap. This study demonstrates the utility of molecular diet analysis and how temporal variability in community composition adds complexity to predator-prey interactions.

The East African state of Uganda relies heavily on tourism as a GDP contributor and large carnivores are important for generating visitor revenue in its national parks. African leopards, spotted hyenas and African lions are three species that draw significant tourist attention but also cause damage to the livestock of human communities living on Ugandan national park edges. A private safari lodge in the Lake Mburo National Park has been using a financial compensation scheme in an attempt to stem conflict between these species and human communities living in the region since 2009. Financial compensations have produced mixed results with some studies reporting successes in reducing carnivore deaths, while others warn against their use, citing moral hazard, financial unsustainability and weakened protection of livestock by farmers. We sought to assess the characteristics of this compensation scheme and the patterns of conflict between Bahima pastoralist communities and carnivores that the scheme aims to mitigate. Using a dataset of 1,102 leopard and hyena depredation events (January 2009-December 2018) we found that spotted hyenas were responsible for the overwhelming majority of livestock depredation (69%) around Lake Mburo. Depredations occurred mostly at night (97% and 89% of all depredation for spotted hyenas and leopards respectively) and inside livestock protective pens (bomas). Depredation was more likely to occur in rugged areas, closer to human settlements, and the national park border, and further away from water. We could find no evidence of seasonality in depredation events. Our most important, albeit worrying result was that conflict had increased dramatically over time and the number of depredation claims had tripled in the period from 2014-2018 when compared to 2009-2013, risking financial unsustainability of the scheme. Our results are important for future conservation stakeholders attempting to implement financial compensation in the broader Ugandan landscape. They suggest that careful thought needs to be placed into fund sustainability, increasing claims over time and the development of clear rules that underpin compensation claims.

Lead pollution varied by season in the two different ecotype sediments. In the algae- dominated zone, the highest concentrations of DGT-labile Pb and dissolved Pb occurred in April and July, respectively. The reductive dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides was identified as an important driver for Pb releases in April and July. This was supported by the decrease of the reducible fraction of Pb in sediments during those sampling periods. Furthermore, dissolved organic matter (DOM) complexation with Pb in sediments also significantly increased the dissolved Pb concentrations in July. The Pb-DOM complexes accounted for 95% of the total chemical species of Pb in pore water, calculated by Visual MINTEQ 3.1 model. Low concentrations of labile and dissolved Pb were observed in October and January; these resulted from the formation of Pb-sulfide precipitates and adsorption by Fe/Mn oxides. It was supported by the high rate of Pb(HS)(2) precipitation (saturation index > 0), at 36%, in October samples and the high reducible fraction of Pb in sediments in January samples. In the macrophytes-dominated region, there was a decrease of labile and dissolved Pb concentrations in April and July. It is likely because of the uptake of Pb by submerged macrophyte roots and the Fe/Mn plaques in the root surface. High concentrations of labile and dissolved Pb were observed in October and January, likely resulting from the DOM complexation with Pb in sediments. This was supported by the fact that the Pb-DOM complexes accounted for 90% and 87% of the total chemical species of Pb in October and January, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Physico-chemical parameters, monitored in this study by a high-resolution in-situ multi-sensor system and derived from lab-based water sample analyses, show the seasonal variation and have different degrees of vertical gradients across the water column. Through analyzing the changes and relations between multi-factors, we reveal pictures of water quality dynamics and algal kinetics. Nitrate has regular seasonal changes different to the seasonal patterns of total dissolved Phosphorus. Positive correlations are found between Chlorophyll a fluorescence and temperature, wind-induced resuspension and mixing promote the augment of Cyanobacteria fluorescence (Phycocyanin) signal. While the resuspension can also result in the increase of turbidity and affect the light environment for hydrophytes, the algal scums are the main reason for the high turbidity on the surface, which lower the illumination radiation in the water body. Those parameters are the primary dominants responsible for the change of algae from our monitoring data, which could be used as indicators for the dynamic changes of algae in the future.

Located downwind during the monsoon season from the rapidly developing South Asia, the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau are expected to receive direct anthropogenic Hg and Pb loadings, yet the source, pathway, and effects of such transport remain poorly known due to logistic challenges in accessing this region. When studying the sediment record from Lake Gokyo (4750 m above sea level (a.s.l.)) in the Himalayas, we find remarkably different Hg and Pb accumulation trends over the past 260 years. Although Hg accumulation has continued to increase since the Industrial Revolution, Pb accumulation peaked during that time and has been decreasing since then. Stable isotope analysis reveals that the decoupling trends between these two elements are due to different sources and pathways of Hg and Pb in the region. Both delta Hg-202 and Delta Hg-199 have been increasing since the Industrial Revolution, suggesting that anthropogenic Hg emissions from South Asia have been continuously increasing and that the Indian monsoon-driven wet deposition of atmospheric Hg is the dominant pathway for Hg accumulation in the sediments. In contrast, analysis of Pb-206/Pb-207 and (208)pb/Pb-207 ratios suggests that Pb accumulation in the sediments originates primarily from natural sources and that the decreasing trend of Pb accumulation is most likely due to a weakening input of atmospheric mineral dust by the westerlies. These decoupling trends highlight the ongoing issue of transboundary Hg transport to the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau that are source waters for major freshwater systems in Asia and calls for regional and international collaborations on Hg emission controls in South Asia.					junming, guo/JZC-7672-2024; Ram, Kirpa/G-9642-2011; Guo, Junming/JZC-7672-2024; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018; Huang, Jie/GWQ-5005-2022; Tripathee, Lekhendra/T-4350-2019; Wang, Feiyue/E-4147-2012; Yin, Runsheng/H-7687-2012; Lin, Mang/C-1451-2013; Sharma, Chhatra/A-6168-2009	Guo, Junming/0000-0002-3133-5597; Yin, Runsheng/0000-0001-9631-5303; Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; huang, jie/0000-0002-3060-0862; Sharma, Chhatra/0000-0003-0714-7411; Lin, Mang/0000-0001-8904-7697													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 5	2020	54	9					5429	5436		10.1021/acs.est.0c00429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c00429								32242420					WOS:000530651900018

A lack of information on factors, such as evaporative water loss, has an impact on the design and management of these reservoirs, as well as on regional water safety. Acquiring this information is crucial for hydrologists to develop more effective water resource management strategies and policies. This study assesses the performance of a diverse number of methods that are used to estimate evaporation and provides evaporation probability curves on a fortnightly period for small reservoirs in the Brazilian savannah region. Evaporation data were collected for a small water reservoir located in the Buriti Vermelho watershed, a typical dam of the Brazilian savannah region. Among the assessed methods, those of Kohler et al. (1955) and Linacre (1993) presented the best performances on both the daily and monthly scales for evaporation estimates. By simulating the evaporation rates for a timeseries, an increasing trend in evaporation was observed for the transition between the dry and wet seasons, jeopardizing double cropping in the region. The developed probability curves are an important tool for improving water resource planning and increasing the local water availability.

Plenty of habitat models for fish, vegetation, and invertebrates have been developed and widely used; however, there is a lack of effective models to assess the effects of water resource projects on waterbird habitat in wetlands. This study developed a habitat model by integrating two-dimensional hydrodynamic, multicriteria evaluation Cellular Automata-Markov and habitat suitability modules (HMH) to evaluate the effects of hydraulic structures on the habitat of waterbirds in wetlands. The developed HMH model was applied to the Duchang Provincial Nature Reserve (DPNR) of Poyang Lake in China, which is an important conservation wetland in the Ramsar Convention. For demonstration, the HMH model analyzed the habitat suitability for Grus leucogeranus, a rare species in the region, with a scheduled sluice under two different regulating rules (named Rule 1 and Rule 2), and compared it to the habitat suitability without the sluice. Results showed that the sluice operations would increase the water body during dry seasons, and thus increase the area of shallow water, a preferential habitat to Grus leucogeranus. The sluice operation in Rule 1 would either change the location or remarkably reduced the area of suitable habitat in the northern DPNR. The sluice operation in Rule 2 would either slightly increase the area or change the location of suitable habitats in the northern DPNR. The study demonstrated that the developed method for habitat suitability assessment could provide a viable approach for eco-hydrological management of wetlands.

Anoxygenic photosynthesis and iron-sulfur metabolic potential ofChlorobiapopulations from seasonally anoxic Boreal Shield lakes	ISME JOURNAL												Aquatic environments with high levels of dissolved ferrous iron and low levels of sulfate serve as an important systems for exploring biogeochemical processes relevant to the early Earth. Boreal Shield lakes, which number in the tens of millions globally, commonly develop seasonally anoxic waters that become iron rich and sulfate poor, yet the iron-sulfur microbiology of these systems has been poorly examined. Here we use genome-resolved metagenomics and enrichment cultivation to explore the metabolic diversity and ecology of anoxygenic photosynthesis and iron/sulfur cycling in the anoxic water columns of three Boreal Shield lakes. We recovered four high-completeness and low-contamination draft genome bins assigned to the classChlorobia(formerly phylumChlorobi) from environmental metagenome data and enriched two novel sulfide-oxidizing species, also from theChlorobia. The sequenced genomes of both enriched species, including the novel "CandidatusChlorobium canadense", encoded thecyc2gene that is associated with photoferrotrophy among culturedChlorobiamembers, along with genes for phototrophic sulfide oxidation. One environmental genome bin also encodedcyc2. Despite the presence ofcyc2in the corresponding draft genome, we were unable to induce photoferrotrophy in "Ca. Chlorobium canadense".

Overall, our results provide an important basis for further probing the functional role ofcyc2and indicate that anoxygenic photoautotrophs in Boreal Shield lakes could have underexplored photophysiology pertinent to understanding Earth's early microbial communities.

It is considered as an ephemeral lakeexperiencing dynamic seasonal transitions ranging from a lake surface to wetland conditions. The influence of the seasonal water level transition on lake-atmosphere energy exchange can have important consequences for local climate and water resource management. Here we study the dynamics of surface-atmosphere energy exchange and examine the hydrological and meteorological controls on its partitioning for the period August 2013 to July 2016. Change in the water depth (WD) directly impacts water surface contribution and the inundated duration. The latent heat (LE) and sensible heat (H) fluxes showed an unimodal diurnal pattern in the wetland-covered period and changed to an irregular pattern during the lake-covered period when water surface contribution exceeded a value of 62%. The Bowen ratio (H/LE) was large/small in the wetland-/lake-covered period and decreased significantly with increasing WD. On a diurnal and daily timescale, the LE and H showed less dependence on wind speed (U) and water vapor or temperature gradient and greater dependence on net radiation when transitioning from the lake-covered period to wetland-covered period, respectively. On a monthly timescale, both the LE and H were mainly controlled by the net radiation. However, the interannual variations in LE and H were significantly correlated with the inundated duration and WD over Poyang Lake. The decreasing trend in Poyang Lake level, therefore, has potential to reduce lake evaporation and local precipitation and further amplify regional hydrometeorological droughts.

Assessment of Suitable Areas for Home Gardens for Irrigation Potential, Water Availability, and Water-Lifting Technologies	WATER												The study was conducted in Lake Tana Basin of Ethiopia to assess potentially irrigable areas for home gardens, water availability, and feasibility of water-lifting technologies. A GIS-based Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) technique was applied to access the potential of surface and groundwater sources for irrigation. The factors affecting irrigation practice were identified and feasibility of water-lifting technologies was evaluated. Pairwise method and expert's opinion were used to assign weights for each factor. The result showed that about 345,000 ha and 135,000 ha of land were found suitable for irrigation from the surface and groundwater sources, respectively. The rivers could address about 1-1.2% of the irrigable land during dry season without water storage structure whereas groundwater could address about 2.2-2.4% of the irrigable land, both using conventional irrigation techniques. If the seven major dams within the basin were considered, surface water potential would be increased and satisfy about 21% of the irrigable land. If rainwater harvesting techniques were used, about 76% of the basin would be suitable for irrigation. The potential of surface and groundwater was evaluated with respect to water requirements of dominant crops in the region. On the other hand, rope pump and deep well piston hand pump were found with relatively the most (26%) and the least (9%) applicable low-cost water-lifting technologies in the basin.					; Worqlul, Abeyou/I-1788-2019; Srinivasan, R/D-3937-2009; Jha, Manoj/AAK-3750-2021; Srinivasan, Raghavan/D-3937-2009	wale worqlul, abeyou/0000-0002-7990-8446; Jha, Manoj/0000-0003-1156-2992; Srinivasan, Raghavan/0000-0001-8375-6038														2073-4441				APR	2018	10	4							495	10.3390/w10040495	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10040495													WOS:000434954900149

The evaluation and monitoring of water quality are therefore necessary for preventing potential human risk associated with the exposure to contaminated water. In this study, physicochemical and bacteriological parameters were assessed in an urban river (named Kokolo Canal/Jerusalem River) draining the municipality of Lingwala (City of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo) and in two shallow wells used as drinking water supplies, during the wet and dry seasons in order to estimate the seasonal variation of contamination. The faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) isolated strains (Escherichia coil (E. coil) and Enterococcus (ENT)) from water and surface sediment, were characterized for human-specific bacteroides by molecular approach. The results revealed very high faecal contamination of water from the shallow wells, and of water and sediments from the river, during both wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, E. coil reached the values of 18.6 x 10(5) and 4.9 x 10(5) CFU 100 mL(-1) in Kokolo Canal and shallow wells, respectively; and Enterococcus reached the values of 7.4 x 10(4) and 2.7 x 10(4) CFU 100 mL(-1). Strong mutually positive correlation was observed between E. coil and ENT, with the range of R-value being 0.93 < r < 0.97 (p-value < 0.001, n = 15). The PCR assays for human-specific Bacteroides indicated that more than 98% of 500 isolated FIB strains were of human origin, pointing out the effect of poor household sanitation practices on surface water but also on groundwater contamination. The water samples from the shallow wells and Kokolo Canal were highly polluted with faecal matter in both seasons. However, the pollution level was significantly higher during the wet season compared to the dry season. Physicochemical analysis revealed also very high water electrical conductivity, with values much higher than the recommended limits of the World Health Organization guideline for drinking water. These results highlight the potential human health risk associated with the exposure to water contamination from shallow wells and Kokolo Canal, due to the very high level of human FIB. Rapid, unplanned and uncontrolled population growth in the city of Kinshasa is increasing considerably the water demand, whereas there is a dramatic lack of appropriate sanitation and wastewater facilities, as well as of faecal sludge (and solid waste) management and treatment. The lack of hygiene and the practice of open defecation is leading to the degradation of water quality, consequently the persistence of waterborne diseases in the neighbourhoods of sub-rural municipalities, and there is a growing threat to the sustainability to water resources and water quality. The results of this study should encourage municipality policy and strategy on increasing the access to safely managed sanitation services; in order to better protect surface water and groundwater sources, and limit the proliferation of epidemics touching regularly the city.

CHALLACEA Project Members	Half-precessional dynamics of monsoon rainfall near the East African Equator	NATURE												External climate forcings-such as long-term changes in solar insolation-generate different climate responses in tropical and high latitude regions(1). Documenting the spatial and temporal variability of past climates is therefore critical for understanding how such forcings are translated into regional climate variability. In contrast to the data-richmiddle and high latitudes, high-quality climate-proxy records from equatorial regions are relatively few(2-4), especially from regions experiencing the bimodal seasonal rainfall distribution associated with twice-annual passage of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Here we present a continuous and well-resolved climate-proxy record of hydrological variability during the past 25,000 years from equatorial East Africa. Our results, based on complementary evidence from seismic-reflection stratigraphy and organic biomarker molecules in the sediment record of Lake Challa near Mount Kilimanjaro, reveal that monsoon rainfall in this region varied at half-precessional (similar to 11,500-year) intervals in phase with orbitally controlled insolation forcing. The southeasterly and northeasterly monsoons that advect moisture from the western Indian Ocean were strengthened in alternation when the inter-hemispheric insolation gradient was at a maximum; dry conditions prevailed when neither monsoon was intensified and modest local March or September insolation weakened the rain season that followed. On sub-millennial timescales, the temporal pattern of hydrological change on the East African Equator bears clear high-northern-latitude signatures, but on the orbital timescale it mainly responded to low-latitude insolation forcing. Predominance of low-latitude climate processes in this monsoon region can be attributed to the low-latitude position of its continental regions of surface air flow convergence, and its relative isolation from the Atlantic Ocean, where prominent meridional overturning circulation more tightly couples low-latitude climate regimes to high-latitude boundary conditions.

Matt			The ratio of methanogens to methanotrophs and water-level dynamics drive methane transfer velocity in a temperate kettle-hole peat bog	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Peatlands are a large source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, yet the uncertainty around the estimates of CH4 flux from peatlands is large. To better understand the spatial heterogeneity in temperate peatland CH4 emissions and their response to physical and biological drivers, we studied CH4 dynamics throughout the growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 in Flatiron Lake Bog, a kettle-hole peat bog in Ohio. The site is composed of six different hydrobiological zones: an open water zone, four concentric vegetation zones surrounding the open water, and a restored zone connected to the main bog by a narrow channel. At each of these locations, we monitored water level (WL), CH4 pore-water concentration at different peat depths, CH4 fluxes from the ground and from representative plant species using chambers, and microbial community composition with a focus here on known methanogens and methanotrophs. Integrated CH4 emissions for the growing season were estimated as 315.4 +/- 166 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in 2017 and 362.3 +/- 687 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in 2018. Median CH4 emission was highest in the open water, then it decreased and became more variable through the concentric vegetation zones as the WL dropped, with extreme emission hotspots observed in the tamarack mixed woodlands (Tamarack) and low emissions in the restored zone (18.8-30.3 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Generally, CH4 flux from above-ground vegetation was negligible compared to ground flux (< 0.4 %), although blueberry plants were a small CH4 sink. Pore-water CH4 concentrations varied significantly among zones, with the highest values in the Tamarack zone, close to saturation, and the lowest values in the restored zone. While the CH4 fluxes and pore-water concentrations were not correlated with methanogen relative abundance, the ratio of methanogens to methanotrophs in the upper portion of the peat was significantly correlated to CH4 transfer velocity (the CH4 flux divided by the difference in CH4 pore-water concentration between the top of the peat profile and the concentration in equilibrium with the atmosphere). Since ebullition and plant-mediated transport were not important sources of CH4 and the peat structure and porosity were similar across the different zones in the bog, we conclude that the differences in CH4 transfer velocities, and thus the flux, are driven by the ratio of methanogen to methanotroph relative abundance close to the surface. This study illustrates the importance of the interactions between water-level and microbial composition to better understand CH4 fluxes from bogs and wetlands in general.					; Bohrer, Gil/A-9731-2008; Davies, G./I-2708-2019	Rey-Sanchez, Camilo/0000-0003-4762-9001; Bohrer, Gil/0000-0002-9209-9540; Grau-Andres, Roger/0000-0001-9020-1276													1726-4170	1726-4189				AUG 29	2019	16	16					3207	3231		10.5194/bg-16-3207-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3207-2019													WOS:000483092900001

The results indicated that lake sediments exhibited a high nutrient status as manifested by the high loadings of organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus (AP). Comparison of metal (Ni, Cr, Co, Zn, Cu and Pb) levels with sediment quality guidelines showed that Ni and Cr were found in concentrations well above the PEL (probable effect level) values. No correlations were found between the nutrients and the measured heavy metals. Multivariate analysis results implied that Ni, Cr, Co, Cu and Zn were controlled by natural geological sources whereas Pb might have an anthropogenic origin. The bioavailability ratios of metals followed a decreasing order of Pb > Cu Co > Zn > Ni > Cr based on results obtained by a single 0.5 M HCl leach. Total and bioavailable concentrations of metals demonstrated significant seasonal variations but trends could not be generalized for all the elements. On the contrary, the nutrients did not show significant seasonal differences indicating that the lake sediments record the history of contamination with regard to nutrient status.					; Kelepertzis, Efstratios/ABE-5821-2020; Panagiotaki, Panagiota/AAS-1141-2020	Kelepertzis, Efstratios/0000-0002-1445-0542; VAFIDIS, DIMITRIS/0000-0002-8454-6937; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2015	73	8					4483	4493		10.1007/s12665-014-3736-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3736-1													WOS:000351453600043

The set of studied samples included the following: (i) water from the upper layer (5 m); (ii) water from the surface microlayer; (iii) water from the lake tributaries; (iv) water from deep layers (400 m); and (v) aerosol from the near-water layer. Ten PAHs were detected in the water samples: naphthalene, 1-methylnaphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and chrysene. The total PAH concentrations (?PAHs) were detected in a wide range from 9.3 to 160 ng/L, characterizing by seasonal, intersessional, and spatial variability. In September 2016, the ?PAH concentration in the southern basin of the lake reached 610 ng/L in the upper water layer due to an increase in fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene in the composition of the PAHs. In June 2019, Sigma PAHs in the water from the northern basin of the lake reached 290 ng/L, with the naphthalene and phenanthrene concentrations up to 170 ng/L and 92 ng/L, respectively. The calculation of back trajectories of the atmospheric transport near Lake Baikal, satellite images, and Sigma PAH concentrations in the surface water microlayer of 150 to 960 ng/L confirm the impact of wildfires on Lake Baikal, with which the seasonal increase in the Sigma PAH concentrations was associated in 2016 and 2019. The toxicity of PAHs detected in the water of the lake in extreme situations was characterized by the total value of the toxic equivalent for PAHs ranging from 0.17 to 0.22 ng/L, and a possible ecological risk of the impact on biota was assessed as moderate.					; Gorshkov, Alexandre/T-7587-2017; Izosimova, Oksana/F-9387-2015; Galachyants, Yuri/J-4633-2018	Kustova, Olga/0000-0001-9087-4817; Marinaite, Irina/0000-0003-3856-420X; 														2073-4441				OCT	2021	13	19							2636	10.3390/w13192636	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13192636													WOS:000708262600001

However, these spatiotemporal dynamics of fish metacommunities (beta diversity) were barely quantified. Previous studies either based on species incidence data in calculating beta diversity or solely focus on partial habitat (lotic or lentic) were widely criticized for their misleading results. Here, we addressed the issue by comparing the taxonomic and functional differences in beta diversity and the turnover and nestedness components between wet and dry seasons in the Yangtze-Caizi transitional floodplain. The calculating of beta diversity based on both incidence and abundance data were also compared respectively to test their sensitivity in revealing fish meta-community dynamics triggered by flood pulses. Regionally in the studied transitional floodplain, we detected significantly taxonomic and functional homogenization of fish assemblages triggered by floods in the high-water period. Then locally within the lotic habitats, our results demonstrated significantly higher overall beta diversity and the turnover components in both the high and low waters. Meanwhile, the significantly higher Local Contributions to Beta Diversity (LCBD) also indicated the higher uniqueness of lotic habitats. These findings highlighted remarkably heterogeneous fish assemblages in lotic habitats, thus deserving higher conservation priority in contrast with lentic habitats. Comparing with classic incidence-based measurements, our results exhibited higher sensitivity of abundance-based approaches in revealing homogeneous or heterogeneous patterns of fish metacommunities influenced by floods. Our results highlighted the importance of employing abundance-based data to measure beta diversity within small spatial extents.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021; Dai, Bingguo/AAM-7257-2021	Jiang, Zhongguan/0000-0002-5949-6106; Dai, Bingguo/0000-0003-4935-2800													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAY	2020	112								106122	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106122													WOS:000518385800001

Making sense of the noise: The effect of hydrology on silver carp eDNA detection in the Chicago area waterway system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling is an emerging tool for monitoring the spread of aquatic invasive species. One confounding factor when interpreting eDNA sampling evidence is that eDNA can be present in the water in the absence of living target organisms, originating from excreta, dead tissue, boats, or sewage effluent, etc. In the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), electric fish dispersal barriers were built to prevent non-native Asian carp species from invading Lake Michigan, and yet Asian carp eDNA has been detected above the barriers sporadically since 2009. In this paper the influence of stream flow characteristics in the CAWS on the probability of invasive Asian carp eDNA detection in the CAWS from 2009 to 2012 was examined. In the CAWS, the direction of stream flow is mostly away from Lake Michigan, though there are infrequent reversals in flow direction towards Lake Michigan during dry spells. We find that the flow reversal volume into the Lake has a statistically significant positive relationship with eDNA detection probability, while other covariates, like gage height, precipitation, season, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and chlorophyll concentration do not. This suggests that stream flow direction is highly influential on eDNA detection in the CAWS and should be considered when interpreting eDNA evidence. We also find that the beta-binomial regression model provides a stronger fit for eDNA detection probability compared to a binomial regression model. This paper provides a statistical modeling framework for interpreting eDNA sampling evidence and for evaluating covariates influencing eDNA detection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

So far, little is known about the rate of CH4 emission from lake aquaculture and about how ecological restoration (or aquaculture abandonment) affects the emission. In this study, the eddy covariance (EC) technique was deployed to quantify the CH4 flux in an enclosure lake aquaculture farm and to investigate the flux response to ecological restoration. The lake site under aquaculture farming emitted 36.0 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) to the atmosphere, an amount that is comparable to the global mean value of semi-intensive aquaculture systems. The annual CH4 emission decreased from the pre-restoration level by 34% and 37% to 23.7 and 22.8 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in the first and second year of ecological restoration, respectively, but was still much higher than that at a reference lake site not impacted by aquaculture farming (6.12 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)). The high emission values after aquaculture abandonment suggest that aquafeed input in the decades of farming may have caused accumulation of a large amount of organic carbon in the sediment that continues to fuel CH4 production and that it may take a long time for the system to recover to a natural state. After aquaculture abandonment, floating-leaved plants expanded rapidly within the EC flux footprint, resulting in a high net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in the growing season. These plants appeared to be able to transport CH4 to the atmosphere through aerenchyma tissues and stomata.

In order to interpret the relationships between variations of Microcystis morphospecies and extracellular MC concentrations, the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton community composition, MC concentrations, and environmental parameters were monitored monthly from August, 2009 to July, 2010. The results indicated that Microcystis dominated total phytoplankton abundance from May to December (96%-99% of total biovolume), with toxic Microcystis viridis and non-toxic Microcystis wesenbergii dominating after July (constituting 65%-95% of the Microcystis population), followed by M. viridis as the sole dominant species from November to January (49%-93%). Correlation analysis revealed that water temperature and nutrient were the most important variables accounting for the occurrence of M. wesenbergii, while the dominance of M. viridis was related with nitrite and nitrate. The relatively low content of MCs was explained by the association with a large proportion of M. viridis and M. wesenbergii, small colony size of Microcystis populations, and low water temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen. The extracellular MC (mean of 0.5 +/- 0.2 mu g/L) of water samples analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated the low concentrations of MC in Dianchi Lake which implied the low potential risk for human health in the basin. The survey provides the first whole lake study of the occurrence and seasonal variability of Microcystis population and extracellular MCs that are of particular interest for water quality monitoring and management.

The process of visualizing seasonal rounds informs transdisciplinary research. We present a methodological approach for communities of enquiry to engage communities of practice through context-specific sociocultural and ecological relations driven by seasonal change. We first discuss historical precis of the concept of seasonal rounds that we apply to assess the spatial and temporal communal migrations and then describe current international research among Indigenous and rural communities in North America and Central Asia by the creation of a common vocabulary through mutual respect for multiple ways of knowing, validation of co-generated knowledge, and insights into seasonal change. By investigating the relationship between specific biophysical indicators and livelihoods of local communities, we demonstrate that seasonal rounds are an inclusive and participatory methodology that brings together diverse Indigenous and rural voices to anticipate anthropogenic climate change.

J	Moreno, PI; Videla, J				Moreno, Patricio I.; Videla, Javiera			Centennial and millennial-scale hydroclimate changes in northwestern Patagonia since 16,000 yr BP	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We examine hydroclimate changes at centennial/millennial timescales since 16,000 yr BP in northwestern Patagonia based on the pollen and charcoal record from Lago El Salto, a small closed-basin lake located in the Chilean Lake District (41 degrees 38'48.02 '' S, 73 degrees 5'48.42 '' W). We observe cold/wet conditions between 14,500-16,000 yr BP, followed by further cooling with increased precipitation until 13,000 yr BP, enhanced precipitation seasonality and/or variability between 11,600-13,000 yr BP, and an extended warm-and-dry interval between 7600 and 11,300 yr BP with peak paleofire activity. Colder-and-wetter than present conditions and muted paleofire activity prevail between 5300 and 7600 yr BP, followed by alternating cold/wet and centennial-scale warm/dry phases starting at 5300 yr BP with three conspicuous megadroughts since 2500 yr BR The most recent megadrought occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. We identify a cold reversal that spans the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) and the Younger Dryas (YD) chrons with stronger-than-present westerly influence during the former and enhanced variability during the latter. These results extend the northern limit of strong cooling and increase in precipitation during the ACR and the southern limit of influence of strong hydrologic variations during the YD in terrestrial environments, suggesting an overlap in the spheres of influence of processes originating from southern and northern polar latitudes. An extended warm southern westerly wind (SWW)-minimum interval is evident between 7600 and 11,300 yr BP, followed by a rapid shift to cool-moist conditions between 5300 and 7600 yr BP brought by a mid-Holocene SWW maximum. Since then we observe centennial-scale hydroclimate variability, which has driven biodiversity and fire-regime shifts of evergreen temperate rainforests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, a supplementary measure, transplantation of submerged macrophytes after fish removal, has been applied to restore warm Chinese shallow lakes in order to compensate for the expected lack of increasing grazing control of phytoplankton after the biomanipulation. These measures have successfully shifted turbid warm lakes to a clear water state, but little is known about the responses to restoration of key physico-chemical variables. We analyzed the seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations in two subtropical and one tropical biomanipulated shallow Chinese lakes subjected to restoration. In all three lakes, a marked decline occurred in the concentrations of lake total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS), and chlorophyll a (Chl a), while the transparency (SD: WD ratio, Secchi depth to water depth ratio) increased. A clear water state was established, lasting so far for 7 to 23 months, and TN, TP, Chl a, and TSS levels in the three restored lakes decreased to, on average, 49%, 58%, 41%, and 18% of the level prior to restoration and/or the level in a reference lake, respectively, while the annual mean SD: WD ratio exhibited a 1.5-4 fold increase. In conclusion, lake restoration by transplantation of submerged macrophytes after fish removal had major positive effects on the physico-chemical variables in our study lakes. However, continuous control of omnivorous and herbivorous fish biomass is recommended as the fish typically present in warm, shallow lakes to some extent feed on submerged macrophytes, when available.

This work was designed to explore the transformation and fate of DON and dissolved inor-ganic nitrogen (DIN) in drinking water treatment. The changes of DON and formation of N-DBPs were evaluated along the water treatment route (i.e., pre-ozonation and biological-contact oxidation, delivery pipes' transportation, coagulation-sedimentation, sand filtra-tion, post-ozonation, biological activated carbon, ultrafiltration and disinfection) of drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). The transformation mechanism of DON was comprehen-sively investigated by molecular weight fractionation, three-dimensional fluorescence, LC-OCD (Liquid Chromatography-Organic Carbon Detection), total free amino acids. A detailed comparison was made between concentrations and variations of DON and DIN affected by seasons in the drinking water treatment. Regardless of seasonal variation in raw wa-ter concentration, the DON removal trends between different treatment processes remain constant in the present study. Compared to other treatment processes, pre-ozonation and coagulation-sedimentation exhibited the dominant DON removal in different seasons, i.e., 11.13%-14.45% and 14.98%-22.49%, respectively. Contrary, biological-contact oxidation and biological activated carbon negatively impacted the DON removal, in which DON increased by 1.76%-6.49% in biological activated carbon. This may be due to the release of soluble mi-crobial products (SMPs) from bacterial metabolism, which was further validated by the rise of biopolymers in LC-OCD.

Hydrological Foundation as a Basis for a Holistic Environmental Flow Assessment of Tropical Highland Rivers in Ethiopia	WATER												The sustainable development of water resources includes retaining some amount of the natural flow regime in water bodies to protect and maintain aquatic ecosystem health and the human livelihoods and wellbeing dependent upon them. Although assessment of environmental flows is now occurring globally, limited studies have been carried out in the Ethiopian highlands, especially studies to understand flow-ecological response relationships. This paper establishes a hydrological foundation of Gumara River from an ecological perspective. The data analysis followed three steps: first, determination of the current flow regime flow indices and ecologically relevant flow regime; second, naturalization of the current flow regime looking at how flow regime is changing; and, finally, an initial exploration of flow linkages with ecological processes. Flow data of Gumara River from 1973 to 2018 are used for the analysis. Monthly low flow occurred from December to June; the lowest being in March, with a median flow of 4.0 m(3) s(-1). Monthly high flow occurred from July to November; the highest being in August, with a median flow of 236 m(3) s(-1). 1-Day low flows decreased from 1.55 m(3) s(-1) in 1973 to 0.16 m(3) s(-1) in 2018, and 90-Day (seasonal) low flow decreased from 4.9 m(3) s(-1) in 1973 to 2.04 m(3) s(-1) in 2018. The Mann-Kendall trend test indicated that the decrease in low flow was significant for both durations at alpha = 0.05. A similar trend is indicated for both durations of high flow. The decrease in both low flows and high flows is attributed to the expansion of pump irrigation by 29 km(2) and expansion of plantations, which resulted in an increase of NDVI from 0.25 in 2000 to 0.29 in 2019. In addition, an analysis of environmental flow components revealed that only four "large floods" appeared in the last 46 years; no "large flood" occurred after 1988. Lacking "large floods" which inundate floodplain wetlands has resulted in early disconnection of floodplain wetlands from the river and the lake; which has impacts on breeding and nursery habitat shrinkage for migratory fish species in Lake Tana. On the other hand, the extreme decrease in "low flow" components has impacts on pin smaller pools. These results serve as the hydrological foundation for continued studies in the Gumara catchment, with the eventual goal of quantifying environmental flow requirements.redators, reducing their mobility and ability to access prey concentrated					Tilahun, Seifu/ABE-2501-2020; Abebe, wubneh/E-7774-2019; Mhiret, Demesew/KUC-9862-2024; Abebe, Wubneh Belete/GXG-2437-2022; Moges, Michael/HGC-1516-2022	Moges, Michael Mehari/0000-0003-1920-6757; Alemaw Mhiret, Demesew/0000-0002-6318-3612; Walraevens, Kristine/0000-0002-8116-7376; Van Camp, Marc/0000-0002-8417-2373; steenhuis, tammo/0000-0003-0508-9350; Abebe, Wubneh Belete/0000-0003-2072-7146; 														2073-4441				FEB	2020	12	2							547	10.3390/w12020547	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12020547													WOS:000519846500238

To evaluate the impact of a combined and individual climate and LU/LC dynamics on stream flow, series of simulation were computed by changing climate and LU/LC variables. The model was calibrated and validated against observed data. Statistical measures like coefficient of determination and Nash-Sutcliffe were used to evaluate the model and it results in 0.82 and 0.82 for calibration and 0.81 and 0.80 for validation respectively. During the study period, forest and shrub land decreased by 38% and 48% while, settlement and cultivated land increased by 572% and 7% respectively. Mann-Kendall trend test analysis showed a significant trend in maximum and minimum temperature at 5% significant level, whereas there were three no trend cases for rainfall out of four tested cases and one non-significant decreasing trend. The simulated flow showed a very good agreement with the observed flow data with 0.82 and 0.82 for calibration and 0.81 and 0.80 for validation respectively. Simulation result indicted that LU/LC change increased the wet season flow by 14.5% while decreasing by 9.65% in dry season. In wet season the flow increased by 4.5% while decreased by 3.3% in dry season because of change in climate and seasonal variability. The study showed the increase in stream flows can be directly attributed to the expansion of cultivated lands at a cost of the forested vegetation.

J	Pokrovsky, OS; Karlsson, J; Giesler, R				Pokrovsky, Oleg S.; Karlsson, Jan; Giesler, Reiner			Freeze-thaw cycles of Arctic thaw ponds remove colloidal metals and generate low-molecular-weight organic matter	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												High-latitude boreal and arctic surface/inland waters contain sizeable reservoirs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and trace elements (TE), which are subject to seasonal freezing. Specifically, shallow ponds and lakes in the permafrost zone often freeze solid, which can lead to transformations in the colloidal and dissolved fractions of DOM and TE. Here, we present results from experimental freeze-thaw cycles using iron (Fe)- and DOM-rich water from thaw ponds situated in Stordalen and Storflaket palsa mires in northern Sweden. After ten cycles of freezing, 85% of Fe and 25% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were removed from solution in circumneutral fen water (pH 6.9) but a much smaller removal of Fe and DOC (< 7%) was found in acidic bog water (pH 3.6). This removal pattern was consistent with initial supersaturation of fen water with respect to Fe hydroxide and a lack of supersaturation with any secondary mineral phase in the bog water. There was a nearly two- to threefold increase in the low-molecular-weight (LMW) fraction of organic carbon (OC) and several TEs caused by the repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Future increases in the freeze-thaw frequency of surface waters with climate warming may remove up to 25% of DOC in circumneutral organic-rich waters. Furthermore, an increase of LMW OC may result in enhanced carbon dioxide losses from aquatic ecosystems since this fraction is potentially more susceptible to biodegradation.

This yearlong study investigated monthly fluctuation of bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-nonylphenol (NP) concentrations in both water and sediment samples from Taihu Lake and evaluated the impact of rainfall on their spatiotemporal distribution and partition trends. Results showed that BPA concentration in water was negatively correlated to rainfall while NP concentrations in both phases were positively related to rainfall. The spatial distribution of NP in the lake water was season specific with the lakeshore area higher than the central area during the wet season and a reversed pattern during the dry season. The spatial distributions of sediment-associated NP and BPA in both phases were not significantly different among seasons. Contrary partition tendencies were observed for BPA and NP that BPA tended to desorb from sediment and NP tended to be adsorbed during the wet season while the trends were reversed during the dry season. This study suggests that rainfall could affect the occurrence, distribution and environmental fate of micropollutants and should be considered in the monitoring program and risk assessment.					; Ding, Jiannan/HIR-2080-2022; Wang, Zhenyu/IXD-4651-2023; ZHANG, YUN/LZE-5248-2025	Zhang, Yun/0000-0002-6309-2470; 													0147-6513	1090-2414				NOV	2020	204								111064	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111064								32738625					WOS:000574853800003

Climate change alters the reproductive phenology and investment of a lacustrine fish, the three-spine stickleback	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												High-latitude lakes are particularly sensitive to the effects of global climate change, demonstrating earlier ice breakup, longer ice-free seasons, and increased water temperatures. Such physical changes have implications for diverse life-history traits in taxa across entire lake food webs. Here, we use a five-decade time series from an Alaskan lake to explore effects of climate change on growth and reproduction of a widely distributed lacustrine fish, the three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We used multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models to describe trends in the mean length for multiple size classes and to explore the influence of physical (date of ice breakup, surface water temperature) and biological (density of con-and heterospecifics) factors. As predicted, mean size of age 1 and older fish at the end of the growing season increased across years with earlier ice breakup and warmer temperatures. In contrast, mean size of age 0 fish decreased over time. Overall, lower fish density and warmer water temperatures were associated with larger size for all cohorts. Earlier ice breakup was associated with larger size for age 1 and older fish but, paradoxically, with smaller size of age 0 fish. To explore this latter result, we used mixing models on age 0 size distributions, which revealed an additional cohort in years with early ice breakup, lowering the mean size of age 0 fish. Moreover, early ice breakup was associated with earlier breeding, evidenced by earlier capture of age 0 fish. Our results suggest that early ice breakup altered both timing and frequency of breeding; three-spine stickleback spawned earlier and more often in response to earlier ice breakup date. While previous studies have shown the influence of changing conditions in northern lakes on breeding timing and growth, this is the first to document increased breeding frequency, highlighting another pathway by which climate change can alter the ecology of northern lakes.

Long-term effects of a Phragmites australis invasion on birds in a Lake Erie coastal marsh	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												On the North shore of Lake,Erie, Long Point provides habitat to many thousands of breeding and migrating birds, including marsh-nesting species that are in decline across the Great Lakes. Invasive Phragmites australis threatens the ecological integrity of these marshes. Early concerns prompted a study into the effects of invasion on bird use in 2001-2002 that concluded P. australis was not a major bird conservation issue. We evaluate breeding season bird occupancy in these wetlands after over a decade of P. australis expansion, comparing bird diversity and abundance in P. australis with diversity and abundance in the vegetation communities that P. australis is displacing: cattail, meadow, and open-water marsh. We also examine community composition and functional traits to better capture the effects of P. australis invasion. In 2015, total bird abundance was lower in P. australis than cattail marsh (ANOVA p < 0.001), with little difference in bird species richness among vegetation types (ANOVA p = 0.272). Bird community composition was distinct among the vegetation types (MRPP p < 0.001), such that P. australis supported a subset of bird species found within cattail and meadow marsh habitat, rather than novel species. Phragmites australis habitat excludes many marsh-nesting species and provides habitat for shrub-nesting, ground and foliage gleaners instead. Marsh-nesters of conservation concern are restricted to remaining cattail, meadow marsh, and open-water habitat. The full effects of P. australis invasion may exhibit a lag time, and community composition and functional traits should be considered when evaluating the effects of biological invasions.

The effects of extreme events on phytoplankton dynamics in a semi-arid man-made lake	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												In arid and semi-arid regions, a hydrological regime characterized by an annual cycle of drought and rainy seasons changes the volume and retention time of reservoirs. Such changes affect the limnological characteristics and lead to changes on phytoplankton community. Phytoplankton seasonal succession was studied in a Brazilian eutrophic semi-arid water supply reservoir (Cruzeta). In this study, the changes in the biomass and species composition of phytoplankton during two annual hydrological cycles were analyzed, and the driving factors were evaluated. The composition of phytoplankton alternated between filamentous cyanobacteria, such as Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, under conditions of mixing, and colonial species, such as Microcystis panniformis and Sphaerocavum brasiliensis, under conditions of high water column stability. The lower water level during a severe drought favored adaptive phytoplankton species with low requirement for resources, such as diatoms and cryptomonads. Extreme events, i.e., torrential rains and severe droughts, governed by the hydrological regime of the semi-arid region led to strong altered availability of resources in the watershed, directing the spatial and temporal dynamics of the phytoplankton in the Cruzeta man-made lake. The results showed an unusual behavior of the phytoplankton community contradicting the expectations about the climatic change scenario. Instead of an expected increase in cyanobacteria, the severe drought led to low biomass and resources, favoring diatoms and cryptomonads.					; Becker, Vanessa/G-6189-2015	Becker, Vanessa/0000-0002-7326-4328; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2015	49	3					293	307		10.1007/s10452-015-9524-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-015-9524-5													WOS:000358581000004
J	Amiri, V; Nakhaei, M; Lak, R; Kholghi, M				Amiri, Vahab; Nakhaei, Mohammad; Lak, Razyeh; Kholghi, Majid			Investigating the salinization and freshening processes of coastal groundwater resources in Urmia aquifer, NW Iran	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This paper presents the results of an assessment about interaction between Urmia Lake (UL) and coastal groundwater in the Unnia aquifer (UA). This aquifer is the most significant contributor to the freshwater supply of the coastal areas. The use of hydrochemical facies can be very useful to identify the saltwater encroachment or freshening phases in the coastal aquifers. In this study, the analysis of salinization/freshening processes was carried out through the saturation index (SI), ionic deltas (Delta), binary diagrams, and hydrochemical facies evolution (HFE) diagram. Based on the Gibbs plot, the behavior of the major ions showed that the changes in the chemical composition of the groundwater are mainly controlled by the water-soil/rock interaction zone and few samples are relatively controlled by evaporation. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the deposited chloride and sulfate particles can fount the minor salinity source in some coastal areas when washed down by precipitation. The Si calculations showed that all groundwater samples, collected in these periods, show negative saturation indices, which indicate undersaturation with respect to anhydrite, gypsum, and halite. In addition, except in a few cases, all other samples showed the undersaturation with respect to the carbonate minerals such as aragonite, calcite, and dolomite. Therefore, these minerals are susceptible to dissolution. In the dry season, the SI calculations showed more positive values with respect to dolomite, especially in the northern part of UA, which indicated a higher potential for precipitation and deposition of dolomite. The percentage of saltwater in the groundwater samples of Urmia plain was very low, ranging between 0.001 and 0.79 % in the wet season and 0.0004 and 0.81 % in the dry season. The results of HFE diagram, which was taken to find whether the aquifer was in the saltwater encroachment phase or in the freshening phase, indicated that except for a few wells near the coast, there is very little hydraulic interaction between UA and UL. In this coastal area, most of the samples that were collected repeatedly in both wet and dry seasons showed the same hydrochemical facies, which suggested that the seasonal groundwater fluctuations cannot significantly change the chemical composition of groundwater.					; Lak, Razyeh/Y-3056-2019; Amiri, Vahab/AAW-1555-2021; Nakhaei, Mohammad/A-5816-2019	Lak, Razyeh/0000-0003-3223-5528; Amiri, Vahab/0000-0001-9734-9812; Nakhaei, Mohammad/0000-0002-4823-5197													0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2016	188	4							233	10.1007/s10661-016-5231-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5231-5								27000318					WOS:000372750100032

Malaria vector species composition and entomological indices following indoor residual spraying in regions bordering Lake Victoria, Tanzania	MALARIA JOURNAL												Background Vector control through long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and focal indoor residual spraying (IRS) is a major component of the Tanzania national malaria control strategy. In mainland Tanzania, IRS has been conducted annually around Lake Victoria basin since 2007. Due to pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors, use of pyrethroids for IRS was phased out and from 2014 to 2017 pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic (R) 300CS) was sprayed in regions of Kagera, Geita, Mwanza, and Mara. Entomological surveillance was conducted in 10 sprayed and 4 unsprayed sites to determine the impact of IRS on entomological indices related to malaria transmission risk. Methods WHO cone bioassays were conducted monthly on interior house walls to determine residual efficacy of pirimiphos-methyl CS. Indoor CDC light traps with or without bottle rotator were hung next to protected sleepers indoors and also set outdoors (unbaited) as a proxy measure for indoor and outdoor biting rate and time of biting. Prokopack aspirators were used indoors to capture resting malaria vectors. A sub-sample of Anopheles was tested by PCR to determine species identity and ELISA for sporozoite rate. Results Annual IRS with Actellic (R) 300CS from 2015 to 2017 was effective on sprayed walls for a mean of 7 months in cone bioassay. PCR of 2016 and 2017 samples showed vector populations were predominantly Anopheles arabiensis (58.1%, n = 4,403 IRS sites, 58%, n = 2,441 unsprayed sites). There was a greater proportion of Anopheles funestus sensu stricto in unsprayed sites (20.4%, n = 858) than in sprayed sites (7.9%, n = 595) and fewer Anopheles parensis (2%, n = 85 unsprayed, 7.8%, n = 591 sprayed). Biting peaks of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) followed periods of rainfall occurring between October and April, but were generally lower in sprayed sites than unsprayed. In most sprayed sites, An. gambiae s.l. indoor densities increased between January and February, i.e., 10-12 months after IRS. The predominant species An. arabiensis had a sporozoite rate in 2017 of 2.0% (95% CI 1.4-2.9) in unsprayed sites compared to 0.8% (95% CI 0.5-1.3) in sprayed sites (p = 0.003). Sporozoite rates were also lower for An. funestus collected in sprayed sites. Conclusion This study contributes to the understanding of malaria vector species composition, behaviour and transmission risk following IRS around Lake Victoria and can be used to guide malaria vector control strategies in Tanzania.

J	Wesström, I; Joel, A; Messing, I				Wesstrom, Ingrid; Joel, Abraham; Messing, Ingmar			Controlled drainage and subirrigation - A water management option to reduce non-point source pollution from agricultural land	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Losses of nutrients from arable land significantly contribute to the eutrophication of lakes and coastal waters. Consequently agricultural nutrient and water management strategies have been emphasized during the last decades. The problem of excessive drainage at certain times of the year in conventional drainage systems (CD) can in many cases be overcome by implementing controlled drainage strategies (CWT). The data for this paper is based on water management projects, at both plot and field scales, which have been carried out in Southern Sweden during the period 2002 to 2005. The studies included water table strategies in which the subsoil was subjected to various degrees of water status at different times of the year by means of controlled drainage system. They were run on one site with small plots and two sites with field scale plots, and each site consisted of one CD plot and three CWT plots. Compared to CD, CWT had lower subsurface runoff all years of measurement. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in subsurface drainage water revealed no significant differences between CWT and CD. N and P losses, in contrast, tended to be lower in CWT than in CD, possibly due to lower runoff volumes in CWT. The yearly losses of NO3-N, Total-N, PO4-P and Total-P through the drainage system were on average 40% lower in CWT than in CD. The yield and N uptake by crops, in most measurements, were higher in CWT due to more water available during the cropping season and thereby improved N efficiency of the applied fertiliser. The results from the experiments revealed that controlled drainage has a potential to lower non-point source leaching of nutrients from agricultural land, improve N and P use efficiency and increase yields.

J	Pal, P; Joshi, A; Anantharaman, H				Pal, Preeti; Joshi, Amey; Anantharaman, Harish			Nanobubble ozonation for waterbody rejuvenation at different locations in India: A holistic and sustainable approach	RESULTS IN ENGINEERING												In this study, four different sites of ponds at different time period were analysed to show to the effect of Nanobubble ozonation (NBO). NBO is one of novel technologies which is environmentally friendly only using air, ozone, and requiring virtually no chemicals. All the case studies have been performed in real time in different seasons and locations which gives the idea of importance of NBO for the treatment of water bodies with completely natural, environmentally sustainable, cost effective, and less time-consuming technology. Three case studies have been investigated in-situ (Site 1, 2, 4) and one ex-situ (site-3), which verify the efficacy of NBO in treating pond water. NBO treated water was determined to be in the standard limits, odour was eliminated, and water was cleaned enough to be consumed by the animals. The test results show that ozone nanobubble (NBO) in wastewater treatments achieved 85-99% reduction in total soluble solids (TSS), 80-90% reduction in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and 55% chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction at site 3 and 82% COD reduction at site 4. Improved dissolved oxygen suitable for the living beings was achieved. Hence, this paper emphasizes the efficacy of NBO treatment to reclaim the water bodies and ecological restoration and to achieve the sustainable goals of clean water and environmental sustainability. DO level in all the ponds improved significantly after NBO treatment and showed the value of 14.5 mg/L when measured even after 50 h. Nano -bubble gas dissolution system not only able to improve the dissolved oxygen up to supersaturation level but also able to retain it consistent more than 14-15 h. The vary reason for maintaining such consistency is the size of nanobubbles which is around <0.5 mu m and NB doesn't follow the buoyancy, hence move in water in Brownian motion. NBG systems are future of our lakes and ponds rejuvenation and maintain the water quality.

We present a record of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from the Shiwangutian (SWGT) peatland in central-southern China. Comparative results from surface peat samples from the SWGT peatland and the surrounding surface soils demonstrate that the brGDGTs are primarily of in-situ origin, demonstrating their potential as a record of local environmental changes. Monthly observational re-sults show no seasonal variations in the methylation index of 5-methyl brGDGTs (MBT'5MEwhich has been proposed as an indicator of local environmental temperature in peatlands) in the surface peat samples, sug-gesting that it is an indicator of MAT. Thus, we conclude that the long-term increasing trend in the brGDGTs-based MBT'5ME records of two parallel independently-dated peat cores from the SWGT peatland clearly demonstrate a long-term warming trend during the Holocene. Additionally, we found that the brGDGTs-based records from five peatlands along an environmental gradient from southeastern (SE) humid to northwestern (NW) arid China also show a long-term Holocene warming trend. However, this trend is the opposite to the long-term Holocene cooling trend indicated by brGDGTs records from two peatlands in northeastern (NE) China, highlighting the complexity of peat brGDGTs as a climatic indicator. We therefore appeal for more peat brGDGTs studies, which are important for understanding the climate history of the Holocene and its potential relationship with human activities.

J	Li, SM; Wang, XL; Qiao, B; Li, JS; Tu, JM				Li, Songmin; Wang, Xiaoling; Qiao, Bin; Li, Jiansheng; Tu, Jiamin			First flush characteristics of rainfall runoff from a paddy field in the Taihu Lake watershed, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Nonpoint storm runoff remains a major threat to surface water quality in China. As a paddy matures, numerous fertilizers are needed, especially in the rainy seasons; the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in rainfall runoff from farmland is much higher than at other times, and this poses a great threat to water bodies and is the main reason for water eutrophication, especially in high concentration drainages. To date, most studies regarding the characteristics of pollutants in rainfall runoff have mainly been concentrated on urban runoff and watershed runoff; therefore, it is particularly important to investigate the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in rainfall runoff from paddy fields. To study the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss and whether the first flush effect exists, continuous monitoring of the rainfall runoff process of six rainfall events was conducted in 2013, of which four rainfall events during storm, high, middle, and low intensity rainfalls were analyzed, and runoff and quality parameters, such as suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3 (-)-N), total phosphorus (TP), and phosphate (PO43--P), were analyzed to determine the relationship between runoff and water quality. The paddy field is located north of Wuxi Lake Basin along the Hejia River upstream in Zhoutie town, Yixing city. An analysis of the load distribution during rainfall runoff was conducted. Event mean concentration (EMC) was used to evaluate the pollution situation of the paddy field's rainfall runoff. A curve of the dimensionless normalized cumulative load (L) vs. normalized cumulative flow (F) (L-F curve), the probability of the mass first flush (MFFn), and the pollutants carried by the initial 25% of runoff (FF25) were used to analyze the first flush effect of the paddy field runoff, and different contaminants show different results: the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus fluctuate and follow a similar trend as runoff changes, NO3 (-)-N concentration is lower in the early part of runoff and higher in the later, and TP mainly occurs in the particle state in storm runoff and mainly in the dissolved state when the rainfall intensity is smaller. Nitrogen and phosphorus losses from paddy fields are closely related to the average rainfall intensity and the max rainfall intensity, and the runoff loss of nitrogen and phosphorus is more severe when the rainfall intensity is large. Based on an analysis of multiple methodologies, TN and NH4+-N show a certain degree of a first flush effect, whereas the first flush effect of TP is not obvious. The first flush effect of SS is obvious in larger intensity rainfall and shows a slight secondary flush effect in smaller rainfall events.

J	Wu, ZS; Cai, YJ; Liu, X; Xu, CP; Chen, YW; Zhang, L				Wu, Zhaoshi; Cai, Yongjiu; Liu, Xia; Xu, Cai Ping; Chen, Yuwei; Zhang, Lu			Temporal and spatial variability of phytoplankton in Lake Poyang: The largest freshwater lake in China	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The composition and both the temporal and spatial distribution of phytoplankton were studied in Lake Poyang; samples were collected every 3 months from January 2009 to October 2011 at 15 sites. The phytoplankton community was found to belong to seven groups, with Bacillariophyta dominating. No significant difference was observed in the phytoplankton community structure at any of the sites (p = 02371), except one site; however, the structure was significantly different with regard to annual and seasonal trends (p = 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Aulacoseira granulata, Synedra acus, Fragilaria virescens, and Cuptomonas erosa were the main contributors to the dissimilarity in temporal distribution. Although the nutrient concentrations for 3 years combined were relatively high (mean total nitrogen was 1.719 mg L-1 and mean total phosphorus was 0.090 mg L-1), phytoplankton biomass was low (mean total biomdss of 0.203 mg L-1). The underwater light condition, as indicated by the Secchi depth, was shown to be the principal limiting factor in regulating the growth of phytoplankton, and the transparency coincided with biomass variation on a seasonal level. The effect of nutrients on phytoplankton may be concealed by the water level, which varied over a wide range among different seasons. However, the annual trend for the biomass was associated with the nutrient concentration, which increased yearly and initiated the development of phytoplankton. The biomass is high in the south and low in the north, which may be the result of greater underwater light climate and high nutrient concentrations in the southern area.

We examined the environmental factors that triggered Microcystis bloom outbreak in India's largest brackish water coastal lagoon, Chilika. The warmer water temperature (25.31-32.48 degrees C), higher dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) loading (10.15-13.53 mu mol L-1), strong P-limitation (N:P ratio 138.47-246.86), higher water transparency (46.62-73.38 cm), and low-salinity (5.45-9.15) exerted a strong positive influence on blooming process. During the bloom outbreak, M. aeruginosa proliferated, replaced diatoms, and constituted 70-88% of the total phytoplankton population. The abundances of M. aeruginosa increased from 0.89 x 104 cells L-1 in September to 1.85 x 104 cells L-1 in November and reduced drastically during bloom collapse (6.22 x 103 cells L-1) by the late November of year 2017. The decrease in M. aeruginosa during bloom collapse was associated with a decline in DIN loading (2.97 mu mol L-1) and N:P ratio (73.95). Sentinel-3 OLCI-based satellite monitoring corroborated the field observations showing Cyanophyta Index (CI) > 0.01 in September, indicative of intense bloom and CI < 0.0001 during late November, suggesting bloom collapse. The presence of M. aeruginosa altered the phytoplankton community composition. Furthermore, co-occurrence network indicated that bloom resulted in a less stable community with low diversity, inter-connectedness, and prominence of a negative association between phytoplankton taxa. Variance partitioning analysis revealed that TSM (16.63%), salinity (6.99%), DIN (5.21%), and transparency (5.15%) were the most influential environmental factors controlling the phytoplankton composition. This study provides new insight into the phytoplankton co-occurrences and combination of environmental factors triggering the rapid onset of Microcystis bloom and influencing the phytoplankton composition dynamics of a large coastal lagoon. These findings would be valuable for future bloom forecast modeling and aid in the management of the lagoon.

Spatial-temporal variability of in situ cyanobacteria vertical structure in Western Lake Erie: Implications for remote sensing observations	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Remote sensing has provided expanded temporal and spatial range to the study of harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) in western Lake Erie, allowing for a greater understanding of bloom dynamics than is possible through in situ sampling. However, satellites are limited in their ability to specifically target cyanobacteria and can only observe the water within the first optical depth. This limits the ability of remote sensing to make conclusions about full water column cyanoHAB biomass if cyanobacteria are vertically stratified. FluoroProbe data were collected at nine stations across western Lake Erie in 2015 and 2016 and analyzed to characterize spatiotemporal variability in cyanobacteria vertical structure. Cyanobacteria were generally homogenously distributed during the growing season except under certain conditions. As water depth increased and high surface layer concentrations were observed, cyanobacteria were found to be more vertically stratified and the assumption of homogeneity was less supported. Cyanobacteria vertical distribution was related to wind speed and wave height, with increased stratification at low wind speeds (<4.9 m/s) and wave heights (<027 m). Once wind speed and wave height exceeded these thresholds the assumption of vertically uniform cyanobacteria populations was justified. These findings suggest that remote sensing can provide adequate estimates of water column cyanoHAB biomass in most conditions; however, the incorporation of bathymetry and environmental conditions could lead to improved biomass estimates. Additionally, cyanobacteria contributions to total chlorophyll-a were shown to change throughout the season and across depth, suggesting the need for remote sensing algorithms to specifically identify cyanobacteria.

Reduction of soil erosion and mercury losses in agroforestry systems compared to forests and cultivated fields in the Brazilian Amazon	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In addition to causing physical degradation and nutrient depletion, erosion of cultivated soils in the Amazon affects aquatic ecosystems through the release of natural soil mercury (Hg) towards lakes and rivers. While traditional agriculture is generally cited as being among the main causes of soil erosion, agroforestry practices are increasingly appreciated for soil conservation. This study was carried out in family farms of the rural Tapajos region (Brazil) and aimed at evaluating soil erosion and associated Hg release for three land uses. Soils, runoff water and eroded sediments were collected at three sites representing a land cover gradient: a recently burnt short-cycle cropping system (SCC), a 2-year-old agroforestry system (AFS) and a mature forest (F). At each site, two PVC soil erosion plots (each composed of three 2 x 5 m isolated subplots) were implemented on steep and moderate slopes respectively. Sampling was done after each of the 20 rain events that occurred during a 1-month study period, in the peak of the 2011 rain season. Runoff volume and rate, as well as eroded soil particles with their Hg and cation concentrations were determined. Total Hg and cation losses were then calculated for each subplot. Erosion processes were dominated by land use type over rainfall or soil slope. Eroded soil particles, as well as the amount of Hg and cations (CaMgK) mobilized at the AFS site were similar to those at the F site, but significantly lower than those at the SCC site (p < 0.0001). Erosion reduction at the AFS site was mainly attributed to the ground cover plants characterizing the recently established system. Moreover, edaphic change throughout AFS and F soil profiles differed from the SCC site. At the latter site, losses of fine particles and Hg were enhanced towards soil surface, while they were less pronounced at the other sites. This study shows that agroforestry systems, even in their early stages of implementation, are characterized by low erosion levels resembling those of local forest environments, thus contributing to the maintenance of soil integrity and to the reduction of Hg and nutrient mobility.

Eating local: influences of habitat on the diet of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												We employ molecular methods to profile the diet of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, and describe spatial and temporal changes in diet over their maternity season. We identified 61 prey species of insects and 5 species of arachnid. The largest proportion of prey (similar to 32%) were identified as species of the mass-emerging Ephemeroptera (mayfly) genus Caenis. Bats roosting in agricultural settings had lower dietary richness than those occupying a roost located on a forest fragment in a conservation area. We detected temporal fluctuations in diet over the maternity season. Dipteran (fly) species dominated the diet early in the season, replaced later by species of mayfly. Because our methodology provides species-level identification of prey, we were able to isolate environmental indicator species in the diet and draw conclusions about the location and type of their foraging habitat and the health of these aquatic systems. The species detected suggested that the bats use variable habitats; members of one agricultural roost foraged on insects originating in rivers or streams while those in another agricultural roost and the forest roost fed on insects from pond or lake environments.

It provided more comprehensive fundamental data for risk assessment and contamination control of phenolic EDCs in aquatic environments. Phenolic EDCs, such as nonylphenol-diethoxylate (NP2EO), nonylphenol-mono-ethoxylate (NP1EO), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), bisphenol A (BPA), 4-cumylphenol (4-CP) and 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), were ubiquitously present in Panlong River. The distribution of phenolic EDCs in the water and sediment tended to assume a shape like an inverted letter "W". The residual levels of phenolic EDCs increased dramatically in certain areas. The concentrations of NP2EO, NP1EO, 4-NP, BPA, 4-CP, 4-t-OP and the total phenolic EDCs (EPEDCs) were up to 202, 154, 17, 79, 3.3, 4.6 and 429 ng/L in water, and were up to 352, 316, 124, 18, 14, 4.8 and 813 ng/g in sediment, respectively. However, the concentrations of 4-NP, BPA, 4-CP, 4-t-OP and EPEDCs in the three predominant fish species (Carassius auratus, Cyprinus carpio and Anabarilius alburnops) were up to 63, 113, 12, 14 and 201 ng/g, respectively. Distribution characteristics of phenolic EDCs in water were significantly similar to those found in sediment, but different in fish. Occurrence, bioaccumulation and sources of phenolic EDCs were mainly subjected to the distribution characteristics of industry, agriculture and residential areas in Panlong catchment. Moreover, the bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were closely related to the octanol-water partition coefficients (log K-ow) of phenolic EDCs. Without direct input, the redissolution of phenolic EDCs from sediments seems conceivable. The concentrations of phenolic EDCs in the sections of urban areas were remarkably higher than those in suburban sections, since there could exist a potential risk to aquatic organisms and even to human.

Blooms can show significant daily, monthly, seasonal, inter-annual variability as well as horizontal variation in a lake. In the present study, we use satellite data to explore the sensitivity of different sections of a large eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu) to climate and catchment-related drivers. Bloom coverage in the larger open areas of the lake, historically less eutrophic, has increased over the last 12 years even though extensive efforts were made to improve catchment conditions. Decadal trends in these lake sections were more sensitive to climate conditions and nutrient concentrations compared with the more enclosed eutrophic bays. Bloom coverage was bimodal during the year, with regional differences occurring during the second maximum. Links between climate variability, nutrients, and bloom coverage suggest that major bloom events are likely to continue to occur.

A total of 360 surface water samples were collected from the main rivers and lakes in the urban area of Beijing monthly from July 2013 to June 2014 (except the frozen period). Laboratory analyses revealed that antibiotics were widely used and extensively distributed in the surface water of Beijing, and sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones were the predominant antibiotics with the average concentrations of 136 and 132 ng L-1, respectively. A significant difference of antibiotic concentrations from different sampling sites was observed, and the southern and eastern regions of Beijing showed higher concentrations of antibiotics. Seasonal variation of the antibiotics in the urban surface water was also studied, and the highest level of antibiotics was found in November, which may be due to the low temperature and flow of the rivers during the period of cold weather. Risk assessment showed that several antibiotics might pose high ecological risks to aquatic organisms (algae and plants) in surface water, and more attention should be paid to the risk of antibiotics to the aquatic environment in Beijing.

A community of metacommunities: exploring patterns in species distributions across large geographical areas	ECOLOGY												Ecological communities show extremely complex patterns of variation in space, and quantifying the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors underpinning patterns of species distributions is one of the main goals of community ecology. Although we have accumulated good knowledge about the processes driving species distributions within metacommunities, we have few insights about whether (and how) environmental and spatial features can actually generate consistent species distributional patterns across multiple metacommunities. In this paper we applied the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework to identify and classify metacommunities according to multiple but discrete patterns of species distributions. Given that each pattern has unique underlying structuring mechanisms, exploring and comparing such patterns across multiple metacommunities spanning large geographical areas provides a way to test the existence of general principles underlying species distributions within metacommunities. In this study, we applied the EMS framework into a data set containing about 9000 lakes distributed across 85 fish metacommunities across Ontario, Canada, and estimated the relative importance of local and spatial factors in explaining their distributional patterns. Nested and Clementsian gradients were the patterns that fitted most metacommunities; nested metacommunities were distributed throughout the province, while Clementsian gradient metacommunities were concentrated in the southeastern region. Sixty-five percent of nested metacommunities were located in low-energy watersheds (i.e., colder climate and shorter growing season), whereas metacommunities representing Clementsian gradients were present in high-energy watersheds (i.e., relatively warmer climate and longer growing season). Taken together, our results reveal that the environmental and spatial properties in which metacommunities are embedded are at least partially responsible for their species distributional patterns.					; Peres-Neto, Pedro/E-4717-2011; da Silva, Renato/H-7424-2019	Lindo, Zoe/0000-0001-9942-7204; Henriques da Silva, Renato/0000-0003-2731-2023; Peres Neto, Pedro/0000-0002-5629-8067													0012-9658	1939-9170				MAR	2013	94	3					627	639		10.1890/12-0683.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-0683.1								23687889					WOS:000317044300010

Comparative water use by maize, perennial crops, restored prairie, and poplar trees in the US Midwest	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Water use by plant communities across years of varying water availability indicates how terrestrial water balances will respond to climate change and variability as well as to land cover change. Perennial biofuel crops, likely grown mainly on marginal lands of limited water availability, provide an example of a potentially extensive future land cover conversion. Wemeasured growing-season evapotranspiration (ET) based on daily changes in soil profile water contents in five perennial systems-switchgrass, miscanthus, native grasses, restored prairie, and hybrid poplar-and in annual maize (corn) in a temperate humid climate (Michigan, USA). Three study years (2010, 2011 and 2013) had normal growing-season rainfall (480-610 mm) whereas 2012 was a drought year (210 mm). Over all four years, mean (+/- SEM) growing-season ET for perennial systems did not greatly differ from corn (496 +/- 21 mm), averaging 559 (+/- 14), 458 (+/- 31), 573 (+/- 37), 519 (+/- 30), and 492 (+/- 58) mmfor switchgrass, miscanthus, native grasses, prairie, and poplar, respectively. Differences in biomass production largely determined variation in water use efficiency (WUE). Miscanthus had the highest WUEin both normal and drought years (52-67 and 43 kg dry biomass ha(-1) mm(-1), respectively), followed by maize (40-59 and 29 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)); the native grasses and prairie were lower and poplar was intermediate. That measured water use by perennial systems was similar to maize across normal and drought years contrasts with earlier modeling studies and suggests that rain-fed perennial biomass crops in this climate have little impact on landscape water balances, whether replacing rain-fed maize on arable lands or successional vegetation on marginal lands. Results also suggest that crop ET rates, and thus groundwater recharge, streamflow, and lake levels, may be less sensitive to climate change than has been assumed.

J	Fraga, C; Hollmuller, P; Schneider, S; Lachal, B				Fraga, Carolina; Hollmuller, Pierre; Schneider, Stefan; Lachal, Bernard			Heat pump systems for multifamily buildings: Potential and constraints of several heat sources for diverse building demands	APPLIED ENERGY												This article covers a comparative analysis of the potentials and constraints of different heat sources (air, geo-thermal boreholes, lake, river, groundwater and solar thermal) exploited by HP systems, implemented in various types of multifamily buildings (MFB) - new, retrofitted and non-retrofitted - which correspond to real case studies situated in Geneva. After characterizing the various heat sources and building demands, as well as presenting the numerical model and adopted sizing values, we study the intrinsic potential of the various HP heat sources and show that the HP seasonal performance factor (SPF) is directly correlated to the heat source temperature. In a further step we consider complementary PV production for the HP system, taking into account the available roof area and daily profile match. For buildings with a combined space heating and domestic hot water heat demand up to 80 kWh/m(2), which correspond to current best case buildings (10% of the existing MFB stock in Geneva), combined HP & PV systems should lead to an annual purchased electricity inferior to 15 kWh/ m(2) (with a factor 2 between best and worst heat sources), with an associated daily peak load up to 150 Wh/m(2)/ day. For a demand below 130 kWh/m(2) (which is the case of 75% of the existing MFB stock of the Canton), the various combinations of HP & PV systems mainly result in a purchased electricity below 45 kWh/m(2). The daily peak load reaches up to 500 Wh/m(2)/day, or eventually higher in the case of high-rise buildings. Aside from the final purchased electricity, the annual electricity injected into the grid is in the order of 15-20 kWh/m(2) for low-rise buildings, and half that much for high-rise buildings (except for solar HP systems, for which the reduced available roof area for PV leads to significantly lower values). Lastly, SPF alone is not a sufficient indicator for the characterization of the HP system performance, since it doesn't reflect the absolute value of the electricity demand, which primarily depends on the building heat demand. Furthermore, both SPF and annual electricity demand are limited to annual balance considerations. As a complement, an indication of the peak electricity load gives valuable indications of the potential stress on the grid.

Reservoirs located on river courses have positive impacts on economic and social development because they concentrate large water volumes used for electrical energy production, water supply, irrigation, industry, aquaculture, providing ecosystems for migratory birds and aquatic species. The aim of the study was to assess the contamination with copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) of a cross-border reservoir located on River Prut (border between Romania and Republic of Moldova) in a temperate climate zone. Several aspects were considered: seasonal variation of water parameters and toxic metals, bioconcentration in eight fish species and transfer from prey to predator through the food chain, bioaccumulation by two freshwater molluscs separated in size groups and their role as bioindicators of toxic metals pollution. Metals concentrations were measured with an atomic absorption spectrometer (HR-CS GF-AAS). Cadmium, lead, nickel and chromium concentrations limits in water samples were below the detection limits (0.005 mu g L-1Cd, 0.013 mu g L-1Pb and 0.011 mu g (LCr)-Cr-_1) during the monitoring period, suggesting that anthropogenic contamination was insignificant in the studied ecosystem. Fish liver and kidney had specific selectivity for copper (0.9-55.56 mu g g(-1)) and cadmium (0.097-1.031 mu g g(-1)) in case of pike-perch and bighead carp. The separation of molluscs in size groups did not prove that toxic metals increase in concentration with the organism age. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We measured the speciation of pore-water and sediment-bound sulfur (aqueous sulfate and sulfides, elemental sulfur, iron monosulfide, pyrite, organic sulfur) and supporting geochemical variables (carbon, oxygen, iron) in the sediments of a perennially oxygenated and a seasonally anoxic basin of an oligotrophic lake in Quebec, using a combination of pore-water analyses, sequential extractions and X-ray absorption near edge structure. A non-steady state early diagenetic model was developed and calibrated against this extensive dataset to help unravel the pathways and quantify the rates of S transformations. Results suggest that the main source of S to the sediments is the settling of organic ester-sulfate (R-O-SO3-H). Hydrolysis of these compounds provides an additional source of sulfate for anaerobic microbial oxidation of sedimentary organic matter, releasing sulfide to the pore-water. Reduced solid-bound S species accumulate as thiols (R-SH) and iron sulfides in the perennially oxygenated and seasonally anoxic basin, respectively. The model-estimated rate constant for R-SH formation is lower than previously estimated for this particular lacustrine site, but similar to that proposed for marine shelf sediments. The solid sediment S profiles, however, carry the imprint of the time-dependent sulfate input to the lake. Iron sulfide enrichments formed during past decades of elevated atmospheric SO4 deposition are presently dissolving. In the sediments of the perennially oxygenated basin this reaction hampers the build-up of Fe(III) (oxy)hydroxide near the sediment-water interface. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatial distributions of external and internal phosphorus loads in Lake Erie and their impacts on phytoplankton and water quality	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Re-eutrophication in Lake Erie has led to new programs to reduce external phosphorus loads, and it is important to understand the interrelated dynamics of external and internal phosphorus loads. In addition to developing phosphorus load response curves for algal biomass in the western basin and hypoxia in the central basin, we used a two-dimensional (vertical-longitudinal) hydrodynamic and ecological model to show that both external and internal phosphorus loads were distributed homogeneously in the water column in Lake Erie's western basin. In the stratified central and eastern basins phosphorus released by organic matter decay and crustacean zooplankton excretion was concentrated in the upper water column, contributing 100-119% of the phytoplankton phosphorus demand, while phosphorus released by dreissenids and from anoxic sediments was distributed primarily in the hypolimnion during the growing season. Simulated reductions in external phosphorus loads decreased individual phytoplankton groups most at times when they were normally most abundant, e.g., Microcystis decreased the most during September. Phosphorus was limiting over the simulation periods, but water temperature and light conditions also played critical roles in phytoplanlcton succession. While water column phosphorus responded quickly to external phosphorus reduction, pulses of phosphorus (riverine input or sediment resuspension) occurring immediately before the Microcystis bloom period could allow it to bloom despite long-term external phosphorus load reduction. Studies are warranted to assess the contribution of seasonal dynamics in phosphorus loading (including sediment resuspension) to Microcystis bloom development.

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of sediment P release in reservoirs remains unclear. This study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics in P of the sediment and water of three cascade reservoirs in the Weiyuan River (Tuojiang tributary). The results showed elevated P in sediment [total P (TP): 1208.93 mg kg -1] and water (TP: 0.23 mg L-1) during the low-water season (LWS), which could be attributed to notably higher organic matter content (9.65%), finer particle size (20.95 mu m), and extended hydraulic retention time (HRT: 13.13 days) downstream of the cascade reservoirs. Further study employing static in-situ diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) and dynamic ex-situ adsorption kinetic experiments confirmed that the downstream release of P from sediments [diffusion flux (Fd): 1.67 mg m- 2 d-1, equilibrium P concentrations (EPC0): 0.22 +/- 0.10 mg L-1] greatly exceeded those upstream (-0.66 +/- 0.17 mg m- 2 d-1, 0.07 +/- 0.001 mg L-1), Fe (II) was a critical factor in regulating sedimentary P release. The combined effects of high P in overlying water and sediment significantly stimulated downstream phytoplankton growth, particularly among cyanobacteria (26.48%) and green algae (8.33%). Further regulatory steps are needed to regulate LWS algal blooms downstream of cascade reservoirs.					; Zhou, Yuxin/CAG-3371-2022	Yin, Yuepeng/0009-0008-2711-9243; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV 15	2023	346								118980	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118980		SEP 2023						37741190					WOS:001083726600001

We investigated the movement patterns of an aquatic top predator, Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), using a three-dimensional acoustic telemetry system installed in Kleiner Dollnsee (25ha), a small, shallow, mesotrophic natural lake. Adult piscivorous perch (N=16) were tagged and tracked in the whole lake at a minimum of 9-s intervals over the course of one year. Perch increased swimming activity with higher water temperature and light intensity. Air pressure, wind speed and lunar phase also explained perch movements, but the effects were substantially smaller compared to temperature and light. Perch showed a strong diel pattern in activity, with farther swimming distances and larger activity spaces during the daytime, compared to the night-time. To investigate the influence of prey distribution, we sampled the prey fish in both littoral and pelagic zones in both day and night monthly using gill nets. We found that the prey fish underwent diel horizontal migration, using the littoral zone during the day and the pelagic zone during the night. However, perch showed the opposite patterns, suggesting either that the prey fish avoided predation risk or that the horizontal diel migration of perch was driven by other mechanisms. Our results collectively suggest that the movement ecology of piscivorous perch is mainly governed by a foraging motivation as a function of abiotic variables, especially temperature and light.

The high -frequency observations and rich historical data of the MODIS surface reflectance product (MODIS-500 m) provide important data support for monitoring the FUI of inland lakes. However, MODIS-500 m has only three bands in the visible light range, resulting in significant uncertainty in FUI inversion. To address this problem, this study developed an improved FUI inversion model using 500 synthetic spectra covering natural waters. The model, with a performance threshold set at 170 degrees (FUI = 8), used a segmented algorithm across the entire color space. Validated with on -site measurement datasets (3500 samples), the model exhibited excellent performance, with mean relative error (MRE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.71 % and 3.63 degrees , respectively. Compared to existing models, it was more suitable for long-term FUI inversion in various types of lakes, particularly in eutrophic regions. Subsequently, the model was applied to MODIS-500 m observations from 2000 to 2022, revealing the spatiotemporal dynamics of FUI in 180 large lakes and reservoirs (hereinafter referred to as lakes) in China. The results indicated that the long-term mean FUI in the study area was 9, with 7 and 12 in the western and eastern regions, respectively, showing a distinct spatial distribution of "blue in the west and green in the east." The mean change rate of hue angle for all lakes was -0.085 degrees /yr, showing an overall decreasing trend. Environmental factors ' relative contributions to longterm water color changes in each lake region were quantified using the multiple general linear model (GLM). Although each lake region exhibited different driving forces, they were primarily influenced by vegetation, lake surface area, and anthropogenic factors. Additionally, the seasonal types of lake water color were analyzed, with the west and east showing opposite patterns, reflecting the significant influence of topographic features and seasonal changes in climate on water color. The research results provide techniques for accurate inversion of FUI using MODIS-500 m data, while deepening the understanding of long-term water color changes in inland lakes in China.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				MAY 15	2024	255								121560	10.1016/j.watres.2024.121560	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121560		APR 2024						38564894					WOS:001221656400001
J	Turbet, M; Forget, F; Head, JW; Wordsworth, R				Turbet, Martin; Forget, Francois; Head, James W.; Wordsworth, Robin			3D modelling of the climatic impact of outflow channel formation events on early Mars	ICARUS												Mars was characterized by cataclysmic groundwater-sourced surface flooding that formed large outflow channels and that may have altered the climate for extensive periods during the Hesperian era. In particular, it has been speculated that such events could have induced significant rainfall and caused the formation of late-stage valley networks. We present the results of 3-D Global Climate Model simulations reproducing the short and long term climatic impact of a wide range of outflow channel formation events under cold ancient Mars conditions. We find that the most intense of these events (volumes of water up to 107 km(3) and released at temperatures up to 320 K) cannot trigger long-term greenhouse global warming, regardless of how favorable are the external conditions (e.g. obliquity and seasons). Furthermore, the intensity of the response of the events is significantly affected by the atmospheric pressure, a parameter not well constrained for the Hesperian era. Thin atmospheres (P < 80 mbar) can be heated efficiently because of their low volumetric heat capacity, triggering the formation of a convective plume that is very efficient in transporting water vapor and ice at the global scale. Thick atmospheres (P > 0.5 bar) have difficulty in producing precipitation far from the water flow area, and are more efficient in generating snowmelt. In any case, outflow channel formation events at any atmospheric pressure are unable to produce rainfall or significant snowmelt at latitudes below 40 degrees N. As an example, for an outflow channel event (under a 0.2 bar atmospheric pressure and 45 obliquity) releasing 106 km3 of water heated at 300 I( and at a discharge rate of 109 m(3) s(-1), the flow of water reaches the lowest point of the northern lowlands (around similar to 70 degrees N, 30 degrees W) after similar to 3 days and forms a 200 m deep lake of 4.2 x 10(6) km(2) after similar to 20 days; the lake becomes entirely covered by an ice layer after similar to 500 days. Over the short term, such an event leaves 6.5 x 10(3) km(3) of ice deposits by precipitation (0.65% of the initial outflow volume) and can be responsible for the melting of similar to 80 km(3) (0.008% of the initial outflow volume; 1% of the deposited precipitation). Furthermore, these quantities decrease drastically (faster than linearly) for lower volumes of released water. Over the long term, we find that the presence of the ice-covered lake has a climatic impact similar to a simple body of water ice located in the Northern Plains. For an obliquity of similar to 45 degrees and atmospheric pressures > 80 mbar, we find that the lake ice is transported progressively southward through the mechanisms of sublimation and adiabatic cooling. At the same time, and as long as the initial water reservoir is not entirely sublimated (a lifetime of 10(5) martian years for the outflow channel event described above), ice deposits remain in the West Echus Chasma Plateau region where hints of hydrological activity contemporaneous with outflow channel formation events have been observed. However, because the high albedo of ice drives Mars to even colder temperatures, snowmelt produced by seasonal solar forcing is difficult to attain. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Simulation of Neighborhood-Scale Air Quality With Two-Way Coupled WRF-CMAQ Over Southern Lake Michigan-Chicago Region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The southern Lake Michigan region of the United States, home to Chicago, Milwaukee, and other densely populated Midwestern cities, frequently experiences high pollutant episodes with unevenly distributed exposure and health burdens. Using the two-way coupled Weather Research Forecast and Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (WRF-CMAQ), we investigate criteria pollutants over a southern Lake Michigan domain using 1.3 and 4 km resolution hindcast simulations. We assess WRF-CMAQ's performance using data from the National Climatic Data Center and Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System. Our 1.3 km simulation slightly improves on the 4 km simulation's meteorological and chemical performance while also resolving key details in areas of high exposure and impact, that is, urban environments. At 1.3 km, we find that most air quality-relevant meteorological components of WRF-CMAQ perform at or above community benchmarks. WRF-CMAQ's chemical performance also largely meets community standards, with substantial nuance depending on the performance metric and component assessed. For example, hourly simulated NO2 and O-3 are highly correlated with observations (r > 0.6) while PM2.5 is less so (r = 0.4). Similarly, hourly simulated NO2 and PM2.5 have low biases (<10%), whereas O-3 biases are larger (>30%). Simulated spatial pollutant patterns show distinct urban-rural footprints, with urban NO2 and PM2.5 20%-60% higher than rural, and urban O-3 6% lower. We use our 1.3 km simulations to resolve high-pollution areas within individual urban neighborhoods and characterize seasonal changes in O-3 regimes across tight spatial gradients. Our findings demonstrate both the benefits and limitations of high-resolution simulations, particularly over urban settings.Plain Language Summary In this study we use an air quality model to simulate air pollution at very fine spatial scales over a central midwestern U.S. domain that includes Chicago, IL and Milwaukee, WI. We assess our model's performance relative to meteorological and air quality observations and then characterize the spatial patterns of modeled pollutants. We find large differences in air pollution between urban and rural settings. Because our model operates at fine spatial scales, we are also able to discuss differences in air pollution in different neighborhoods in individual cities. In Chicago, we find elevated pollution near highways and in south and west side neighborhoods, findings that are consistent with previous reports of disparate air quality related health impacts.

Estimating relations between temperature, relative humidity as independed variables and selected water quality parameters in Lake Manzala, Egypt	AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL												In Egypt, Lake Manzala is the largest and the most productive lake of northern coastal lakes. In this study, the continuous measurements data of the Real Time Water Quality Monitoring stations in Lake Manzala were statistically analyzed to measure the regional and seasonal variations of the selected water quality parameters in relation to the change of air temperature and relative humidity. Simple formulas are elaborated using the DataFit software to predict the selected water quality parameters of the Lake including pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Electrical Conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Turbidity, and Chlorophyll as a function of air temperature, relative humidity and quantities and qualities of the drainage water that discharge into the lake. An empirical positive relation was found between air temperature and the relative humidity and pH, EC and TDS and negative relation with DO. There is no significant effect on the other two parameters of turbidity and chlorophyll. (C) 2015 Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

J	Li-kun, Y; Sen, P; Xin-hua, Z; Xia, L				Li-kun, Yang; Sen, Peng; Xin-hua, Zhao; Xia, Li			Development of a two-dimensional eutrophication model in an urban lake (China) and the application of uncertainty analysis	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Urban lakes in China, particularly those with relatively small surface areas and closed watersheds, have suffered from severe eutrophication over the past few years. To investigate the causes and to examine the underlying mechanisms, a two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model was developed. The model reflected the interactions between nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, it can be utilized to describe seasonal and regional water quality changes. The two-dimensional hydraulic model was set up using Navier-Stokes equations and was calculated by applying the finite volume method. The Bayesian method was employed to calibrate the model parameters and obtain the parameter posterior distribution. The two-dimensional hydraulic information and the parameter posterior distribution were utilized to calculate a two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model, for which the 95% confidence interval (uncertainty bounds which can provide the trend and range for water quality changes) and mean value of every water quality index (nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, Chl. a and dissolved oxygen) were simulated. Comparisons between the model simulations and the field data indicated that the models were able to calculate the hydrodynamic information and the eutrophication dynamics with reasonable accuracy (all the relative errors lower than 11%). The simulated concentrations of water quality indexes (nitrate, ammonia, phosphate and Chl. a.) in the vicinity of the lake were higher than that in the middle of the lake during the simulation period, indicating that the nutrient load of the rainwater runoff had significant impacts on algal blooms and water quality. Therefore, the urban lake was vulnerable to the influence of rainwater runoff. To reduce the eutrophication risk, rainwater runoff needs to be controlled. Two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication models, such as those used in this study, can provide a powerful management tool that will continue to improve prediction reliability.

We conducted pollen analyses of 183 samples and 1611 modern surface samples to characterize the processes of vegetation succession and climate change during the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition (2.89-2.34 Ma) in the Nihewan Basin. The results show that pollen assemblages are dominated by arboreal pollen, indicating that the vegetation in the study area was forest dominated and that the climate was more humid than today, however, the temperature varied substantially. The most substantial vegetation and climate changes occurred at similar to 2.8 Ma, when the pollen representation of warm and humid tolerant taxa such as evergreen Quercus and Carya disappeared, and also broadleaved deciduous types such as Ulmus, deciduous Quercus and Betula decreased obviously, on the contrary, the pollen representation of cold and drought tolerant taxa increased substantially: e.g. Picea (from generally less than 20% to more than 30%) and Chenopodiaceae (from generally less than 10% to more than 20%). The quantitative reconstructed results indicating that Tann decreased by about 2-3 degrees C and Pann decreased by similar to 150 mm compared to before 2.8 Ma, with a maximum decrease of similar to 9 degrees C for Tann and similar to 450 mm for Pann. Another important vegetation and climate changes occurred at similar to 2.6 Ma, which was the coldest and driest of the studied interval, when the vegetation was substantially simplified with spruce (generally above 80%) as the dominated types.

J	Thompson, JR; Green, AJ; Kingston, DG				Thompson, J. R.; Green, A. J.; Kingston, D. G.			Potential evapotranspiration-related uncertainty in climate change impacts on river flow: An assessment for the Mekong River basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Six MIKE SHE models of the Mekong are developed, each employing potential evapotranspiration (PET) derived using alternative methods: Blaney-Criddle (BC), Hamon (HM), Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Linacre (LN), Penman (PN) and Priestley-Taylor (PT). Baseline (1961-1990) PET varies, with PT followed by HS providing the lowest totals, LN and BC the highest. The largest mean annual PET is over 1.5 times the smallest. Independent calibration of each model results in different optimised parameter sets that mitigate differences in baseline PET. Performance of each model is "excellent" (monthly NSE > 0.85) or "very good" (NSE: 0.65-0.85). Scenarios based on seven GCMs for a 2 degrees C increase in global mean temperature are investigated. Inter-GCM variation in precipitation change is much larger (in percentage terms by 2.5-10 times) than inter-GCM differences in PET change. Precipitation changes include catchment-wide increases or decreases as well as spatially variable directions of change, whereas PET increases for all scenarios. BC and HS produce the smallest changes, LN and HM the largest. PET method does impact scenario discharges. However, GCM-related uncertainty for change in mean discharge is on average 3.5 times greater than PET method-related uncertainty. Scenarios with catchment-wide precipitation increases (decreases) induce increases (decreases) in mean discharge irrespective of PET method. Magnitude of change in discharge is conditioned by PET method; larger increases or smaller declines in discharge result from methods producing the smallest PET increases. Uncertainty in the direction of change in mean discharge due to PET method occurs for scenarios with spatially variable precipitation change, although this is limited to few gauging stations and differences are relatively small. For all scenarios, PET method-related uncertainty in direction of change in high and low flows occurs, but seasonal distribution of discharge is largely unaffected. As such, whilst PET method does influence projections of discharge, variation in the precipitation climate change signal between GCMs is a much larger source of uncertainty. (C) 2013 The Authors.

However, the effect of machine-planted rice with side-deep fertilization (MRSF) on N loss and footprint of double-cropping rice fields in Hunan is still unclear.MethodsWe established a field experiment in which we applied various N compositions (N 135/148.5-90/99 kg ha-1) to early-season rice (ESR) and late-season rice (LSR). The loss of different N forms during the whole growth period of double cropping rice was measured. The N footprint of double cropping rice in the red soil region of Dongting Lake area was calculated using the life cycle assessment method.ResultsCompared with the conventional fertilizer, with a N level of 150/160 kg ha-1, the MRSF treatments significantly decreased both NH4+-N and NO3--N runoff by 26.2-40.9% and 9.0-36.5%, respectively, for ESR, and by 54.4-79.0% and 6.6-40.7%, respectively, for LSR. Moreover, relative to the conventional fertilization (CF) treatment, the MRSF treatments significantly reduced leaching loss by 21.8-41.2% and 20.5%-42.1%, respectively, for ESR, and 26.7-41.8% and 20.9%-51.0%, respectively, for LSR. While urease activity decreased with increasing soil depth, MRSF treatments increased relative soil urease activity in the later rice growth stages. Compared with the CF treatment, they also decreased the total N footprint by 42.3-53.5% and 45.1-57.1% for ESR and LSR, respectively. Correlation analysis further showed that mineral N loss and total N footprint increased exponentially with the N-application rate under the MRSF strategy.ConclusionsOverall, MRSF reduced environmental risks associated with N loss caused by paddy field leaching and runoff while maintaining the topsoil N content. In this manner, MRSF can attenuate the total N footprint of double-cropping rice systems in the Dongting Lake area.

Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) are typical hydrological features produced on the surface of the GrIS during the melt seasons. The existence and evolution of SGLs play an important role in the melting process of the ice sheet surface. To understand the distribution and recent changes of SGLs in Greenland, this study developed a random forest (RF) algorithm incorporating the texture and morphological features to automatically identify SGLs based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Sentinel-2 imagery was used to map the SGLs inventory in Greenland during the 2016-2018 melt seasons and to explore the spatial and temporal variability characteristics of SGLs. Our results show changes in SGLs from 2016 to 2018, with the total area decreasing by ~1152.22 km(2) and the number increasing by 1134; SGLs are mainly distributed in western Greenland (SW, CW, NW) and northeastern Greenland (NE), where the NE region has the largest number of observed SGLs and the largest SGL was with the surface area of 16.60 km(2) (2016). SGLs were found to be most active in the area with the elevation of 800-1600 m and the slope of 0-5 degrees, and showed a phenomenon of retreating to lower elevation areas and developing to steeper slope areas. Our work provided a method for rapid inventory of SGLs. This study will help monitor the mass balance of the GrIS and predict future rapid ice loss from Greenland.					; Huang, huabing/JHT-7278-2023; Cheng, Xiao/AAT-6307-2020; Xu, Yifang/IWL-8258-2023	huang, hua bing/0000-0001-6253-8437; Chen, Peimin/0009-0007-2909-074X; Cheng, Xiao/0000-0001-6910-6565; Chi, Zhaohui/0000-0002-4842-9573; 														2072-4292				JAN	2022	14	1							55	10.3390/rs14010055	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14010055													WOS:000751379400001

Land use status of Daye Lake basin in 2019 has been shown by Landsat 8 OLI image, water quality of Daye Lake, and 12 inflowing rivers have been investigated once a month; this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the water pollution characteristics of the inflowing rivers and lake in the basin under different LULC patterns, and providing a reference for the scientific planning of land-use types in the basin and land use research in lake basins in subtropical areas. Pollutants are mainly introduced to Daye Lake from the west (such as Da Gang) and north (such as Linjiaju Gang), with concentrations gradually decreasing within the lake from west to east. Construction land is closely associated with the total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) inputs to the basin, which can be trapped by vegetation. Agricultural dryland can contribute acid and dissolved oxygen (DO) to water. Precipitation can influence the input of pollutants, with a stronger effect on TN and weaker effect on TP. Pollutants accumulate from the inlets to the centre of the lake, with longer retention times during the dry season.

Traditional transplanted rice paddies have been experiencing conversion to pond aquaculture wetlands for pursuing higher economic benefits over the past decades in southeast China. A parallel field experiment was carried out to compare CH4 emissions from a transplanted rice paddy and its converted crab-fish farming wetland in southeast China. Over the rice-growing season, CH4 fluxes averaged 1.86 mg m(-2) h(-1) from rice paddies, and 1.14 and 0.50 mg m(-2) h(-1) for the treatments with or without aquatic vegetation present in the crab-fish farming wetlands, respectively. When averaged across the treatments, seasonal CH4 emissions from crab-fish framing wetlands were 52 % lower than those from rice paddies. The CH4 fluxes were negatively related to water dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration but positively related to soil/sediment dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in crab-fish farming wetlands. Dependence of CH4 fluxes on DO or DOC was intensified by the aquatic vegetation presence. By extrapolating the present CH4 emission rate with the current rice paddy-converted aquaculture cultivation area, the seasonal CH4 emissions from inland aquaculture wetlands during the critical farming stage (20 June to 18 October) were estimated to be 33.6 Gg ha(-1) in southeast China in 2012. Rice paddies conversion to crab-fish farming wetlands might have reduced CH4 emissions by 22-54 % in mainland China. Results of this study suggest that the conversion of transplanted rice paddies to crab-fish aquaculture wetlands for higher economic benefits would also lead to a lower ecosystem CH4 release rate.					; ZOU, JIANWEN/B-3059-2012; WU, SHUANG/HRA-0836-2023	ZOU, JIANWEN/0000-0003-4689-9237; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2016	23	2					1505	1515		10.1007/s11356-015-5383-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5383-9								26374545					WOS:000368200200055

Human activities accelerate this phenomenon and provoke dramatic changes to the aquatic ecosystems. The monitoring of water quality of these ecosystems and the study of the effects they have on the environment demand a large amount of spatial and temporal information, which is almost exclusively provided by Earth Observations (EO). This study uses a large temporal series of Sentinel-2 (S2; 2016 till 2019) images to characterize the temporal and spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a [Chla] in San Roque Reservoir, Cordoba Province, Argentina. A robust method that combines empirical modelling of [Chl-a] and data mining analysis is employed. Model results showed significant fit (R2 = 0.77) between [Chl-a] measured in the reservoir and the ratio between the NIR and red bands of S2. An analysis of spatio-temporal patterns demonstrated that [Chl-a] distribution in San Roque is complex and influenced by seasonal changes, aeolian forces, hydrodynamic flows, bathymetry, water levels, and pollution sources. The study also found a correlation between algae bloom events and areas with extreme levels of [Chl-a] (>850 mg/m3) in the water body. Additionally, advanced data mining tools such as slope analysis and spatial anomalies indexes, identified regions in the reservoir where water quality had improved or deteriorated.

We studied the reasons of the disappearance of these lakes by determining the way of replenishment of these lakes and the impact of the natural-social environment of the basin, with the aim of saving these gradually disappearing lakes. Based on remote sensing image and hydrological analysis, this paper studied the recharge of Daihai Lake and Huangqihai Lake. The deep learning method was used to establish the time-series of lake evolution. The same method was combined with the innovative woodland and farmland extraction method to set up the time-series of ground classification composition in the basins. Using relevant survey data, combined with soil water infiltration test, water chemical, and isotopic signature analysis of various water bodies, we found that the Daihai Lake area is the largest in dry season and the smallest in rainy season and the other lake is not satisfied with this phenomenon. In addition, we calculated the specific recharge and consumption of the study basin. These experiments indicated that the exogenous groundwater is recharged directly through the faults at the bottom of Daihai Lake, while the exogenous groundwater is recharged in Huangqihai Lake through rivers indirectly. Large-scale exploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation and industrial production is the main cause of lake degradation. Reducing the extraction of groundwater for agricultural irrigation is an important measure to restore lake ecology.					; Chen, Jiaqi/AAA-9767-2019	Wang, jian/0000-0002-8146-0214; Li, Ning/0000-0002-4358-6449; Lv, Jiming/0000-0003-0185-6495; 														2072-4292				JAN	2020	12	1							45	10.3390/rs12010045	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12010045													WOS:000515391700045

Here, we collected surface water samples from the mainstream and tributaries in the Ganjiang River basin in January and July, 2015, in order to delineate the temporal-spatial distribution characteristics of heavy metals, identify their sources, and assess their potential risk. Compared with China's environmental quality standards for drinking water, our results revealed that 5 heavy metals, including Fe, Al, As, Mn and Tl, exceeded the standard values and the over-standard rates were 21.62%, 16.22%, 8.11%, 4.05% and 4.05%, respectively. The concentrations of hydrochemical ions and heavy metals exhibited significant seasonal variation and spatial heterogeneity. Multivariate statistical approaches indicated that intense anthropogenic activities (mining industries and agricultural activities) were the most important sources of heavy metals in the Ganjiang River, and the upstream of the Ganjiang (in southern Jiangxi Province) and the Yuan River were the regions with the most serious pollution. Assessming health risk using the hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk (CR) recommended by the USEPA showed that children were more susceptible to the health risk than adults, and As was the most largest contributor leading to noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risk to human health. Therefore, effective measures such as controls on mining wastewater and the use of pesticides and fertilizers should be taken by local government to protect aquatic ecosystems and human health.

J	Mondal, D; Pal, S				Mondal, Debabrata; Pal, Swades			Monitoring dual-season hydrological dynamics of seasonally flooded wetlands in the lower reach of Mayurakshi River, Eastern India	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												The seasonally flooded wetlands are often neglected due to their ephemeral and erratic appearance and small size, however, their hydro-ecological importance, socio-economic values are equivalent to the permanent wetlands. Using dual-season Landsat multi-spectral imagery, this study highlights a comprehensive monitoring of the hydrological dynamics of wetlands in the lower reach of the Mayurakshi River at a 14-year temporal resolution with the seasonal mode of 1987-2014 time frames. Our results demonstrate the seasonal and periodic hydrological variability of water presence frequency (WPF) in six wetland complexes defined for this study. The Hijal, Ghambira and Maldah wetland complexes are highly affected by the change of WPF, while Dwarka complex is relatively stable. The assessment of WPF change analysis showed that the method is proficient in identifying stable and physically vulnerable wetland patches and absolute loss of wetland inundation frequency resulting from various anthropogenic causes like regulation of river, dry farming practices and other integrated developmental works. The outcome of our study provides a robust basis for the fundamental hydrological and ecological studies and helpful for the conservation and management of seasonally flooded wetland resources in the tropical monsoon climate.

J	Bunn, HT; Gurtov, AN				Bunn, Henry T.; Gurtov, Alia N.			Prey mortality profiles indicate that Early Pleistocene Homo at Olduvai was an ambush predator	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The prime-adult-dominated mortality profile of large bovids in the 1.8 Ma FLK Zinj assemblage, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, was recently attributed to ambush hunting by early Homo (Bunn, H.T., Pickering, T.R. 2010. Quat. Res. 74, 395-404). We now investigate a logical follow-up question: is enough known about the causes and pervasiveness of prime-adult-dominated mortality profiles (defined as >70% prime adults) from modern ecosystems and from archaeological sites to warrant their attribution solely to hominin hunting? Besides hominin hunting, three methods of scavenging could have provided the large bovids butchered at FLK Zinj: first-access scavenging from non-predator-related accidents; late-access passive scavenging from lion (or other) kills; early-access aggressive scavenging from lion (or other) kills. We present new data on hunted prey from Hadza bow hunting (e.g., N = 50 impala; N = 18 greater kudu) near Lake Eyasi, Tanzania, and from San bow hunting (N = 13 gemsbok) in the Kalahari Desert, Botswana, documenting non-selective, living-structure profiles. We present new data on drowned wildebeest (N = 175) from Lake Masek, in the Serengeti, documenting many prime adults but also a significantly high percentage of old adults, unlike the profile at FLK Zinj. We also examine mortality profiles from modern African lions and from Old World Pleistocene archaeological sites, revealing that while prime-dominated profiles are present in some archaeological assemblages, particularly some Late Pleistocene European sites involving cervids, they are not documented from lion or other larger carnivore predation; moreover, living-structure profiles with prime adults representing similar to 50-60% of prey are common, particularly in African archaeological assemblages involving bovids hunted by humans. Although taphonomic bias, prey socioecology, and season of death may all influence mortality profiles, prime-dominated profiles require careful evaluation. The prime-dominated profile at FLK Zinj is significantly different from profiles formed by the three scavenging methods, which likely indicates hunting by Early Pleistocene Homo.

After 90 minutes of sunlight irradiation, the degradation efficiencies toward bisphenol A and phenol were 96% and 97%, respectively. Changes in sunlight due to the season and the calcination temperature and duration displayed weak influence on the degradation efficiencies for these two pollutants. Although the use of tap water, river water, lake water, and seawater exhibited a certain impact on the photocatalytic efficiency, the final removal efficiencies for bisphenol A and phenol in seawater still reached 89% and 90%, respectively. Moreover, the photocatalytic efficiencies toward bisphenol A and phenol remained above 91% and 86% during testing over five cycles. Superoxide groups (O-2(-)) and holes were the main active substances, while hydroxyl radicals (OH-) also played a certain role in photocatalysis. The charge-carrier concentration and mobility of beta-Bi2O3 were 4.82 x 10(21) cm(-3) and 4.0017 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), respectively, based on the Hall test. beta-Bi2O3 was an isotropic semiconductor based on first-principles calculations, and its excellent photocatalytic activity originated from the high electron mobility and moderate hole mobility. The bisphenol A and phenol degradation mechanisms on the beta-Bi2O3 surface were revealed based on adsorption model calculations. Finally, the reduction in total organic carbon content further verified the degradation of these two contaminants.

We performed a controlled fishing experiment targeting northern pike (Esox lucius) in a small (25 ha), weakly eutrophic natural lake situated about 80 km northeast of Berlin (Germany) to understand abiotic, biotic and gear-related factors that relate to catch rates and size of pike captured by angling. The experiment was conducted over two one-week long fishing campaigns where boat-based anglers randomly sampled across 30 pre-determined sites. Sites were systematically exposed to two standardized lure types (soft plastic shad or spoon). We found the catch rates of pike per 15 min to be significantly higher in shallow water and when soft plastic lures were used compared to deeper water and when spoons were used. Catch rates significantly dropped over the course of seven days, suggesting either learning or other reasons moving pike from vulnerable to invulnerable pools (e.g., due to stress caused by capture, sampling and release). Catch rates also varied by season and across anglers and sites as random effects. The variation in size of pike captured exhibited greater stochasticity than variation in catch rate. There was no lure effect on the size of the pike captured, but we found a seasonal effect and a day effect, suggesting larger fish were captured first. Pike captured in sublittoral areas were significantly smaller than those captured in other habitats. Overall, our study documented a novel effect of lure type on the catch rates of pike, but the explanatory power of the predictors was only moderate. Therefore, our results support the idea that the best fishing ingredients are investing time and maximizing encounter probabilities through habitat choice, with only moderate additional effects to be expected from attention to abiotic conditions, day time and choice of type of artificial lure.

However, estimations of the magnitude of global CH4 emissions from lakes may be highly biased owing to the uncertainties in data originating from observation times, methods, and parameterizations of the gas transfer velocity (k). Here, we conducted continuous 48-hour measurements of CH4 fluxes using the floating chamber method seasonally at Lake Baihua, a small reservoir in southwestern China, and compared the results with estimates derived from boundary layer models. Results showed that there was a weak dependency of k on wind speed, indicating that wind speed was not the major factor regulating gas exchange in such small lakes. It is thus concluded that the wind speed-dependent boundary layer model method is not suitable for CH4 flux observations in small and medium-sized lake, and that the floating chamber method is recommended for use instead. The measured CH4 fluxes displayed remarkably diurnal patterns, therefore the use of single observations to represent daily average values comes with unacceptably large uncertainties. A reasonable alternative is averaging observations made at sunrise and at sunset to represent daily values, which has a much smaller uncertainty (ranging from 0.8% to 13.6%). The coincident peaks of CH4 and chlorophyll concentrations in the subsurface indicate that CH4 originated mainly from aerobic methanogenesis. Solar radiation is likely one of the major factors regulating CH4 production and emissions in the lake through enhancing CH4 production, inhibiting CH4 oxidation, and probably changing hydrodynamics conditions. Therefore, irradiation should be taken into consideration as a key factor in observing CH4 fluxes in lakes. As sampling times are limited, observations during both sunny and cloudy weather should be proportionally included. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that solar radiation has been proposed as a key driver of CH4 emissions from lakes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lutz, K; Bahrami, Z; Braun, M				Lutz, Katrina; Bahrami, Zahra; Braun, Matthias			Supraglacial Lake Evolution over Northeast Greenland Using Deep Learning Methods	REMOTE SENSING												Supraglacial lakes in Greenland are highly dynamic hydrological features in which glacial meltwater cumulates, allowing for the loss and transport of freshwater from a glacial surface to the ocean or a nearby waterbody. Standard supraglacial lake monitoring techniques, specifically image segmentation, rely heavily on a series of region-dependent thresholds, limiting the adaptability of the algorithm to different illumination and surface variations, while being susceptible to the inclusion of false positives such as shadows. In this study, a supraglacial lake segmentation algorithm is developed for Sentinel-2 images based on a deep learning architecture (U-Net) to evaluate the suitability of artificial intelligence techniques in this domain. Additionally, a deep learning-based cloud segmentation tool developed specifically for polar regions is implemented in the processing chain to remove cloudy imagery from the analysis. Using this technique, a time series of supraglacial lake development is created for the 2016 to 2022 melt seasons over Nioghalvfjerdsbrae (79(circle) N Glacier) and Zachariae Isstrom in Northeast Greenland, an area that covers 26,302 km(2) and represents roughly 10% of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream. The total lake area was found to have a strong interannual variability, with the largest peak lake area of 380 km(2) in 2019 and the smallest peak lake area of 67 km(2) in 2018. These results were then compared against an algorithm based on a thresholding technique to evaluate the agreement of the methodologies. The deep learning-based time series shows a similar trend to that produced by a previously published thresholding technique, while being smoother and more encompassing of meltwater in higher-melt periods. Additionally, while not completely eliminating them, the deep learning model significantly reduces the inclusion of shadows as false positives. Overall, the use of deep learning on multispectral images for the purpose of supraglacial lake segmentation proves to be advantageous.					; Braun, Matthias/S-4693-2016; Braun, Matthias/A-4968-2009	Bahrami, Mahsa/0009-0007-7619-1383; Lutz, Katrina/0009-0009-8638-9769; Braun, Matthias/0000-0001-5169-1567														2072-4292				SEP	2023	15	17							4360	10.3390/rs15174360	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15174360													WOS:001065285000001
J	Moser, L; Schmitt, A; Wendleder, A; Roth, A				Moser, Linda; Schmitt, Andreas; Wendleder, Anna; Roth, Achim			Monitoring of the Lac Bam Wetland Extent Using Dual-Polarized X-Band SAR Data	REMOTE SENSING												Wetlands in semi-arid Africa are vital as water resource for local inhabitants and for biodiversity, but they are prone to strong seasonal fluctuations. Lac Bam is the largest natural freshwater lake in Burkina Faso, its water is mixed with patches of floating or flooded vegetation, and very turbid and sediment-rich. These characteristics as well as the usual cloud cover during the rainy season can limit the suitability of optical remote sensing data for monitoring purposes. This study demonstrates the applicability of weather-independent dual-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for the analysis of spatio-temporal wetland dynamics. A TerraSAR-X repeat-pass time series of dual-co-polarized HH-VV StripMap data-with intervals of 11 days, covering two years (2013-2015) from the rainy to the dry season-was processed to normalized Kennaugh elements and classified mono-temporally and multi-temporally. Land cover time series and seasonal duration maps were generated for the following four classes: open water, flooded/floating vegetation, irrigated cultivation, and land (non-wetland). The added value of dual-polarimetric SAR data is demonstrated by significantly higher multitemporal classification accuracies, where the overall accuracy (88.5%) exceeds the classification accuracy using single-polarimetric SAR intensity data (82.2%). For relevant change classes involving flooded vegetation and irrigated fields dual-polarimetric data (accuracies: 75%-97%) are favored to single-polarimetric data (42%-87%). This study contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of semi-arid African wetlands in terms of water areas including water with flooded vegetation, and the location and timing of irrigated cultivations.

Contrasting patterns of allochthony among three major groups of crustacean zooplankton in boreal and temperate lakes	ECOLOGY												The importance of terrestrial-derived organic matter for lake zooplankton communities remains debated, partly because little is known about the basic pathways by which allochthonous carbon is transferred to zooplankton, and whether these vary among the major taxonomic and functional groups. We quantified allochthony of three zooplankton groups (Cladocera, Calanoida, and Cyclopoida) across 18 lakes in Quebec, spanning broad gradients of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and lake trophy, using a multi-isotope (delta H-2 + delta C-13), multi-source (terrestrial, phytoplanktonic, benthic) approach. All three zooplankton groups had significant levels of allochthony, but differed greatly in their respective patterns across lakes. Allochthony in Calanoida and Cyclopoida was linked to detrital food chains based on particulate organic matter (POM) and on DOM, respectively, whereas in Cladocera it appeared related to both pathways; not surprisingly this latter group had the highest mean allochthony (0.31; compared to 0.18 in Cyclopoida and 0.16 in Calanoida). This study highlights the complexity of the pathways of delivery and transfer of terrestrial organic matter in freshwaters, and underscores the role that microbial food webs play in this transfer.

However, the mechanism between hydrological connectivity and water-related environment has not been revealed completely. To address these issues, we use a landscape connectivity approach to assess the connectivity of water patches for analyzing the hydrological connectivity of the Bosten Lake Basin (BLB), as well as its response to human activities and climate change, based on the Joint Research Centre (JRC) global surface water dataset. It shows that the integral index of connectivity (IIC) of the BLB is low (ranging from 0 to 0.2) from 1990 to 2019, with an increasing interannual trend. The connectivity is higher in wet periods and in oases compared with dry periods and high-altitude mountain regions. Correlation and regression analyses indicate that hydrological connectivity has a strong correlation (r > 0.5, p <= 0.05) with water area and water level. The interannual and seasonal trends of eight hydrochemical indices in the Bosten Lake have been investigated to systematically elaborate the complex relationships between hydrological connectivity and water quality in the BLB. Results indicated that better hydrological connectivity can improve water quality, and the minimum of pollutants were observed in high hydrological connectivity period, covering approximately 75% of the high-water quality period. These findings could provide scientific support for the water management in the BLB.					zhiyi, li/P-6695-2016; Chen, Ya-Ning/E-4847-2015; Huang, Wenjing/JAN-8962-2023	Fang, Gonghuan/0000-0002-1320-1835; Liu, Yongchang/0000-0003-0644-895X; Zhou, Honghua/0000-0002-4370-3609														2072-4292				OCT	2022	14	19							4977	10.3390/rs14194977	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14194977													WOS:000867085100001

This study compared the trophic niche differentiations of Neogobius melanostomus and Ponticola kessleri in the upper Danube River using stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15), gut content analyses and morphometric analyses of the digestive tract. Both species were identified as predacious omnivores with high dietary overlap and a generalistic feeding strategy. Amphipods (especially invasive Dikerogammarus spp.) contributed 2/3 to the index of food importance. delta N-15-signatures of N. melanostomus revealed an ontogenetic diet shift and significantly exceeded those in P. kessleri by similar to 1.5aEuro degrees, indicating a niche separation of half a trophic level. P. kessleri had shorter uncoiled intestinal tracts than N. melanostomus, indicating a narrower niche and adaptation to animal food. Trophic niches in both species expanded during the growth period with increasing intraguild predation and cannibalism in P. kessleri and increasing molluscivory in N. melanostomus. P. kessleri showed a higher degree of specialization and more stable feeding patterns across seasons, whereas N. melanostomus adapted its diet according to the natural prey availability. The feeding patterns of both species observed in the upper Danube River strongly differ from those in their native ranges, underlining their great plasticity. Both goby species consumed mainly other non-native species (similar to 92% of gut contents) and seemed to benefit from previous invasions of prey species like Dikerogammarus villosus. The invasive success of gobies and their prey mirror fundamental ecological changes in large European freshwater ecosystems.					; Geist, Juergen/C-4933-2008; Auerswald, Karl/C-5186-2008; Cerwenka, Alexander/ABF-3106-2020	Auerswald, Karl/0000-0001-5275-4320; Geist, Juergen/0000-0001-7698-3443; Cerwenka, Alexander/0000-0002-9393-0885													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2013	703	1					113	131		10.1007/s10750-012-1349-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1349-9													WOS:000312782000009

We carried out a detailed seasonal study of water chemistry, zooplankton diet, and MeHg accumulation in zooplankton in two lakes with contrasting tOM concentrations. Between-lake differences explained 51% of the variability in our water chemistry data, with no observed effect of season or sampling depth, contrary to our expectations. Higher tOM was correlated with higher aqueous Hg concentrations, lower areal pelagic primary productivity, and an increased contribution of terrestrial particles to pelagic particulate organicmatter. Based on dietary marker analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15, and fatty acid [FA] composition), zooplankton diet was strongly linked to feeding mechanism, with dietary reliance on phytoplankton highest in the selective-feeding calanoid copepods, and lowest in filter feeding cladocerans. Zooplankton dietary reliance on phytoplankton and their concentrations of high-quality lipids, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, were higher in the clear-water lake than in the brown-water lake, where bacterial and terrestrial food sources were more prevalent. MeHg was highest in zooplankton from the brown-water lake, with highest concentrations in the 200-500 mu m zooplankton size fraction for both lakes. Contrary to our expectations, there was no effect of season on zooplankton dietary markers or MeHg. Our results suggest that, overall, higher tOM results in higher MeHg concentrations in water and zooplankton, and reduces zooplankton dietary reliance on phytoplankton. Increased tOM thus leads to a decrease in the nutritional quality of zooplankton (i.e. higher MeHg concentrations, and lower concentrations of essential fatty acids), which may cascade up the food web with negative implications for higher trophic levels.

The turbidity of different water surfaces and its response mechanisms to regional climatic factors and human activities in the Yangtze River Delta Region (YRDR), an important rapid economic development region in China, remain poorly understood. To enhance the knowledge of turbidity variations and dominant drivers of YRDR water surfaces, a complete long-term turbidity series was obtained using Landsat images from 1990 to 2020. The results show that the turbidity trend differed from-1.3 NTU/yr to 0.7 NTU/yr in different water surfaces. Turbidity decreased significantly in the mainstream of the Yangtze River (MYR), aquaculture ponds (AP) and other water bodies, whilst increasing significantly in the medium lakes (ML) and mainstream of the Qiantang River (MQR). Meanwhile, no significant changes in turbidity were observed in the great lakes (GL) and small lakes (SL). Rather than climatic factors, urbanisation and decreasing wastewater discharge were the dominant drivers of turbidity trends during the study period. In addition, ecological engineering in AP increased water transparency. The Three Gorges Dam also decreased turbidity in MYR. Increasing turbidity in the downstream of MQR was driven by increasing seasonal water surfaces and reclamation projects near Hangzhou Bay. GL faced no significant increase in turbidity due to the offset of afforestation to urbanisation induced turbidity increase. These findings provide important information for government decision-making for subsequent aquatic environmental protection and restoration in the YRDR.

J	Fahl, K; Stein, R				Fahl, Kirsten; Stein, Ruediger			Modern seasonal variability and deglacial/Holocene change of central Arctic Ocean sea-ice cover: New insights from biomarker proxy records	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												For the reconstruction of sea-ice variability, a biomarker approach which is based on (1) the determination of sea-ice diatom-specific highly-branched isoprenoid (IP25) and (2) the coupling of phytoplankton biomarkers and IP25 has been used. For the first time, such a data set was obtained from an array of two sediment traps deployed at the southern Lomonosov Ridge in the central Arctic Ocean at water depth of 150 m and 1550 m and recording the seasonal variability of sea ice cover in 1995/1996. These data indicate a predominantly permanent sea ice cover at the trap location between November 1995 and June 1996, an ice-edge situation with increased phytoplankton productivity and sea-ice algae input in July/August 1996, and the start of new-ice formation in late September. The record of modern sea-ice variability is then used to better interpret data from sediment core PS2458-4 recovered at the Laptev Sea continental slope close to the interception with Lomonosov Ridge and recording the post-glacial to Holocene change in sea-ice cover. Based on IP25 and phytoplankton biomarker data from Core PS2458-4, minimum sea-ice cover was reconstructed for the Bolling/Allerod warm interval between about 14.5 and 13 calendar kyr BP, followed by a rapid and distinct increase in sea-ice cover at about 12.8 calendar kyr BP. This sea-ice event was directly preceded by a dramatic freshwater event and a collapse of phytoplankton productivity, having started about 100 years earlier. These data are the first direct evidence that enhanced freshwater flux caused enhanced sea-ice formation in the Arctic at the beginning of the Younger Dryas. In combination with a contemporaneous, abrupt and very prominent freshwater/meltwater pulse in the Yermak Plateau/Fram Strait area these data may furthermore support the hypothesis that strongly enhanced freshwater (and ice) export from the Arctic into the North Atlantic could have played an important trigger role for the onset of the Younger Dryas cold reversal. During the Early Holocene, sea-ice cover steadily increased again (ice-edge situation), reaching modern sea-ice conditions (more or less permanent sea-ice cover) probably at about 7-8 calendar kyr BP.

S	Starinsky, A; Katz, A		Garfunkel, Z; BenAvraham, Z; Kagan, E		Starinsky, Abraham; Katz, Amitai			The Story of Saline Water in the Dead Sea Rift - The Role of Runoff and Relative Humidity	DEAD SEA TRANSFORM FAULT SYSTEM: REVIEWS	Modern Approaches in Solid Earth Sciences											Saline waters have been found in the subsurface of the Dead Sea basin along the area stretching from Lake Kinneret in the north to the Timna area in the south. The maximum salinity of the waters reaches 340 g L-1, and their chemical composition is Ca-chloridic, like most subsurface brines in sedimentary basins elsewhere. It is now generally accepted that such waters evolved from ancient seawater via a three-stage mechanism, namely: (1) seawater evaporation in a marine lagoon; (2) modification of the resulting brine by water-rock interaction; (3) dilution of the brine by freshwater or mixing with other saline fluids. The age of the parental seawater from which the salinity of the brines was derived is Late Miocene to Early Pliocene. All saline waters in the Dead Sea basin display Na/Cl ratios below that of seawater (0.86), indicating that their evolution should be tied to formation of rock salt bodies; indeed, such were actually found in the subsurface of the two tectonic depressions of the Dead Sea and Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee). It is likely that the ancient lagoon from which the seawater evaporated and in which the salt deposited was approximately 300 km long and 20 km wide. The Na/Cl ratios in the brines and in fluid inclusions in halite crystals formed from these waters cover a wide range below the seawater value (0.86), reaching values as low as 0.1 eq/eq (All solute ratios in the paper are presented in equivalent units unless otherwise stated). The maximum degree of evaporation that an aqueous solution may reach depends, amongst other things, on the relative humidity. Because evaporation may proceed only as long as the activity of water in the evaporating solution (a(H2O)) is higher than the relative humidity above it, it is possible to estimate the maximum relative humidity that prevailed in the area during the deposition of the salt from the Na/Cl ratio in a given brine or in fluid inclusion enclosed in a halite sample. The Pliocene lagoon waters that, at that stage, had high Mg/Ca ratios, started to migrate outwards from the basin towards the west, under the local hydraulic head, through the Judea group limestone layers of upper Cretaceous age which comprise in that area the margin of the basin. During their passage, the brines interacted with limestone beds resulting in discordant dolomite bodies. The resulting, brine accumulated at depth in the Northern Negev. Upon decline of the regional hydraulic head, the waters that infiltrated out to the west reversed their flow backwards to the basin, now displaying a chemical composition significantly different than that on their way out. The newly acquired -composition is thus characterized by low Mg/Ca and SO4/Cl ratios, of similar to 0.5 and similar to 0.01, respectively, and is defined as R-1 water. At some later time the lagoon was cut off from the sea, and its area was -transformed to a lacustrine environment, allowing for other processes to take place which modified the composition of the lagoonal brines. As from the lagoon's cut off from the sea, the contribution of dissolved marine salts to the basin was substituted by freshwater solutes carried in by runoff. The freshwater that started to feed the saline lake(s) was saturated with respect to CaCO3 minerals (calcite and aragonite), deposited its entire load of dissolved Ca2+ as CaCO3 and CaSO4 in the lake. Additional Ca2+ to compensate for the excess SO4 + HCO3 over Ca2+ was borrowed from the saline, Ca-chloridic brine in the lake, bringing about a marked increase in the Mg/Ca ratio therein. The present paper presents a model (Katz and Starinsky, Aquat Geochem 15: 159-194, 2009) that describes the relation between the increase in the Mg/Ca ratio of the lake and the accumulated mass of CaCO3 (calcite or aragonite) that was deposited in it. The evolving saline waters affected by this process, with Mg/Ca ratios >1, are defined as group R2 waters. An additional, significant modification of the brine inflicted by its passage from a marine lagoon to a lacustrine water body is reflected by the Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratio. We inspect two cases relevant to this question, the first in the Lake Kinneret area and the second in the Dead Sea basin. The R-2 lacustrine waters on the eastern side of Lake Kinneret show Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios around 0.706, contrasting in this regard with the R1-type waters on the western side of the lake which are characterized by Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios of similar to 0.708. We propose that the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio transition 0.708 -> 0.706 is driven by addition of freshwater with low Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.704-0.707) originating in the runoff flowing to the lake over the basaltic terrain from the NE (Sr-87/Sr-86 similar to 0.704). In the southern, Dead Sea area, the lacustrine R-2 waters were fed by runoff with Sr-87/Sr-86 similar to 0.708 and, therefore, remained unchanged in this respect. The Timna water composition is a result of interaction between diluted -subsurface Ca chloride brines that originated as group R-S1 in the Dead Sea area with basic igneous rocks. The depletion of Mg2+ in the water is due to a reaction of destruction of Ca-plagioclase and formation of Mg2+ rich mixture of epidote and chlorite. The Sr isotope signature of similar to 0.706 was formed by exchange of high 87Sr/86Sr (similar to 0.708) brines with low Sr-87/(8)6Sr (similar to 0.7045) igneous basic rocks, like olivine norite. The age of the water-rock interaction is estimated to be older than the R-s brine formation, i.e. <3-4 m.y.																			1876-1682		978-94-017-8872-4; 978-94-017-8871-7				2014	6						317	353		10.1007/978-94-017-8872-4_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8872-4_11	10.1007/978-94-017-8872-4												WOS:000343087700012

This study used Landsat collection and annual average climate data from the growing season to investigate the efficacy of established land management policies to restore degraded land and reverse the aeolian desertification process in the Shiyang river basin between 1974 and 2020. The time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) results revealed that greening and browning trend patterns depend on climatic conditions in rangelands and water allocation management systems in farmlands. Thanks to land rehabilitation and watershed management projects, farmland has been extended to 3.1%, shifting sand area has been reduced to 9.2%, and water in Qingtu lake area re-emergedfrom 0 to 17.05 Km(2) in the early 2010 s. Built-up areas also extended to 87.05 km2 between 2010 and 2020 due to extensive construction of solar power panels in the area. The severity of desertification is profoundly linked to climate and land-use management systems in the Shiyang river basin. Moreover, the ADL area declined from 14.65% to 10.74% of the entire river basin, where intensity has steadily reversed in several basin parts, mainly in the middle reach. Around 2248 km(2) of land were entirely rehabilitated, 2298 km(2) remained steady, 1706 km(2) exhibited a reverse in desertification intensity, 199 km2 degraded, and 277 km2 of land were newly turned into ADL between 1974 and 2020, with a large portion of degraded land occurred in the lower reach of the Basin. These findings highlight land management contribution, rational water allocation, and conservation measures to reverse desertification and maintain a sustainable ecosystem despite climate change impacts and water resources shortage in the Shiyang river basin. This research will help decision-makers set up novel land management programs for better eco-environment development in the future.

Provenance, stratigraphy and chronology of Holocene tephra from Vestfiroir, Iceland	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												Tephrochronology facilitates the interpretation and correlation of terrestrial and marine paleoclimate records in and around Iceland. The Holocene tephra record on the Vestfiro ir peninsula has until now been poorly known. Based on detailed analysis of major element chemistry, we present a holistic tephra stratigraphy and chronology (n = 30) generated from four lakes located on northeastern Vestfiroir. Key markers are Tv-3, the 10 ka Grimsvotn tephra series along with the Hekla VF, Katla EG, Hekla T, Hekla 4 (intermediate component) and Hekla 3 (intermediate component), Snaefellsjokull-1, Landnam (basalt and rhyolite), Katla 920, Hekla 1693 and Baroarbunga 1716 tephra layers. Notably, we also document two early Holocene intermediate tephra from the Hekla volcano, the oldest yet identified. Imperfections in the continuity of tephra records between lakes indicate gaps produced by either variable ash plume trajectories or periodic ice coverage (glacier or seasonal) of the lakes. The northernmost lake, Skorarvatn, archives three tephra layers consistent with the 10 ka Grimsvotn tephra layer series formed by eruptions in the same time frame as the well-known Saksunarvatn tephra from the Faroe Islands. Radiocarbon-dated macrofossils bounding Skorarvatn's upper and basal tephra layers from the 10 ka series indicate that they were produced by at least three large, successive eruptions from Grimsvotn over similar to 240 years. The composite Vestfiroir tephra stratigraphy and chronology presented here will enable better age control and synchronization between paleoclimate records in the northern North Atlantic.

After the Project began operating in 2013, eutrophication in the lake has created increasing public concern regarding the direct effect on water quality from the project. In this paper, we used multivariate statistical methods to examine the variances between water quality variables at four site groups (inlets and outlets in the study area) and during three seasons (wet, normal, and dry seasons) in Eastern Hongze Lake. We also used redundancy analysis (RDA) to analyze environmental factors' impact on water quality. We found that (1) the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus were exceeding the standard values; (2) No significant spatial heterogeneity regarding nitrogen and phosphorus among the inlet/outlet of Eastern Hongze Lake existed in normal and wet seasons, and there was no evidence demonstrating that SNWDP-ER could improve eutrophication or even contribute to eutrophication in the dry season; (3) Environmental factors (land use, water diversion, and population) have limited influences on water quality, which was possibly caused by the overly-high river input and artificial input of nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, it is critical to reinforce the control of pollution sources and enhance the ecological restoration.																			2071-1050					JUN	2018	10	6							1885	10.3390/su10061885	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10061885													WOS:000436570100197

Additionally, total silver was measured in sludge of the WWTP and in water, sediment, and fish of the receiving lake at several points with varying distance to the discharge point and compared to a reference lake. We used a novel single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS, with microsecond time resolution) protocol to detect SCN in environmental samples in addition to total elemental analysis by ICP-MS/OES (optical emission spectrometry), and histological analysis by dark-field microscopy. Total silverwas below the limit of quantification in the WWTP influent and effluent, and in lake water and fishes, except for one influent sample. However, comparably high silver concentrations were detected in the sludge, irrespective of the season, indicating accumulation of silver. Furthermore, SP-ICP-MS analysis of influent samples confirmed the presence of SCN. Despite the high removal efficiency of silver and SCN from the wastewater, high silver concentrations were measured in the sediment near the discharge point, suggesting a constant silver input into the lake. Silver and SCN levels were lower than concentrations leading to adverse effects in recently published toxicological studies, thus the investigated lake ecosystem is currently not at risk.

J	Johnson, NS; Snow, B; Bruning, T; Jubar, A				Johnson, Nicholas S.; Snow, Brian; Bruning, Tyler; Jubar, Aaron			A seasonal electric barrier blocks invasive adult sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and reduces production of larvae	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control is achieved in the Laurentian Great Lakes by applying lamprey-specific pesticides (lampricides) to habitats containing larval sea lamprey. Lampricide treatments cost less and are more effective in watersheds where dams block adult sea lamprey migration and limit larval distribution relative to watersheds with no barriers to migration. However, dams impound water and can block movement of valued fishes, outcomes that are untenable for some stakeholders. Here, a seasonal and non-physical barrier of pulsed direct electrical current was tested to block adult sea lamprey while also monitoring the movement and mortality of non-target fish species. The electric barrier was operated in the Black Mallard River, a tributary to northern Lake Huron, March through August 2016-2018. The electric field blocked adult sea lamprey; 1056 adult sea lamprey were captured downstream of the electric field and two were captured upstream of the electric barrier over the three-year study. In 2018, larval sea lamprey abundance upstream of the barrier was about 50% less than historical averages, and genetic analysis found that roughly 98% of larvae upstream of the barrier were spawned in years prior to barrier installation. When the barrier was electrified, non-target fish species were blocked, and a small percentage (<3%) were killed. This study demonstrated that a seasonally deployed electric barrier can reduce the abundance of larval sea lamprey upstream without impounding water, but effects on the movements and survival of other fish species remain a concern.

The prominent eco-environmental problems, such as eutrophication and accidental deterioration in water quality, restrict reservoir construction. Compared to natural lakes, reservoirs have specific geologic backgrounds and eco-environmental characteristics, which manifest in the following aspects: (a) the origin of the water environment and ecological system of the reservoir is different from natural lakes; (b) sediment is rich in organic matter and nutrients; (c) water eutrophication and heavy metal pollution are tightly interlocked; (d) multi-interface and seasonal stratification control the key physicochemical and biological processes; (e) the cumulative effect of the material cycle has an important influence on the water environment and ecological security; (f) artificial regulation of water level leads to the ecological degradation of the hydro-fluctuation belt; and (g) the slow response of the aquatic ecosystem to the reduction of external load. Research on the eco-environment of sub-deep water reservoirs trails that of natural lakes in China. After describing the eco-environmental characteristics of reservoirs in China, we address potential challenges and propose future research directions to develop a full understanding of the complex biogeochemical processes prevalent in reservoirs.					jianyang, guo/N-9506-2019	Yang, Haiquan/0000-0003-4826-8199													0309-1333	1477-0296				APR	2018	42	2					185	201		10.1177/0309133317751844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309133317751844													WOS:000430336100003

Measurements using gas traps indicated very high ebullition rates, but due to the stochastic nature of ebullition a mass balance approach was crucial to deduce system-wide methane sources and losses. Methane diffusion from the sediment was generally low and seasonally stable and did not account for the high concentration of dissolved methane measured in the reservoir discharge. A strong positive correlation between water temperature and the observed dissolved methane concentration enabled us to quantify the dissolved methane addition from bubble dissolution using a system-wide mass balance. Finally, knowing the contribution due to bubble dissolution, we used a bubble model to estimate bubble emission directly to the atmosphere. Our results indicated that the total methane emission from Lake Wohlen was on average >150 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), which is the highest ever documented for a midlatitude reservoir. The substantial temperature-dependent methane emissions discovered in this 90-year-old reservoir indicate that temperate water bodies can be an important but overlooked methane source.

Environmental DNA as a detection tool for zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) at the forefront of an invasion event in Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS					2nd Freshwater Invasives - Networking for Strategy II (FINS-II) Conference	JUL 11-14, 2016	Zagreb, CROATIA	Univ Zagreb, European Inland Fisheries & Aquaculture Advisory Commiss				Zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771), an invasive bivalve in North America, was first recorded in Lake Winnipeg in 2013. Quagga mussel D. bugensis (Andrusov, 1897), a second invasive mussel to North America, has yet to be detected in Manitoba waters. The establishment and continued spread of zebra mussels is of concern. Accordingly, we developed two species-specific and one Dreissena-specific qPCR-based environmental DNA (eDNA) assays designed as a single multiplexed reaction able to identify the presence of zebra mussel and infer the presence of quagga mussel in water samples from at-risk and invaded locations. In 2014, samples were collected from four invaded harbours on Lake Winnipeg during the early (May) and late (October) seasons. Zebra mussel eDNA was detected in 0-33.3% of samples per site early in the season, whereas late season sample detection ranged from 42.9 to 100%. In order to confirm that there was no nonspecific amplification of DNA from local biota, samples were also collected from sites where neither adult nor veliger-stage zebra mussels had been previously observed. These sites included three harbours on Lake Winnipeg and six sites within the Manitoban portion of the Red River. No amplification of eDNA was recorded at these sites except for that at a float-plane dock in the Red River upstream of Lake Winnipeg. Zebra mussels were subsequently detected at this location by sampling for transformed attached individuals. Thus, we demonstrate that eDNA is an early indicator of the presence of zebra mussels and is a useful detection tool at the forefront of their recent invasion in Manitoba. This work provides the foundation for the development of a zebra mussel eDNA monitoring program for waterbodies in Manitoba and western Canada.

Twenty-eight river water and 22 groundwater samples collected in four major cities and 14 river water samples from the Red River were screened to investigate the occurrence and sources of 16 PFAAs. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were the most prevalent of 11 detected PFAAs with maximum concentrations in urban river water of 5.3, 18 and 0.93 ng L-1, respectively, and in groundwater of 8.2, 4.5 and 0.45 ng L-1, respectively. PFAAs in the Red River water were detected at low levels. PFAA concentrations in river water were higher in the rainy season than in the dry season, possibly due to storm water runoff, a common phenomenon in Southeast Asian countries. The highest concentrations of PFAAs in river water were observed in samples from highly populated and industrialized areas, perhaps sourced from sewage. The PFAA concentrations observed were similar to those in other Southeast Asian countries, but lower than in developed nations. From the composition profiles of PFAAs, industrial products containing PFAAs imported from China and Japan might be one of the major sources of PFAAs in the Vietnamese aquatic environment. According to the health-based values and advisory issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the concentrations of detected PFAAs in this study do not pose an immediate health risk to humans and aquatic organisms.

Density-dependent and phenological mismatch effects on growth and survival in lesser snow and Ross's goslings	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Strong seasonality of high-latitude environments imposes temporal constraints on forage availability and quality for keystone herbivores in terrestrial arctic ecosystems, including hyper-abundant colonial geese. Changes in food quality due to intraspecific competition, or food availability relative to the breeding phenology of birds, may have consequences for growth and survival of young. We used long-term data (1993-2014) from the Karrak Lake nesting colony in the Canadian central arctic to study relative roles of density and phenological mismatch (i.e. days between seasonal peaks in vegetation quality and hatching) as drivers of annual variations in gosling survival among lesser snow Anser caerulescens caerulescens and Ross's geese A. rossii. Survival of Ross's goslings was consistently higher compared to snow geese. For both species, annual gosling survival was greatest when phenological mismatch was minimal and when nesting population size was low. We also examined gosling structural size (1999-2014) in relation to density and mismatch hypotheses to understand whether changes in survival were preceded by a parallel response in growth stemming from a density-dependent effect on annual forage conditions. After controlling for sex, age and random effects of capture group and year x species, structural size of both snow and Ross's goslings was reduced in years when phenological mismatch was greater. However, there was no significant evidence that body size of goslings was negatively related to breeding population size at the colony. Our results lend support to the notion that both broad-scale changes in seasonality from observed and predicted warming in the arctic and, to a lesser extent, density-dependence on brood-rearing areas may result in changes to offspring quality or survival, with implications for population recruitment.					; Douglas, David/AAU-1087-2021	Ross, Megan/0000-0001-8926-4464; Douglas, David/0000-0003-0186-1104													0908-8857	1600-048X				DEC	2018	49	12							e01748	10.1111/jav.01748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.01748													WOS:000454115400001

However, issue on the dominant drivers of this water loss has not been well addressed. In this work, variations in water area and water level of the Lake Dalinor during the period 1984-2018 were tracked using the satellite altimetry and Landsat images. Dominant drivers for the derived variations were then investigated based on the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) analysis and the Vegetation Interface Processes model. Results showed that both the water area and water level displayed a two-stage variation with a slightly increasing trend before 2000 and a drastic decline since 2000 (p< 0.01). The SPEI analysis revealed a close relationship between water level variations and the cumulative water anomalies at seasonal and annual scales. The model-based attribution analysis suggested that climate change and anthropogenic impacts contributed 76.5% and 23.5% of the observed declining trend, respectively. Climate warming and drying dominated the water level decline since 2000, while the large-scale conversion from the natural grassland to the seeded pasture might have accelerated this water loss process. This study confirmed the prominent impacts of climate warming and drying on the lake desiccation in the semi-arid Mongolian Plateau and highlighted the gradually intensifying impacts of human activities such as grassland conversion on the lake water budget.

Riverine characteristics and adult demography influence female lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) spawning behavior, reproductive success, and ovarian quality	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Abiotic conditions and demographic factors can influence the timing of spawning. Behavioral plasticity allows females to select spawning conditions that are conducive to offspring development; however, reproductive costs associated with delaying spawning are not well understood. In this study, factors influencing timing of female spawning, residence time (RT), and reproductive success (RS) during two seasons were determined, and plasma testosterone concentrations were used to quantify atretic rates in a wild, lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) population. For the 123 females monitored, RT ranged from 1 to 23 days and was influenced by arrival date, temperature, discharge, and male number, with the latter having the largest influence. RS varied due to arrival date, temperature, discharge, male number, male length, and operational sex ratio. Two females had testosterone levels indicative of atresia and RS estimates lower than yearly means; however, most females had normal ovaries, suggesting little reproductive costs of plasticity in spawning ground residency time. Results demonstrate the multitude of factors influencing female reproductive behavior and RS, highlighting the importance of abiotic and demographic conditions to recruitment in wild populations.

J	Liu, X; Teubner, K; Chen, YW				Liu, Xia; Teubner, Katrin; Chen, Yuwei			Water quality characteristics of Poyang Lake, China, in response to changes in the water level	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												As one of the few remaining lakes that are freely connected with the Yangtze River, Poyang Lake exhibits large annual water level (WL) fluctuations. In this study, weekly samples were collected at the north end of Poyang Lake from September 2011 to December 2012, and we investigated the mechanism of limnological responses to fluctuations in the WL. The study covers three seasons that were associated with WL fluctuations ranging from 8 to 19 m. Spearman's rank correlations and multivariate non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses indicated that low and high WL periods differed in a number of water quality characteristics. The low WL period coincided with the non-growing season and was associated with the peak concentrations of nitrogen, the highest turbidity (Turb), and the lowest water temperature. The high WL period was mainly characterized by enhanced chlorophyll a concentration. Spearman's rank correlations revealed positive relationships between the WL and the concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P and negative relationships between the WL and the Turb, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, NO2-N, and NH4-N concentrations. All results support the conclusion that the large WL fluctuations are the principal drivers for physicochemical variables in this floodplain lake ecosystem.					; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021; 陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023	Liu, Xia/0000-0002-6225-9179; Teubner, Katrin/0000-0002-3699-2043; 													1998-9563	2224-7955				DEC	2016	47			1			238	248		10.2166/nh.2016.209	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2016.209													WOS:000391003300017

Comparative analysis of free-living and particle-associated bacterial communities of Lake Baikal during the ice-covered period	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Free-living (FLC) and particle-associated (PAC) bacterial communities contribute differentially to the cycling of matter in the environment. In this work we have for the first time studied the taxonomic composition and diversity of FLC and PAC in the oligotrophic freshwater Lake Baikal during the under-ice plankton peak. The communities on the bottom ice surface and in the water column under the ice were studied. Analysis by light microscopy showed that the bottom surface of the ice was dominated by green algae Chlorella spp. A complex of microalgae developed in the water column: green algae Monoraphidium griffithii, Monoraphidium contortum, Chlorella spp., chrysophyte Dinobryon cylindricum, haptophyte Chrysochromulina parva, and diatom Synedra acus. Algal abundance on the ice sub-surface was several orders of magnitude higher than that in the water column. According to pyrosequencing data of the bacterial 16S rRNA V3-V4 region, diversity of FLC (as measured by Shannon, Simpson, Chao1 and ACE indices) was higher than that of PAC. Proteobacteria (Burkholderiaceae) dominated the FLC associated with ice; FLC of the water column under ice were dominated by Actinobacteria (Sporichthyaceae and Ilumatobacteraceae) and Verrucomicrobia (Methylacidiphilaceae). PAC associated with ice were dominated by Bacteroidetes (Flavobacteriaceae), while water column-associated PAC were dominated by Verrucomicrobia (FukuN18_freshwater_group, Methylacidiphilaceae) and cyanobacteria (Cyanobiaceae). The difference between free-living and particle-associated, as well as between water column and ice sub-surface bacterial communities, were explored on operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and phylotype levels.

Therefore, the present study aims to numerically simulate three seasonal Rt scenarios based on a calibrated hydrodynamic numerical model (SisbaHiA) applied to a representative stretch of the lower Amazon River. The following methodological steps were performed: (a) establishing experimental water flow in natural channels; (b) statistically test numerical predictions (tidal range cycles for different hydrologic periods); and (c) simulating velocity fields and water discharge associated with Rt numerical outputs of the hydrodynamic model varied from 14 <= Rt <= 22 days among different seasonal periods. This change has shown the significant influence of hydrologic period and geomorphological features on Rt. Rt, in its turn, has shown significant spatial heterogeneity, depending on location and stretch of the channels. Comparative analyses between simulated and experimental parameters evidenced statistical correlations higher than 0.9. We conclude that the generated Rt scenarios were consistent with other similar studies in the literature. Therefore, they depicted the applicability of the hydrodynamics to the conservation of the Amazonian aquatic ecosystem, as well as its relevance for biochemical and pollutant dispersion studies, which still remain scarce in the literature.					; Da Cunha, Alan/KBC-3017-2024	medeiros de abreu, carlos henrique/0000-0003-0904-8791; brito, daimio/0000-0003-3657-6530														2073-4441				MAR	2020	12	3							660	10.3390/w12030660	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12030660													WOS:000529249500045

To quantify the water transparency the attenuation coefficient, k(d), of the photosynthetically active radiation - PAR, k(d)(PAR), the euphotic zone depth (Z(eu)) and the Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) are used. There is no investigation using satellite data about the water transparency for inland waters dominated by the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), an optical significant substance (OSS) of dissolved organic matter and an important water quality indicator that affect the primary production, and its relation with Chl-a. Therefore, six models, among them empirical and semi-analytical, were evaluated for Z(eu) and one semi-analytical model was considered for Z(SD). The errors (unbiased absolute percentage error, epsilon - 30%) of empirical and semi-analytical models for Z(eu) estimations were similar; and an empirical model using k(d)(490) from Zhao et al. (2013) had the best performance (epsilon - 16%). The semi-analytical model from Lee et al. (2015) to estimate Z(SD) presented an error of 57%. The spatial distributions of Z(eu) and Z(SD) provided the observation of a seasonal pattern of water transparency parameters, with high values in dry season, when the OSS concentrations reduced.					; Bernardo do Carmo, Nariane/C-3284-2015; Pequeno, Thanan/AAD-8287-2019; Alcantara, Enner/H-4286-2012	Bernardo, Nariane/0000-0002-8292-3102; Alcantara, Enner/0000-0002-7777-2119													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2020	110								105848	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105848	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105848													WOS:000507381800015

Earlier research has focused on statistical models of shallow lakes and process-based dynamic models for coastal wetlands. However, process-based dynamic modeling for shallow lakes remains relatively incomplete, and the loss of biomass in unsuitable situations is seldom considered. This study established an occupied habitat model by coupling a cellular automaton with a modified logistic function. The cellular automaton was used to simulate the spatial diffusion of the reed. The logistic function was used to simulate the accumulation of biomass over time, and modified with the loss of biomass in unsuitable habitats. Both reed distribution and dynamic variations in reed growth can be simulated by this model. Water level was considered the most important factor in reed growth. In Baiyangdian Lake, China, the growing season is from April to October. The suitable habitat area (SHA) and aboveground biomass (AGB) of reeds were simulated using data from actual hydrological processes and hypothetical scenarios. Element contents and water consumption by transpiration were estimated on the basis of the AGB data. The results are as follows. (1) Water-level changes affected the habitat of the common reed. The SHA increased slightly (from 6.0 m) and then decreased with rising water level, reaching its maximum value at 6.7 m of the 90 % guarantee rate water level. SHA declined rapidly when the water level was higher than 7.5 m. (2) When the water level was maintained at 6.3-7.3 m, the water consumption for transpiration per unit AGB was lower than that for other water levels. (3) To maintain a higher water level for a suitable reed habitat area and to reduce water consumption per unit biomass transpiration, a reference value of 6.7 m can be regarded as the lowest ecological water level in Baiyangdian Lake.					; Zhou, Yang/HJA-9545-2022; Yang, Zhifeng/AFL-3211-2022; Yang, Yufeng/ABS-0346-2022	Zhou, Yang/0000-0002-2202-2388; Yi, Yujun/0000-0002-5264-4321; Xie, Hongyi/0000-0003-2705-8061; 													0304-3800	1872-7026				MAR 1	2020	419								108938	10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.108938	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.108938													WOS:000518669200006

However, the character of the interrelation between bacterioplankton dynamics and the lake trophic state remained obscure. The long-term (1995-2015) monitoring data were carried out to examine the relations between bacterial parameters (abundance, biomass, and cell biovolume) and main hydroecological factors (chlorophyll, phosphorus, nitrogen, organic matter) in three water bodies: Lake Batorino, Lake Myastro, and Lake Naroch, which differ by trophic state. The results of the analysis of the data show that the growth of the chlorophyll-based trophic state index (TSIchi) as well as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total phosphorus (TP) and 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) in the chain Lake Naroch - Lake Myastro - Lake Batorino is accompanied by a linear increase in the bacterioplankton abundance, while fluctuations of bacterioplankton abundances and trophic state parameters in each of the Naroch Lakes are not correlated with each other. It is shown that temperature is the factor, which impacts seasonal bacterioplankton dynamics. The ratio of the time-averaged abundance of bacteria in July to the time-averaged abundance of bacteria in May remains virtually unchanged compared to the ratio between July and October. However, similar ratios for chlorophyll-a undergo significant changes. This result leaves room for further investigation of the factors, which can influence trophic state of the lakes, on the assumption that bacterial abundance is considered as an invariant measure.

J	Lara, MJ; Chipman, ML; Hu, FS				Lara, Mark J.; Chipman, Melissa L.; Hu, Feng Sheng			Automated detection of thermoerosion in permafrost ecosystems using temporally dense Landsat image stacks	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenic climate change has been linked to the degradation of permafrost across northern ecosystems, with notable implications for regional to global carbon dynamics. However, our understanding of the spatial distribution, temporal trends, and seasonal timing of episodic landscape deformation events triggered by permafrost degradation is hampered by the limited spatial and temporal coverage of high-resolution optical, RADAR, LIDAR, and hyperspectral remote sensing products. Here we present an automated approach for detecting permafrost degradation (thermoerosion), using meso-scale high-frequency remote sensing products (i.e., Landsat image archive). This approach was developed, tested, and applied in the ice-rich lowlands of the Noatak National Preserve (NOAT; 12,369 km(2)) in northwestern Alaska. We identified thermoerosion (TE) by capturing the spectral signal associated with episodic sediment plumes in adjacent water bodies following TE. We characterized and extracted this episodic turbidity signal within lakes during the snow-free period (June 15-October 1) for 1986-2016 (continuous data limited to 1999-2016), using the cloud-based geospatial parallel processing platform, Google Earth Engine (TM). Thermoerosional detection accuracy was calculated using seven consecutive years of sub-meter high-resolution imagery (2009-2015) covering 798 (similar to 33%) of the 2456 lakes in the NOAT lowlands. Our automated TE detection algorithm had an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 86% and 0.47 +/- 0.043, indicating that episodic sediment pulses had a "moderate agreement" with landscape deformation associated with permafrost degradation. We estimate that lake shoreline erosion, thaw slumps, catastrophic lake drainage, and gully formation accounted for 62, 23, 13, and 2%, respectively, of active TE across the NOAT lowlands. TE was identified in similar to 5% of all lakes annually in the lowlands between 1999 and 2016, with a wide range of inter-annual variation (ranging from 0.2% in 2001 to 22% in 2004). Inter-annual variability in TE occurrence and spatial patterns of TE probability were correlated with annual snow cover duration and snow persistence, respectively, suggesting that earlier snowmelt accelerates permafrost degradation (e.g. TE) in this region. This work improves our ability to detect and attribute change in permafrost degradation across space and time.					; Lara, Mark/I-6049-2019	Lara, Mark/0000-0002-4670-7031; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				FEB	2019	221						462	473		10.1016/j.rse.2018.11.034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.11.034													WOS:000456640700035

However, the seasonal spatiotemporal distribution, source apportionment, and ecological risk of BPs in natural basins are poorly understood. Especially in highly urbanized river basins with the extensive economic development and anthropogenic activities threaten these critical but ecologically fragile regions. In this study, field investigations of BPs in the waters of the entire Qinhuai River Basin (QRB) were conducted in June (before the annual flood period) and August (after the annual flood period) 2023. The Qinhuai River, an important primary tributary of the lower Yangtze River, is located in eastern China and the QRB is characterized by a high population density and dense urbanization. Thirty-two sites were sampled for six types of BPs known to be ubiquitous in the surface water of the QRB. Significant differences in the concentrations of those BPs were found. Specifically, the concentration of total BPs (sigma BPs) was significantly higher before than after the flood period: 20.3-472 ng/L (mean = 146 ng/L) and 14.1-105 ng/L (mean = 35.9 ng/L), respectively. BPA was the main contributor to sigma BPs before the flood, and BPB followed by BPA after the flood. sigma BP concentrations were 12-241 % higher downstream than upstream of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The results of a principal component analysis followed by multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) suggested that untreated wastewater discharge from the WWTPs is an important source of BPs in the basin, with urban rainfall runoff as another					; Fan, Yifan/AGR-0338-2022	Zhang, Sheng/0000-0001-6638-5925; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 10	2024	920								170964	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170964		FEB 2024						38369146					WOS:001198991500001

West Nile virus in Ontario, Canada: A twelve-year analysis of human case prevalence, mosquito surveillance, and climate data	PLOS ONE												West Nile Virus (WNV) first arrived in Ontario, Canada in 2001 and has since spread throughout most of the province, causing disease in humans. The provincial government established a province-wide surveillance program to monitor WNV transmission throughout the 36 regional health units. Here we have acquired records of WNV human and mosquito surveillance from 2002 to 2013 to describe seasonal and geographic trends in WNV activity in southern Ontario. Additionally, we obtained climate data from seven municipalities to investigate how temperature and precipitation affect WNV transmission dynamics. We identified a strong quadratic relationship between the number of confirmed human cases and positive Culex mosquito pools recorded at the end of each year (R-2 = 0.9783, p < 0.001). Using Spearman rank correlation tests, we identified that the minimum infection rate of Culex pipiens/restuans pools are the strongest predictor of human cases at a 1 week lag period. We also identified positive correlations between minimum infection rates, temperature, vector abundance, and cumulative precipitation. Global Moran's I index indicates strong positive autocorrelation and clustering of positive Culex pool counts in southern Ontario. Local indicators of spatial association tests revealed a total of 44 high-high and 1 high-low trap locations (n = 680). In the current work we have identified when and where hot spots of WNV activity have occurred in southern Ontario. The municipalities surrounding the western shore of the Lake Ontario and Windsor-Essex County have the largest records of positive mosquitoes and human cases. We identified that positive mosquitoes are a strong indicator of human cases to follow in the coming weeks. An epidemic action threshold of cumulative positive Culex pools was established, allowing Ontario public health officials to predict an epidemic at epidemiological week 34 (rho = 0.90, p < 0.001). These data have the potential to contribute to more efficient larvicide programs and awareness campaigns for the public.																			1932-6203					AUG 22	2017	12	8							e0183568	10.1371/journal.pone.0183568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183568								28829827					WOS:000408085100058

Niche plasticity in invasive fishes in the Great Lakes	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The geographic range of an invasive species is a key determinant of relative impact in the invaded region. Comparison of invasive species that are widespread or rare in invaded ranges can highlight mechanistic traits that determine the risk of impact from invasion. Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is more geographically widespread and abundant than Tubenose Goby (Proterorhinus semilunaris) across invaded ranges of the Laurentian Great Lakes. We used stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in liver and muscle to contrast the isotopic niche breadth and niche plasticity of Round Goby and Tubenose Goby near the inflow and outflow of Lake St. Clair and in western Lake Superior. At all sites, Round Goby and Tubenose Goby that matched in size (21-53 mm standard length) had distinct isotopic niches with no overlap, driven by higher delta N-15 in Round Goby. The variation in isotopic niche, and the mean difference in delta C-13 and delta N-15 between muscle and liver, was greater for Round Goby, suggesting both greater seasonal shifts in diet and niche plasticity in this more widely established invader. Round Goby that were significantly larger than Tubenose Goby had broader isotopic niches and greater niche plasticity in the majority of cases and this was associated with isotopic niche overlap with smaller Round Goby and Tubenose Goby. Our findings suggest that a broad and plastic isotopic niche provides scope for wider establishment range in invasive fish species.

At LCN9, which was monitored on an annual basis for the last 20 years, the sulfate concentrations increased over 4-fold. Among the main causes, we exclude a change in the composition of wet atmospheric deposition, as well as a possible influence of decrease in seasonal snow cover duration, which could have exposed larger basin surfaces to alteration processes. Glacier retreat likely was the main factor responsible for the observed increase of sulfate concentrations. We attribute this chemical changes mainly to the sulfide oxidation processes that occur in subglacial environments. Moreover, we observe that the weakened monsoon of the past two decades has only partially contributed to the lakes enrichment through runoff waters that are more concentrated in solutes or lowering the water table, resulting in more rock exposed to air and enhanced mineral oxidation.

This study investigates the occurrence of Fe and Mn in the groundwater of Chengxi Town located at the terminal of the Xiangjiang River. The study area was monitored for an entire year. Thereafter, the associated health risks were identified. Results showed that approximately 81 and 73 % of the measured samples exceeded the limits for Fe and Mn in Chinese drinking water, respectively. pH level was found to be negatively correlated with the concentrations of Fe and Mn in the groundwater in the study area. The occurrence of Fe in the groundwater showed significant seasonal fluctuations and was possibly affected by the change in environment conditions within the aquifer. By contrast, Mn remained relatively stable in most of the area during the whole year. Overall, no health threats for adults and children in the study area were determined according to the low health index values. Nevertheless, research attention and the implementation of relevant measures are needed for certain villages with exceptionally high Mn concentrations in the groundwater.

Paul			Flooding of a carbonate platform: The Sian Ka'an Wetlands, Yucatan, Mexico-A model for the formation and evolution of palustrine carbonate factories around the modern Caribbean Sea and in the depositional record	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD												The dynamic inter-relationships between marine and freshwater carbonate depositional environments are illustrated in the Sian Ka'an Wetlands, a 5 280 km(2) complex of groundwater-fed freshwater marshes, lakes and brackish coastal lagoons in the South-East Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico). The Yucatan Platform was subaerially emergent and extensively karstified during the last glacial maximum at 18, 000 yr bp. The Late Holocene transgression has caused progressive reflooding of the continental margin, backstepping of the MesoAmerican Reef and encroachment of coastal environments into the platform interior as rising groundwaters flood an interconnected cave and sinkhole system and feed seasonal marshes above. The Sian Ka'an Wetlands form a vast palustrine carbonate factory which is directly juxtaposed and dynamically linked with the marine carbonate factory to seaward. Continuing sea-level rise has caused synchronous landward migration of marginal marine and freshwater environments as beach barriers were breached and palustrine sloughs flooded to form marginal marine seagrass lagoons. The Rio Hondo Fault conditions fluid inflow while the sub-environments of the Sian Ka'an Wetlands reflect tectonic controls on microtopography and hydroperiod. Modern analogues for the Sian Ka'an Wetlands include the Florida Everglades, formed during transgression of the Florida Platform, and relict marsh environments preserved on leeward shores of Andros, Abaco and other Bahama islands. A wide range of ancient examples deposited in coastal and continental interior settings similarly reflect seasonal aquifer rise in response to marine transgression and/or onlap of late-stage basin fill onto a karstified pediment. Freshwater palustrine carbonate factories on carbonate platforms are transient deposystems, controlled by subtle water depth, climate, vegetation and hydrological factors while being critically sensitive to sea-level changes and tectonics. The preservation potential of palustrine carbonates may be relatively low in coastal settings due to erosion or shallow marine overprinting, while greater further inland where marine flooding is rarer and in tectonically subsident continental interior basins where accommodation space is continuously created.

We performed spatially resolved measurements of dissolved CO2 and CH4 surface water concentrations and their gas-exchange coefficients (k) to compute diffusive carbon flux from four contrasting tropical reservoirs across Brazil during different hydrological seasons. We used an online equilibration system to measure dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations; we estimated k from floating chamber deployments in conjunction with discrete CO2 and CH4 water concentration measurements. Diffusive CO2 emissions were higher during dry season than during rainy season, whereas there were no consistent seasonal patterns for diffusive CH4 emissions. Our results reveal that the magnitude and the spatial within-reservoir patterns of diffusive CO2 and CH4 flux varied strongly among hydrological seasons. River inflow areas were often characterized by high seasonality in diffusive flux. Areas close to the dam generally showed low seasonal variability in diffusive CH4 flux but high variability in CO2 flux. Overall, we found that reservoir areas exhibiting highest emission rates ("hotspots") shifted substantially across hydrological seasons. Estimates of total diffusive carbon emission from the reservoir surfaces differed between hydrological seasons by a factor up to 7 in Chapeu D'uvas, up to 13 in Curua-Una, up to 4 in Furnas, and up to 1.8 in Funil, indicating that spatially resolved measurements of CO2 and CH4 concentrations and k need to be performed at different hydrological seasons in order to constrain annual diffusive carbon emission.					; Roland, Fabio/C-7918-2013; Barros, Nathan/IZP-5388-2023; Linkhorst, Annika/AAR-6013-2020; Barros, Nathan/D-5944-2013; Paranaiba, Jose R./S-8556-2019; Paranaíba, José/S-8556-2019	Vale, Roseilson/0000-0003-0950-7134; Linkhorst, Annika/0000-0002-3609-5107; Barros, Nathan/0000-0003-1752-8621; Paranaiba, Jose R./0000-0003-0081-1295; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				APR	2021	126	4							e2020JG006014	10.1029/2020JG006014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG006014													WOS:000645001600025

Twenty-six antibiotics, 20 hydrocarbons, including 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and 59 pesticides were investigated. Ampicillin and benzylpenicillin were the most frequently detected antibiotics in both areas, although at low concentrations to cause direct harm to human health, but could lead to a proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes. The most frequently detected hydrocarbons in Bwaise were naphthalene and xylene while anthracene and fluoranthene were the most frequent in Wobulenzi, also at low concentrations for ecological impact at long-term exposure. Molecular diagnostic ratios indicated pyrogenic and pyrolytic sources of PAHs in both areas. Cypermethrin (for vermin control) was the most frequent pesticide in Bwaise while metalaxyl (attributed to agriculture) was the most frequent in Wobulenzi. Banned organochlorines (8) were also detected in both areas in low concentrations. The pesticide concentrations between the two areas significantly differed (Z=- 3.558; p<0.01), attributed to contrasting land-use characteristics. In Wobulenzi (wet season), the total pesticide concentrations at all the locations exceeded the European Community parametric guideline value while 75% of the detected compounds exceeded the individual pesticide guideline value. Thus, the antibiotic and pesticide residues in shallow groundwater underlying both Bwaise and Wobulenzi pose potential adverse ecological effects at long-term exposure. Monitoring of EOCs in both highly and moderately urbanised catchments should be strengthened towards mitigating associated risks.					; Nakawunde Kulabako, Robinah/HKE-5422-2023; Foppen, Jan/C-6721-2009	Twinomucunguzi, Felix Rutaro Baineki/0000-0002-6159-7424; Foppen, Jan Willem/0000-0002-1112-2383; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2021	193	4							228	10.1007/s10661-021-08975-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-08975-6								33772658					WOS:000634824900001

Operational Seasonal Water Supply and Water Level Forecasting for the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Seasonal water supply forecasts are a critical component of regional water resources management planning. Across the United States, multiple modeling tools and operational protocols have evolved over time to address this need. Here, the authors document, assess, and recommend improvements to the current operational water supply forecasting protocols employed in managing flows through, and water levels across, Earth's largest lake system: the Laurentian Great Lakes. The water resources management actions for this massive system are critically linked to North America's economy, and to human health and safety, through planning and policy decisions related to hydropower management, commercial navigation, and water level fluctuations. The authors' assessment indicates that existing operational seasonal water supply forecasting systems for the Great Lakes have moderate skill and that there are several high-priority areas for improvement, including improved representation of initial hydrological conditions, aligning variability in future meteorological forcings with climate-scale projections, and robust representations of forecast uncertainty.

In the present study, the net effect of increased N deposition on methane (CH4) emissions from rice fields across China was evaluated using the validated DNDC (DeNitrification-DeComposition) model. The results showed that N deposition produces a slight increase in rice biomass and weakly inhibits CH4 emissions, under the current N fertilizer application practices (excessive N fertilizer) in paddy fields. Nationally, N deposition reduces total CH4 emissions by 0.04 Tg yr(-1). CH4 emissions are reduced by 1.38 and 1.69 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1) (accounting for 0.6% and 0.2% of the average CH4 emissions) in a mid-season drainage water regime for single-and double-cropping rice, respectively. N deposition showed significantly influence on CH4 emission reduction (R = 0.86 and 0.74 for single- and double-cropping rice, respectively, p < 0.01). The largest reduction in the CH4 flux of single-cropping rice was mainly concentrated in AEZ (agroecological zone) 6A and AEZ 7, while the largest reduction for double-cropping rice was mainly distributed in the Poyang Lake Basin and Dongting Lake Basin. It should be noticed that the net response of CH4 emissions to N deposition ( - 0.07 and - 0.14 kg CH4 ha(-1 )kg(-1) N for single- and double-cropping rice, respectively) was greater than that to N fertilizers (- 0.05 kg CH4 ha(-1) kg(-1) N) under the same water management practices, which mainly because the nitrate nitrogen in N deposition increases the soil redox potential, thus inhibiting the production of CH4. These results provide a new understanding of the ecological effect of N deposition on agricultural ecosystems.

In three ice-free seasons, the supra-permafrost discharge contributed a mean ratio of over 170% of the precipitation. In the ice-cover seasons, the supra-permafrost discharge contribution varied between -20% and 22% of the water storage change. Results show that a large portion of the lake water storage change is because of the supra-permafrost discharge resulting from precipitation. Furthermore, a precipitation-subsurface runoff function is preliminarily identified in which the supra-permafrost discharge nonlinearly increased with more precipitation. Our results show that the recent lake expansion is linked with increasing supra-permafrost discharge dominated by precipitation. This study also suggests that we need to pay attention to the nonlinear increase of precipitation-controlled supra permafrost discharge on the large lake expansion at the catchment scale in the QTP region, instead of only looking at the inputs (e.g., precipitation and river discharge) as shown in the previous studies.

Understanding the nitrogen budget (i.e., inputs and outputs) is essential to evaluate the prospective decay of the ecosystem services (e.g., freshwater quality, erosion control, loss of high patrimonial-value plant species, etc.) that subalpine headwater catchments provide, especially as these ecosystems experience high atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Here, we use a multi-isotopic tracer (Delta O-17, delta N-15 and delta O-18) of nitrate in aerosols, snow, and streams to assess the fate of atmospherically deposited nitrate in the subalpine watershed of the Lautaret Pass (French Alps). We show that atmospheric N deposition contributes significantly to stream nitrate pool year-round, either by direct inputs (up to 35%) or by in situ nitrification of atmospheric ammonium (up to 35%). Snowmelt in particular leads to high exports of atmospheric nitrate, most likely fast enough to impede assimilation by surrounding ecosystems. Yet, in a context of climate change, with shorter snow seasons, and increasing nitrogen emissions, our results hint at possibly stronger ecological consequences of nitrogen atmospheric deposition in the close future.

However, relatively little is known about the residues and dietary risks associated with cultured fish around Tai Lake. In the present study, a sampling strategy for a complete aquaculture period was conducted. Specifically, 12 selected sulfonamide antibiotics were measured among 116 fish samples recruited from four sampling periods, four species, four areas, and 18 fish ponds. All 12 antibiotics were detected at detection frequencies of 4.31-28.45%. Total sulfonamides were detected in 77.59% of the fish samples, with 57.76% of fish samples containing from 0.1 to 10 mu g kg(-1). Sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), sulfamethazine (SDD), and sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) were the main types of antibiotics used, and these were present at high concentrations (> 100 mu g kg(-1)) with high occurrences, especially in the middle of the aquaculture season. Dietary assessment showed that residual antibiotics in all fish that were being sent to market were far below the maximum residue limit (MRL) of total sulfonamides and that there was almost no risk associated with fish consumption. The results of the present study will facilitate development of effective measures to produce safe aquatic products and meaningful suggestions for consuming aquatic products.					song, chao/HTO-8527-2023														0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	21					17493	17499		10.1007/s11356-017-9442-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9442-2								28593547					WOS:000406479200018

Seasonality of freshwater bacterioplankton diversity in two tropical shallow lakes from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Bacteria are highly important for the cycling of organic and inorganic matter in freshwater environments; however, little is known about the diversity of bacterioplankton in tropical systems. Studies on carbon and nutrient cycling in tropical lakes suggest a very different seasonality from that of temperate climates. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) to investigate seasonal changes in bacterioplankton communities of two tropical lakes, which differed in trophic status and mixing regime. Our findings revealed seasonally and depth-wise highly dynamic bacterioplankton communities. Differences in richness and structure appeared strongly related to the physicochemical characteristics of the water column, especially phosphate, pH and oxygen. Bacterioplankton communities were dominated by common taxonomic groups, such as Synechococcus and Actinobacteria acI, as well as rare and poorly characterized taxa such as 'Candidatus Methylacidiphilum' (Verrucomicrobia). Stratification and oxygen depletion during the rainy season promoted the occurrence of anoxygenic phototrophic and methanotrophic bacteria important for carbon and nutrient cycling. Differences in lake mixing regime were associated with seasonal beta diversity. Our study is the first attempt to use NGS for cataloging the diversity of bacterioplankton communities in Brazilian lakes and thus contributes to the ongoing worldwide endeavor to characterize freshwater lake bacterioplankton signatures.

We hypothesized that the handling of small prey would be less time-consuming, whereas feeding on larger prey would be more efficient. Therefore, type II functional response curves were expected for large prey and a trend towards type III curves for small prey. We expected the introduction of prey refuges to shift the functional response curves from hyperbolic to sigmoidal and that the effect would be even more pronounced with smaller prey. P. muscorum consumed large amounts of small and large C. elegans, with daily per capita ingestion of prey reaching a maximum of 19.8 mu g fresh weight, which corresponds to 4.8 times the predator's biomass. Regardless of prey size and habitat structure, P. muscorum exhibit a type III functional response. Overall, the allometric effect of prey size had a greater effect on the predator's functional response than did the addition of substrate, presumably due to the similar body shape and mobility of the two nematode species. Our results demonstrate that individual factors such as feeding behavior are important determinants of functional responses and therefore of ecosystem stability.

In this study, macrophytes and meiofauna have been investigated in a transitional area (Venice lagoon, Italy) characterized by numerous anthropogenic pressures. Macrophyte Quality Index and meiofaunal richness were used to assess Ecological Quality (EcoQ) status in line with Water Framework and Marine Strategy Framework Directives. Comparing the EcoQ classes, the results appeared consistent in 24 sites, whereas, in the remaining 5 ones, the values significantly diverged. These results could be related i) to the presence of the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa that could affect meiofaunal taxa with the production of tannins; ii) to the different time response of these communities to human impacts. This synergistic investigation has allowed an accurate description of the spatial and temporal changes of meiofauna through data on abiotic and biotic parameters characterizing the ecosystem trophic level.

Trin. ex Steudel in Lake Burullus (Egypt): A biomonitoring application	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study was carried out in some natural stands of Phragmites australis (Cav.)Trin. ex Steudel grown in Lake Burullus, a Mediterranean lake in north Egypt, to investigate: (1) the concentration of trace elements in the organs of P. australis, (2) the extent of trace elements mobility from sediment to below-ground organs and within the plant, (3) the organs of P. australis as potential bioindicators for the contamination of the water and sediment by the trace elements, and (4) the amount of trace elements that released back into the surrounding water after decomposition of dead tissues. Above- and below-ground biomass of P. australis, water and sediment were sampled monthly for one year at six sites of Lake Burullus (three sites represent each of the northern and southern parts of the lake) using six randomly distributed quadrats (each of 0.5 x 0.5 m) at each sampling site. The above- and below-ground biomasses of southern sites are significantly higher than that of the northern sites. Above-ground biomass is >2.5 folds of the below-ground biomass in the northern and southern sites. The highest concentration in the below-ground organs is Cu, Fe and Zn; and in the leaf is Cd. The monthly highest values of trace elements are Cu and Fe in February at the beginning of the growing season; and Cd and Zn in January at the end of the growing season. The annual mean of trace element concentrations (in mg kg(-1)) in P. australis organs ranged from 11.0 to 23.8 for Cd, from 31.0 to 65.6 for Cu, from 34.4 to 973 for Zn, and from 505.0 to 2833.0 for Fe. The mean bioaccumulation factor of all trace elements from the sediment to the below-ground organs is greater than unity for all elements with the following sequence: Cd > Fe > Zn > Cu. Cd has the highest translocation factor from the below-ground to the above-ground organs, while Fe has the lowest. Positive linear correlations are detected between the concentrations of all elements (except Cu) in plant organs, water and sediment. The higher translocation factor of Cd in the above-ground organs of P. australis makes it suitable for the phytoextraction of this element from the water and sediment, while the lower translocation factor for Cu, Fe and Zn makes it suitable for their phytostabilization. In conclusion, all the organs of P. australis could act as bioindicators and biomonitors of the examined trace elements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Climate change may have limited effect on global risk of potato late blight	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Weather affects the severity of many plant diseases, and climate change is likely to alter the patterns of crop disease severity. Evaluating possible future patterns can help focus crop breeding and disease management research. We examined the global effect of climate change on potato late blight, the disease that caused the Irish potato famine and still is a common potato disease around the world. We used a metamodel and considered three global climate models for the A2 greenhouse gas emission scenario for three 20-year time-slices: 2000-2019, 2040-2059 and 2080-2099. In addition to global analyses, five regions were evaluated where potato is an important crop: the Andean Highlands, Indo-Gangetic Plain and Himalayan Highlands, Southeast Asian Highlands, Ethiopian Highlands, and Lake Kivu Highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa. We found that the average global risk of potato late blight increases initially, when compared with historic climate data, and then declines as planting dates shift to cooler seasons. Risk in the agro-ecosystems analyzed, varied from a large increase in risk in the Lake Kivu Highlands in Rwanda to decreases in the Southeast Asian Highlands of Indonesia.

Network-Based Biomonitoring: Exploring Freshwater Food Webs With Stable Isotope Analysis and DNA Metabarcoding	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Threatened freshwater ecosystems urgently require improved tools for effective management. Food web analysis is currently under-utilized, yet can be used to generate metrics to support biomonitoring assessments by measuring the stability and robustness of ecosystems. Using a previously developed analysis pipeline, we combined taxonomic outputs from DNA metabarcoding with a text-mining routine to extract trait information directly from the literature. This pipeline allowed us to generate heuristic food webs for sites within the lower Saint John/Wolastoq River and the Grand Lake Meadows (hereafter called the "GLM complex"), Atlantic Canada's largest freshwater wetland. While these food webs are derived from empirical traits and their structure has been shown to discriminate sites both spatially and temporally, the accuracy of their properties have not been assessed against other methods of trophic analysis. We explored two approaches to validate the utility of heuristic food webs. First, we qualitatively compared how well-trophic position derived from heuristic food webs recovered spatial and temporal differences across the GLM complex in comparison to traditional stable isotope approaches. Second, we explored how the trophic position of invertebrates, derived from heuristic food webs, predicted trophic position measured from d(15)N values. In general, both heuristic food webs and stable isotopes were able to detect seasonal changes in maximum trophic position in the GLM complex. Samples from the entire GLM complex demonstrated that prey-averaged trophic position measured from heuristic food webs strongly predicted trophic position inferred from stable isotopes (R-2 = 0.60), and even stronger relationships were observed for some individual models (R-2 = 0.78 for best model). Beyond their areas of congruence, heuristic food web and stable isotope analyses also appear to complement one another, suggesting a surprising degree of independence between community trophic niche width (assessed from stable isotopes) and food web size and complexity (assessed from heuristic food webs). Collectively, these analyses indicate that trait-based networks have properties that correspond to those of actual food webs, supporting the routine adoption of food web metrics for ecosystem biomonitoring.					; Curry, R./ABG-3515-2020; Monk, Wendy/F-4243-2012; Porter, Teresita/H-4072-2011; Bush, Alex/ACC-9756-2022	Curry, R.

Spatiotemporal analysis of microbial community dynamics during seasonal stratification events in a freshwater lake (Grand Lake, OK, USA)	PLOS ONE												Many freshwater lakes undergo seasonal stratification, where the formation of phototrophic blooms in the epilimnion and subsequent sedimentation induces hypoxia/anoxia in the thermocline and hypolimnion. This autochthonously produced biomass represents a major seasonal organic input that impacts the entire ecosystem. While the limnological aspects of this process are fairly well documented, relatively little is known regarding the microbial community response to such events, especially in the deeper anoxic layers of the water column. Here, we conducted a spatiotemporal survey of the particle-associated and free-living microbial communities in a warm monomictic freshwater reservoir (Grand Lake O' the Cherokees) in northeastern Oklahoma, USA. Pre-stratification samples (March) harbored a homogeneous community throughout the oxygenated water column dominated by typical oligotrophic aquatic lineages (acl clade within Actinobacteria, and Flavobacterium within the Bacteroidetes). The onset of phototrophic blooming in June induced the progression of this baseline community into two distinct trajectories. Within the oxic epilimnion, samples were characterized by the propagation of phototrophic (Prochlorococcus), and heterotrophic (Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Beta-Proteobacteria) lineages. Within the oxygen-deficient thermocline and hypolimnion, the sedimentation of surface biomass induced the development of a highly diverse community, with the enrichment of Chloroflexi, "Latescibacteria", Armatimonadetes, and Delta-Proteobacteria in the particle-associated fraction, and Gemmatimonadetes and "Omnitrophica" in the free-living fraction. Our work documents the development of multiple spatially and temporally distinct niches during lake stratification, and supports the enrichment of multiple yet-uncultured and poorly characterized lineages in the lake's deeper oxygen-deficient layers, an ecologically relevant microbial niche that is often overlooked in lakes diversity surveys.					; Youssef, Noha/T-5198-2019; Zamor, Richard/AAG-7504-2019; M.Zamor, Richard/AAG-7504-2019	Baker, Kristina/0000-0003-2812-5502; Youssef, Noha/0000-0001-9159-3785; Zamor, Richard/0000-0003-3512-2940; 													1932-6203					MAY 11	2017	12	5							e0177488	10.1371/journal.pone.0177488	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177488								28493994					WOS:000401314300119

However, integrated analyses are scarcer than studies addressing factors separately. Integration is likely more efficient in studies of small well-characterized (experimental) reservoir watersheds, because the isolation of factor contributions is presumably clearer. But those studies are uncommon. This work describes the water quality of two small 5.5 m-deep reservoirs (MD-Main and VD-Vocoroca dams) located in Pindorama Experimental Center, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, considering the interplay between reservoir dimension, seasonal thermal stratification, chemical gradients, erosive rainfall events, presence of natural biofilters, and land uses and landscape patterns around the reservoirs and within the contributing watersheds. The monitoring of agricultural activities and water quality parameters occurred in October 2018-July 2019. A 4 degrees C thermal stratification occurred in October (difference between surface and bottom water temperature), which decreased until disappearance in January (VD) or April (MD). The longer stratification period of MD was justified by its larger area relative to VD (approximate to 10x). Thermal stratification triggered hypoxia at the bottom of both reservoirs (DO approximate to 1 mg/L), more prolonged and severe in MD. Hypoxia activated Ec and TDS peaks in January likely explained by bottom-sediment nutrient releases, presumably phosphorus. The Ec peak reached 560 mu S/cm in MD and 290 mu S/cm in VD. The smaller VD peak was probably explained by the action of macrophytes. In March, a 240 NTU turbidity peak occurred in MD, caused by precedent erosive rainfall and the lack of vegetation protection alongside the south border. As expected, the study accomplished clear isolation of factor contributions, verified by Factor and Cluster analyses. Our results can subsidize studies on larger reservoir watersheds requiring restoration, where the isolation of factors is more challenging. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, JX; Qi, ZM; Wang, C				Wang, Jiaxin; Qi, Zhiming; Wang, Chong			Phosphorus loss management and crop yields: A global meta-analysis	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Phosphorus (P) management is critical for environmental protection as excessive or inappropriate P application can lead to water pollution. However, conflicting results from various experiments on the effectiveness of P management practices make it challenging to draw general conclusions. Moreover, there is a lack of compre-hensive analysis on the effects of P management practices on crop yields as a result of their implementation. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis (522 paired observations), combing with previous meta-analyses, to evaluate the effectiveness of different P management practices on reducing soil P loss and the impact of these practices on crop yields during the study periods. Our findings indicate that the most effective P loss management practices do not necessarily result in the greatest improvement in crop yield. In summary, efficient irrigation, crop straw return, buffer strip, and intercropping demonstrat the greatest effectiveness in reducing soil P loss, achieving an average reduction of -94.2%, -87.7%, -87.2%, and -61%, respectively. While soil amendment, intercropping, and conservative practices have showed the largest increase in crop yields, attaining an average increase of 188.8%, 80%, and 72.9% respectively. In addition, we find that soil available P level, crop growing season rainfall, and P addition amount are important factors influencing the effectiveness of P management practices. High soil available P and rainfall tended to offset the effectiveness of these practices, while high P additions correlated with more effective reduction of P loss. Based on our results, we recommend prioritizing crop straw return when implementing P loss control practices.					; Wang, Jiaxin/AAF-5415-2020	Qi, Zhiming/0000-0002-8233-165X; 													0167-8809	1873-2305				NOV 1	2023	357								108683	10.1016/j.agee.2023.108683	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2023.108683		JUL 2023											WOS:001053267200001

Understanding the effect of pollutants on the organization of bacterial communities is of paramount importance in order to unravel bacterial assemblages colonizing specific ecological niches. Here, chemical and molecular approaches were combined to investigate the bacterial communities inhabiting the sediments of the lchkeul Lake/Bizerte Lagoon, a hydrological system under anthropogenic pressure. Although the microbial community of the lchkeul Lake sediment was different to that of the Bizerte Lagoon, common bacterial genera were identified suggesting a lake-lagoon continuum probably due to the hydrology of the system exchanging waters according to the season. These genera represent bacterial "generalists" maintaining probably general biogeochemical functions. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed significant differential abundance distribution of bacterial genera according to the habitat, the pollution type and level. Further, correlation analyses identified specific bacterial genera which abundance was linked with pesticides concentrations in the lake, while in the lagoon the abundance of specific bacterial genera was found linked with the concentrations of PAHs (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and organic forms of Sn. As well, bacterial genera which abundance was not correlated with the concentrations of pollutants were identified in both lake and lagoon. These findings represent valuable information, pointing out specific bacterial genera associated with pollutants, which represent assets for developing bacterial tools for the implementation, the management, and monitoring of bioremediation processes to mitigate the effect of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems.

Prospects for ecological intensification of Australian agriculture	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												World population growth, changing diets and limited opportunities to expand agricultural lands will drive agricultural intensification in the decades ahead. Concerns about the reliance of past agricultural intensification on non-renewable resources, about its negative impacts on natural resources both on and off farm and on greenhouse gas emissions, provide an imperative for future agricultural intensification to become ecologically efficient. We define ecological intensification of agriculture (EIA) as: producing more food per unit resource use while minimising the impact of food production on the environment. Achieving it will require increased precision in the use of inputs and reduction in inefficiencies and losses. It will also require a more holistic view of farming, going beyond efficiencies of single inputs into a single field in a single season to consideration of efficiencies of whole systems over decades. This paper explores the ecological intensification issues facing agricultural production in Australia where opportunities for agricultural intensification are centred on more efficient use of limited and unreliable water resources in both dryland and irrigated agriculture. Ecological efficiencies can be achieved by better matching the supply of nutrients to crops' requirements both temporally and spatially. This has the added benefit of minimising the opportunities for excessive nutrients to impact on soil health (acidity and dryland salinity) and water quality (pollution of groundwater and eutrophication of lakes and rivers). Opportunities for ecologically efficient intensification are also identified through better integration of crop and livestock enterprises on mixed crop-livestock farms. We define nine desirable attributes of an EIA system: (1) increased agricultural production; (2) efficient use of limited resources; (3) minimal impact on global warming; (4) minimal negative on-site impacts; (5) minimal negative off-site impacts; (6) minimal risk and maximum resilience; (7) preservation of biodiversity in agriculture; (8) preservation of biodiversity in nature and; (9) positive social outcomes. We focus on four technologies and production systems emerging in Australian agriculture: climate risk management; precision agriculture; crop-livestock integration and deficit irrigation. For each of these systems we identify how well they are likely to match the nine desirable attributes of an EIA system. While it seems unlikely that any single technology can satisfy all nine desirable attributes, there is hope that in combination emerging and future technologies will progress Australian agriculture towards greater productivity and ecological efficiency.

We investigated human activity in a low-human-impact region of Poland, taking advantage of varved sediments from Lake Szurpily, which span the last 8200 years. Multiple sediment variables indicated that catchment evolution and lacustrine responses, mainly to changes in forest cover, were divided into four phases. Because of sparse or only seasonal occupation of settlements in NE Poland, human impact in the region was insignificant until ca. 939 +/- 55 BC (lacustrine phase I). During Phase II (939 +/- 55 BC-AD 1392 +/- 38), we recorded an increase in human indicators, reflecting the direct influence of a Yatvingian community. Afterwards, between AD 1392 +/- 38 and 1770 +/- 30 (phase III), permanent settlements and agricultural land use stabilized. The beginning of the last period (phase IV) was clearly identified by all sediment variables, which responded simultaneously to local human activities. Disappearance of laminae from AD 1858 +/- 22 until about AD 1997 indicated disturbance of pre-existing, stable depositional conditions, followed by environmental recovery in the last 20 years. Such recovery may have been related to recent socio-economic changes and establishment of a park that reduced human influence on the lake.					; Fiłoc, Magdalena/AAF-9403-2019; Tylmann, Wojciech/AAL-3504-2021; Zolitschka, Bernd/P-1487-2019	Bubak, Iwona/0000-0001-8387-3883; Mayr, Christoph/0000-0001-9002-9963; Filoc, Magdalena/0000-0003-1226-2676; Kupryjanowicz, Miroslawa/0000-0003-0629-6247; Gasiorowski, Michal/0000-0003-2610-4257; Tylmann, Wojciech/0000-0003-1749-5882; Kinder, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5379-5367													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2019	61	4					419	435		10.1007/s10933-019-00068-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-019-00068-2													WOS:000463911900003

Paleoenvironmental dynamics in South Amazonia, Brazil, during the last 35,000 years inferred from pollen and geochemical records of Lago do Saci	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Paleoenvironmental changes for the last 35,000 years were reconstructed from palynological, sedimentological and organic geochemical evidence from a well-dated sediment core from Lago do Saci (South Amazonia). Dry climatic conditions occurred between 35,000 and 18,200 cal yr BP as recorded by high frequencies of open savanna taxa and low lake level indicated by Sagittaria and low Total Organic Carbon content. Cold temperatures are indicated by the presence of Podocarpus and Ilex. A sedimentation hiatus observed between 18,200 and 9200 cal yr BP was likely related to dry conditions. The beginning of the Holocene was marked by rainforest expansion and an increase in carbon content that represented high lake levels and warmer and wetter climate conditions. Between 7500 and 5000 cal yr BP, the expansion of open savanna, seasonal forest elements and abundant black carbon suggests a dry phase. After 5000 cal yr BP, rainforest expansion and higher lake levels indicate a return to wetter conditions. A reduction of flooding taxa (Celtis and Mauritia) between 1800 and 1300 cal yr BP, high lake level conditions and maintenance of a forest physiognomy, suggests a decrease of regional precipitation and subsequent reduction of the flooded areas in a still humid climate regime.

In this study, MSA archaeological sites on the Makgadikgadi pan floor date to two dry periods in the basin during the late Quaternary. Site formation at one site occurred during dry, or seasonally dry conditions that followed a period of high lake levels between 128 +/- 18 ka and 81 +/- 6 ka. The site was buried by sediments from a subsequent period of high lake levels dating to between 72 +/- 5 ka and 57 +/- 8 ka. At other investigated sites, the archaeological material was most likely deposited during a second dry period sometime after this. Overlying dunes are much younger (late Holocene) than the late Pleistocene lakebed sediments associated with the archaeological sites. Rapid burial of the archaeological sites by clayey sands has resulted in limited disturbance and weathering of archaeological material which ap-pears to have only been exposed very recently, perhaps in the last 350 years when conditions have been particularly dry and susceptible to deflation. The spatial patterning of both sediment accumulation and deflation strongly influences archaeological visibility both within and around the Makgadikgadi basin.(c) 2022 The Authors.

J	Mei, XF; Dai, ZJ; Du, JZ; Cheng, JP				Mei, Xuefei; Dai, Zhijun; Du, Jinzhou; Cheng, Jinping			Three Gorges Dam enhanced organic carbon burial within the sediments of Poyang Lake, China	CATENA												Lakes play a dominant role in the global carbon cycle, serving as crucial long-term carbon (C) sinks. Carbon burial within lakes is influenced by changes in both inflowing and outflowing processes. While considerable attention has been given to studying the former, the latter has often been overlooked and remains insufficiently documented. In this study, we investigated the variations in organic carbon burial within Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, which mainly discharges into the Changjiang River. This study focused on the response of organic carbon burial to the regulation of a mega dam, the Three Gorges Dam, along the lake's main channel. The mean organic carbon accumulation rate in Poyang Lake sediments increased substantially by 3.82-4.60 times after the year 2000, compared to the preceding period. Furthermore, the Three Gorges Dam induced an abnormal reduction in lake levels by 1.38 m during the dry season, leading to a translocation of approximately 0.42 billion m2 of water area toward vegetated systems. The pronounced expansion of vegetation across the shallow floodplain of Poyang Lake is identified as the primary driver behind the enhanced organic carbon burial within the lake sediments. These findings emphasize the imperative to further investigate and address the global issue of organic carbon accumulation in lake floodplain sediments, particularly in the context of riverine dams. These results shed light on the ecological implications of mega -dam regulation on organic carbon dynamics and underscore the significance of understanding and mitigating the associated environmental impacts.

Vertically, permafrost is attached or detached from frost action. The latter can be further divided into shallow (depth to the permafrost table <= 8 m), deep (>8 m) and two-layer permafrost. Since the 1980s, air temperatures have been rising at an average rate of 0.02 degrees C yr(-1). Human activities have also increased remarkably, resulting in a regional degradation of permafrost. The lower limit of permafrost has risen by 50-80 m. The average maximum depth of frost penetration has decreased by 0.1-0.2 m. The temperatures of the suprapermafrost water have increased by 0.5-0.7 degrees C. General trends of permafrost degradation include reduction in areal extent from continuous and discontinuous to sporadic and patchy permafrost, thinning of permafrost, and expansion of taliks. Isolated patches of permafrost have either been significantly reduced in areal extent, or changed into seasonally frozen ground. Degradation of permafrost has led to a lowering of ground water levels, shrinking lakes and wetlands, and noticeable change of grassland ecosystems alpine meadows to steppes. The degradation of alpine grasslands will cause further degradation of permafrost and result in the deterioration of ecological environments as manifested by expanding desertification and enhancing soil erosion.																			1748-9326					OCT-DEC	2009	4	4							045206	10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045206													WOS:000272900500063

The dramatic water-volume variations since the 21th century has aroused concerns from local and transboundary water resource authorities. To track its dynamics during the past sixteen years with no aid of in-situ data, serial Jason altimeters and optical remote sensing images were integrated to reconstruct the time series of the water-volume variations. We developed a workflow consisting of four procedures: 1) Deriving the water-level time series using Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 after applying a feature-based waveform classification method and a targeted waveform retracking strategy; 2) Extracting the water-area by using Landsat images; 3) Establishing the relationship between water-level and water-area; and 4) Reconstructing the water-volume variation time series by integrating the water-level time series and the relationship derived from 3). We found that Lake Hulun has gone through three stages of changes: 1) Period one (2002-2009), water-level and volume dropped significantly at a rate of -0.40 m yr(-1) and -0.73 km(3) yr(-1), respectively. 2) Period two (2010-2012), the water-level and volume were relatively stable. 3) Period three (2013-2015), the water-level and volume began to rise rapidly at the rates of 1.09 m yr(-1) and 1.99 km(3) yr(-1), respectively. In addition, two significant change years (2007 and 2013) were detected, which corresponded well with extreme climatic conditions. Preliminary analyses indicate that the water-volume variations are closely related to precipitation and temperature anomalies in wet seasons.					; Gong, Peng/AAM-1516-2021; Yuan, Cui/S-6742-2016	liu, cai xia/0000-0001-5851-6374; 													0143-1161	1366-5901				JAN 17	2019	40	2					670	692		10.1080/01431161.2018.1516316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.1516316													WOS:000457495600012

Isotopic constraints on water balance of tundra lakes and watersheds affected by permafrost degradation, Mackenzie Delta region, Northwest Territories, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Widespread permafrost degradation in Canada's western Arctic has led to formation of shoreline retrogressive thaw slumps (SRTS), a process influential inmodifyingwater and biogeochemical balances of tundra lakes. To investigate hydrological effects of SRTS, water sampling campaigns were conducted in 2004, 2005, and 2008 for paired lakes (undisturbed vs SRTS) in the upland region adjacent to the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada. An isotope mass balance model to estimate evaporation/inflow, precipitation/inflow, water yield, and runoff ratiowas developed incorporating seasonal evaporative drawdown effects and a mixingmodel to simulate gradients in marine-continental atmospheric moisture. Site-specific water balance results revealed systematically higher evaporation/inflow and precipitation/inflow for lakes with active SRTS compared to undisturbed lakes, and typically higher ratios of these indicators associated with stabilized versus active SRTS. Water yields were higher for active SRTS sites compared to undisturbed and stabilized SRTS sites, suggesting that slumping is an initial but not a sustained source of water delivery to lakes. Catchments with wildfire history were found to have lower water yields, attributed to reduced permafrost influence on runoff generation. Conceptually, we define a permafrost thaw trajectory whereby undisturbed sites, active SRTS, stabilized SRTS, and ancient SRTS represent progressive stages of permafrost thaw. We postulate that release of additional runoff is mainly due to permafrost thaw in active SRTS, which also promotes lake expansion, talik formation, and subsurface connectivity. Eventual stabilization of slumps and reduced runoff is expected once permafrost thaw sources are exhausted, at which time lakes may become more reliant on replenishment by direct precipitation. The effect of snow catch in slumps appears to be subordinate to permafrost thaw sources based on eventual decline in runoff once thaw slumps stabilize. Improved, site-specific hydrologic understanding is expected to assist with ongoing research into carbon cycling and biogeochemical feedbacks in the region.

First, a spatially-distributed set of explanatory variables for groundwater occurrence is compiled into a geographic information system. Twenty machine learning classifiers are subsequently trained on a sample of 488 boreholes and excavated wells for a region of eastern Chad. This process includes collinearity, cross-validation, feature elimination and parameter fitting routines. Random forest and extra trees classifiers outperformed other algorithms (test score > 0.80, balanced score > 0.80, AUC > 0.87). Fracture density, slope, SAR coherence (interferometric correlation), topographic wetness index, basement depth, distance to channels and slope aspect proved the most relevant explanatory variables. Three major conclusions stem from this work: (1) using a large number of supervised classification algorithms is advisable in groundwater potential studies; (2) the choice of performance metrics constrains the relevance of explanatory variables; and (3) seasonal variations from satellite images contribute to successful groundwater potential mapping.					martinez-santos, pedro/AFP-6982-2022	Martinez-Santos, Pedro/0000-0003-2014-4063; Gomez-Escalonilla, Victor/0000-0002-5347-2525													1010-6049	1752-0762				DEC 13	2022	37	25					8924	8951		10.1080/10106049.2021.2007298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2021.2007298		NOV 2021											WOS:000723474800001

Spatiotemporal changes in reservoir water quality were evaluated by applying Korean water quality indices and multivariate statistical techniques (MSTs). A dataset of 15 water quality parameters at five sites in the PDR were evaluated from 2017 to 2021. The organic matter, suspended matter, total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and total coliforms in the PDR exhibited a fair grade or higher. Chemical oxygen demand was found to correlate with biochemical oxygen demand, Chl-a, and TP. The average real-time water quality index (RTWQI) and average trophic state index (TSIKO) of the PDR were excellent and mesotrophic, respectively, and 46% of eutrophic conditions occurred during the monsoon season. For a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), the five sites were grouped into three polluted areas and 12 months were grouped into dry and wet seasons. Principal component analysis and factor analysis identified four potential pollution sources (domestic sewage, industrial wastewater, intensive agricultural activities, and livestock wastewater) in the PDR and explained 79.7% of the total changes. Thus, the RTWQI, TSIKO, and MSTs are useful tools for assessing freshwater quality in Korea, predicting potentially harmful conditions, and potentially assisting policymakers in PDR management.

In many Northern Hemisphere temperate regions, cold seasons have become more variable and unpredictable, necessitating frequent river ice observations over long sections of rivers. Satellite SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)-based river ice detection models have been successfully applied and tested, but different hydrological, morphological and climatological conditions can affect their skill. In this study, we developed and tested Sentinel-1 SAR-based ice detection models in 525 km sections of the Nemunas and Neris Rivers. We analyzed three binary classification models based on VV, VH backscatter and logistic regression. The model sensitivity and specificity were used to determine the optimal threshold between ice and water classes. We used in situ observations and Sentinel-2 Sen2Cor ice mask to validate models in different ice conditions. In most cases, SAR-based ice detection models outperformed Sen2Cor classification because Sen2Cor misclassified pixels as ice in areas with translucent clouds, undetected by the scene classification algorithm, and misclassified pixels as water in cloud or river valley shadow. SAR models were less accurate in river sections where river flow and ice formation conditions were affected by large valley-dammed reservoirs. Sen2Cor and SAR models accurately detected border and consolidated ice but were less accurate in moving ice conditions. The skill of models depended on how dense the moving ice was. With a lowered classification threshold and increased model sensitivity, SAR models detected sparse frazil ice. In most cases, the VV polarization-based model was more accurate than the VH polarization-based model. The results of logistic and VV models were highly correlated, and the use of VV was more constructive due to its simpler algorithm.					; Grendaite, Dalia/GRR-6724-2022; Stonevičius, Edvinas/M-6138-2019	Stonevicius, Edvinas/0000-0001-6053-5857; Grendaite, Dalia/0000-0002-9611-5421; 														2072-4292				APR	2022	14	7							1627	10.3390/rs14071627	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14071627													WOS:000782024400001

Improved methodology for measuring pore patterns in the benthic foraminiferal genus Ammonia	MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY												Benthic foraminiferal pores are considered to play an important role in facilitating the gas exchange between the organism and the environment, with pore size and density supposed to be related to gas exchange intensity. Recent studies have therefore attempted to establish relationships between pore patterns and redox conditions, such as bottom water oxygen and nitrate concentrations. However, a prerequisite for such an attempt is the development of a practical and reliable methodology for measuring pore patterns. The aim of this study is to present a semi-automated pore measurement method for Ammonia, a dominant taxon of temperate coastal environments that are increasingly affected by seasonal hypoxia (bottom water oxygen concentration < 63 mu M). The approach is based on image analyses of a measurement frame positioned on SEM images with 1000x magnification. Statistical analyses show that the surface area of the pores in the frame has a normal distribution. Therefore, a mean pore surface area can be used to describe the pores in the measurement frame. We observed small but significant ontogenetic changes in pore density (number of pores per frame) and pore surface area. Accordingly, it seems preferable to limit pore measurements to size windows on chambers representing the same ontogenetic stage. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the method, we applied it in two case studies. Firstly, a study of living Ammonia in Lake Grevelingen (Netherlands) revealed a clear difference in pore patterns between three studied stations characterised by different seasonal bottom water oxygenation patterns. Secondly, a sediment core from the same site clearly showed the presence of two morphotypes of Ammonia; one with numerous, small pores and the other with fewer but much larger pores, resulting in a higher porosity (larger part of the test covered by pores). Since the man-made closure of Lake Grevelingen in 1971, the latter morphotype has progressively replaced the former one.

Two high volume cascade impactors were used to collect particulate fractions of ambient air over a one year period at urban and rural sites. The majority of FRs were found on the finest aerosols (<0.95 mu m). Concentrations of HBCD were higher than those of SPBDEs. Moreover, we noted seasonality and spatial differences in particle size distributions, yet a large portion of the observed differences were due to differences in particulate matter (PM) itself. When normalized by PM, the size distributions of the FRs exhibited much greater heterogeneity. Differences existed between the FR distributions by molecular weight, with the higher molecular weight FRs (e.g., BDE-209, Dechlorane Plus) distributed more uniformly across all particulate size fractions. The seasonal, spatial, and compound-specific differences are of crucial importance when estimating dry and wet deposition of FRs as smaller aerosols have longer atmospheric residence times. Estimated wet and dry deposition of four representative FRs (BDE-47, BDE-209, HBCD, and Dechlorane Plus) using size-segregated aerosol data resulted in lower deposition estimates than when bulk aerosol data were used. This has implications for estimates of long-range atmospheric transport and atmospheric residence times, as it suggests that without size-specific distributions, these parameters could be underestimated for FRs.					; Klanova, Jana/H-1207-2012; Melymuk, Lisa/H-1061-2017; Čupr, Pavel/H-4180-2012; Kukucka, Petr/F-7064-2016; Melymuk, Lisa/AAF-2526-2021; Cupr, Pavel/H-4180-2012	Kukucka, Petr/0000-0003-1733-8334; Klanova, Jana/0000-0002-8818-5307; Vojta, Simon/0000-0003-4528-8346; Melymuk, Lisa/0000-0001-6042-7688; Cupr, Pavel/0000-0002-3848-7091													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 16	2014	48	24					14426	14434		10.1021/es5044547	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es5044547								25380095					WOS:000346686100045

These gases can be produced by microbial organic carbon decomposition, but little is known about the microbiota and its participation in GHG production and consumption in these environments. In this paper we analyzed the sediment microbiota of three eutrophic tropical urban freshwater reservoirs, in different seasons and evaluated the correlations between microorganisms and the atmospheric CH4 and CO2 flows, also correlating them to limnological variables. Our results showed that deeper water columns promote high methanogen abundance, with predominance of acetoclastic Methanosaeta spp. and hydrogenotrophs Methanoregula spp. and Methanolinea spp. The aerobic methanotrophic community was affected by dissolved total carbon (DTC) and was dominated by Crenothrix spp. However, both relative abundance of the total methanogenic and aerobic methanotrophic communities in sediments were uncoupled to CH4 and CO2 flows. Network based approach showed that fermentative microbiota, including Leptolinea spp. and Longilinea spp., which produces substrates for methanogenesis, influence CH4 flows and was favored by anthropogenic pollution, such as untreated sewage loads. Additionally, less polluted conditions favored probable anaerobic methanotrophs such as Candidatus Bathyarchaeota, Sva0485, NC10, and MBG-D/DHVEG-1, which promoted lower gaseous flows, confirming the importance of sanitation improvement to reduce these flows in tropical urban freshwater reservoirs and their local and global warming impact.

Terrestrial Origin for Abundant Riverine Nanoscale Ice-Nucleating Particles	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) associated with fresh waters are a neglected, but integral component of the water cycle. Abundant INPs were identified from surface waters of both the Maumee River and Lake Erie with ice nucleus spectra spanning a temperature range from -3 to -15 degrees C. The majority of river INPs were submicron in size and attributed to biogenic macromolecules, inferred from the denaturation of ice-nucleation activity by heat. In a watershed dominated by row-crop agriculture, higher concentrations of INPs were found in river samples compared to lake samples. Further, ice-nucleating temperatures differed between river and lake samples, which indicated different populations of INPs. Seasonal analysis of INPs that were active at warmer temperatures (>=-10 degrees C; INP-10) showed their concentration to correlate with river discharge, suggesting a watershed origin of these INPs. A terrestrial origin for INPs in the Maumee River was further supported by a correspondence between the ice-nucleation signatures of river INPs and INPs derived from the soil fungus Mortierella alpina. Aerosols derived from turbulence features in the river carry INP-10, although their potential influence on regional weather is unclear. INP-10 contained within aerosols generated from a weir spanning the river, ranged in concentration from 1 to 11 INP m(-3), which represented a fold-change of 3.2 over average INP-10 concentrations sampled from aerosols at control locations.					; Frohlich-Nowoisky, Janine/D-6227-2015; McKay, Robert/P-3759-2017; Hartmann, Susan/T-4222-2018; Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010; Wex, Heike/X-5882-2018; Froehlich, Janine/D-6227-2015	Grawe, Sarah/0000-0001-6621-574X; Frohlich-Nowoisky, Janine/0000-0002-1278-0054; McKay, Robert/0000-0003-2723-5371; Glasgo, Liz/0000-0002-0537-0647; Hartmann, Susan/0000-0002-9556-2772; Hill, Thomas/0000-0002-5293-3959; Wex, Heike/0000-0003-2129-9323; Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896; Reitz, Laura/0000-0001-8185-0880													0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 6	2018	52	21					12358	12367		10.1021/acs.est.8b03881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b03881								30264996					WOS:000449722200040

In this study, we analyzed the physical, chemical, and biological data from the lower Nakdong River in South Korea from 2005 to 2009 before weir construction and from 2012 to 2016 after weir construction. A partial least square path model (PLS-PM) was applied to delineate the complex interrelationships of diatoms and cyanobacteria with physico-chemical parameters, nutrients, zooplankton grazing, and hydrological parameters. Inferential modeling using the hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) allowed the identification of differences in the importance and threshold conditions of population dynamics drivers of diatoms and cyanobacteria before and after flow regulation. The annually averaged trajectories of limnological variables displayed significant shifts in seasonality and magnitudes of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and nutrient concentrations between the two periods. The results of PLS-PM indicated that, after flow regulation, diatoms and cyanobacteria were directly affected by nutrients and zooplankton densities and the path coefficients of hydrological parameters decreased or even were insignificant. The inferential models suggested that diatom dynamics were essentially shaped by threshold conditions of water temperature (WT) and pH before regulation, but mainly by those of rotifers (below 51.1 ind. L-1) after regulation. As for cyanobacteria dynamics, WT was identified as a critical threshold condition before and after regulation, and the threshold of PO4- concentration above 145.4 L-1 was identified as the reason for occasional blooms during the post-regulation period. Overall, the results suggest that flow regulation gradually alters habitat conditions typically of rivers to those of stagnant waters. These findings must be taken into account for sustainable management strategies of regulated rivers.

Contamination and Ecological Hazard Assessment of Heavy Metals in Freshwater Sediments and Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) Fish Muscles in a Nile River Canal in Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Heavy metal residues in sediment and Oreochromis niloticus fish muscles, collected from a Nile River Canal (Bahr Shebeen Canal), Egypt, were investigated from September 2014 to December 2015. The spatial and seasonal distributions of Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn are described and discussed. Relative abundance of these metals in sediment was found as follows: Fe > Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd. Indices of pollution were used to detect the degree of sediment contamination and indicated elevated concentrations likely to adversely affect benthic and benthic-associated organisms. Anthropogenic activities strongly influenced metal occurrence in sediments. Accumulation of heavy metals in fish muscular tissue was found to be nearly comparable to the sediment. Relative abundance of metals in fish tissue followed the trend of Fe > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cd. Fish can be used as a surrogate for heavy metals pollution. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) in fish muscle showed the following trend: Pb > Zn > Cu > Fe > Cd. Levels of most selected heavy metals detected in muscular tissue of fish were below admissible limits set by different organizations. However, HI (hazard index) showed that the cumulative risk effects are of considerable concern, especially where fish consumption is high. Consequently, it is recommended that discharged water containing pollutants should be prioritized to include continuous monitoring, and adequate public awareness.

The palaeoenvironmental, paleoclimatic and palaeogeographic significance of such saline lake carbonates has been deciphered on the basis of a multi-proxy analyses including: 1) depositional and diagenetic features; 2) biological components (molluscs, benthic foraminifera, characean gyrogonites, spores and pollens); 3) carbon and oxygen stable isotopes; 4) trace elements; and 5) clay mineralogy. Five stages of lacustrine system evolution have been identified: 1) fresh-water closed lake under dry climate (unit U1); 2) fresh to brackish water lacustrine deltaic system with a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentation under relatively wet climatic conditions (unit U2); 3) saltwater lacustrine carbonate system under humid climatic setting (unit U3); 4) evaporitic lake (unit U4); and 5) closed lake with shallow-water carbonate sedimentation under subtropical to Mediterranean climate with dry seasons (unit U5). Upper Eocene aridification is evidenced to have started as early as the earliest Priabonian (unit U1: MP17A mammal zone). A change from humid to dryer climatic conditions is recorded between units U3 and U4. The early to middle Priabonian saline lake is interpreted as an athalassic (inland) lake that have been transiently connected with neighboring salt lakes influenced by seawater and/or fed with sulfates deriving from recycling of evaporites. Maximum of connection with neighboring saline lakes (Mormoiron Basin, Camargue and Central grabens, Herault Basin) likely occurred during unit U3 and at the base of unit U5. The most likely sources of salts of these adjacent basins are: 1) Triassic evaporites derived from salt-diapirs (Rhone valley) or from paleo-outcrops located east of the Durance fault or offshore in the Gulf of Lion; or 2) marine incursions from the south, through Paleogene grabens in the Gulf of Lion.

Do storm synoptic patterns affect biogeochemical fluxes from temperate deciduous forest canopies?	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The volumetric quantity and biogeochemical quality of throughfall and stemflow in forested ecosystems are influenced by biological characteristics as well environmental and storm meteorological conditions. Previous attempts at connecting forest water and nutrient cycles to storm characteristics have focused on individual meteorological variables, but we propose a unified approach by examining the storm system in its entirety. In this study, we use methods from synoptic climatology to distinguish sub-canopy biogeochemical fluxes between storm events to understand the response of forest ecosystems to daily weather patterns. For solute inputs tied to atmospheric deposition (NH4 (+), NO3 (-), SO4 (2-), Na+, Cl-), stagnant air masses resulted in high inputs in rainfall (273.42, 81.81, 52.30, 156.99, 128.70 mu mol L-1), throughfall (355.05, 130.66, 83.24, 239.55, 261.32 mu mol L-1), and stemflow (338.34, 182.75, 153.74, 125.75, 272.88 mu mol L-1). For inputs tied to canopy exchange (DOC, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), a clear distinction was observed between throughfall and stemflow pathways. The largest throughfall concentrations were in the Great Lakes Low (1794.80, 352.96, 72.75, 74.37 mu mol L-1) while the largest stemflow concentrations were in the Weak Upper Trough (3681.78, 497.34, 82.36, 72.46 mu mol L-1). Stemflow leaching is likely derived from a larger reservoir of leachable cations in the tree canopy than throughfall, with stemflow fluxes maximized during synoptic types with greater rainfall amounts and throughfall fluxes diluted. For flux-based enrichment ratios, water volume, storm magnitude, antecedent dry period, and seasonality were important factors, further illustrating the influence of synoptic characteristics on wash-off, leaching and, ultimately, dilution processes within the canopy.

The strontium and neodymium isotope composition of the terrigenous fraction and the major element distribution reveal large and abrupt changes in source, oscillating between a dominant aeolian Saharan contribution during arid periods and a dominant Nile River contribution during pluvial periods. Iron content shows a strong correlation with strontium and neodymium isotopes. This allows the use of a high-resolution continuous Fe record as a proxy of Blue Nile sediment input over the last 100,000 years. The detailed Fe record, with approximately 10 years resolution during pluvial periods, is consistent with subtropical African records of well-dated lake level fluctuations and thus constitutes a first continuous high resolution record of the East African monsoon regime intensity over Ethiopia. The detailed Fe record shows the two main known pluvial periods attributed to strengthening of the African monsoon over Ethiopia, the Nabtian period from 14 to 8 ka cal BP and the Saharan period from 98 to 72 ka BR For the first time, the last glacial period (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2,3 and 4) is documented with a continuous record showing large oscillations between high and low East African palaeo-monsoon regimes. The end of the Nabtian period occurred at 8 ka in core MS27PT, i.e. much earlier than on the East Equatorial African region where it ended around 5.5 ka. We interpret this as evidence that the southward shift of the rain belt occurred 3000 years earlier over the Eastern Ethiopian Highland and propose that the gradual southward migration of the rain belt was associated with highly variable intensity and longer rainy seasons from 8 to 5 ka. During the last glacial period, two wet periods are present around 60-50 ka BP and 38-30 ka BP. These two humid periods are in phase with the rise of atmospheric CH4 concentrations suggesting that wetland tropical African area was one of the sources of the atmospheric CH4 during the MIS 3. During the Last Glacial Maximum and MIS 4, high Saharan aeolian influxes in phase with records of aeolian dust deposited in East Antarctica are documented. This study highlights the importance of reconstructions of monsoon rainfall fluctuation at high temporal resolution to better understand the link between low- and high-latitude climate variability at millennial timescales.

This morphologically conspicuous freshwater bacterium is a rare example of as-yet-uncultivated prokaryotes with validly published names and unknown identity. We report the results of molecular identification of this elusive bacterium, which was detected in a eutrophic boreal lake in Northern Russia. By using high-performance cell sorting, P. bekefii-like cell rosettes were selectively enriched from lake water. The retrieved 16S rRNA gene sequence was nearly identical to those in dozens of metagenomes assembled from freshwater lakes during cyanobacterial blooms and was phylogenetically placed within a large group of environmental sequences originating from various freshwater habitats worldwide. In contrast, 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to all currently described members of the order Planctomycetales was only 83%-92%. The metagenome assembled for P. bekefii reached 43% genome coverage and showed the potential for degradation of peptides, pectins, and sulfated polysaccharides. Tracing the seasonal dynamics of P. bekefii by Illumina paired-end sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments and by fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that these bacteria only transiently surpass the detection limit, with a characteristic population peak of up to 10(4) cells ml(-1) following cyanobacterial blooms.

Integrated Ichnofacies models for deserts: Recurrent patterns and megatrends	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Although it is commonly assumed that the trace-fossil record of eolian dunes and associated environments is invariably poor, a systematic review of the available information indicates that this is not necessarily the case. A model involving five main phases of colonization of desert environments through the Phanerozoic is proposed in this paper. The first phase (Cambrian-Silurian) involved animal incursions into coastal dune fields directly from the sea, although it is unlikely that these animals would have remained for long periods of time in coastal deserts. The second phase (Devonian) reflects the activities of dune pioneers that left their fluvial habitat to enter temporary or permanently into inland deserts. The third phase (Carboniferous-Permian) involved the colonization of deserts by tetrapods. The fourth phase (Triassic-Cretaceous) involved a major exploitation of the infaunal ecospace as reflected by the appearance of more varied behavioral pattems in sub-superficial structures. The fifth phase (Paleogene-Recent) reflects the appearance of the ecological dynamic that characterizes modern desert communities. The invertebrate ichnofacies for eolian dunes is re-named herein as the "Octopodichnus-Entradichnus Ichnofacies" honoring the seminal work of previous workers who simultaneously tackled the issue of eolian dune ichnofacies. The Chelichnus ichnofacies is retained for vertebrate trace-fossil assemblages in eolian settings. Both ichnofacies occur in mobile and temporary stabilized sandy substrates, subject to frequent erosion and deposition, and to strong seasonality. Desert settings consist of complex mosaics of habitats or physical units associated with organism activity. Trace-fossil distribution can be understood as reflecting the partitioning of desert settings in a mosaic of landscape units, characterized by water content and its temporal fluctuations, nutrient availability, nature of the substrate, and the dominant organisms present. In turn, desert systems are dynamic entities that change as a response to regional climate. Landscape units, such as eolian sand seas, salt flat and playa lake systems, ephemeral rivers and alluvial fans, interact in response to regional scale climate variations in hyper-arid, arid, and semiarid climatic settings. Ancient deserts completely developed under hyper-arid climatic conditions rarely preserve trace fossils due to the absence of moisture near the surface. However, the alternation of wet periods may represent windows for life development and thus, preservation of biogenic structures. Arid deserts display complex patterns of dunes combined with dry, wet, and flooded interdunes. Dry desert elements (e.g. dunes, interdunes, sand sheets) typically record the Entradichnus-Octopodichnus and Chelichnus Ichnofacies. Slight rises in regional precipitation produce elevation of the water table and increase of fluvial discharges that provide water and sediment to the system These processes may result in the local concentration of trace fossils in wet interdunes and ephemeral fluvial systems, illustrating the Scoyenia and Chelichnus Ichnofacies. In semiarid systems playa lakes expand by the addition of freshwater, evolving into freshwater lakes, and fluvial systems may become more common; lake margins and fluvial overbanks typically contain trace-fossil assemblages that may be ascribed to the Scoyenia Ichnofacies.

While recent studies have shown that water plays a major role in modulating sliding velocities, the impact it might have on erosion rates is still unclear. Here we incorporate subglacial hydrology into a glacial erosion model that is based on a sliding rule. Our results explicitly highlight that adding subglacial hydrology has profound impacts on the temporal and spatial patterns of glacial erosion. First, it suggests that erosion might mainly occur during melting seasons, when subglacial water pressure is large and effective pressure is low (i.e., before the channels fully develop and reduce the water pressure at the ice bedrock interface), which promotes sliding and erosion. Second, the distribution of erosion is bimodal with a peak at the equilibrium line altitude and, as we demonstrate, enhanced erosion at much lower altitudes within the ablation area where water due to melting abounds. This has important implications because it explains why glacial erosion can simultaneously set a limit on the mean elevation of mountain ranges and carve large fjords or glacial lakes.

In reservoirs, zooplankton strongly interact with the physical and chemical characteristics of water, and this interaction is mainly influenced by climate variation and the different methods used to manage the dam water level. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate how the distinct operating modes of two cascade reservoirs affected the richness, abundance, and composition of zooplankton, both spatially (intra and inter-reservoirs) and temporally (annual and seasonal). In this study, the upstream reservoir (Salto Santiago) operates using the storage method, with a water retention time (WRT) of 51 days, whereas the downstream reservoir (Salto Osorio) operates using the run-of-river method, with a WRT of 16 days. Methods. Zooplankton samples were collected for 16 consecutive years from the two reservoirs located on the Iguacu River, Brazil. A total of 720 samples were collected. Four-way ANOVAs were used to determine the differences in richness and abundance of the zooplankton among years, periods, reservoirs, and environments. Multidimensional non-metric scaling (NMDS) and an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) were used to describe similarity patterns in species composition. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to select the environmental predictors that best explained the variation in zooplankton abundance data. Results. We identified a total of 115 taxa in this study, and rotifers were the richest group. In contrast, the copepods were the most abundant. The four-way ANOVA results showed significant differences in the species richness and abundance of the zooplankton among years, periods, reservoirs, and environments. The NMDS ordination and ANOSIM test indicated that the largest differences in zooplankton species composition were annual and seasonal differences. Finally, the CCA showed that these differences were mainly associated with changes in water transparency, temperature, and the chlorophyll a, phosphorus, and total dissolved solids concentrations. Discussion. Inter-annual changes in zooplankton species composition showed that over time, large filters-feeders (e.g., large daphinids and calanoid copepods) were replaced by small cladocerans (e.g., bosminids) and generalist rotifers. The highest species richness was associated with the fluvial environment, whereas the highest abundance was associated with the transitional and lacustrine reservoir environments. Variations in water temperature, nutrients, and food availability explained the annual and seasonal changes in community structure, whereas variations in the water flow characteristics of the environments explained the longitudinal changes in the richness and abundance of zooplankton in reservoirs. The differences in zooplankton structure between the two reservoirs can be explained by the functional differences between the two systems, such as their WRTs and morphometrics.

To improve our understanding on the anthropogenic and climatic influences on landscape development in Southern Greece for the last 2500 years, we report a 2 m-long, continuous high-resolution sedimentary record from shallow Lake Stymphalia (Peloponnese, Greece). Our proxies record climatically as well as anthropogenically induced landscape changes, influencing the lake area and lake depth. The Classical-Hellenistic era reflects a moderate, stable Mediterranean climate with low sedimentation rates. The parallel existence of the highly populated, major ancient city of Stymphalos, on the contemporary lake edge, doesn't seem to have caused lasting alterations in the record. The construction of the Hadrianic Aqueduct in the Roman era, ca. 130 AD, however causes an influential transformation in the lake development. It has a lasting effect on the lake hydrology as well as the vulnerability of this ecosystem. During Late Roman times, 5th to 6th century cal AD, the abandonment of the aqueduct combined with cooler climate conditions allows lake levels to recover. A phase of very high climatic instability was identified for the subsequent Early Byzantine (EB) period, during the 7th and 8th century cal AD. For this period, the later phase of the Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA), our proxies indicate further cooling and highly fluctuating water availability in a rather small lake area. The Middle Byzantine (MB) Period (9th-12th century AD) is characterized by an over fivefold increase in sedimentation rates. Since local population was still well below Classical levels, we explain this singular period through an interaction of modest increase in land use but marked by careless management of deforested areas, warm and wet climatic conditions during the Medieval Warm Period and long-term effects of vulnerability caused by the aqueduct construction. Probably during this phase, the lake level rose through unparalleled sedimentary infill to flood and bury a significant part of the Lower Town of the abandoned ancient city. The Late Byzantine Period (13th and 14th century AD) sees core evidence for erosion of established, non-vegetated soils (high magnetic susceptibility), in a period of almost total depopulation. In the subsequent Ottoman era (late 15th - early 19th centuries AD) local settlement made only slight recovery, the climatic conditions seem less stable during the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the lake seasonally and later periodically starts to dry up, cumulating in a longer dry phase at the end of the 19th century AD, when agricultural activity on the polje floor was possible. The conclusion conforms with recent modelling of environmental change, critical of mono-causation, rather focussing on complex interactions of human and natural factors in the inception of landscape transformation.

We present an experiment that allows disentangling the contribution of abiotic and biotic differences in shaping the response to two aspects of temperature change: permanent increase of mean temperature versus pulse disturbance in form of a heat wave. We used natural communities from six different sites of a floodplain system as well as artificially mixed communities from laboratory cultures and grew both, artificial and natural communities, in water from the six different floodplain lakes (sites). All 12 contexts (2 communities x 6 sites) were first exposed to three different temperature levels (12, 18, 24 A degrees C, respectively) and afterward to temperature pulses (4 A degrees C increase for 7 h day(-1)). Temperature-dependent changes in biomass and community composition depended on the initial composition of phytoplankton communities. Abiotic conditions had a major effect on biomass of phytoplankton communities exposed to different temperature conditions, however, the effect of biotic and abiotic conditions together was even more pronounced. Additionally, phytoplankton community responses to pulse temperature effects depended on the warming history. By disentangling abiotic and biotic effects, our study shows that temperature-dependent effects on phytoplankton communities depend on both, biotic and abiotic constraints.

Wildlife roadkill patterns on a major highway in northern Tanzania	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												Despite expanding road networks, there is limited understanding of the effects of roads on wildlife in East Africa. We present a baseline survey and describe the patterns of roadkill in the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem of Tanzania. A 75 km stretch of the Arusha Highway that passes adjacent to Manyara Ranch and Lake Manyara National Park was studied for 10 consecutive days in November 2013 (the rainy season). Wildlife species killed on the road, roadkill frequency and road characteristics were determined. A total of 101 roadkill were recorded (0.13 roadkill km(-1)) comprising 37 species from all terrestrial vertebrate groups, of which two species, house cat (Felis catus) and domestic dog (Canis lupus), were domesticated species. Birds were the most frequently killed taxon (50%), followed by mammals (30%), reptiles (17%) and amphibians (3%). Excluding birds, roadkill primarily consisted of nocturnal species (65%) versus diurnal species (35%). Most roadkill (77.3%) were encountered on road stretches adjacent to protected areas of Manyara Ranch and Lake Manyara National Park compared with 22.7% on the road stretches adjacent to non-protected areas. These findings highlight that roads are a potential threat to wildlife in East Africa and serve as a baseline for future comparisons.

Rainfall variables and indicators from rainfall readings at 42 stations in Malawi, excluding Lake Malawi, were analysed at monthly, seasonal and annual scales. In the study, the data were firstly subjected to quality checks through the cumulative deviations test and the standard normal homogeneity test. Spatial rainfall variability was investigated using the spatial correlation function. Temporal trends were analysed using Mann-Kendall and linear regression methods. Heterogeneity of monthly rainfall was investigated using the precipitation concentration index (PCI). Finally, inter-annual and intra-annual rainfall variability were tested using normalized precipitation anomaly series of annual rainfall series (|AR|) and the PCI (|APCI|), respectively. The results showed that (1) most stations revealed statistically non-significant decreasing rainfall trends for annual, seasonal, monthly and the individual months from March to December at the 5% significance level. The months of January and February (the highest rainfall months), however, had overall positive but statistically non-significant trends countrywide, suggesting more concentration of the seasonal rainfall around these months. (2) Spatial analysis results showed a complex rainfall pattern countrywide with annual mean of 1,095 mm centred to the south of the country and mean inter-annual variability of 26%. (3) Spatial correlation amongst stations was highest only within the first 20 km, typical of areas with strong small-scale climatic influence. (4) The country was further characterised by unstable monthly rainfall regimes, with all PCIs more than 10. (5) An increase in inter-annual rainfall variability was found.

E.			Aram Dorsum: An Extensive Mid-Noachian Age Fluvial Depositional System in Arabia Terra, Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												A major debate in Mars science is the nature of the early Mars climate, and the availability of precipitation and runoff. Observations of relict erosional valley networks have been proposed as evidence for extensive surface runoff around the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. However, these valley networks only provide a time-integrated record of landscape evolution, and thus, the timing, relative timescales and intensity of aqueous activity required to erode the valleys remain unknown. Here, we investigate an ancient fluvial sedimentary system in western Arabia Terra, now preserved in positive relief. This ridge, "Aram Dorsum," is flat-topped, branching, similar to 85 km long, and particularly well preserved. We show that Aram Dorsum was an aggradational alluvial system and that the existing ridge was once a large river channel belt set in extensive flood plains, many of which are still preserved. Smaller, palaeochannel belts feed the main system; their setting and network pattern suggest a distributed source of water. The alluvial succession is up to 60 m thick, suggesting a formation time of 10(5) to 10(7) years by analogy to Earth. Our observations are consistent with Aram Dorsum having formed by long-lived flows of water, sourced both locally, and regionally as part of a wider alluvial system in Arabia Terra. This suggests frequent or seasonal precipitation as the source of water. Correlating our observations with previous regional-scale mapping shows that Aram Dorsum formed in the mid-Noachian. Aram Dorsum is one of the oldest fluvial systems described on Mars and indicates climatic conditions that sustained surface river flows on early Mars. Plain Language Summary The oldest regions of Mars contain ancient valleys, carved by running water, and sinuous ridges, often interpreted as the remnants of former riverbeds, left upstanding by erosion. These "inverted channel" systems provide insight into Mars's ancient climate and hydrologic cycle. We use high-resolution satellite images to investigate "Aram Dorsum," an 85 km long ridge system in the Arabia Terra region. Our observations show that Aram Dorsum is composed of sedimentary rocks, originally deposited in rivers or their adjacent floodplains. The Aram Dorsum sedimentary material is up to 60mthick, which, by comparison with similar sedimentary deposits on Earth, suggests that the Aram Dorsum river system was active for between 10,000 and 10 million years. Our study also indicates that Aram Dorsum was formed around 3.9 billion years ago, an age consistent with other evidence for ancient rivers and lakes in this region. The water that flowed within the rivers at Aram Dorsum probably came from both locally and regionally generated rainfall or snowfall, rather than a single point source of water, such as large distant ice sheets. Our observations therefore point to an ancient Martian climate that supported precipitation and river flow for thousands or millions of years.

J	Getahun, YS; Li, MH; Chen, PY				Getahun, Yitea Seneshaw; Li, Ming-Hsu; Chen, Pei-Yuan			Assessing Impact of Climate Change on Hydrology of Melka Kuntrie Subbasin, Ethiopia with Ar4 and Ar5 Projections	WATER												Assessing future challenges in water resources management is crucial to the Melka Kuntrie (MK) subbasin suffering water shortage. Impact assessments are evaluated by the HBV hydrological model with six scenarios, including two GCMs of AR4-A2 and two GCMs of AR5-RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, for the time periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100. Evapotranspiration is expected to increase under all scenarios-due to rising temperature-and induce more water stress on rainfed agriculture of the area. However, the increase in the monthly minimum temperature is beneficial to crops against chilling damages. Five out of six projections show significant increases of rainfall and streamflow in both annual and major rainy seasons, except ECHAM-A2. Annual rainfall (streamflow) is expected to increase by 38% (23%) and 57% (49%) during 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, respectively, under RCP8.5 scenarios. Greater flashflood risk is a concern because of the projected increase in streamflow. The projection of decreased streamflow with ECHAM-A2 will exacerbate the existing water shortage, especially in the minor rainy season. Water harvesting during the major rainy season would be vital to enhance water management capacities and reduce flashflood risks. Lacking sufficient hydraulic and irrigation infrastructures, the MK subbasin will be more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.					; Li, Ming-Hsu/AAD-4938-2020; Getahun, Yitea Seneshaw/AAS-9048-2021	Li, Ming-Hsu/0000-0003-3383-6130; Getahun, Yitea Seneshaw/0000-0001-6479-1954														2073-4441				MAY	2020	12	5							1308	10.3390/w12051308	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12051308													WOS:000555915200087

The influence of permafrost thawing on lake expansion is significant but rarely considered in previous studies. In this study, based on Landsat images and permafrost field data, the spatial-temporal area changes of lakes of more than 5 km(2) in the endorheic basin on the QTP during 2000-2017 is examined and the impact of permafrost degradation on lake expansion is discussed. The main results are that permafrost characteristics and its degradation trend have close relationships with lake changes. Lake expansion in the endorheic basin showed a southwest-northeast transition from shrinking to stable to rapidly expanding, which corresponded well with the permafrost distribution from island-discontinuous to seasonally frozen ground to continuous permafrost. A dramatic lake expansion in continuous permafrost showed significant spatial differences; lakes expanded significantly in northern and eastern continuous permafrost with a higher ground ice content but slightly in southern continuous permafrost with a lower ground ice content. This spatial pattern was mainly attributed to the melting of ground ice in shallow permafrost associated with accelerating permafrost degradation. Whereas, some lakes in the southern zones of island-discontinuous permafrost were shrinking, which was mainly because the extended taliks arising from the intensified permafrost degradation have facilitated surface water and suprapermafrost groundwater discharge to subpermafrost groundwater and thereby drained the lakes. Based on observation and simulated data, the melting of ground ice at shallow depths below the permafrost table accounted for 21.2% of the increase in lake volume from 2000 to 2016.

J	Blöthe, JH; Rosenwinkel, S; Höser, T; Korup, O				Bloethe, Jan H.; Rosenwinkel, Swenja; Hoeser, Thorsten; Korup, Oliver			Rock-glacier dams in High Asia	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Rock glaciers in semiarid mountains contain large amounts of ice and might be important water stores aside from glaciers, lakes, and rivers. Yet whether and how rock glaciers interact with river channels in mountain valleys remains largely unresolved. We examine the potential for rock glaciers to block or disrupt river channels, using a new inventory of more than 2000 intact rock glaciers that we mapped from remotely sensed imagery in the Karakoram (KR), Tien Shan (TS), and Altai (ALT) mountains. We find that between 5% and 14% of the rock glaciers partly buried, blocked, diverted or constricted at least 95 km of mountain rivers in the entire study area. We use a Bayesian robust logistic regression with multiple topographic and climatic inputs to discern those rock glaciers disrupting mountain rivers from those with no obvious impacts. We identify elevation and potential incoming solar radiation (PISR), together with the size of feeder basins, as dominant predictors, so that lower-lying and larger rock glaciers from larger basins are more likely to disrupt river channels. Given that elevation and PISR are key inputs for modelling the regional distribution of mountain permafrost from the positions of rock-glacier toes, we infer that river-blocking rock glaciers may be diagnostic of non-equilibrated permafrost. Principal component analysis adds temperature evenness and wet-season precipitation to the controls that characterise rock glaciers impacting on rivers. Depending on the choice of predictors, the accuracy of our classification is moderate to good with median posterior area-under-the-curve values of 0.71-0.89. Clarifying whether rapidly advancing rock glaciers can physically impound rivers, or fortify existing dams instead, deserves future field investigation. We suspect that rock-glacier dams are conspicuous features that have a polygenetic history and encourage more research on the geomorphic coupling between permafrost lobes, river channels, and the sediment cascades of semiarid mountain belts.

We evaluated the potentially crucial factors influencing the algal chlorophyll (CHL-a), nutrients, and the links between the rainfall and other vital elements in a large multipurpose reservoir (Yongdam Reservoir) during 2013-2019. We developed the empirical models on algal CHL-a, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and TN:TP's ambient ratios considering the maneuvering influence of Asian monsoons. The intensive rainfall during the monsoon months strongly impacted the nutrient regime and other vital factors. The seasonal patterns of algal CHL-a varied in response to the nutrient contents (TN, TP), suspended solids, and ambient N:P ratios along the longitudinal gradient. The conditional plot analysis, empirical modeling, and observations supported an overall P-limitation scenario, as was evident from the magnitude of N:P ratios (R-2 = 0.36, F = 24.9, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the reservoir's trophic status alluded to the larger particles and blue-green algae during the monsoon and postmonsoon months. The correlation analysis, Mann-Kendall trend test, and principal component analysis illustrated compelling links between CHL-a, TP, and rainfall regime. The outcomes suggested the reservoir was primarily controlled by phosphorus limitation, with an increasing CHL-a tendency along with nitrogen dilution. However, a slight decline in phosphorus was also detected. The Yongdam Reservoir is under the threat of recurrent eutrophication events that could jeopardize this vital drinking water facility due to increasing agricultural and anthropic activities.

Engaging fathers to improve complementary feeding is acceptable and feasible in the Lake Zone, Tanzania	MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION												In Tanzania, suboptimal complementary feeding practices contribute to high stunting rates. Fathers influence complementary feeding practices, and effective strategies are needed to engage them. The objectives of this research were to examine the acceptability and feasibility of (1) tailored complementary feeding recommendations and (2) engaging fathers in complementary feeding. We conducted trials of improved practices with 50 mothers and 40 fathers with children 6-18 months. At visit 1, mothers reported current feeding practices and fathers participated in focus group discussions. At visit 2, mothers and fathers received individual, tailored counselling and chose new practices to try. After 2 weeks, at visit 3, parents were interviewed individually about their experiences. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically. The most frequent feeding issues at visit 1 were the need to thicken porridge, increase dietary diversity, replace sugary snacks and drinks and feed responsively. After counselling, most mothers agreed to try practices to improve diets and fathers agreed to provide informational and instrumental support for complementary feeding, but few agreed to try feeding the child. At follow-up, mothers reported improved child feeding and confirmed fathers' reports of increased involvement. Most fathers purchased or provided funds for recommended foods; some helped with domestic tasks or fed children. Many participants reported improved spousal communication and cooperation. Families were able to practice recommendations to feed family foods, but high food costs and seasonal unavailability were challenges. It was feasible and acceptable to engage fathers in complementary feeding, but additional strategies are needed to address economic and environmental barriers.					; Kerr, Rachel/AAQ-6552-2020	Owoputi, Ibukun/0000-0002-5508-5166; Martin, Stephanie/0000-0002-0378-802X; Bezner Kerr, Rachel/0000-0003-4525-6096; 													1740-8695	1740-8709				JUL	2021	17			1	SI				e13144	10.1111/mcn.13144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13144								34241956					WOS:000672049600012

Hydrological and Water Quality Trends through the Lens of Historical Operation Schedules in Lake Okeechobee	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Water management operations can drive long-term water quality patterns in nutrient-enriched lakes and reservoirs. This study identified multidecadal trends of rainfall, flow, water levels, total phosphorous (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and Chlorophyll-a in the water column and eight (dis)tributaries during four specific operation schedules (1974-1990, 1991-1999, 2000-2007, and 2008-2019) in Lake Okeechobee (Florida). We found an increasing trend in water discharges towards the Gulf of Mexico (via the Caloosahatchee River) during the dry season for the entire 46 years, and a decreasing trend in discharges towards the Atlantic Ocean (via the St. Lucie Canal) during 2008-2019. Higher flows, combined with increasing TP concentrations in the lake and the Caloosahatchee, led to significant increases in monthly TP mass loads to the Gulf of Mexico by up to 122%-158% during 2008-2019. Higher flows in the Caloosahatchee also resulted in a net TN load increase to the Gulf, despite system-wide decreases in TN concentrations. Overall, results from this study demonstrate that reservoir operations could have long-term effects on nutrient status and exports; thus, modifying operations should be considered as a potential nutrient management tool.

Remotes sensors, such as Landsat, have been providing data since the last four decades, which are useful for extracting land cover types such as forest and water. Researchers have proposed many surface water extraction techniques, among which index-based methods are popular owing to their simplicity and cost effectiveness. By using the standard and Otsu threshold methods, water features can be mapped, thus changes can be detected. On the basis of the results of this study, the following water indices were applied, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), water ratio index (WRI), and simple water index (SWI) for surface water extraction, and their changes using Landsat images. Three unique test sites from Nepal, which represent overall types of water features found in the country, were selected for this study. A model was developed in ArcGIS to differentiate the water features based on index methods and changes were calculated in terms of positive and negative. The results show that most of the case water index methods based on standard and Otsu thresholds cannot accurately separate water from its nearby backgrounds, such as melting ice, shadows of hills with or without vegetation, grasslands, and wet barren sand. From the current cases, it is not recommended to use the water indices in Nepal without any appropriate expert opinion or sitewise calibrated thresholding for automated water detection. However, they can be used for the overall change detection. Most of the change maps of the selected lakes showed good accuracies in some unique cases, such as the dark shadow and forest near a water body. SWI is good for stagnant lakes but not for water bodies with shifting features, such as the Koshi River. The model can be very useful in quickly understanding the changes in water bodies and taking the necessary measures to planners, but not much in accurate mapping. Furthermore, studies of different seasons, sensor data, and sites are necessary in the use of standard water indices for accurate change detection.

J	Lindner, F; Walter, F; Laske, G; Gimbert, F				Lindner, Fabian; Walter, Fabian; Laske, Gabi; Gimbert, Florent			Glaciohydraulic seismic tremors on an Alpine glacier	CRYOSPHERE												Hydraulic processes impact viscous and brittle ice deformation. Water-driven fracturing as well as turbulent water flow within and beneath glaciers radiate seismic waves which provide insights into otherwise hard-to-access englacial and subglacial environments. In this study, we analyze glaciohydraulic tremors recorded by four seismic arrays installed in different parts of Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Switzerland. Data were recorded during the 2016 melt season including the sudden subglacial drainage of an ice-marginal lake. Together with our seismic data, discharge, lake level, and ice flow measurements provide constraints on glacier hydraulics. We find that the tremors are generated by subglacial water flow, in moulins, and by icequake bursts. The dominating process can vary on sub-kilometer and sub-daily scales. Consistent with field observations, continuous source tracking via matched-field processing suggests a gradual upglacier progression of an efficient drainage system as the melt season progresses. The ice-marginal lake likely connects to this drainage system via hydrofracturing, which is indicated by sustained icequake signals emitted from the proximity of the lake basin and starting roughly 24 h prior to the lake drainage. To estimate the hydraulics associated with the drainage, we use tremor-discharge scaling relationships. Our analysis suggests a pressurization of the subglacial environment at the drainage onset, followed by an increase in the hydraulic radii of the conduits and a subsequent decrease in the subglacial water pressure as the capacity of the drainage system increases. The pressurization is in phase with the drop in the lake level, and its retrieved maximum coincides with ice uplift measured via GPS. Our results highlight the use of cryo-seismology for monitoring glacier hydraulics.

Dynamic modeling of organic carbon fates in lake ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Lakes are active processors of organic carbon (OC) and play important roles in landscape and global carbon cycling. Allochthonous OC loads from the landscape, along with autochthonous OC loads from primary production, are mineralized in lakes, buried in lake sediments, and exported via surface or groundwater outflows. Although these processes provide a basis for a conceptual understanding of lake OC budgets, few studies have integrated these fluxes under a dynamic modeling framework to examine their interactions and relative magnitudes. We developed a simple, dynamic mass balance model for OC, and applied the model to a set of five lakes. We examined the relative magnitudes of OC fluxes and found that long-term (> 10 year) lake OC dynamics were predominantly driven by allochthonous loads in four of the five lakes, underscoring the importance of terrestrially-derived OC in northern lake ecosystems. Our model highlighted seasonal patterns in lake OC budgets, with increasing water temperatures and lake productivity throughout the growing season corresponding to a transition from burial- to respiration-dominated OC fates. Ratios of respiration to burial, however, were also mediated by the source (autochthonous vs. allochthonous) of total OC loads. Autochthonous OC is more readily respired and may therefore proportionally reduce burial under a warming climate, but allochthonous OC may increase burial due to changes in precipitation. The ratios of autochthonous to allochthonous inputs and respiration to burial demonstrate the importance of dynamic models for examining both the seasonal and inter-annual roles of lakes in landscape and global carbon cycling, particularly in a global change context. Finally, we highlighted critical data needs, which include surface water DOC observations in paired tributary and lake systems, measurements of OC burial rates, groundwater input volume and DOC, and budgets of particulate OC.					; Morales, Ana/AAA-1654-2020; Yang, Zutao/LSL-2505-2024; Scordo, Facundo/LSL-2910-2024; Krivak-Tetley, Flora/ABF-3277-2021; Farrell, Kaitlin/AAH-2858-2019; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020	Scordo, Facundo/0000-0001-6182-7368; Dugan, Hilary/0000-0003-4674-1149; McCullough, Ian/0000-0002-6832-674X; Farrell, Kaitlin (Kait)/0000-0002-4709-7749; Krivak-Tetley, Flora/0000-0003-3521-2460; Yang, Zutao/0000-0002-6919-569X; 													0304-3800	1872-7026				OCT 24	2018	386						71	82		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.08.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.08.009													WOS:000456907100007

Freshwater fish faunas, habitats and conservation challenges in the Caribbean river basins of north-western South America	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY					Symposium on Fish and Aquatic Habitat Conservation in South America during the 21st Brazilian Ichthyology Meeting	2015	Recife, BRAZIL					The remarkable fish diversity in the Caribbean rivers of north-western South America evolved under the influences of the dramatic environmental changes of neogene northern South America, including the Quechua Orogeny and Pleistocene climate oscillations. Although this region is not the richest in South America, endemism is very high. Fish assemblage structure is unique to each of the four aquatic systems identified (rivers, streams, floodplain lakes and reservoirs) and community dynamics are highly synchronized with the mono-modal or bi-modal flooding pulse of the rainy seasons. The highly seasonal multispecies fishery is based on migratory species. Freshwater fish conservation is a challenge for Colombian environmental institutions because the Caribbean trans-Andean basins are the focus of the economic development of Colombian society, so management measures must be directed to protect aquatic habitat and their connectivity. These two management strategies are the only way for helping fish species conservation and sustainable fisheries.

J	Xiang, J; Liu, DY; Ding, WX; Yuan, JJ; Lin, YX				Xiang, Jian; Liu, Deyan; Ding, Weixin; Yuan, Junji; Lin, Yongxin			Effects of biochar on nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions from paddy field during the wheat growth season	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Agricultural activities are an important source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). Excess nitrogen (N) fertilization in the Taihu Lake region, southeast China, has resulted in a series of environmental issues such as N2O emissions and water body eutrophication. Optimal fertilization can reduce the loss of surplus N with a penalty of no or low yield. The conversion of plant residues to biochar is an attractive strategy for mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions and for enhancing carbon storage in soil. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of biochar on N2O emissions, crop yield, and global warming potential (GWP). Five treatments were conducted with four replicates: no nitrogen fertilizer (Control), locally conventional N fertilizer (RN), optimal N fertilizer (ON), optimal N fertilizer plus low amount of biochar [3.75 t ha(-1); (ONC1)], and optimal N fertilizer plus high amount of biochar [7.50 t ha(-1); (ONC2)]. Results showed that both N2O and NO emissions increased exponentially with the N fertilizer application rate during the wheat growth season, and cumulative N2O emissions were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in the ON treatment Biochar amendment at 3.75 and 7.50 t ha(-1) did not notably reduce N2O emissions. A significant negative correlation was observed between N2O flux and the soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) in biochar amendment, and the NO/N2O ratio was almost lower than 1, except for tillering fertilization when the soil WFPS was lower, indicating that N2O was primarily produced by denitrification. The GWP was significantly mitigated in the ON treatment compared with the RN treatment, which was significantly lower in the biochar treatment (P < 0.05). The greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) also decreased from 0.039 to 0.031 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) yield after biochar addition. GWP and GHGI results indicated that the application of biochar could significantly mitigate GWP compared with the ON treatment. Our results suggest that the application of biochar slightly reduced N2O emission, which might contribute to promote the reduction N2O to N-2. Optimal N fertilization, especially, combined with biochar will exercise a greater effect for mitigating global warming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Contribution of different bacterial dispersal sources to lakes: Population and community effects in different seasons	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The diversity and composition of lake bacterial communities are driven by the interplay between local contemporary environmental conditions and dispersal of cells from the surroundings, i.e. the metacommunity. Still, a conceptual understanding of the relative importance of the two types of factors is lacking. For instance, it is unknown which sources of dispersal are most important and under which circumstances. Here, we investigated the seasonal variation in the importance of dispersal from different sources (mixing, precipitation, surface runoff and sediment resuspension) for lake bacterioplankton community and population dynamics. For that purpose, two small forest lakes and their dispersal sources were sampled over a period of 10 months. The influence of dispersal on communities and populations was determined by 454 sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and SourceTracker analysis. On the community level direct effects of dispersal were questionable from all sources. Instead we found that the community of the preceding sampling occasion, representing growth of resident bacteria, was of great importance. On the population level, however, dispersal of individual taxa from the inlet could be occasionally important even under low water flow. The effect of sediment resuspension and precipitation appeared small.					; Berga, Merce/E-3305-2018; Lindström, Eva/H-5930-2016; Logue, Jürg/AAF-7347-2020	Lindstrom, Eva/0000-0001-8920-3071; Berga, Merce/0000-0002-9518-8776; Comte, Jerome/0000-0002-7936-4290; Logue, Jurg Brendan/0000-0001-8838-0914; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUN	2017	19	6			SI		2391	2404		10.1111/1462-2920.13749	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13749								28401636					WOS:000404007700024
J	Ramaraj, M; Sivakumar, R				Ramaraj, M.; Sivakumar, Ramamoorthy			Integration of band regression empirical water quality (BREWQ) model with deep learning algorithm in spatiotemporal modeling and prediction of surface water quality parameters	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Monitoring and managing lake water quality are some of the most reminiscent of aquatic environmental challenges. Prediction of water quality parameters plays a major role in the enrichment of water resource management. This study creates and compares deep learning models such as ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system), LSTM (long short-term memory), and NAR neural networks in water quality prediction and proposes the most effective prediction model. Obtaining adequate water quality data with high precision to train and test deep learning models is sometimes challenging due to cost or technological constraints. A solution to this problem was established by developing the best band regression empirical water quality (BREWQ) model, which was used to extract seasonal water quality dataset (n = 490) from multi-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel 2A) for 2016-2021. The accuracy assessment parameters, such as coefficient of determination (R-2), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), is confined to illustrate the performance accuracy of the incorporated models. The results from this study inferred that the ANFIS model approach of Gbellmf linear, Gaussmff with the fuzzy set combination of [3 3 3 3] has the potential to predict magnesium-87.03% (MSE:8.2436, RMSE:9.92, MAPE:4.50), potassium-94.34% (MSE:6.24, RMSE: 8.06, MAPE: 31.55), sodium-96.19% (MSE:5.82, RMSE:7.36, MAPE:4.82). Secchi Disc Depth (SDD)-99.87% (MSE:3.72, RMSE:6.14, MAPE:16.03), temperature-96.2% (MSE:2.19, RMSE:3.67, MAPE:45.33), total hardness-90.31% (MSE:8.09, RMSE:10.13, MAPE: 8.91) and turbidity-60.52% (MSE:6.24, RMSE: 8.08, and MAPE:1688.43) with the least error, whereas LSTM showed the lowest error in predicting parameters such as Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)- 96.76% (MSE:8.78, RMSE:10.4502 & MAPE:16.83), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS)-84.31% (MSE:3.58, RMSE: 6.68, MAPE:35.69). On the other hand, it is revealed from this study that NARNET had less accuracy than LSTM and ANFIS in predicting water quality due to their simple network structure. In the ultramodern era, such deep-learning prediction models aid in continuously monitoring water bodies to prevent pollution.

J	Qi, L; Hu, CM; Duan, HT; Barnes, BB; Ma, RH				Qi, Lin; Hu, Chuanmin; Duan, Hongtao; Barnes, Brian B.; Ma, Ronghua			An EOF-Based Algorithm to Estimate Chlorophyll a Concentrations in Taihu Lake from MODIS Land-Band Measurements: Implications for Near Real-Time Applications and Forecasting Models	REMOTE SENSING												For near real-time water applications, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua are currently the only satellite instruments that can provide well-calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data over the global aquatic environments. However, TOA radiance data in the MODIS ocean bands over turbid atmosphere in east China often saturate, leaving only four land bands to use. In this study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been developed and validated to estimate chlorophyll a concentrations (Chla, mu g/L) in surface waters of Taihu Lake, the third largest freshwater lake in China. The EOF approach analyzed the spectral variance of normalized Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) data at 469, 555, 645, and 859 nm, and subsequently related that variance to Chla using 28 concurrent MODIS and field measurements. This empirical algorithm was then validated using another 30 independent concurrent MODIS and field measurements. Image analysis and radiative transfer simulations indicated that the algorithm appeared to be tolerant to aerosol perturbations, with unbiased RMS uncertainties of <80% for Chla ranging between 3 and 100 mu g/L. Application of the algorithm to a total of 853 MODIS images between 2000 and 2013 under cloud-free conditions revealed spatial distribution patterns and seasonal changes that are consistent to previous findings based on floating algae mats. The current study can provide additional quantitative estimates of Chla that can be assimilated in an existing forecast model, which showed improved performance over the use of a previous Chla algorithm. However, the empirical nature, relatively large uncertainties, and limited number of spectral bands all point to the need of further improvement in data availability and accuracy with future satellite sensors.

Therefore, it is vital to determine the critical underwater light climate thresholds for macrophyte degradation and recovery. In this study, we first proposed a novel index, defined as the ratio of euphotic depth (Z(eu)) to water depth (WD), as a measure of the underwater light supply for macrophytes. The underwater light environment in Lake Taihu (a large, shallow, eutrophic lake) was then characterized based on this index (Z(eu)/WD) using field measurements collected from 2006 to 2013 (8 years x 4 seasons x 32 sites). The distribution of the macrophyte presence frequency (MPF, the number of investigations that identified macrophytes divided by the total number of investigations) was greater than 0.70 in Xukou Bay and East Lake Taihu over the 32 investigations, followed by the other sites distributed in East Lake Taihu. The proportion of macrophyte coverage increased with the increase in Z(eu)/WD. A significant relationship was observed between Zeu/WD and MPF for the 19 sites with macrophytes (r(2) = 0.48, p< 0.001, n = 19). In the region with high nutrient concentrations and serious water pollution, better underwater light conditions are required for the growth of macrophytes. A Z(eu)/WD value of 0.80 can be regarded as the critical underwater light threshold for the growth of macrophytes in Lake Taihu. The region with Z(eu)/WD ranging between 0.57 and 0.80 was usually covered by sparse macrophytes; this region should be vital for macrophyte recovery and environmental management in Lake Taihu. The distribution of Z(eu)/WD was further obtained using MODIS satellite-derived Zeu from June to October in 2003 and 2013. Xukou Bay and Guangfu Bay in the southern part of Lake Taihu could be regarded as potentially crucial regions for the recovery of macrophytes from the perspective of underwater light and nutrient levels.

Results indicate that the occurrences of hydrological droughts in the catchment are different from those of meteorological drought on both a seasonal and annual basis. However, annual variability of both indices showed the same periodic variation characteristics during the study period. With comparison of the performance of SPEI and SRI time series at different timescales, our observation reveals that the two drought indices show a higher degree of similarity and correlation as timescales increased. In addition, SRI is found to be less variable than SPEI at shorter timescales and it shows an obvious hydrologic delay of about 1-2 months in response to SPEI at timescales > 12 months. Due to hydrologic detention of subsurface soil moisture, shallow groundwater and perhaps reservoir storage, a 2-month timescale of SPEI is found to be more appropriate for river discharge monitoring, especially for those rivers with similar drainage area, climate and geographical conditions as in this study region.

Source limitation of carbon gas emissions in high-elevation mountain streams and lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Inland waters are an important component of the global carbon cycle through transport, storage, and direct emissions of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere. Despite predictions of high physical gas exchange rates due to turbulent flows and ubiquitous supersaturation of CO(2)and perhaps also CH(4)patterns of gas emissions are essentially undocumented for high mountain ecosystems. Much like other headwater networks around the globe, we found that high-elevation streams in Rocky Mountain National Park, USA, were supersaturated with CO2 during the growing season and were net sources to the atmosphere. CO2 concentrations in lakes, on the other hand, tended to be less than atmospheric equilibrium during the open water season. CO2 and CH4 emissions from the aquatic conduit were relatively small compared to many parts of the globe. Irrespective of the physical template for high gas exchange (high k), we found evidence of CO2 source limitation to mountain streams during the growing season, which limits overall CO2 emissions. Our results suggest a reduced importance of aquatic ecosystems for carbon cycling in high-elevation landscapes having limited soil development and high CO2 consumption via mineral weathering.

Recent glacier retreat and climate trends in Cordillera Huaytapallana, Peru	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												We analyzed 19 annual Landsat Thematic Mapper images from 1984 to 2011 to determine changes of the glaciated surface and snow line elevation in six mountain areas of the Cordillera Huaytapallana range in Peru. In contrast to other Peruvian mountains, glacier retreat in these mountains has been poorly documented, even though this is a heavily glaciated area. These glaciers are the main source of water for the surrounding lowlands, and melting of these glaciers has triggered several outburst floods. During the 28-year study period, there was a 55% decrease in the surface covered by glaciers and the snowline moved upward in different regions by 93 to 157 m. Moreover, several new lakes formed in the recently deglaciated areas. There was an increase in precipitation during the wet season (October-April) over the 28-year study period. The significant increase in maximum temperatures may be related to the significant glacier retreat in the study area. There were significant differences in the wet season temperatures during El Nino (warmer) and La Nina (colder) years. Although La Nina years were generally more humid than El Nino years, these differences were not statistically significant. Thus, glaciers tended to retreat at a high rate during El Nino years, but tended to be stable or increase during La Nina years, although there were some notable deviations from this general pattern. Climate simulations for 2021 to 2050, based on the most optimistic assumptions of greenhouse gas concentrations, forecast a continuation of climate warming at the same rate as documented here. Such changes in temperature might lead to a critical situation for the glaciers of the Cordillera Huaytapallana, and may significantly impact the water resources, ecology, and natural hazards of the surrounding areas.

The result shows that branched GDGT lipids occur widely in the studied lake sediments. The different distribution of branched GDGTs between the Chinese soils from Weijers et al. (2007b) and the Chinese lake sediments indicates that the branched GDGTs in the lacustrine sediment are the mixture of allochthonous and autochthonous branched GDGTs. Our result supports the suggestion that temperature is the principal factor affecting the distribution of GDGTs. Seasonality, sources, and precipitation increase the uncertainty of the correlation between the methylation index of branched tetraethers (MBT)/cyclization ratio of branched tetraethers (CBT) proxy and the temperature. The correlations of the MBT/CBT index with mean annual air temperature (T) for the global lakes are T = 6.803 - 7.062 x CBT + 37.090 x MBT (n = 139, p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.62, and RMSE = 5.24 degrees C); for the global lakes with pH < 8.5, T = 3.949 - 5.593 x CBT + 38.213 x MBT (n = 100, p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.73, and RMSE = 4.27 degrees C). The significant correlation suggests that the MBT/CBT proxy might be used as a potential paleotemperature proxy in the limnic environment. The MBT/CBT proxy provides an independent way to evaluate and verify the sensitivities of the different proxies for paleotemperature reconstruction from lacustrine sediments.

In many places, the natural LULCs are converted into agricultural land to sustain the increasing food demand arising from a rapidly growing population. Modelling the responses of LULC changes on the hydrology of the area at the watershed scale is crucial for sustainable development of land and water resources. This study investigates the historic LULC change and its potential impacts on the hydrology of Ziway Lake Watershed in the Ethiopian Rift. Commonly, such assessments are accomplished by integrating physically based and semi-distributed hydrological model with Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques. A hybrid LULC classification approach was applied to classify Landsat images of 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2020 and detect the LULC changes in the watershed. Subsequently, Soil and Water Assessment Tool was utilized to simulate the response of the hydrological process (water balance and stream flow) to LULC changes from 1985 to 2020. The image classifications of 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2020 revealed four LULC maps with eight LULC types. The relative change assessment results in the past 35 years from 1985 to 2020 revealed that the major expansion in Settlement, Cultivation and Agroforest resulting in a reduction of Woodlands. However, 58.3% of the watershed has remained intact while 41.7% has shown some degree of change. At the watershed level, these LULC changes had increased SURQ (87.07%), WYLD (31.86%) and ET (4.91%). Conversely, the observed change had reduced PERC (63.22%). But, the spatial analysis of the water balance components due to LULC changes were found to be non-uniform across the watershed. On the other hand, the seasonal stream flow analysis results indicated that Katar flow is increased by 15.36% and declined by 3.86% during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Similarly, Meki flow showed a decrement during the dry seasons and an increment during the wet seasons by 7.04% and 20.66%, respectively. Beside the observed change, the results of the hypothetical LULC change scenarios justified a pronounced impact of historic LULC change on the water balance components of the watershed. These change in hydrological components and stream flow substantially attributed to the transformation of Woodland to agricultural land. Among the water balance components, the increment of SURQ may have a wider implication for increasing soil erosion and lake bed siltation. The continuous decline in PERC also highly affected the available groundwater resource of the watershed. The study will have significance for watershed managers and decision makers to improve the LULC and water management practices in the area by formulating mechanisms to maintain a sustainable hydrological balance in the watershed.

J	Meredith, W; Casamitjana, X; Quintana, XD; Menció, A				Meredith, Warren; Casamitjana, Xavier; Quintana, Xavier D.; Mencio, Anna			Effects of morphology and sediment permeability on coastal lagoons? hydrological patterns	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Mediterranean coastal lagoons are influenced from a wide variety of external factors such as surface and groundwater flows and climate dynamics. They are also vulnerable to human activities, which have caused a significant loss of these types of habitats. As a result, the EU habitat management have now prioritized resto-ration of natural wetlands. However, there is a lack of systemic studies on the mechanisms of coastal wetland degradation and ecohydrological processes that determine restored ecological functioning as an end goal, as well as a lack of reference sites to make comparisons. Furthermore, while lagoon morphometry and underlying sediment permeability have been studied extensively, combining these disciplines to evaluate lagoon hydrology and salinity dynamics is yet to be fully explored. The aim of this study was to analyze the hydrological dynamics of 4 newly constructed lagoons and compare them with 2 natural lagoons in the La Pletera salt marshes and evaluate the restoration and conservation efforts. We use the General Lake Model (GLM) to assess water volume fluctuations, salinity variability and lagoon water circulation (groundwater and surface water inflows, outflows and evaporation). We also combine data of the underlying lithological characteristics and lagoon morphometry, to compare and better understand the interplay of these parameters on the hydrological behavior of each lagoon. Results indicated that the older and natural lagoons exhibited more consistent patterns of confinement; with deeper morphologies, lower evaporation effect, lower water circulation, and more annual patterns of salinity fluctuation. The presence of low-permeability layers also resulted in less fluctuation of higher salinity levels. Conversely, three of the four new lagoons had similar, shallower morphologies and higher evaporation fluxes, but exhibited different water circulation patterns due to the presence or absence of low permeability layers. Also, their salinity fluctuations were more influenced by seasonal mixing than by evaporation, indicating more sus-ceptibility to climatic influence in their annual hydrological pattern than in the natural lagoons. This could prove important when constructing and restoring lagoons according to predetermined morphology and underlying sediment patterns, as it could ultimately limit or enhance the success of set objectives and overall ecological functioning in a flooding - confinement driven lagoon ecosystem conditioned by irregular and unpredictable climatic events.

The present study represents the first attempt to determine the distribution of C. raciborskii and CYN in tropical China. The presence of C. raciborskii and CYN, as well as the composition of phytoplankton, was determined from a total of 86 samples from 25 urban reservoirs for drinking water supply in Dongguan City of South China. The presence of C. raciborskii was observed in 21 of the 25 reservoirs and confirmed that this species has been widely distributed in the investigated reservoirs. C. raciborskii accounted for between 0.1 and 90.3 % of the total phytoplankton biomass and contributed to the majority of the phytoplankton in some reservoirs such as Tangkengbian and Xiagongyan. Its biomass was negatively correlated with NO3--N concentration and Secchi depth. Dissolved CYN was detected in more than one-half of the reservoirs with concentrations up to 8.25 mu g L-1, and it positively correlated with C. raciborskii biomass. Dissolved microcystins (MCs) were detected in 12 of the 25 reservoirs with a maximum concentration 1.99 mu g L-1. Our data strongly suggest that C. raciborskii and CYN could be important health hazards in urban reservoirs of South China and that more data are needed for further assessment.

The atmospheric concentrations of 36 CUPs were measured in 24 h gas and particle samples collected in 2017 at six sites in the Great Lakes basin. Thirteen individual CUPs were detected at least once in both gas- and particle-phase samples, with chlorothalonil, trifluralin, metolachlor, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, and chlorpyrifos detected in >50% samples. The gas-particle partitioning analysis suggests that gas-phase chemicals like trifluralin and chlorpyrifos were not influenced by either temperature or relative humidity while particle-phase chemicals like metolachlor were marginally and negatively correlated with relative humidity. Median total CUP concentrations were 339, 238, 84, 33, 60, and 6.0 pg/m(3) at Chicago, Cleveland, Sturgeon Point, Point Petre, Sleeping Bear Dunes, and Eagle Harbor, respectively. The concentrations of total CUPs and most individual CUPs were generally higher at the urban sites of Chicago and Cleveland than at the rural/remote sites of Sturgeon Point, Point Petre, Sleeping Bear Dunes, and Eagle Harbor. Chlorothalonil, trifluralin, bifenthrin, and chlorpyrifos were the most abundant individual CUPs among fungicides, herbicides, pyrethroid insecticides, and other insecticides, respectively. The spatio-seasonal variation suggests that fungicides at Sturgeon Point and Sleeping Bear Dunes, with the highest fraction of agricultural land use, were associated with agricultural activities, while pyrethroid insecticides were generally driven by human activities.

However, studies of the dynamic processes of such transport have been limited. The South-to-North Water Diversion Project of China is the largest manmade water diversion system ever constructed. Here, in a year-long project, we used environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to assess fish biodiversity and assemblage composition along the Project's 1277-km main canal, while also inves-tigating the temporal, spatial, and functional trait drivers of changes in the fish assemblages. Together, 45 fish taxa were detected, with substantial compositional variations between seasons. The number of detected species typically dropped upon entering the canal but remained relatively constant along the canal's length. Spatial variations in fish assemblages were generally dominated by the turnover component over nestedness, and a positive spatial autocorrelation of qualitative assemblage composition was detected within 80 km in all seasons. Furthermore, several functional traits, such as smaller body size, invertivorous diet, rheophilic living, and lithophilic and demersal spawning, were positive predictors of fish presence along the length of the canal and they may boost species chances of introduction to the recipient areas. Our results provide crucial information for ecological management of diversion projects and have key implications for modelling and predicting foreign species invasion through water transfers.					; zhang, shan/JMC-9434-2023; Zhang, Shan/JMC-9434-2023; yao, meng/JHT-5062-2023	Zhao, Jindong/0000-0002-4213-8548; Zhang, Shan/0000-0002-9063-8467; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				APR 1	2023	331								117217	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117217		JAN 2023						36621023					WOS:000914955300001
J	Metzger, J; Nied, M; Corsmeier, U; Kleffmann, J; Kottmeier, C				Metzger, Jutta; Nied, Manuela; Corsmeier, Ulrich; Kleffmann, Joerg; Kottmeier, Christoph			Dead Sea evaporation by eddy covariance measurements vs. aerodynamic, energy budget, Priestley-Taylor, and Penman estimates	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The Dead Sea is a terminal lake, located in an arid environment. Evaporation is the key component of the Dead Sea water budget and accounts for the main loss of water. So far, lake evaporation has been determined by indirect methods only and not measured directly. Consequently, the governing factors of evaporation are unknown. For the first time, long-term eddy covariance measurements were performed at the western Dead Sea shore for a period of 1 year by implementing a new concept for onshore lake evaporation measurements. To account for lake evaporation during offshore wind conditions, a robust and reliable multiple regression model was developed using the identified governing factors wind velocity and water vapour pressure deficit. An overall regression coefficient of 0.8 is achieved. The measurements show that the diurnal evaporation cycle is governed by three local wind systems: a lake breeze during daytime, strong downslope winds in the evening, and strong northerly along-valley flows during the night. After sunset, the strong winds cause half-hourly evaporation rates which are up to 100% higher than during daytime. The median daily evaporation is 4.3 mm d(-1) in July and 1.1 mm d(-1) in December. The annual evaporation of the water surface at the measurement location was 994 +/- 88 mm a(-1) from March 2014 until March 2015. Furthermore, the performance of indirect evaporation approaches was tested and compared to the measurements. The aerodynamic approach is applicable for subdaily and multi-day calculations and attains correlation coefficients between 0.85 and 0.99. For the application of the Bowen ratio energy budget method and the Priestley-Taylor method, measurements of the heat storage term are inevitable on timescales up to 1 month. Otherwise strong seasonal biases occur. The Penman equation was adapted to calculate realistic evaporation, by using an empirically gained linear function for the heat storage term, achieving correlation coefficients between 0.92 and 0.97. In summary, this study introduces a new approach to measure lake evaporation with a station located at the shoreline, which is also transferable to other lakes.

Temporal dynamics of flooding, evaporation, and desiccation cycles and observations of salt crust area change at the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Bonneville Salt Flats (BSF) in Utah is a dynamic saline playa environment responding to natural and anthropogenic forces. Over the last century, the saline groundwater from below BSF has been harvested to produce potash via evaporative mining, mostly used as agricultural fertilizers, while the surface halite crust has provided a significant recreational site for land speed racing. Perceptions of changes in the salt crust through time have spurred debates about land use and management; however, little is known about the timescales of natural change as the salt crust responds to climatic parameters that drive flooding, evaporation, and desiccation (FED) cycles that control surface salt growth and dissolution. Climate data over the last similar to 30 years are examined to identify annual patterns in surface water balance at BSF to identify annual and seasonal climate constraints on FED cycles. Landsat satellite data from 1986 to the present are used to map the areal extent of the surface halite salt crust at BSF at the end of the desiccation season (between August 15 and October 30) annually. Overall, the observed area of the desiccation-stage BSF halite crust has varied from a maximum of 156 km(2) in 1993 to a minimum of 72 km2 in 2014 with an overall trend of declining area of halite observed over the similar to 30 years of analysis. Climatic variables that influence FED cycles and seasonal salt dissolution and precipitation have also varied through this time period; however, the relationship between surface water fluxes and salt crust area do not clearly correlate, suggesting that other processes are influencing the extent of the salt. Intra-annual analyses of salt area and weather illustrate the importance of ponded surface water, wind events, and microtopography in shaping a laterally extensive but thin and ephemeral halite crust. Examination of annual to decadal changes in salt crust extent and environmental parameters at BSF provides insights into the processes driving change and the sustainability of land use in this dynamic environment.

Brian; Hansson, Lars-Anders			Diel vertical migration of copepods and its environmental drivers in subtropical Bahamian blue holes	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Diel vertical migration (DVM) is the most common behavioral phenomenon in zooplankton, and numerous studies have evaluated DVM under strong seasonality at higher latitudes. Yet, our understanding of the environmental drivers of DVM at low latitudes, where seasonal variation is less pronounced, remains limited. Therefore, we here examined patterns of vertical distribution in copepods in six subtropical Bahamian blue holes with different food web structure and tested the role of several key environmental variables potentially affecting this behavior. Day and night samplings showed that copepods generally performed DVM, characterized by downward migration to deeper depths during the day and upward migration to surface waters at night. Across all blue holes, the daytime vertical depth distribution of calanoid copepods correlated positively with both predation risk and depth of food resources (Chlorophyll a), but was less affected by ultraviolet radiation (UVR). A potential explanation is that since UVR is a continuous threat across seasons, zooplankton have established photoprotective pigmentation making them less vulnerable to this threat. The copepods also showed a size-structured depth segregation, where larger individuals were found at deeper depths during the day, which further strengthens the suggestion that predation is a major driver of DVM in these systems. Hence, in contrast to studies performed at higher latitudes, we show that despite the constant exposure to UVR, predator avoidance and food availability are the most pronounced drivers of copepod DVM at those low latitudes, suggesting that the main driver of DVM may vary among systems, but also systematically by latitude.

The 2022-23 drought in the South American Altiplano: ENSO effects on moisture flux in the western Amazon during the pre-wet season	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES												The 2022-23 hydrological year in the Lake Titicaca, Desaguadero River, and Lake Poopo<acute accent> hydrological system (TDPS) over the South American Altiplano constituted a historically dry period. This drought was particularly severe during the pre-wet season (October-December), when the TDPS and the adjacent Andean-Amazon region experienced as much as 60% reductions in rainfall. Consequently, Titicaca Lake water levels decreased by 0.05 m from December to January, which is part of the rising lake level period of normal conditions. Such conditions have not been seen since the El Nino-related o-related drought of 1982-83. Using a set of hydroclimatic, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and atmospheric reanalysis datasets, we find that this new historical drought was associated with enhanced southerly moisture flux anomalies, reducing the inflow of moisture-laden winds from the Amazon basin to the TDPS. Such anomalies in moisture transport were not seen since at least the 1950s. The atmospheric dynamics associated with this drought are related to La Nina a SST anomalies via subtropical teleconnections associated with Rossby wave trains towards South America, further extended by subtropical Atlantic Ocean SST anomalies. This feature reduced the atmospheric moisture inflow from the Amazon and weakened the development of the Bolivian High in the upper troposphere. These results document a new atmospheric mechanism related to extreme droughts in the TDPS associated with La Nina a SST anomalies during the pre-wet season. This goes beyond the traditional understanding of El Nino o events, especially the strongest ones, being associated with dry conditions in the TDPS during the wet season (December-March).

A complete mapping of ground motion variation in Hoh Xil is essential for an in-depth understanding of the terrain's responses to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau. However, the inaccessibility and extremely harsh environment impeded extensive field investigations on landform alteration and its formative process. Such difficulty can be resolved by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), which enables a broad detection of subtle permafrost motions at millimeter precision. This study, for the first time, accomplished a multitemporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) deformation mapping from 2015 to 2020 in Hoh Xil, with a wide coverage of about 200 000 km(2). 1592 Sentinel-1 images were processed based on the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique. The results show that Hoh Xil was experiencing dynamic permafrost disturbances. Thawing permafrost with both a linear subsidence rate higher than 2 mm/year and a periodic amplitude over 2 mm was primarily detected in areas of flat or gentle slopes. The InSAR cumulative deformation is highly correlated with permafrost thawing depth. Significant lag times were identified between seasonal oscillation of InSAR deformation and land surface temperature (LST). Thermokarst landforms of retrogressive thaw slumps and thermokarst lakes broadly formed and dynamically evolved as a consequence of permafrost degradation. Particularly, widespread thawing permafrost characterized by the spatial clustering of thermokarst lakes appeared to occur in areas adjacent to large lakes. The discovered dynamic permafrost disturbances in Hoh Xil manifested even the secluded Tibetan Plateau hinterland was facing the threat of climate change.					meng, xianglian/GRS-5259-2022	Yi, Yonghong/0000-0002-0039-0462; Hao, Tong/0000-0003-0177-6006; Lu, Ping/0000-0002-0127-3911; zhang, yin sheng/0000-0002-5976-8589; Li, Rongxing/0000-0001-9837-5115													0196-2892	1558-0644					2023	61								5204416	10.1109/TGRS.2023.3253937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2023.3253937													WOS:000969953000009

It is fundamental to reduce the potential engineering geological disasters by exploring the dynamic evolution of saline soil. Most of the previous researches of saline soil were conducted by simulated experiments and traditional geodetic surveying methods. Restricted to the limited sampling points, the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of saline soil were difficult to find out in a large scale. This paper exploited SBAS-InSAR method to extract the deformation of the Qarhan Salt Lake (in Qinghai, China) section along Qinghai-Tibet railway, based on 119 image data acquired by Sentinel-IA from 2015 to 2020. The results showed that the deformation trends varied frequently in this saline mud flat. Between the adjacent areas with different deformation trends along Qinghai-Tibet railway, discontinuities caused by uplift and subsidence were very obvious. Besides, among the areas with brine exploitation or artificial construction, the maximum subsidence rate reached50 mm/yr, and the maximum cumulative subsidence exceeded 320 mm in the latest 5 years. In the saline mud flat closed to the rivers and lakes, the deformation trend was continuous uplift. Nevertheless, there were obvious seasonal deformation characteristics in those areas far away from the water body. Further analysis found out a sharply subsidence caused by the salt collapsibility appeared in rainy seasons. While an uplift trend induced by the salt swelling or frost heave was remarkable in dry seasons. Subsequently, the relationships were analyzed between the time series deformation and external environmental factors. Furthermore, the deformation mechanism of saline soilin the Qarhan Salt Lake region was interpreted then. In general, this study provides complete spatiotemporal evolution information of saline soil, and demonstrates the deformation characteristics of saline soil in the Qarhan Salt Lake region successfully. Related results would contribute to the safety monitoring for large-scale infrastructure construction in the saline soil areas. (C) 2021 Editorial office of Geodesy and Geodynamics.

Juvenile coho salmon track a seasonally shifting thermal mosaic across a river floodplain	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Seasonal variation in river water levels creates a shifting mosaic of habitat conditions associated with variables such as water temperature, chemistry and prey availability to consumers. Previous work has shown that fishes can exploit spatial variation in water temperature, but less is known about how they respond to shifts in the spatial arrangement of habitat conditions through time. Juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) are the numerically dominant fish species in many southwest Alaskan streams, which exhibit seasonal variation in water level and temperature due to changes in precipitation and snowmelt. We assessed the degree to which juvenile coho salmon exploit the associated shifting mosaic of water temperature by monitoring the spatial distribution of water temperatures and juvenile coho salmon in the lake-influenced reaches of a southwest Alaskan stream. We also monitored the diets of juvenile coho salmon relative to the spatial distribution of prey taxa. Juvenile coho salmon exhibited two scales of movement to track spatiotemporal variation in habitat conditions. First, over the course of 6weeks, individuals moved among off-channel units, tracking shifts in the location of warm water habitat caused by receding water level. Second, individuals moved at diel time scales, foraging on benthic macroinvertebrates in the cold thalweg of the stream at night and then digesting prey in warmer off-channel habitats during the day. Seasonally asynchronous variation in water temperature among off-channel habitat units produced portfolio effects in habitat conditions, such that coho salmon had continual access to warm habitat for digestion despite its ephemeral availability at discrete locations. Our study demonstrates that behavioural thermoregulation by juvenile fishes can be important throughout the growing season and is not restricted to ephemeral events such as resource pulses or heat stress. Our results have implications for the conservation of highly connected, heterogeneous landscapes, and their ability to support economically and ecologically important species such as coho salmon.

We present the results of a multidisciplinary paleoenvironmental study on IWPs in the northern Yukon, Canada. High-resolution laboratory analyses were carried out on a permafrost core and the overlying seasonally thawed (active) layer, from an IWP located in a drained lake basin on Herschel Island. In relation to 14 Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates spanning the last 5000 years, we report sedimentary data including grain size distribution and biogeochemical parameters (organic carbon, nitrogen, C/N ratio, delta C-13), stable water isotopes (delta O-18, delta D), as well as fossil pollen, plant macrofossil and diatom assemblages. Three sediment units (SUS) correspond to the main stages of deposition (1) in a thermokarst lake (SW : 4950 to 3950 cal yrs BP), (2) during transition from lacustrine to palustrine conditions after lake drainage (SU2: 3950 to 3120 cal yrs BP), and (3) in palustrine conditions of the IWP field that developed after drainage (SU3: 3120 cal yrs BP to 2012 CE). The lacustrine phase (pre 3950 cal yrs BP) is characterized by planktonic-benthic and pioneer diatom species indicating circumneutral waters, and very few plant macrofossils. The pollen record has captured a regional signal of relatively stable vegetation composition and climate for the lacustrine stage of the record until 3950 cal yrs BP. Palustrine conditions with benthic and acidophilic diatom species characterize the peaty shallow-water environments of the low-centered IWP. The transition from lacustrine to palustrine conditions was accompanied by acidification and rapid revegetation of the lake bottom within about 100 years. Since the palustrine phase we consider the pollen record as a local vegetation proxy dominated by the plant communities growing in the IWP. Ice-wedge cracking in water-saturated sediments started immediately after lake drainage at about 3950 cal yrs BP and led to the formation of an IWP mire. Permafrost aggradation through downward closed-system freezing of the lake talik is indicated by the stable water isotope record. The originally submerged IWP center underwent gradual drying during the past 2000 years. This study highlights the sensitivity of permafrost landscapes to climate and environmental change throughout the Holocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Joshua; Feakins, Sarah J.; Galy, Valier			Leaf wax biomarkers in transit record river catchment composition	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Rivers carry organicmolecules derived from terrestrial vegetation to sedimentary deposits in lakes and oceans, storing information about past climate and erosion, as well as representing a component of the carbon cycle. It is anticipated that sourcing of organic matter may not be uniform across catchments with substantial environmental variability in topography, vegetation zones, and climate. Here we analyze plant leaf wax biomarkers in transit in the Madre de Dios River (Peru), which drains a forested catchment across 4.5km of elevation from the tropical montane forests of the Andes down into the rainforests of Amazonia. We find that the hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf wax molecules (specifically the C-28 n-alkanoic acid) carried by this tropical mountain river largely records the elevation gradient defined by the isotopic composition of precipitation, and this supports the general interpretation of these biomarkers as proxy recorders of catchment conditions. However, we also find that leaf wax isotopic composition varies with river flow regime over storm and seasonal timescales, which could in some cases be quantitatively significant relative to changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation in the past. Our results inform on the sourcing and transport of material by a major tributary of the Amazon River and contribute to the spatial interpretation of sedimentary records of past climate using the leaf wax proxy.					; Galy, valier/I-6185-2012; Feakins, Sarah/K-4149-2012; galy, valier/I-6185-2012	Feakins, Sarah/0000-0003-3434-2423; Galy, valier/0000-0003-0385-8443; Ponton, Camilo/0000-0001-7608-1116; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				SEP 28	2014	41	18					6420	6427		10.1002/2014GL061328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014GL061328													WOS:000344913700015

Mixing intensities were estimated from small-scale oscillations of water temperature and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates derived from current velocity fluctuations. Well-developed turbulent conditions prevailed in the stably stratified interfacial layer separating the ice base from the warmer deep waters. The source of turbulent mixing was identified as whole-lake (barotropic) oscillations of the water body driven by strong wind events over the ice surface. We derive a scaling of ice-water heat flux based on dissipative Kolmogorov scales and successfully tested against measured dissipation rates and under-ice temperature gradients. The results discard the conventional assumption of nearly conductive heat transport within the stratified under-ice layer and suggest contribution of the basal heat flux into the melt of ice cover is higher than commonly assumed. Decline of the seasonal ice cover in the Arctic is currently gaining recognition as a major indicator of climate change. The heat transfer at the ice-water interface remains the least studied among the mechanisms governing the growth and melting of seasonal ice. The outcomes of the study find application in the heat budget of seasonal ice on inland and coastal waters.

Its ancient fluvial surfaces are, however, often concealed by aeolian deposits, inhibiting the discovery and mapping of potential groundwater recharge areas. However, recent advances in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging offer a novel approach for detecting partially hidden and dynamic landscape features. Interferometry SAR coherence change detection (CCD) is a fairly recent technique that allows the mapping of very slight surface changes between multidate SAR images. Thus, this work explores the use of the CCD method to investigate the fluvial and aeolian morphodynamics along two paleochannels in Egypt. The results show that during wetter climates, runoff caused the erosion of solid rocks and the rounding of sand-sized grains, which were subsequently deposited in depressions further downstream. As an alternating dry climate prevailed, the sand deposits were reshaped into migrating linear dunes. These highly dynamic features are depicted on the CCD image with very low coherence values close to 0 (high change), while the deposits within the associated ephemeral wadis show low to moderate coherence values ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 (high to moderate change), and the country rocks show a relative absence of change with high coherence values close to 1. These linear dunes crossed their parent's stream courses and dammed the runoff to form lakes during rainy seasons. Part of the dammed surface water would have infiltrated the ground to recharge the permeable wadi deposits. The alternation of fluvial and aeolian depositional environments produced unique hydromorphometrically trapped lakes that are very rare in arid regions, but of great interest because of their significance to groundwater recharge.					; Koch, Magaly/B-3467-2017	gaber, ahmed/0000-0002-2487-0815; sayed, ismail/0000-0003-3495-2555; Koch, Magaly/0000-0002-6186-1619														2072-4292				JUN	2018	10	6							832	10.3390/rs10060832	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10060832													WOS:000436561800026

Resource partitioning among top-level piscivores in a sub-Arctic lake during thermal stratification	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In systems with multiple piscivores, co-occurrence is dependent on resource partitioning. This is pronounced in oligotrophic northern lakes, which have simple food webs and short open-water seasons. We used acoustic telemetry and stable isotopes to quantify habitat and dietary partitioning during thermal stratification among three piscivores that commonly co-occur in Canadian sub-Arctic lakes-burbot (Lota Iota), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and northern pike (Esox lucius). Spatial core areas and core habitat niches (space and depth) did not significantly overlap among species. Although burbot and lake trout occupied similar mean daily depths (16.2 m and 13.4 m, respectively), and water temperatures (5.4 degrees C and 6.9 degrees C, respectively), they were spatially segregated. Burbot were closely associated with the lake bottom on steep drop-offs between the offshore and nearshore zone with moderate substrate complexity, whereas lake trout were located over deep offshore basins and suspended above the lake bottom. Northern pike occupied shallow depths (5.3 m) and warmer water (16.5 degrees C) within the nearshore region and were closely associated with bottom substrate of highest complexity. Some significant overlap among spatial home ranges and broad habitat niches indicated that these species interact. However, dietary niches did not significantly overlap at either the core or broad levels, suggesting that species were utilizing spatially diverse food sources. Our results highlight the importance of including depth and space when quantifying resource partitioning among fishes and provide insight into the mechanisms that promote piscivore co-occurrence in northern lakes.

This complexity creates challenges for monitoring, and consequently, many inland fish stocks have few data and cannot be assessed using methods typically applied to industrial marine fisheries. In such situations, there may be a role for methods recently developed for assessment of data-poor fish stocks. Herein, three established data-poor assessment tools from marine systems are demonstrated to highlight their value to inland fisheries management. A case study application uses archived length, catch and catch-per-unit-effort data to characterise the ecological status of an important recreational brown trout stock in an Irish lake. This case study is of specific use to management of freshwater sport fisheries, but the broader purpose of the paper was to provide a crossover between marine and inland fisheries science, and to highlight accessible data-poor assessment approaches that may be applicable in diverse inland systems.

J	Linares, MS; Callisto, M; Marques, JC				Linares, Marden Seabra; Callisto, Marcos; Marques, Joao Carlos			Invasive bivalves increase benthic communities complexity in neotropical reservoirs	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Invasive bivalves often act as ecosystem engineers, generally causing physical alterations in the ecosystems in which they establish themselves. However, the effects of these physical alterations over benthic macroinvertebrate communities' structure are less clear. The objective of this study was to characterize the ecological effects of the invasive bivalves Corbicula fluminea and Limnopema fortunei on the structure of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in neo-tropical reservoirs. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) invasive bivalves act as facilitator species to other benthic macroinvertebrates, resulting in communities with higher number of species, abundance and diversity; (2) invasive bivalves change the taxonomic composition of benthic macroinvertebrate communities; (3) invasive bivalves increase the complexity of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. For that it was used data from 160 sampling sites from four reservoirs. We sampled sites once in each area, during the dry season from 2009 to 2012. The first hypothesis was rejected, as the presence of invasive bivalves significantly decreased the host benthic communities' number of species and abundance. The second hypothesis was corroborated, as the composition of other benthic macroinvertebrates was shown to be significantly different between sites with and without invasive bivalves. We observed a shift from communities dominated by common soft substrate taxa, such as Chironomidae and Oligochaeta, to communities dominated by the invasive Gastropoda Melanoides tuberculata. The biomass data corroborated that, showing significantly higher biomass of M. tuberculata in sites with invasive bivalves, but significantly lower biomass of native species. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities presenting invasive bivalves showed significantly higher eco-exergy and specific eco-exergy, which corroborate the third hypothesis. These results suggest that while the presence of invasive bivalves limits the abundance of soft bottom taxa such as Chironomidae and Oligochaeta, it enhances benthic communities' complexity and provide new energetic pathways to benthic communities in reservoirs. This study also suggests a scenario of invasion meltdown, as M. tuberculata was facilitated by the invasive bivalves. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A surrogate regression approach for computing continuous loads for the tributary nutrient and sediment monitoring program on the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water quality (WO) in many Great Lake tributaries has been degraded (increased nutrient and sediment concentrations) due to changes in their watersheds, resulting in downstream eutrophication. As part of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, specific goals were established for loading of specific constituents (e.g., phosphorus). In 2010, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative was launched to identify problem areas, accelerate restoration efforts, and track their progress. In 2011, the U.S. Geological Survey established a monitoring program on 30 tributaries to the lakes, representing-46% of the U.S. draining area and the spectrum of land uses. Discrete measurements of nutrients and suspended sediment, and continuous measurements of flow and WQ surrogates (turbidity, temperature, specific conductance, pH, and dissolved oxygen) are being collected in these tributaries to document their WQ and estimate continuous (5-min) loading. To estimate loadings, two regression models were developed for each constituent for each site: one using continuous flow and a seasonality factor; and one using flow, seasonality, and continuous surrogates. Variables included in the final models for each constituent were chosen from the explanatory variables that worked "best" for all sites. In computing loads, when continuous surrogate data were unavailable for short periods, loads were computed using the flow and seasonality models. Prediction intervals for all loads were calculated using results from both models. These results provide a better understanding of short-term variability and long-term changes in loading affecting the environmental health of the Great Lakes than traditional regression techniques that employ only flow and seasonality parameters.

J	Zhou, H; Liu, YB				Zhou, Han; Liu, Yuanbo			Spatio-temporal pattern of meteorological droughts and its possible linkage with climate variability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Spatial pattern of meteorological droughts is a critical element for investigating drought condition. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and rotated EOF (REOF) methods are widely used to discriminate dominant patterns. Previous works focused on case applications but left the associated physical meanings unexplored. This study employs the EOF, wavelet analysis, and stepwise regression methods to distinguish spatio-temporal patterns of meteorological droughts with pattern interpretation. For this purpose, monthly precipitation data were used from 73 meteorological stations in the Poyang Lake basin of China for the period of 1960-2007. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was applied to quantify meteorological droughts. Our results identified four leading EOF/REOF patterns at the basin scale. Seasonal SPI series showed more dominant periods than monthly SPI series, indicating periodic complexity of regional droughts. The dominant periods coincided with those of the EOF/REOF time coefficients. The four leading EOF/REOFs were significantly related to the dominant time scales of 2, 3, 6, 11, 16, and 17 years, except for the fifth EOF/REOF. Stepwise regression analysis further indicated that the four leading EOF/REOFs be likely the superposition of SPI variation from inter-annual and inter-decadal scales. The SPI series at different time scales (1-36 months) showed significant correlations with climate teleconnection modes, confirming the existence of identified spatio-temporal pattern. The Nino3.4 and Southern Oscillation were the primary teleconnection modes that influenced the variability of meteorological droughts over the basin. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation also contributed to the regional dry/wet alternation. The findings provide important implications for understanding spatial and temporal variation of regional droughts.

Dispersal of rotifers and cladocerans by waterbirds: seasonal changes and hatching success	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Aquatic invertebrates can be geographically dispersed by abiotic vectors (wind, rain and water flow) or organisms (mainly by insects, fishes and waterbirds). However, there is a lack of information on the dispersal by waterbirds of cladocerans and especially rotifers, and on the hatching success of the dispersed propagules. Here, we quantify the dispersal of cladocerans and rotifers by waterbirds through analysis of their faecal droppings collected in a wetland formed by two natural lakes located in Donana National Park (Spain). We also study the influence of different photoperiod and temperature conditions on the hatching success of the dispersal propagules. Diapausing propagules of 22 species of rotifers or cladocerans were identified in waterbird faecal droppings, with a mean number of 0.9 diapausing propagules per dropping. The hatching success rate, which was not influenced by photoperiod or temperature, was low (12.5%). Nevertheless, the role of rotifer dispersal by waterbirds appears to have been underestimated in the past. In this study area, the dispersal of rotifers by waterbirds may be at least as relevant as their dispersal by air currents. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relative importance of dispersal mechanisms (mainly air currents and animal vectors) in different geographical areas.

Evaluating the effects of aquaculture on the freshwater lake from the perspective of plankton communities: The diversity, co-occurrence patterns and their underlying mechanisms	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Aquaculture has significant impacts on freshwater lakes, but plankton communities, as key components of the microbial food web, are rarely considered when assessing the impacts of aquaculture. Revealing the dynamics of plankton communities, including bacterioplankton, phytoplankton and zooplankton, under anthropological disturbances is critical for predicting the freshwater ecosystem functioning in response to future environmental changes. In the present study, we examined the impacts of aquaculture on water quality, plankton diversity and the co-occurrence patterns within plankton metacommunities in a shallow freshwater lake. The study zones are influenced by the 20-year historical intensive aquaculture, but now they are undergoing either ecological aquaculture or ecological restoration. Our results showed that ecological aquaculture was more efficient in ni-trogen removal than ecological restoration. Moreover, lower bacterioplankton diversity but higher phyto-plankton and zooplankton diversity were found in the ecological aquaculture and ecological restoration zones compared to the control zone. The lower network connectivity of the plankton metacommunities in the ecological aquaculture and ecological restoration zones indicated the decreasing complexity of potential mi-crobial food web, suggesting a possible lower resistance of the plankton metacommunities to future disturbance. Furthermore, plankton communities of different trophic levels were driven under distinct mechanisms. The bacterioplankton community was primarily affected by abiotic factors, whereas the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities were explained more by trophic interactions. These results revealed the impacts of aquaculture on the plankton communities and their potential interactions, thereby providing fundamental in-formation for better understanding the impacts of aquaculture on freshwater ecosystem functioning.

Pelagic producers intercept the flux of light to the benthic habitat and benthic producers intercept the flux of sediment-derived nutrients to the pelagic habitat. In boreal and subarctic regions, climate change is affecting this interaction both directly through warming and indirectly through increased loading with colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM) from the catchment (brownification). We use a dynamical ecosystem model to explore the consequences of these changing environmental conditions for lake primary production and compare model predictions with the results of an experiment in which we manipulated water temperature and cDOM supply in a 2x2 factorial design. The experiment was performed in field mesocosms large enough to harbor reproducing fish populations and was run over an entire growing season. In agreement with model predictions, benthic algal production and biomass declined and pelagic algal production and biomass increased with browning. Pelagic nutrient concentrations diverged over time between low and high cDOM treatments, suggesting that browning alleviated pelagic algal nutrient limitation by shading benthic competitors and preventing them from intercepting the release of nutrients from the sediment. Warming considerably reduced benthic and pelagic algal production as well as pelagic algalbiomass and total phosphorus. The warming results are only in partial accordance with model expectations, but can be explained by an indirectly inferred, positive response of macrophyte production (which was not included in the model) to warming. Our study suggests that lake ecosystem responses to climate change are mediated by cross-habitat feedbacks between benthic and pelagic producers.					; de Vasconcelos, Francisco/C-1642-2014; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019	Rivera de Vasconcelos, Francisco/0000-0002-2327-9716; Rodriguez, Patricia/0000-0002-7134-8966; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	2016	97	10					2580	2592		10.1002/ecy.1487	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1487								27859128					WOS:000386088000007

And the rice paddy, an important artificial wetland type, plays an important role in the regional ecological environment. This study proposes a stacked generalization and spectral mixture approach to map paddy rice using coarse spatial resolution images [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectralradiometer, (MODIS)]. By this method, the time series MODIS enhanced vegetation index images, phenological variables, land surface water index, elevation, and slope images are all employed to produce the optimal feature combination, which is then used to map paddy rice by the stacking algorithm. The validation experiment using the data of the Dongting Lake area showed that the proposed method can improve the overall accuracy of single classifiers, including the support vector machine, random forest, k-nearestneigbor (kNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and decision tree. Stacking (XGB) achieves the highest overall accuracy (90.3%) and Kappa coefficient (0.86), which are 2.8% and 0.03 higher than that of using the single kNN classifier. Furthermore, its user accuracies for distinguishing double-cropping rice and single-season rice are 92.5% and 90.0%, respectively. In terms of the paddy rice classification accuracy, the stacking model is also superior to single classifiers. Moreover, the MODIS-derived rice map obtained by the stacked generalization approach and the spectral mixture method area has a large determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.9975) with the government statistic data. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in using coarse spatial resolution images for large-scale paddy rice mapping.					; Cai, Yaotong/LSM-1704-2024; Liu, Yang/HMV-0119-2023; zhang, meng/GQP-4394-2022	Cai, Yaotong/0000-0002-5981-1786; Li, Xinyu/0000-0001-6678-8660													1939-1404	2151-1535					2020	13						2264	2275		10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2994335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2994335													WOS:000542949600011

During a selected 4-year temporal coverage (2006 to 2009), the turbidity gradients were simultaneously analyzed in the delta plain lakes and in the Black Sea western-northwestern coastal zone. Two distinct, but complementary, methodologies for retrieving turbidity were employed, one for the lakes and the other for the coastal zone. After comparing the turbidity satellite-derived turbidity products with in-situ measurements, the inter-comparability of the products was independently verified. Then, through an integrative analysis, the initial hypothesis of turbidity control by the Danube River inputs was tested in both areas (Delta plain and coastal zone). Seasonal turbidity patterns were identified together with the mechanisms responsible for its important temporal and spatial variability. Reciprocal contributions derived from the association of multi-scale satellite products were highlighted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Vegetated urban streams have sufficient purification ability but high internal nutrient loadings: Microbial communities and nutrient release dynamics	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The release of nutrients back into the water column due to macrophyte litter decay could offset the benefits of nutrient removal by hydrophytes within urban streams. However, the influence of this internal nutrient cycling on the overly-ing water quality and bacterial community structure is still an open question. Hence, litter decomposition trials using six hydrophytes, Typha latifolia (TL), Phragmites australis (PAU), Hydrilla verticillata (HV), Oenanthe javanica (OJ), Myriophyllum aquaticum (MA), and Potamogeton crispus (PC), were performed using the litterbag approach to mimic a 150-day plant litter decay in sediment-water systems. Field assessment using simple in/out mass balances and uptake by plant species was carried out to show the potential for phytoremediation and its mechanisms. Results from two years of monitoring (2020-2021) indicated mean total nitrogen (TN) retention efficiencies of 7.2-60.14 % and 9.5-55.6 % for total phosphorus (TP) in the studied vegetated urban streams. Nutrient retention efficiencies showed temporal variations, which depended on seasonal temperature. Mass balance analysis indicated that macrophyte as-similation, sediment adsorption, and microbial transformation accounted for 10.31-41.74 %, 0.84-3.00 %, and 6.92-48.24 % removal of the inlet TN loading, respectively. Hydrophyte detritus decay induced alterations in physi-cochemical parameters while significantly increasing the N and P levels in the overlying water and sediment. Decay rates varied among macrophytes in the order of HV (0.00436 g day-1) > MA (0.00284 g day-1) > PC (0.00251 g day-1) > OJ (0.00135 g day-1) > TL (0.00095 g day-1) > PAU (0.00057 g day-1). 16S rRNA gene sequencing anal-ysis showed an increase in microbial species richness and diversity in the early phase of litter decay. The abundances of denitrification (nirS and nirK) and nitrification (AOA and AOB) genes also increased in the early stage and then de-creased during the decay process. Results of this study conducted in seven urban streams in northern China demon-strate the direct effects of hydrophytes in encouraging nutrient transformation and stream self-purification. Results also demonstrate that macrophyte detritus decay could drive not only the nutrient conversions but also the microbial community structure and activities in sediment-water systems. Consequently, to manage internal sources and conver-sions of nutrients, hydrophytic detritus (e.g., floating/submerged macrophytes) must be suppressed and harvested.

Using CDOM spectral shape information to improve the estimation of DOC concentration in inland waters: A case study of Andean Patagonian Lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												For the last two decades different scientific disciplines have focused on lacustrine dissolved organic matter (DOM) given its importance in the biogeochemistry of carbon and in ecosystem functioning. New satellites supply the appropriate resolutions to evaluate chromophoric dissolved organicmatter (CDOM) in inland waters, opening the possibility to estimate DOM at appropriate spatiotemporal scales. This requires, however, a robust relationship between CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In this work, we evaluated the use of CDOM as a proxy of DOC in 7 Andean Patagonian lakes. Considering the entire data set, CDOM absorption coefficients (a(355) and a(440)) were linearly related with DOC. Shallow lakes, however, drove this relationship showing a moderate relationship, whereas, deep lakes with lower colour presented a weaker relationship. Therefore, we assessed the use of CDOM spectral shape information to improve DOC estimates regardless of observed DOM differences due to climatic seasonality and lakes' morphometry. The use of well-known CDOM spectral shape metrics (i.e., S275-295 and a(250):a(365) ratio) significantly improved DOC estimation. Particularly, using a Gaussian decomposition approach we found that much of the variation in the spectral shape, associated with the variability of CDOM:DOC ratio, was explained by differences in two dynamic regions centred at 270 and 320 nm. A strong nonlinear relationship was found between the a(270):a(320) ratio and the DOC-specific absorption coefficients a*(355) and a*(440). This was translated into a further improvement in DOC estimation yielding the higher R-2 and lower mean absolute differences (MAPD < 16%), either considering the entire data set or shallow and deep lakes separately.

Consequently, the present study investigates for the first time the concentrations of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) in river, estuary, and marine sediments from this area. The results highlighted high concentrations of Cr, Zn, As, and Pb exceeding the probable effect level (PEL) on aquatic life. Zn was the most dominant element detected at a range of 180-480 mg kg(-1) in marine sediment, 132-382 mg kg(-1) in estuary sediment, and 121-687 mg kg(-1) in river sediment. Total PCBs ( n-ary sumation 7 x 4.3) ranged from 1995 to 20,156 mu g kg(-1), 2013-12,058 mu g kg(-1), and 1861-36,417 mu g kg(-1) in marine, estuary, and river sediments, respectively. Total PCBs ( n-ary sumation 7 x 4.3) were above PEL for all sediments, suggesting potential adverse effects on benthic organisms. The OCP, PBDE, and PAH levels were low to moderate for all sediments. Taking into consideration, the concentrations of Zn, Pb, PCBs, and DDTs, probable environmental risks, are present.

Here we show that machine learning techniques - once trained against a full data set - can be used to infer plankton biomass information from chemical and physical parameter only, so that trophic index can then be computed without using additional biological data. More specifically, we reconstruct plankton information from chemical and physical data, and this information together with chemical data was used to compute the TRIX, which was eventually used to assess the eutrophication status of the water body. The RF was also used to evaluate the prevailing mechanism (bottom up versus top-down) controlling plankton dynamic. The case study was a Mediterranean lagoon, the Ghar El Melh Lagoon, which has been used as a natural laboratory to test the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Based on the resulting TRIX values (4.2 in April - 5.7 in December) the Ghar El Melh Lagoon can be classified an eutrophic ecosystem. This modeling process suggests that phytoplankton growth in Ghar El Melh Lagoon is mainly bottom-up control by nutrients availability, whereas the top-down control exerted by the zooplankton is relatively weak. Results highlight that in bottom up controlled lagoon machine learning technique can efficiently be used to compute ecological indicators even with low availability of biological data.					; Solidoro, Cosimo/A-3997-2009; Béjaoui, Béchir/AGR-1419-2022	Ottaviani, Ennio/0000-0002-2538-5985; Solidoro, Cosimo/0000-0003-2354-4302; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2018	95		1				765	774		10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.08.041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.08.041													WOS:000456907400075

Studies focusing on microbial diversity in thalassohaline lakes are still scarce compared with those on athalassohaline lakes such as soda lakes that have no marine origin. In this work, we investigated multiple facets of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic diversity in the thalassohaline Lake Dziani Dzaha using a metabarcoding approach. We showed that bacterial and archaeal diversity were mainly affected by contrasting physicochemical conditions retrieved at different depths. While photosynthetic microorganisms were dominant in surface layers, chemotrophic phyla (Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes) and archaeal methanogens dominated deeper layers. In contrast, eukaryotic diversity was constant regardless of depth and was affected by seasonality. A detailed focus on eukaryotic communities showed that this constant diversity profile was the consequence of the high predominance of Picocystis salinarum, while nondominant eukaryotic groups displayed seasonal diversity turnover. Altogether, our results provided an extensive description of the diversity of the three domains of life in an unexplored extreme environment and showed clear differences in the responses of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities to environmental conditions.

Remote sensing tools, artificial neural networks, and wavelet approaches aim to solve the problem	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Lake Urmia, as the largest lake in Iran, has suffered from water-level decline and this problem needs to be investigated accurately. The major reason for the decline is controversial. The current paper aimed to study the hydro-environmental variables over the Lake Urmia basin using remote sensing tools, artificial neural networks, wavelet transforms, and Mann-Kendall trend tests from 1995 to 2019 in order to determine the primary reason of the decline and to find the most important hydrologic periodicities over the basin. The results indicated that for the monthly-, seasonally-, and annually-based time series, the components with 4-month and 16-month, 24- and 48-month, and 2- and 4-year, respectively, are the most dominant periodicities over the basin. The agricultural increase according to the vegetation index and evapotranspiration and their close relationship with the water-level change indicated that human land-use is the main reason for the decline. The increasing agriculture, in the situations that the precipitation has not increased, caused the inflow runoff to the lake to decline and the remaining smaller discharge is not sufficient to stabilize the water level. Temperature time series, also, has experienced a significant positive trend which intensified the water-level change.

Isolation and Characterization of Rhizophydiales (Chytridiomycota), Obligate Parasites of Planktothrix agardhii in a Laurentian Great Lakes Embayment	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Planktothrix agardhii dominates the cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom community in Sandusky Bay, Lake Erie (USA), from May through September. This filamentous cyanobacterium is host to a known obligate parasite, the chytrid Rhizophydium sp. During the 2018 bloom season, by utilizing dilution and single-filament isolation techniques, 7 chytrid and 12 P. agardhii strains were isolated from Sandusky Bay. These 7 chytrids and a selection of P. agardhii hosts were then characterized with respect to infection rates. Infections by the isolated chytrids were specific to Planktothrix planktonic species and were not found on other filamentous cyanobacterial taxa present in the bay (Aphanizomenon sp. and Cuspidothrix sp.). Even among the potential P. agardhii host strains, individual chytrid isolates had different degrees of infectivity and showed preferences for different host isolates, suggesting possible ecological partitioning even within the same sample population. When mechanisms of chytrid pathogenesis were examined, the zoospores displayed a swarming pattern to attack and fracture the host filament and create new infection sites at the trichome termini. Infections by these parasitic chytrids also led to a release of intracellular microcystin toxins from the hosts. Additionally, infections were dependent on medium type, highlighting the importance of medium choice for experimental outcomes. Media in which chytrid swarming was observed closely matched the ionic strength of the natural environment. Understanding pathogenesis by fungal parasites will assist future efforts to determine environmental factors favoring loss mechanisms for Planktothrix agardhii-dominated blooms. IMPORTANCE Whereas many studies have focused on the factors contributing to the establishment and persistence of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs), few studies have examined bloom pathogenesis. Chytrid fungi infect cyanobacteria and stimulate food web interactions through manipulation of previously hard-to-digest filaments and the release of nutrients to support heterotrophic microbes. Specifically, chytrids infective for filamentous Planktothrix agardhii exhibit a species-specific infection that fragments trichomes into shorter units that can be consumed more easily by grazers. Chytrid zoospores also serve as a high-quality food source for the lower food web. Understanding host-pathogen relationships and mechanisms of pathogenesis on cyanobacteria will be necessary to effectively model the ecology of cHABs.

However, the interactions are far from clear between water physicochemical parameters and microbial community on aquatic plants and in surface sediments of lake in trophic agriculture area. This study employed Illumina sequencing, Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM), and physico-chemical analytical methods to explore the interactions between water quality and microbes (bacteria and eukaryotes) in three substrates of trophic shallow Lake Cyohoha North, Rwanda. The Lake Cyohoha was significantly polluted with total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) in the wet season compared to the dry season. PLS-PM revealed a strong positive correlation (+0.9301) between land use types and physico-chemical variables in the rainy season. In three substrates of the trophic lake, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were dominant phyla in the bacterial communities, and Rotifers, Platyhelminthes, Gastrotricha, and Ascomycota dominated in microeukaryotic communities. As revealed by null and neutral models, stochastic processes predominantly governed the assembly of bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in biofilms and surface sediments. Network analysis revealed that the microbial interconnections in Ceratophyllum demersum were more stable and complex compared to those in Eichhornia crassipes and sediments. Co-occurrence network analysis (|r| > 0.7, p < 0.05) revealed that there were complex interactions among physicochemical parameters and microbes in epiphytic and sediment biofilms, and many keystone microbes on three substrates played important role in nutrients removal, food web and microbial community stable. These findings emphasize that eutrophic water influence the structure, composition, and interactions of microbes in epiphytic and surface sediment biofilms, and provided new insights into the interconnections between water quality and microbial community in presentative substrates in tropical lacustrine ecosystems in agriculturally polluted areas. The study provides useful information for water quality protection and aquatic plants restoration for policy making and catchment management.

Very Low Phytoplankton Diversity in a Tropical Saline-Alkaline Lake, with Co-dominance of Arthrospira fusiformis (Cyanobacteria) and Picocystis salinarum (Chlorophyta)	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Lake Dziani Dzaha (Mayotte Island, Indian Ocean) is a tropical thalassohaline lake which geochemical and biological conditions make it a unique aquatic ecosystem considered as a modern analogue of Precambrian environments. In the present study, we focused on the diversity of phytoplanktonic communities, which produce very high and stable biomass (mean(2014-2015) = 652 +/- 179 mu g chlorophyll a L-1). As predicted by classical community ecology paradigms, and as observed in similar environments, a single species is expected to dominate the phytoplanktonic communities. To test this hypothesis, we sampled water column in the deepest part of the lake (18 m) during rainy and dry seasons for two consecutive years. Phytoplanktonic communities were characterized using a combination of metagenomic, microscopy-based and flow cytometry approaches, and we used statistical modeling to identify the environmental factors determining the abundance of dominant organisms. As hypothesized, the overall diversity of the phytoplanktonic communities was very low (15 OTUs), but we observed a co-dominance of two, and not only one, OTUs, viz., Arthrospira fusiformis (Cyanobacteria) and Picocystis salinarum (Chlorophyta). We observed a decrease in the abundance of these co-dominant taxa along the depth profile and identified the adverse environmental factors driving this decline. The functional traits measured on isolated strains of these two taxa (i.e., size, pigment composition, and concentration) are then compared and discussed to explain their capacity to cope with the extreme environmental conditions encountered in the aphotic, anoxic, and sulfidic layers of the water column of Lake Dziani Dzaha.					; Leboulanger, Christophe/W-9859-2018; escalas, arthur/D-7897-2015; Grossi, Vincent/G-6493-2010; Agogue, Helene/O-4122-2014; JEZEQUEL, DIDIER/K-8269-2012; Agogué, Hélène/O-4122-2014; claire, Carré/LIC-3077-2024; ader, magali/A-5613-2011; Bernard, Cecile/AAE-4242-2022; HUGONI, Mylene/C-7925-2019	Bernard, Cecile/0000-0001-7032-3989; Leboulanger, Christophe/0000-0001-5836-4294; GOT, Patrice/0000-0001-7528-0770; Agogue, Helene/0000-0002-1078-0130; ader, magali/0000-0002-9239-1509; , Claire Carre/0000-0002-1332-0340; HUGONI, Mylene/0000-0002-2430-1057													0095-3628	1432-184X				OCT	2019	78	3					603	617		10.1007/s00248-019-01332-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-019-01332-8								30729265					WOS:000485929400006

For example, infrastructure with a long lifespan now needs to be designed or adapted to account for a future climate that will be different from the past or present. There is a growing necessity for the climate information used in decision making to change from traditional science-driven metrics to decision-driven metrics. This is particularly relevant in East Africa, where limited adaptation and socio-economic capacity make this region acutely vulnerable to climate change. Here, we employ an interdisciplinary consultation process to define and analyse a number of such decision-oriented metrics. These metrics take a holistic approach, addressing the key East African sectors of agriculture, water supply, fisheries, flood management, urban infrastructure and urban health. A multifaceted analysis of multimodel climate projections then provides a repository of user-focused information on climate change and its uncertainties, for all metrics and seasons and two future time horizons. The spatial character and large intermodel uncertainty of changes in temperature and rainfall metrics are described, as well as those of other relevant metrics such as evaporation and solar radiation. Intermodel relationships amongst metrics are also explored, with two clear clusters forming around rainfall and temperature metrics. This latter analysis determines the extent to which model weights could, or could not, be applied across multiple climate metrics. Further work must now focus on maximising the utility of model projections, and developing tailored risk-based communication strategies.					; Rowell, David/AAF-3674-2019; Marsham, John/AAA-2277-2020	Lwiza, Kamazima/0000-0003-2790-9284; Rowell, David P/0000-0002-6727-1732; Bornemann, Jorge/0000-0003-2537-6883; Evans, Barbara/0000-0001-9815-3141; Ascott, Matthew/0000-0002-4868-2069; Marsham, John/0000-0003-3219-8472; Tesfaye, Kindie/0000-0002-7201-8053													0165-0009	1573-1480				OCT	2019	156	3					365	384		10.1007/s10584-019-02499-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02499-2													WOS:000494050600005

In this study, a methodological framework is proposed for quantifying Chl-apigments using Earth observation (EO) data from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. The first step of the methodology involves the implementation of stepwise multiple regression (MLR) analysis of the available Chl-adataset. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to explore Greek lakes' potential interrelationships based on their Chl-avalues in conjunction with certain criteria: their characteristics (artificial/natural), typology, and climatic type. Additionally, parameters such as seasonal water sampling and the date difference between sampling and satellite overpass are taken into consideration. Next, is implemented a stepwise multiple regression analysis among different groups of cases, formed by the criteria indicated from the PCA itself. This effort aimed at exploring different remote sensing-derived Chl-aalgorithms for various types of lakes. The practical use of the proposed approach was evaluated in a total of 50 lake water bodies (natural and artificial) from 2013-2018, constituting the National Lake Network Monitoring of Greece in the context of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). All in all, the results evidenced the suitability of Landsat data when used with the proposed technique to estimate log-transformed Chl-a. The proposed scheme resulted in the development of models separately for natural (R= 0.78; RMSE = 1.3 mu g/L) and artificial lakes (R= 0.76; RMSE = 1.29 mu g/L), while the model developed without criteria proved weaker (R= 0.65; RMSE = 1.85 mu g/L) in comparison to the other ones examined. The methodological framework proposed herein can be used as a useful resource toward a continuous monitoring and assessment of lake water quality, supporting sustainable water resources management.					; Petropoulos, George/N-5810-2019; Petropoulos, George P./F-2384-2013; Dimitriou, Elias/H-4237-2011	Markogianni, Vassiliki/0000-0002-4433-485X; Petropoulos, George P./0000-0003-1442-1423; Kalivas, Dionissios/0000-0001-7031-4863; Dimitriou, Elias/0000-0001-6669-6897														2072-4292				JUL	2020	12	13							2087	10.3390/rs12132087	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12132087													WOS:000550816300001

Seismic Monitoring of a Subarctic River: Seasonal Variations in Hydraulics, Sediment Transport, and Ice Dynamics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												High-latitude rivers are commonly covered by ice for up to one third of the year. Our understanding of the effects of ice on channel morphodynamics and bedload transport is hindered by the difficulties of sensing through the ice and dangers of field work on thin ice or during ice break-up. To avoid this drawback, we used seismic signals to interpret processes and quantify water and sediment fluxes. Our objective was to determine seasonal differences in hydraulics and bedload sediment transport under ice-covered versus open-channel flow conditions using a small seismic network and to provide a first-order estimation of sediment flux in a Fennoscandian river. Our study reach was on a straight, low-gradient section of the Savar River in northern Sweden. Interpretations of seismic signals, from a station 40 m away from the river, and inverted physical models of river stage and bedload flux indicate clear seasonal differences between ice-covered and open-channel flow conditions. Diurnal cycles in seismic signals reflecting turbulence and sediment transport are evident directly after ice break-up. Analysis of seismic signals of ice-cracking support our visual interpretation of ice break-up timing and the main ice break-up mechanism as thermal rather than mechanical. Assuming the bulk of sediment moves during ice break-up and the snowmelt flood, we calculate a minimum annual sediment flux of 56.2 +/- 0.7 t/km(2), which drastically reduces the uncertainty from previous estimates (0-50 t/km(2)) that exclude ice-covered or ice break-up periods.

However, some lake systems depend upon great fluctuation in water surface area. Poyang lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, undergoes dramatic seasonal and interannual variations. Timely monitoring of Poyang lake surface provides essential information on variation of water occurrence for its ecosystem conservation. Application of histogram-based image segmentation in radar imagery has been widely used to detect water surface of lakes. Still, it is challenging to select the optimal threshold. Here, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of a segmentation algorithm, the Otsu Method, from both mathematical and application perspectives. We implement the Otsu Method and provide reusable scripts to automatically select a threshold for surface water extraction using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery on Google Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform that accelerates processing of Sentinel-1 data and auto-threshold computation. The optimal thresholds for each January from 2017 to 2020 are-14.88,-16.93,-16.96and-16.87respectively, and the overall accuracy achieves92%after rectification. Furthermore, our study contributes to the update of temporal and spatial variation of Poyang lake, confirming that its surface water area fluctuated annually and tended to shrink both in the center and boundary of the lake on each January from 2017 to 2020.

We employed the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework and variation partitioning to examine whether metacommunity structure and its underlying mechanisms vary among seasons with distinct biotic and abiotic features. We found gradual shifts in the main assembly mechanisms throughout the year, from apparent spatial structuring (potentially indicative of mass effects) in the wet season to more environmental filtering dynamics in the dry season. When the degree of connectivity was high in the wet season, the benthic metacommunity was characterized by nested structure associated with clumped species loss, and was shaped mainly by spatial processes. However, quasi-Clemensian structure was assigned to metacommunities in the transitional seasons with intermediate connectivity, during which environmental variables were more important than spatial factors in describing community structure. When the degree of connectivity was low in the dry season, the benthic metacommunity displayed Clementsian structure, which was configured solely by environmental variables. The rapid shifts in metacommunity dynamics between seasons mainly result from the considerable changes in the hydrological conditions of Dongting Lake, as the studied system varies from lacustrine to fluvial phases within a single year. Taken together, our results revealed that taking temporal aspects into account gives a better insight into metacommunity organization, especially when the studied systems embrace remarkable variability in hydrological regimes.					; Heino, Jani/E-6342-2010; Tonkin, Jonathan/J-4120-2013; Chen, Xiao/GON-3561-2022	Heino, Jani/0000-0003-1235-6613; Xingliang, Meng/0000-0002-3141-018X; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2022	136								108662	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108662		FEB 2022											WOS:000761405900005

Lacustrine sediments and paleo-shorelines indicate water availability fluctuated dramatically from deep fresh water lakes, to shallow highly alkaline lakes, to completely desiccated lakes. To investigate the role lakes have played through time as readily available water sources to humans, an enhanced knowledge of the pace, character and magnitude of these changes is essential. Hydro-balance models are used to calculate paleo-precipitation rates and the potential pace of lake level changes. However, previous models did not consider changes in hydrological connectivity during humid periods in the rift system, which may have led to an overestimation of paleo-precipitation rates. Here we present a comprehensive hydro-balance modeling approach that simulates multiple rift lakes from the southern Ethiopian Rift (lakes Abaya, Chamo, and paleo-lake Chew Bahir) simultaneously, considering their temporal hydrological connectivity during high stands of the African Humid Period (AHP, similar to 15-5 ka). We further used the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) to calculate the evaporation of paleo-lake Chew Bahir's catchment. We also considered the possibility of an additional rainy season during the AHP as previously suggested by numerous studies. The results suggest that an increase in precipitation of 20-30% throughout the southern Ethiopian Rift is necessary to fill paleo-lake Chew Bahir to its overflow level. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that paleo-lake Chew Bahir was highly dependent on the water supply from the upper lakes Abaya and Chamo and dries out within similar to 40 years if the hydrological connection is cut off and the precipitation amount decreases to present day conditions. Several of such rapid lake level fluctuations, from a freshwater to a saline lake, might have occurred during the termination of the AHP, when humid conditions were less stable. Fast changes in fresh water availability requires high adaptability for humans living in the area and might have exerted severe environmental stress on humans in a sub-generational timescale.

ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Floodplain lakes are ecosystems characterised by annual flood and dry cycles. Fish ecology is influenced by the flood pulse due to the large influx of allochthonous food resources and diversification of habitats during the flood cycle, while during the dry cycle, fishes tend to be confined in reduced habitat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seasonal variation in trophic niche width and overlap of four species-Mylossoma duriventre, Prochilodus nigricans, Cichla.pleiozona and Serrasalmus rhombeus-in an Amazonian floodplain lake. Stable isotope analyses were used to estimate trophic niche width and overlap during the flood and dry seasons. We hypothesised broader niche width for all species during the flood cycle and a higher degree of overlap between the two piscivorous fishes during the dry cycle. Isotopic niche width was 72% broader for P. nigricans, 61% for S. rhombeus and 54% for C. pleiozona during the dry cycle, which did not support our hypothesis. Core niche width overlaps were not observed between piscivorous species in either flood or dry cycle. The results indicate that seasonal variation in isotopic niche width is specific to feeding habit. Understanding how fish trophic ecology responds to changes in the hydrological regime during the seasons is crucial for sustainable fishery management in a region where many people rely heavily on fish for nutritional and economic purposes.

J	Leplongeon, A				Leplongeon, Alice			The Main Nile Valley at the End of the Pleistocene (28-15 ka): Dispersal Corridor or Environmental Refugium?	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Under present environmental conditions, the Nile Valley acts as a 'natural' route between Africa and Eurasia, and is often considered as a corridor for dispersals out of and back into Africa in the past. This review aims to address the role played by the Nile Valley at the end of the Pleistocene (28-15 ka) in the context of post-'Out of Africa' modern human dispersals. Genetic studies based on both modern and ancient DNA suggest pre-Holocene dispersals 'back into Africa' as well as genetic interactions between modern humans across Africa and the Levant. During the Last Glacial, the lowering, or even complete desiccation of major eastern African lakes, including Lake Victoria, reduced the White Nile to a highly seasonal river, depriving the main Nile from its most important tributary in the dry season. This had major consequences, the specifics of which are still debated, on the behavior of the main Nile and the landscape around the Nile Delta. Despite this shift to more arid conditions, there is abundant evidence for human occupation in the main Nile Valley. Combining available geological, palaeoenvironmental, anthropological, genetic and archaeological data, this article discusses problems encountered when trying to reconcile results from different fields, the current limitations of the available data and research perspectives to further address the role of the Nile Valley as a dispersal corridor or an environmental refugium at the end of the Pleistocene.

J	Tekleab, S; Mohamed, Y; Uhlenbrook, S				Tekleab, S.; Mohamed, Y.; Uhlenbrook, S.			Hydro-climatic trends in the Abay/Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Trends of the three hydro-meteorological variables precipitation, temperature and stream flow, represented by 13, 12, and 9 gauging stations, respectively, within the Abay/Upper Blue Nile basin have been studied to support water management in the region. The Trends were evaluated over different time periods depending on data availability at the stations. The statistical Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests have been used to assess trends and change points respectively. The tests have been applied to mean annual, monthly, seasonal, 1- and 7-days annual minimum and maximum values for streamflow, while mean annual, monthly and seasonal timescales were applied to meteorological variables. The results are heterogeneous and depict statistically significant increasing/decreasing trends. Besides, it showed significant abrupt change of point upward/downward shift for streamflow and temperature time series. However, precipitation time series did not show any statistically significant trends in mean annual and seasonal scales across the examined stations. Increasing trends in temperature at different weather stations for the mean annual, rainy, dry and small rainy seasons are apparent. The mean temperature at Bahir Dar - typical station in the Lake Tana sub basin, has been increasing at the rate of about 0.5 degrees C/decade, 0.3 degrees C/decade in rainy season (June-September), 0.6 degrees C/decade in small rainy season (March-May), and 0.6 degrees C/decade in dry season (October-February). Other stations in the Abay/Upper Blue Nile show comparable results. Overall it is found that trends and change point times varied considerably across the stations and catchment to catchment. Identified significant trends can help to make better planning decisions for water management. However, the cause attributes to the observed changes in hydro-meteorological variables need further research. In particular the combined effects of land use/land cover change and climate variability on streamflow of Abay/Blue Nile basin and its tributaries needs to be understood better.

The above-ground biomass of reed stands was monitored in littoral and riparian stands of Lake Cerknica, under different water levels. Leaf and culm litter decomposition was also studied at three locations, from predominantly dry to permanently submerged. Root colonisation by fungi was monitored across two seasons in the littoral reed stand. The primary productivity of the littoral stands was related to a variable degree with water levels and air temperature in July in the current year. In the riparian reeds, only monthly temperatures in October of the previous year were important. The submersion duration of the litter enhanced the decomposition rates. The frequency of fungal colonisation of reed roots was decreasing with the submersion time length. Overall, roots were colonised by arbuscules, hyphae, vesicles, hyphal coils and microsclerotia. The main outcomes of this study deals with the role of intermittent hydrological conditions in determining the structure and functioning of reed-dominated lacustrine wetlands, which are exposed to climate threats.

However, information on the fate of organic pollutants mediated by cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic water remains elusive. In the present study, endocrine disruptive potentials of phytoplankton samples were evaluated throughout a year-long surveillance in a large and eutrophic freshwater lake. Severe cyanobacterial blooms persisted during our sampling campaigns. Estrogenic agonistic, anti-estrogenic, anti-androgenic, and anti-glucocorticogenic effects were observed in the phytoplankton samples using in vitro reporter gene bioassays. 27 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) of different modes of action were detected in the samples via UPLC-MS/MS system. Results from mass balance analysis indicated that the measured estrogenic activities were greater than the predicted estrogenic potencies from chemical analysis, demonstrating that chemical analysis of targeted EDCs is unable to fully explain the compounds responsible for the observed estrogenicities. Results from Spearman's correlation analysis concluded that the concentrations of ten EDCs in phytoplankton samples were negatively correlated with cyanobacterial biomass, suggesting the potential occurrence of biomass bio-dilution effects of EDCs due to the huge biomass of cyanobacteria during bloom seasons. The present study provided complementary information about the potential endocrine disruptive risks of cyanobacterial blooms, which is important for understanding and regulating EDCs in eutrophic lakes.

We retrieved the FU index of the largest 10 lakes in China during 2000-2012 from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer surface reflectance product (MOD09) images. Since FU index is an optical parameter, it can be derived from optical remote sensing data by direct formulas, which is invariant with region and season. Based on validation by in situ measured reflectance data, the FU index products are reliable, with average relative error of 7.7%. FU index can be used to roughly assess water clarity: the clearer a water body is, and the bluer it is in color, the smaller its FU index is. FU index can also be used to roughly classify trophic state into three classes: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic. We analyzed the spatial, interannual, and seasonal variations of the FU index and its implications for water clarity and trophic state, and the findings are mostly consistent with the results from related literature. All in all, it might be a feasible way to roughly assess inland water quality by FU index in large region and over long time period.

This is because of the unique reflectance spectral shapes of the BSC image slicks, where a sharp and monotonic increase in reflectance is found at wavelengths >550 nm and two inflection points are found around similar to 550 nm and similar to 650 nm. Such spectral characteristics differentiate BSC slicks from other floating matters. Based on this principle, a deep learning model is developed to extract BSC features from MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, 2002-2012) and OLCI (Ocean and Land Color Instrument, 2016 - present) satellite images to quantify BSC abundance, spatial distribution patterns, and their temporal changes in the Great Salt Lake (GSL), the world's largest contributor of BSC commercial products. A clear seasonality is found in BSC abundance, with the primary peak in April - May and secondary peak in October - November. The two peaks may be explained by food availability to brine shrimp. The inter-annual variability and the recent increasing trend in BSC abundance, on the other hand, are difficult to explain by fluctuations in wind, temperature, or salinity, while recent increase in commercial harvest does not appear to be associated with the variability in BSC abundance estimated by satellites. Because many salt lakes around the world, for example the Aral Sea, Lake Urmia, and the Dead Sea, also show BSC slicks in satellite imagery, this study suggests that it is possible to perform a systematic evaluation of BSC abundance and possibly brine shrimp populations in all major salt lakes, especially under a changing climate and increased human activities.					ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022; hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012														0034-4257	1879-0704				DEC 1	2021	266								112695	10.1016/j.rse.2021.112695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112695		SEP 2021											WOS:000704281800003

Distribution and Bioaccumulation of Essential and Toxic Metals in Tissues of Thaila (Catla catla) from a Natural Lake, Pakistan and Its Possible Health Impact on Consumers	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Although fish are often recommended as a component of a healthy diet, the environmental accumulation of heavy metals in many fish species has been of considerable concern for those weighing the nutritional health benefits against adverse toxic outcome of excess intake of toxic metals. This study aimed to determine the concentration of essential and toxic metals in the tissues of Catla catla in Mangla Lake and to assess the possible risk to the consumers. Fifty samples of Catla catla were collected from Mangla Lake, Mirpur, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan and analyzed for eighteen metals including essential and trace metals. The measured range concentrations (mu g/g, wet weight) in muscle tissues, in decreasing order, were: K (955-1632), Ca (550-2081), Na (449-896), Mg (129-312), Zn (61.2-215), Fe (11.6-26.8), Sr (2.60-9.27), Pb (1.72-7.81), Se (1.55-3.55), Co (0.12-4.08), Mn (1.04-4.33), Ni (0.69-3.06), Cu (0.88-2.78), Cr (0.45-1.88), As (0.67-1.58), Cd (0.28-0.56), Hg (0.17-0.57) and Li (0.12-0.38). The metal concentrations found in this study were comparatively higher than those reported in literature. A majority of the metals exhibited higher accumulation in gills compared with those in scales and muscles. Mean levels of Pb, As, Co, Mn, Cd, Cr and Zn in Catla catla muscle were found to be exceeding the international permissible limits for the safe human consumption. The condition factor (K), as an indicator of fish health status, indicated that Catla catla of Mangla Lake are in good health condition. The metal pollution index (MPI) of gills (27.9), scales (12.5) and muscle (7.57) indicated low contamination. Moreover, human health risk was evaluated using estimated weekly intake (EWI) and daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI) and target cancer risk (TCR). Estimated weekly and daily intake values for As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni and Pb were higher than provisional permissible tolerable weekly intake and permissible tolerable daily intake while THQ for As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se and Zn was higher than 1. The THQ for As, Hg and Pb was several folds higher than 1, indicative of lifetime non-carcinogenic health risks to the consumers. The hazard index indicated cumulative risk, which greatly increased with increasing fish consumption. Target cancer risk indicated that the people eating the Catla catla from Mangla Lake were exposed to As, Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb with a significant lifetime carcinogenic risk. In summary, consumption of Catla catla from this lake was found to be associated with an increased lifetime risk to the general health of the consumers.

Accurately identifying its amplitude and time characteristics is important for climate, hydrology, and ecology research in permafrost regions. We used Sentinel-1 SAR data and small baseline subset-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology to obtain the characteristics of F-T cycles in the Zonag Lake-Yanhu Lake permafrost-affected endorheic basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2017 to 2019. The results show that the seasonal deformation amplitude (SDA) in the study area mainly ranges from 0 to 60 mm, with an average value of 19 mm. The date of maximum frost heave (MFH) occurred between November 27th and March 21st of the following year, averaged in date of the year (DOY) 37. The maximum thaw settlement (MTS) occurred between July 25th and September 21st, averaged in DOY 225. The thawing duration is the thawing process lasting about 193 days. The spatial distribution differences in SDA, the date of MFH, and the date of MTS are relatively significant, but there is no apparent spatial difference in thawing duration. Although the SDA in the study area is mainly affected by the thermal state of permafrost, it still has the most apparent relationship with vegetation cover, the soil water content in AL, and active layer thickness. SDA has an apparent negative and positive correlation with the date of MFH and the date of MTS.

The change points and trends detected by stepwise regression method and modified Mann-Kendall, respectively, provide limited evidence of the violation of the stationarity assumption in both annual and seasonal extreme precipitation, and we cannot make conclusive statements about the presence of a possible climate change signal. For stationary stations, the ratio of scale to location parameters of generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution shows exponential for annual and seasonal extreme precipitation in some sub-regions. On the other hand, annual and seasonal maxima point to an unbounded-above and heavy-tail behaviour, and discussion of these upper tail properties in light of mixtures of different rainfall-generating mechanisms is provided. In addition, anomalous values of the GEV shape parameter are associated with TCs in controlling the upper tail of annual maxima on China's coastal areas with strong spatial heterogeneities.

Population recovery, seasonal site fidelity, and daily activity of pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) in an Amazonian floodplain mosaic	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) are the world's largest scaled freshwater fish, reaching 3 m in length and >200 kg in weight. Historical overfishing has devastated populations of this remarkable fish across Amazonian floodplains, but community-based management programmes are now stimulating the recovery of wild populations. Pirarucu have evolved a unique set of life history traits, some of which have important implications for population management. Individuals exhibit lateral annual migration patterns during the prolonged annual flood pulse, entering flooded forests to reproduce and forage. During this period, although managed fish stocks become less monopolisable by local communities responsible for managing protected lakes, pirarucu can occupy and reproduce in new environments and thus potentially contribute to population recovery. Here, we show a strong pattern of pirarucu (Arapaima cf. gigas) population recovery under community-based management in an area along the Jurua River, in western Brazilian Amazonia. We show evidence of population recovery even outside formal protected areas, reinforcing the suitability of pirarucu community-based management as a powerful tool for both biodiversity conservation and the improvement of local livelihoods. We also show pirarucu movements across a floodplain mosaic-including lakes, the main river channel, tributary streams, and flooded forests-during the wet season. Our results support evidence of site fidelity among migrating pirarucu, justifying the high effort invested by local communities in seasonally protecting lakes from poachers and illegal fishers. Finally, restricted daily movement patterns by pirarucu support the suitability of population estimates based on day-time counts because the chance of double counting is substantially reduced during the day when these counts are conducted. We highlight the strong suitability of this species for community-based management, since they can: (1) replenish new environments during the wet season through migration and possibly also reproduction; and (2) be efficiently harvested during the dry season, delivering social and ecological benefits at large spatial scales. Positive examples of fisheries management, which align biodiversity conservation and social development, are important for building optimism, and influencing local and international stakeholders. Our study shows how engaging and empowering local communities to help monitor the movement ecology of target species can be an effective strategy to support the sustainable management of aquatic resources in tropical environments.					; Peres, Carlos/B-1276-2013; Campos-Silva, Joao/S-4487-2019	Hawes, Joseph/0000-0003-0053-2018; Peres, Carlos/0000-0002-1588-8765; campos e silva, joao vitor/0000-0003-4998-7216; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2019	64	7					1255	1264		10.1111/fwb.13301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13301													WOS:000471049400002

Sensitive response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to surface melt drainage over a soft bed	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The dynamic response of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) depends on feedbacks between surface meltwater delivery to the subglacial environment and ice flow. Recent work has highlighted an important role of hydrological processes in regulating the ice flow, but models have so far overlooked the mechanical effect of soft basal sediment. Here we use a three-dimensional model to investigate hydrological controls on a GrIS soft-bedded region. Our results demonstrate that weakening and strengthening of subglacial sediment, associated with the seasonal delivery of surface meltwater to the bed, modulates ice flow consistent with observations. We propose that sedimentary control on ice flow is a viable alternative to existing models of evolving hydrological systems, and find a strong link between the annual flow stability, and the frequency of high meltwater discharge events. Consequently, the observed GrIS resilience to enhanced melt could be compromised if runoff variability increases further with future climate warming.

J	Zhou, JW; Cui, P; Fang, H				Zhou, Jia-wen; Cui, Peng; Fang, Hua			Dynamic process analysis for the formation of Yangjiagou landslide-dammed lake triggered by the Wenchuan earthquake, China	LANDSLIDES												The damming of rivers by landslides resulting in the formation of a lake was one of the typical secondary geological hazards triggered by the Wenchuan earthquake which occurred on May 12, 2008. Some landslide-dammed lakes were at a high risk of causing further damage since the rainstorm season was expected soon after the earthquake. Understanding the dynamic processes in the formation of landslide-dammed lakes is helpful in planning the mitigation measures. The Yangjiagou landslide-dammed lake was selected as a case study to investigate the typical processes of dam formation. The dynamic simulation of the formation of the Yangjiagou landslide-dammed lake was divided into two steps: the landslide step and the overflow/overtopping step. Two-dimensional discrete element method (DEM) was adopted to investigate the mechanics of the Yangjiagou landslide. The landslide process was found to be controlled by the bond strength and residual friction coefficient of the DEM models. Computational results show that the formation of the landslide dam took approximately 35 s. The maximum velocity of a typical particle was approximately 26.8 m/s. The shallow-water equation and finite difference method were used to analyze the hydrodynamic mechanisms of the overflow process of the landslide-dammed lake. Computational results show that overflow would have occurred 15.1 h after the river was blocked, and overtopping failure occurs for the landslide dam in the rainstorm season when the water flow is large enough, causing a major disaster.					; Zhou, Jia-wen/A-7807-2012	Cui, Peng/0000-0002-3973-5966; 													1612-510X	1612-5118				JUN	2013	10	3					331	342		10.1007/s10346-013-0387-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-013-0387-3													WOS:000319768400008

The objective of this study is to present an in-depth investigation of black bloom effects on the activities and composition of SRB, as well as the interactions between SRB and other bacteria. Water and surface sediments samples were collected from a shallow freshwater lake during black and non-black blooms. Sulfate reduction rates (SRRs) in the water column were determined from the linear regression of sulfate depletion with time. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs), targeting the dsrA gene and Illumina sequencing of 16S rDNA, were used to estimate the SRB population and SRB community structures, respectively. Our data indicate that although a higher abundance of SRB was responsible for the higher SRR in the bottom water (34.09 +/- 2.37 nmol mL(-1) day(-1)) than in the surface water (14.57 +/- 2.91 nmol mL(-1) day(-1)) during black blooms, cell-specific sulfate reduction rates (csSRRs) in the distinct water layers were not significantly different (P = 0.95), with the value of approximately 0.017 fmol cell(-1) day(-1). Additionally, Desulfomicrobium and Desulfovibrio were the two main genera of SRB in the water column during black bloom season, while Desulfobulbus, Desulfobacca and Desulfatiglans genera were identified in the sediments of both the black and non-black blooms in genera pools. Each SRB genus preferentially associated with bacteria for specific functions in the bacterial co-occurrence network, regardless of whether black booms occurred or not. These results extend our knowledge on the importance of SRB during black blooms and the adaptation of SRB to environmental changes in freshwater lakes.

Eight metal species containing iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), cadmium (Cd), chrome (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), in multiple phases of sediments, suspended solids ( 0.7 mu m), colloids (1 nm-0.7 mu m) and dissolved phase (<1 nm) were analysed to characterize their temporal-spatial patterns, partitioning and transport on a watershed scale. Metal concentrations were associated with suspended solids in the water column and decreased from low flow to high flow. However, metal partitioning between particulate phase (suspended solids) and dissolvable phases (colloids and dissolved phase) was reversed and increased from low flow to high flow with decreased concentration of total suspended solids and median particle size. Partition coefficients (k(p)) showed differences among metal species, with higher values for Pb (354.3-649.0 L/g) and Cr (54.2-223.7 L/g) and lower values for Zn (2.5-25.2 L/g) and Cd (17.3-21.0 L/g). Metal concentrations in sediments increased by factors of 1.2-3.0 from upstream to downstream in watersheds impacted by urbanization. The behaviours of metals in rivers provide deeper insight into the ecological risks they pose for downstream lakes, where increased redox potential and organic matter may increase metal mobility due to algal blooms. Areas with heavy pollution of metals and the transport routines of metals in the river networks were also revealed in our research.

Tropical Montane Forest Conversion Is a Critical Driver for Sediment Supply in East African Catchments	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Land use change is known to affect suspended sediment fluxes in headwater catchments. There is however limited empirical evidence of the magnitude of these effects for montane catchments in East Africa. We collected a unique 4-year high-frequency data set and assessed seasonal sediment variation, water pathways, and sediment response to hydrology in three catchments under contrasting land use in the Mau Forest Complex, Kenya's largest tropical montane forest. Annual suspended sediment yield was significantly higher in a smallholder agriculture-dominated catchment (131.5 +/- 90.6 t km(-2) yr(-1)) than in a tea-tree plantation catchment (42.0 +/- 21.0 t km(-2) yr(-1)) and a natural forest catchment (21.5 +/- 11.1 t km(-2) yr(-1)) (p < 0.05). Transfer function models showed that in the natural forest and the tea-tree plantations subsurface flow pathways delivered water to the stream, while in the smallholder agriculture shallow subsurface and surface runoff were dominant. There was a delayed sediment response to rainfall for the smallholder agriculture and the tea-tree plantations. A slow depletion in sediment supply suggests that the wider catchment area supplies sediment, especially in the catchment dominated by smallholder farming. In contrast, a fast sediment response and depletion in sediment supply in the natural forest suggests a dominance of temporarily stored and nearby sediment sources. This study shows that the vegetation cover of a forest ecosystem is very effective in conserving soil, whereas catchments with more bare soil and poor soil conservation practices generated six times more suspended sediment yield. Catchment connectivity through unpaved tracks is thought to be the main explanation for the difference in sediment yield.

In response to this, fishers have resorted to using some climate change adaptation strategies(CCAS). This study assessed whether or not climate change adaptation strategies used by inland artisanal fishers improve fish catchability along the Volta Lake in Ghana. The study used primary cross-sectional data. A conditional mixed-process (CMP) with an ordered probit outcome was used to estimate the effects of climate change adaptation strategies on fish catchability. The climate change adaptation strategies used by fishers in the study area are; increasing daily fishing time, increasing fishing efforts, changing fishing time, aquaculture production, migrating to another fishing area, fishing further away or deep inside the water, catching smaller fish, participation in alternative non-fishing livelihoods and taking a moratorium in fishing. It was evident that the more climate change adaptation strategies fishers use, the more fish they catch per unit man effort. It is prudent for stakeholders promoting climate change adaptation strategies and sustainable fishing especially the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development to promote these strategies in fishing. More emphasis should be placed on sustainable climate change adaption strategies such as aquaculture production and implementation of close fishing seasons.

Can mountain glacier melting explains the GRACE-observed mass loss in the southeast Tibetan Plateau: From a climate perspective?	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The southeast Tibetan Plateau (SETP) includes the majority of monsoonal temperate glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA), which is an important source of water for the upper reaches of several large Asian river systems. Climatic change and variability has substantial impacts on cryosphere and hydrological processes in the SETP. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravimetry observations between 2003 and 2009 suggest that there was an average mass loss rate of - 5.99 +/- 2.78 Gigatonnes (Gt)/yr in this region. Meanwhile, the hydrological data by model calculations from the GLDAS/Noah and CPC are used to estimate terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes with a slight negative trend of about - 0.3 Gt/yr. The recent studies (Kaab et al., 2012; Gardner et al., 2013) reported the thinning rates of mountain glaciers in HMA based on the satellite laser altimetry, and an approximate estimation of the glacier mass budget in the SETP was 4.69 +/- 2.03 Gt/yr during 2003-2009. This estimate accounted for a large proportion (similar to 78.3%) of the difference between the GRACE TWS and model-calculated TWS changes. To better understand the cause of sharp mass loss existing in the SETP, the correlations between key climatic variables (precipitation and temperature) and the GRACE TWS changes are examined at different timescales between 2003 and 2011. The results show that precipitation is the leading factors of abrupt, seasonal and multi-year undulating signals of GRACE Tws anomaly time series, but with weak correlations with the inter-annual trend and annual mass budget of GRACE TWS. In contrast, the annual mean temperature is tightly associated with the annual net mass budget (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), which indirectly suggests that the GRACE-observed mass loss in the SETP may be highly related to glacial processes.

Unveiling Distribution Patterns of Freshwater Phytoplankton by a Next Generation Sequencing Based Approach	PLOS ONE												The recognition and discrimination of phytoplankton species is one of the foundations of freshwater biodiversity research and environmental monitoring. This step is frequently a bottleneck in the analytical chain from sampling to data analysis and subsequent environmental status evaluation. Here we present phytoplankton diversity data from 49 lakes including three seasonal surveys assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S ribosomal RNA chloroplast and cyanobacterial gene amplicons and also compare part of these datasets with identification based on morphology. Direct comparison of NGS to microscopic data from three time-series showed that NGS was able to capture the seasonality in phytoplankton succession as observed by microscopy. Still, the PCR-based approach was only semi-quantitative, and detailed NGS and microscopy taxa lists had only low taxonomic correspondence. This is probably due to, both, methodological constraints and current discrepancies in taxonomic frameworks. Discrepancies included Euglenophyta and Heterokonta that were scarce in the NGS but frequently detected by microscopy and Cyanobacteria that were in general more abundant and classified with high resolution by NGS. A deep-branching taxonomically unclassified cluster was frequently detected by NGS but could not be linked to any group identified by microscopy. NGS derived phytoplankton composition differed significantly among lakes with different trophic status, showing that our approach can resolve phytoplankton communities at a level relevant for ecosystem management. The high reproducibility and potential for standardization and parallelization makes our NGS approach an excellent candidate for simultaneous monitoring of prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton in inland waters.

Methods We evaluated a comprehensive control strategy in two intervention villages and two control villages along Poyang Lake in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, where annual synchronous chemotherapy is routinely used. New interventions, implemented from 2005 through 2007, included removing cattle from snail- infested grasslands, providing farmers with mechanized farm equipment, improving sanitation by supplying tap water and building lavatories and latrines, providing boats with fecal- matter containers, and implementing an intensive health- education program. During the intervention period, we observed changes in S. japonicum infection in humans, measured the rate of infection in snails, and tested the infectivity of lake water in mice. Results After three transmission seasons, the rate of infection in humans decreased to less than 1.0% in the intervention villages, from 11.3% to 0.7% in one village and from 4.0% to 0.9% in the other ( P< 0.001 for both comparisons). The rate of infection in humans in control villages fluctuated but remained at baseline levels. In intervention villages, the percentage of sampling sites with infected snails decreased from 2.2% to 0.1% in one grassland area and from 0.3% to no infection in the other ( P< 0.001 for both comparisons). The rate of infection in mice after exposure to lake water decreased from 79% to no infection ( P< 0.001). Conclusions A comprehensive control strategy based on interventions to reduce the rate of transmission of S. japonicum infection from cattle and humans to snails was highly effective. These interventions have been adopted as the national strategy to control schistosomiasis in China.

P. M.			Understanding the performance of the FLake model over two African Great Lakes	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												The ability of the one-dimensional lake model FLake to represent the mixolimnion temperatures for tropical conditions was tested for three locations in East Africa: Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika's northern and southern basins. Meteorological observations from surrounding automatic weather stations were corrected and used to drive FLake, whereas a comprehensive set of water temperature profiles served to evaluate the model at each site. Careful forcing data correction and model configuration made it possible to reproduce the observed mixed layer seasonality at Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika (northern and southern basins), with correct representation of both the mixed layer depth and water temperatures. At Lake Kivu, mixolimnion temperatures predicted by FLake were found to be sensitive both to minimal variations in the external parameters and to small changes in the meteorological driving data, in particular wind velocity. In each case, small modifications may lead to a regime switch, from the correctly represented seasonal mixed layer deepening to either completely mixed or permanently stratified conditions from similar to 10 m downwards. In contrast, model temperatures were found to be robust close to the surface, with acceptable predictions of near-surface water temperatures even when the seasonal mixing regime is not reproduced. FLake can thus be a suitable tool to parameterise tropical lake water surface temperatures within atmospheric prediction models. Finally, FLake was used to attribute the seasonal mixing cycle at Lake Kivu to variations in the near-surface meteorological conditions. It was found that the annual mixing down to 60m during the main dry season is primarily due to enhanced lake evaporation and secondarily to the decreased incoming long wave radiation, both causing a significant heat loss from the lake surface and associated mixolimnion cooling.					; van Lipzig, Nicole/ABF-2964-2021; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/ABG-2933-2020; Thiery, Wim/AAJ-6692-2021	Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; van Lipzig, Nicole/0000-0003-2899-4046; Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145													1991-959X	1991-9603					2014	7	1					317	337		10.5194/gmd-7-317-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-7-317-2014													WOS:000332799400012

While both lytic and lysogenic infections are routinely observed in the environment, the ecological and evolutionary processes regulating these viral dynamics are still not well understood, especially for uncultivated virus-host pairs. Here, we characterized the long-term dynamics of uncultivated viruses infecting green sulfur bacteria (GSB) in a model freshwater lake (Trout Bog Lake, TBL). As no GSB virus has been formally described yet, we first used two complementary approaches to identify new GSB viruses from TBL; one in vitro based on flow cytometry cell sorting, the other in silico based on CRISPR spacer sequences. We then took advantage of existing TBL metagenomes covering the 2005-2018 period to examine the interactions between GSB and their viruses across years and seasons. From our data, GSB populations in TBL were constantly associated with at least 2-8 viruses each, including both lytic and temperate phages. The dominant GSB population in particular was consistently associated with two prophages with a nearly 100% infection rate for >10 years. We illustrate with a theoretical model that such an interaction can be stable given a low, but persistent, level of prophage induction in low-diversity host populations. Overall, our data suggest that lytic and lysogenic viruses can readily co-infect the same host population, and that host strain-level diversity might be an important factor controlling virus-host dynamics including lytic/lysogeny switch.

J	Shaw, EL; Gagnon, VS; Ravindran, E				Shaw, Emily L.; Gagnon, Valoree S.; Ravindran, Evelyn			Seasons of research with/by/as the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In response to generations of inequitable research to/for Indigenous communities, many have and are developing research practices that center Indigenous priorities. In this paper, we share the Seasons of Research framework developed by the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community and University collaborators. First, we outline the scholarship that provides the foundations for research and being researchers in Keweenaw Bay. This section includes a comprehensive table that summarizes resources for building, strengthening, and sustaining equitable research partnerships with/by/as Indigenous communities. Next, we share the guidance for research partnerships we created together that uses the Medicine Wheel to illustrate an interconnected system of partnership teachings. The guidance aims for balance between and among four seasons of research: relationship building, planning and prioritization, knowledge exchange, and synthesis and application. Research partnerships with/by/as the Community demonstrate respect for each other's differences, honor reciprocity in actions, exemplify responsibility for differing commitments, and express reverence for shared lands, waters, and living beings. Personal reflections by lead author Emily Shaw are shared to demonstrate the process and practices associated with seasons of research, bridging Indigenous wisdom, social and natural sciences, and environmental engineering. We conclude with a few words on the transformation of the research landscape with Indigenous peoples at home and abroad. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Direct O2 control on the partitioning between denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium in lake sediments	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lacustrine sediments are important sites of fixed-nitrogen (N) elimination through the reduction of nitrate to N-2 by denitrifying bacteria, and they are thus critical for the mitigation of anthropogenic loading of fixed N in lakes. In contrast, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) retains bioavailable N within the system, promoting internal eutrophication. Both processes are thought to occur under oxygen-depleted conditions, but the exact O-2 concentration thresholds particularly of DNRA inhibition are uncertain. In O-2 manipulation laboratory experiments with dilute sediment slurries and (NO3-)-N-15 additions at low-to sub-micromolar O-2 levels, we investigated how, and to what extent, oxygen controls the balance between DNRA and denitrification in lake sediments. In all O-2-amended treatments, oxygen significantly inhibited both denitrification and DNRA compared to anoxic controls, but even at relatively high O-2 concentrations (>= 70 mu mol L-1), nitrate reduction by both denitrification and DNRA was observed, suggesting a relatively high O-2 tolerance. Nevertheless, differential O-2 control and inhibition effects were observed for denitrification versus DNRA in the sediment slurries. Below 1 mu mol L-1 O-2, denitrification was favoured over DNRA, while DNRA was systematically more important than denitrification at higher O-2 levels. Our results thus demonstrate that O-2 is an important regulator of the partitioning between N loss and N recycling in sediments. In natural environments, where O-2 concentrations change in near-bottom waters on an annual scale (e.g., overturning lakes with seasonal anoxia), a marked seasonality with regards to internal N eutrophication versus efficient benthic fixed-N elimination can be expected.					; Lehmann, Moritz/A-3301-2014; Lehmann, Moritz F./A-3301-2014; Lepori, Fabio/F-8966-2012; Zopfi, Jakob/E-8245-2017	Cojean, Adeline/0000-0002-9611-4592; Lehmann, Moritz F./0000-0003-0626-5942; Cannata, Massimiliano/0000-0003-2527-1416; Zopfi, Jakob/0000-0002-8437-7344; Lepori, Fabio/0000-0002-6438-9452													1726-4170	1726-4189				DEC 10	2019	16	23					4705	4718		10.5194/bg-16-4705-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4705-2019													WOS:000502281100003

Abundant pre-industrial carbon detected in Canadian Arctic headwaters: implications for the permafrost carbon feedback	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Mobilization of soil/sediment organic carbon into inland waters constitutes a substantial, but poorly-constrained, component of the global carbon cycle. Radiocarbon (C-14) analysis has proven a valuable tool in tracing the sources and fate of mobilized carbon, but aquatic C-14 studies in permafrost regions rarely detect 'old' carbon (assimilated from the atmosphere into plants and soil prior to AD1950). The emission of greenhouse gases derived from old carbon by aquatic systems may indicate that carbon sequestered prior to AD1950 is being destabilized, thus contributing to the 'permafrost carbon feedback' (PCF). Here, we measure directly the C-14 content of aquatic CO2, alongside dissolved organic carbon, in headwater systems of the western Canadian Arctic-the first such concurrent measurements in the Arctic. Age distribution analysis indicates that the age of mobilized aquatic carbon increased significantly during the 2014 snow-free season as the active layer deepened. This increase in age was more pronounced in DOC, rising from 101-228 years before sampling date (a 120%-125% increase) compared to CO2, which rose from 92-151 years before sampling date (a 59%-63% increase). 'Pre-industrial' aged carbon (assimilated prior to similar to AD1750) comprised 15%-40% of the total aquatic carbon fluxes, demonstrating the prevalence of old carbon to Arctic headwaters. Although the presence of this old carbon is not necessarily indicative of a net positive PCF, we provide an approach and baseline data which can be used for future assessment of the PCF.

The consequences of permafrost degradation associated with thermokarst for surface ecology, landscape evolution, and hydrological processes have been of great scientific interest and social concern. Part of a tundra patch affected by wildfire in northern Alaska (27.5 km(2)) was investigated here, using remote sensing and in situ surveys to quantify and understand permafrost thaw dynamics after surface disturbances. A two-pass differential InSAR technique using L-band ALOS-PALSAR has been shown capable of capturing thermokarst subsidence triggered by a tundra fire at a spatial resolution of tens of meters, with supporting evidence from field data and optical satellite images. We have introduced a calibration procedure, comparing burned and unburned areas for InSAR subsidence signals, to remove the noise due to seasonal surface movement. In the first year after the fire, an average subsidence rate of 6.2 cm/year (vertical) was measured. Subsidence in the burned area continued over the following two years, with decreased rates. The mean rate of subsidence observed in our interferograms (from 24 July 2008 to 14 September 2010) was 3.3 cm/year, a value comparable to that estimated from field surveys at two plots on average (2.2 cm/year) for the six years after the fire. These results suggest that this InSAR-measured ground subsidence is caused by the development of thermokarst, a thawing process supported by surface change observations from high-resolution optical images and in situ ground level surveys.					; Uchida, Masao/C-3673-2013; Iwahana, Go/I-3500-2018; Liu, Lin/Q-4237-2018	Yamanokuchi, Tsutomu/0000-0001-9333-682X; Iwahana, Go/0000-0003-4628-1074; Liu, Lin/0000-0002-9581-1337														2072-4292				MAR	2016	8	3							218	10.3390/rs8030218	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs8030218													WOS:000373627400075
J	Zhang, SY; Li, XY; Zhao, GQ; Huang, YM				Zhang, Si-Yi; Li, Xiao-Yan; Zhao, Guo-Qin; Huang, Yong-Mei			Surface energy fluxes and controls of evapotranspiration in three alpine ecosystems of Qinghai Lake watershed, NE Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	ECOHYDROLOGY												Qinghai Lake watershed, located in the northeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is a region that is sensitive and vulnerable to global climate change. Both the hydrological cycle and water balance in a watershed are significantly influenced by surface energy fluxes and evapotranspiration (ET); however, there is limited information related to the water and heat fluxes in this area. Using the Bowen ratio energy balance method, we measured surface energy fluxes and ET and then explored their controlling factors in three typical ecosystems of the Qinghai Lake watershed, i.e. Kobresia meadow (KMd.), Potentilla fruticosa shrub (PFSh.) and Achnatherum splendens steppe (ASSt.) between 2012 and 2013 for the first time. It was found that between the different ecosystems, there were large differences in the energy portioning. Annual sensible and latent heats accounted for 56-64% and 35-45% of net radiation, respectively. The Bowen rations were the highest in the ASSt. site and the lowest in the PFSh. site. The Bowen ratios and soil water content had negative correlations. Annual ET was 507.9, 493.2 and 413.7mm for the PFSh., KMd. and ASSt. sites, respectively. The annual ET in the KMd. and PFSh. sites was 16% and 3% less than the annual precipitation, while the ET was 26% higher than precipitation for the ASSt. site. Fluctuations in the daily ET of alpine ecosystems from the Qinghai Lake watershed were primarily controlled by radiation, especially during the growing season, whereas ET was also controlled by soil water content in the ASSt. ecosystem where precipitation was low.

Generalist feeding strategies in Arctic freshwater fish: A mechanism for dealing with extreme environments	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Generalist feeding strategies are favoured in stressful or variable environments where flexibility in ecological traits is beneficial. Species that feed across multiple habitat types and trophic levels may impart stability on food webs through the use of readily available, alternative energy pools. In lakes, generalist fish species may take advantage of spatially and temporally variable prey by consuming both benthic and pelagic prey to meet their energy demands. Using stomach content and stable isotope analyses, we examined the feeding habits of fish species in Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) lakes to determine the prevalence of generalist feeding strategies as a mechanism for persistence in extreme environments (e.g. low productivity, extreme cold and short growing season). Generalist and flexible feeding strategies were evident in five common fish species. Fish fed on benthic and pelagic (or nektonic) prey and across trophic levels. Three species were clearly omnivorous, feeding on fish and their shared invertebrate prey. Dietary differences based on stomach content analysis often exceeded 70%, and overlap in dietary niches based on shared isotopic space varied from zero to 40%. Metrics of community-wide trophic structure varied with the number and identity of species involved and on the dietary overlap and niche size of individual fishes. Accumulation of energy from shared carbon sources by Arctic fishes creates redundancy in food webs, increasing likely resistance to perturbations or stochastic events. Therefore, the generalist and omnivorous feeding strategies employed by ACP fish may maintain energy flow and food web stability in extreme environments.					; Rosenberger, Amanda/R-9578-2018	Laske, Sarah/0000-0002-6096-0420; Zimmerman, Christian/0000-0002-3646-0688; Rosenberger, Amanda/0000-0002-5520-8349													0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2018	27	3					767	784		10.1111/eff.12391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12391													WOS:000434638800012

Nitrate is a key form of nitrogen that can cause water quality degradation. In this study, hydrochemical and dual isotopic approaches were utilized to identify the seasonal variation of nitrate sources in the Chaohu Lake and its inflowing rivers. The average nitrate concentrations ([NO3-]) of the lake and its inflowing rivers were 89.9 and 140.8 mu mol L-1, respectively. The isotopic values of delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- in the lake ranged from - 1.01 to + 16.67 parts per thousand and from - 4.39 to + 22.20 parts per thousand, respectively. The two major rivers had distinct isotopic compositions, with averaged delta N-15-NO3- values of + 17.52 and + 3.51 parts per thousand, and average delta O-18-NO3- values of + 2.71 and + 7.47 parts per thousand for the Nanfei River and Hangbu River, respectively. The results show that soil organic ammonium and urban wastewater discharge were the main sources of nitrate in the Chaohu Lake, and nitrate assimilation was an important process affected [NO3-] and isotopic compositions, especially in the western Chaohu Lake. The elevated [NO3-] and delta N-15-NO3- values in the western Chaohu Lake indicate the high influence of human activities. Urban wastewater discharge was the primary nitrate source in the Nanfei River and soil organic ammonium was the main source in the Hangbu River. Although nitrate from direct atmospheric deposition was low, its strong flushing effect can substantially improve riverine [NO3-] and nitrate loading from terrestrial ecosystem. The relatively high nitrate fluxes from the Hangbu River indicate that nitrogen loading from agricultural watershed is unneglectable in watershed nitrogen sources reduction strategies.

Field surveys and current climate change projections (associated with longer dry spells, and shortened rain seasons) have shown that climate change and the rapid spread of aquatic invasive species are increasingly affecting inland surface water availability in semi-arid regions of Southern Africa. It is upon this premise that accurate, reliable, and timely information on the spatio-temporal distribution and configuration of water hyacinth is required in tracing their evolution and propagation in affected areas as well as in potential vulnerable areas. This work, therefore, attempts to test two robust push-broom multispectral sensors: Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) in identifying, detecting, and mapping the spatial distribution and configuration of invasive water hyacinth in a river system. The results of the study show that water hyacinth in small reservoirs can be mapped with an overall accuracy of 68.44% and 77.56% using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data, respectively. The results further demonstrated the blue, red, red edge (RE) 1, short-wavelength infrared (SWIR)-1, and SWIR-2 of both satellite data sets as the critical and outstanding spectral regions in detecting and mapping water hyacinth from other land-cover types. Overall, the study highlights the unexploited prospects of the new noncommercial multispectral sensors in monitoring invasive species infestation from inland surface water-bodies in semi-arid regions (i.e. smaller reservoirs).					; Thamaga, Humphrey/AER-4145-2022; Dube, Timothy/O-5006-2019	Dube, Timothy/0000-0003-3456-8991; Thamaga, Kgabo Humphrey/0000-0002-2305-9975; 													0143-1161	1366-5901					2018	39	22					8041	8059		10.1080/01431161.2018.1479796	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.1479796													WOS:000456452100008

Normalized difference water indexes have dissimilar performances in detecting seasonal and permanent water in the Sahara-Sahel transition zone	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The decrease of water resources can enhance poverty and increase insecurity in dry regions, at the same time leading to loss of biological diversity. For these reasons, the information about surface perennial and well-known water sources in the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa has been mapped. However, seasonal water can be missed in mapping due to their short and erratic appearance, while the mapping of any aquatic resources represents a foremost priority for protecting social, economic and biological values in the e.g. Sahara-Sahel transition zone. Therefore, Remote Sensing becomes crucial to monitor a variety of wetland systems in these regions. This work evaluates the performance of three Normalized Difference Water Indexes [Gao's NDWI (NDWINIR/MIR), McFeeters' NDWI (NDWIG/NIR) and Xu's NDWI (NDWIG/MIR)] in mapping of water systems across Mauritania. Maps with seasonal and permanent water were derived, using a multi-temporal series of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ images. The performance of indexes was compared based on 551 control points collected during five fieldwork missions to Mauritania between 2007 and 2011. Control points were separated in three classes of water availability (permanent, seasonal and non-water points) and then randomly assigned into two data sets: one for selecting the water availability thresholds for index reclassification and another for threshold validation. NDWIG/MIR and NDWINIR/MIR had good performances in detecting permanent and seasonal water, respectively, while NDWIG/NIR failed to detect most of the water bodies. The threshold selection generated water maps with seasonal and permanent features that might be missing in simple mapping of aquatic systems. The extensive data collection provides novel information about NDWI performances for water delineation in arid and semi-arid regions and for a future management of aquatic environments of the Sahara-Sahel transition zone.

J	Piman, T; Lennaerts, T; Southalack, P				Piman, T.; Lennaerts, T.; Southalack, P.			Assessment of hydrological changes in the lower Mekong Basin from Basin-Wide development scenarios	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The Mekong is one of the world's great rivers. It has the greatest mean annual flow in the world for a river basin of comparable size. The flow regime, with very distinct wet and dry seasons, supports a rich biodiversity and the world's largest freshwater fishery. Given that at the present time the hydrological regime of the Mekong remains in its natural state, the accelerating pace of water resources development will induce hydrological change. The natural productivity of the system is therefore potentially jeopardized. This paper reports the findings of simulation studies of the potential hydrological impacts of water resource development scenarios over future planning horizons. In the Definite Future scenario (next 5years), the seasonal redistribution of water by on-going hydropower development will increase the dry season flow by 40-60% in the upper portion of the basin and by 20-30% in the Mekong Delta. The Foreseeable Future scenario (next 20years) and Long-Term Future scenario (next 50years) will result in relatively small changes to the flow regime as further increases in dry season reservoir releases will be offset by planned increases in irrigation and other consumptive water demands. All scenarios were predicted to reduce the average wet season flows by 4-14%, flow reversal to the Tonle Sap Lake by 7-16%, flooded areas by 5-8% and salinity intrusion areas in the Viet Nam Delta by 15-17%.

Upon analyses for the purpose thereof, heavy metal contamination in annual average concentrations in the lake sediment varied, respectively, as Fe > Zn > Cr > Ni > Cu > Pb > Co > As > Cd. Statistical assessments performed in order to see whether the average values of the heavy metal contamination as measured at stations placed in the lake changed by seasonal periods. There found statistically significant differences especially in Cd, Zn, and Pb between seasonal periods. In accordance with the Sediment Quality Index, Gokcekaya Dam Lake sediment was classified as "highly polluted" in terms of the amount of anthropogenic contaminants of As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Enrichment factor and geoaccumulation index values (I-geo) were calculated in order to geochemically interpret the source of contamination due to heavy metal concentration in the lake sediment and the level of pollution. The As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni Pb, and Zn values demonstrated that the sediment was rich for anthropogenic contaminants. The lake was found especially rich for arsenic (14.97-34.70 mg/kg) and lead (68.75-98.65 mg/kg) in accordance with annual average values. In general the lake was geochemically characterized as "moderately contaminated" in terms of As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn content.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN	2017	76	11							402	10.1007/s12665-017-6744-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6744-0													WOS:000403434600021

Identifying and Eliminating Sources of Recreational Water Quality Degradation along an Urban Coast	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Restoration of highly degraded urban coastal waters often requires large-scale, complex projects, but in the interim, smaller-scale efforts can provide immediate improvements to water quality conditions for visitor use. We examined short-term efforts to improve recreational water quality near the Grand Calumet River (GC) in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Identified as an Area of Concern (AOC) by the International Joint Commission, the GC has experienced years of industrial and municipal waste discharges, and as a result, coastal beaches have some of the highest rates of beach closings (>70%) in the United States. Project objectives were to identify sources of microbial contamination and to evaluate a short-term management solution to decrease beach closings: during 2015 (partial) and 2016 (season-long), canines were used to deter gull presence. Water samples were analyzed for Escherichia coli in 2015 and 2016, and fecal sources were evaluated using microbial source tracking markers (2015): human (Bacteroides HF183, Methanobrevibacter nifH), gull (Gull2), and dog (DogBact). Hydrometeorological conditions were simultaneously measured. Results indicated that human, gull, and canine fecal sources were present, with gulls being the dominant source. Escherichia coli densities were highly correlated with number of gulls present, Gull2 marker, and turbidity. Gull deterrence decreased E. coli and Gull2 marker detection during 2015, but numbers rebounded after program completion. The full-season program in 2016 resulted in lower E. coli densities and fewer beach closings. Large-scale restoration efforts are underway at this location, but short-term, small-scale projects can be useful for reducing beach closings and restoring ecosystem services.					; Phanikumar, Mantha/A-2523-2008	Nevers, Meredith/0000-0001-6963-6734; Jackson, P.

This raises the need for monitoring and management actions to prevent widespread environmentally negative effects (e.g., anoxia). An efficient approach to monitoring water quality and primary producers in inland waters is to integrate in situ with remote sensing data. In this work, satellite multispectral data acquired by Sentinel-2 A are used to assess the intra-annual spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton abundance, in terms of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and macrophyte Leaf Area Index (LAI) in a shallow eutrophic fluvial lake system (Mantua Lakes, Italy). Chl-a concentrations and LAI were derived from Sentinel-2 A data by applying a semi-empirical band ratio algorithm combined with a bio-optical model (BOMBER) for the former (Chl-a), and a semi-empirical model for the latter (LAI). These products were validated against in situ data (rRMSE = 20% for both products; R-2 = 0.93 for Chl-a; R-2 = 0.83 for LAI). Phytoplankton maps showed a marked intra-annual spatial and temporal variability, generally revealing a Chl-a concentration gradient from lotic to lentic waters. Air temperature was the main driver of Chl-a concentration, followed by water discharge and precipitation. The macrophyte LAI followed aquatic plant growth seasonally, and was independent of the hydro-meteorological data. Allochthonous and invasive macrophyte species (such as Nelumbo nucifera and Ludwigia hexapetala) had higher LAI compared than the Mantua Lakes' autochthonous floating-leaved species (e.g., Trapa natans and Nuphar lutea). Maps of the abundance of primary producers can be used to follow the temporal and spatial evolution of different communities and support management actions, e.g., by identifying potential algal bloom hotspots, or the optimal timing for measures to control invasive species overgrowth.					; Tóth, Viktor/MFZ-7583-2025; Austoni, Martina/IXD-7503-2023; Laini, Alex/W-8628-2019; Lami, Andrea/M-3982-2019; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; fadel, ali/AAF-7950-2019; Lami, Andrea/F-1415-2013; Villa, Paolo/M-6015-2014; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013	Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; Cazzaniga, Ilaria/0000-0001-8090-3864; Austoni, Martina/0000-0002-8214-1442; Laini, Alex/0000-0002-3458-7538; FADEL, Ali/0000-0001-9986-0892; Lami, Andrea/0000-0003-3627-0363; 													0075-9511	1873-5851				SEP	2018	72						32	43		10.1016/j.limno.2018.08.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2018.08.002													WOS:000447777500005

Phylogenetic conservation of freshwater lake habitat preference varies between abundant bacterioplankton phyla	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Despite their homogeneous appearance, aquatic systems harbour heterogeneous habitats resulting from nutrient gradients, suspended particulate matter and stratification. Recent reports suggest phylogenetically conserved habitat preferences among bacterioplankton, particularly for particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) habitats. Here, we show that independent of lake nutrient level and layer, PA and FL abundance-weighted bacterial community composition (BCC) differed and that inter-lake BCC varied more for PA than for FL fractions. In low-nutrient lakes, BCC differences between PA and FL fractions were larger than those between lake layers. The reverse was true for high-nutrient lakes. Nutrient level affected BCC more in hypolimnia than in epilimnia, likely due to hypolimnetic hypoxia in high-nutrient lakes. In line with previous reports, we observed within-phylum operational taxonomic unit (OTU) habitat preference conservation, although not for all phyla, including the phylum with the highest average relative abundance across all habitats (Bacteroidetes). Consistent phylum-level habitat preferences may indicate that the functional traits that underpin ecological adaptation of freshwater bacteria to lake habitats can be phylogenetically conserved, although the levels of conservation are phylum dependent. Resolving taxa preferences for freshwater habitats sets the stage for identification of traits that underpin habitat specialization and associated functional traits that influence differences in biogeochemical cycling across freshwater lake habitats.

Although nutrient enrichment is commonly identified as a key predictor of cyanobacterial abundance and dominance in freshwaters, several studies have shown that variables related to climate change can also play an important role. Based on our analysis of the literature, we hypothesized that temperature or water-column stability will be the primary drivers of cyanobacterial abundance in stratified lakes whereas nutrients will be the stronger predictors in frequently mixing water bodies. To test this hypothesis, as well as quantify the drivers of cyanobacteria over different scales and identify interactions between nutrients and climate-related variables, we applied linear and nonlinear mixed-effect modeling techniques to seasonal time-series data from multiple lakes. We first compared time series of cyanobacterial dominance to a published lake survey and found that the models were similar. Using time-series data of cyanobacterial biomass, we identified important interactions among nutrients and climate-related variables; dimictic basin experienced a heightened susceptibility to cyanobacterial blooms under stratified eutrophic conditions, whereas polymictic basins were less sensitive to changes in temperature or stratification. Overall, our results show that due to predictable interactions among nutrients and temperature, polymictic and dimictic lakes are expected to respond differently to future climate warming and eutrophication.

To assess the variation of water recharging, the stable isotope abundances of hydrogen and oxygen (82H and 818O) of 152 water samples collected from the Yangtze River mainstream during May (the flat season) and September (the wet season) in 2021 were analyzed. Bayesian modelling was used to calculate the contribution rates of precipitation, glacier snow meltwater, and groundwater. The isotopic compositions of precipitation and the river exhibited comparable seasonal and spatial characteristics. The Bayesian model results showed that the mainstream was governed by precipitation, with a greater contribution of precipitation in the lower reaches during the wet season. Lakes had a larger contribution during the flat season, as evidenced by the greater increase in the magnitude of 818O values in the mid-lower reaches during this period. The mid-lower reaches of the river had a decreased river evaporation line (REL) slope, which could be owe to lake replenishment. In addition to intensifying the seasonal variations in the contribution ratios of the lakes, the emplacement of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) reduced the groundwater contribution of the reservoir. This study enhances our understanding of the hydrological and material cycles in the Yangtze River Basin and provides vital baseline knowledge on the contribution of different recharge sources in the mainstream.					yu, zhaoyuan/H-8800-2012; huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; Huang, Tao/NJR-6873-2025														0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	2024	639								131563	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131563		JUN 2024											WOS:001261907500001

We examine the hydrological fluxes for an Amazon floodplain lake connected to the Solimoes River using a process-based hydrologic model. Water exchanges between the river and lake agree well with field estimates, including the timing of different hydrological phases. However, beyond available field data, modeling results show that the seven simulated years all differed from each other. These interannual differences were caused by the interplay between phases when water levels were rising with river-water flowing into the lake (RWRI), versus rising with lake-water flowing out to the river (RWLO). This exchange determines the river-water content in the lake (C-L). Maximum C-L occurred before river levels peaked because local catchment contributions can be sufficient to push lake-water out to the river, even as river levels rise. Numerical experiments show that the seasonal distribution of local rainfall, local catchment size, and interannual variability in both climate and river stage can contribute to differing dynamics of C-L, in a floodplain lake. Their impacts vary among phases: river-rise dominates the RWRI, whereas local hydrological processes dominate the RWLO and receding-water phases. Intermediate-to-long-term rainfall accumulation controls C-L during the RWLO phase, whereas annual precipitation accumulation is important for C-L, during low water. Our model generalizes beyond limited available field studies and offers potential to better understand floodplain lakes in other areas and how regional versus local changes in climate may affect their hydrological dynamics.

However, the effects of eutrophication on VSC emissions from lake sediments as well as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, depth gradient sediments at different eutrophication levels and seasons were collected from Lake Taihu to investigate the response of sulfur biotransformation in the sediments to eu-trophication based on the analysis of environmental variables, microbial activity, abundance and community struc-ture. H2S and CS2 were the main VSCs produced from the lake sediments, with the production rates of 2.3-7.9 and 1.2-3.9 ng g-1 h-1 in August, respectively, which were higher than those in March, mainly due to the increasing ac-tivity and abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) at high temperatures. The VSC production rates from the sed-iments increased with lake eutrophication level. Higher VSC production rates were detected in surface sediments in eutrophic regions but in deep sediments in oligotrophic regions. Sulfuricurvum, Thiobacillus and Sulfuricella were the main sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) in the sediments, while Desulfatiglans and Desulfobacca were the predominant SRB. Organic matter, Fe3+, NO3--N and total sulfur had significant influences on the microbial communities in the sed-iments. Partial least squares path modelling showed that the trophic level index could stimulate VSC emissions from lake sediments by influencing the activities and abundances of SOB and SRB. These findings indicated that sediments contributed substantially to VSC emissions from eutrophic lakes, especially surface sediments, and sediment dredging might be an effective way to mitigate VSC emissions from eutrophic lakes.

Our previous work has demonstrated that damage to testicular structures and decline in sperm quality in male mice can be caused by microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR), but the overall effects of the scope and extent of paternal exposure on health and disease in the offspring remain underexplored. Here, we report that MC-LR-paternal-exposed offspring mice showed reduced litter size and body weight accompanied by increased abnormalities in the lung. Analyses of the small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) in the sperm from MC-LR-exposed males demonstrated the downregulation of a wide range of piRNAs enriched for those target genes involved in the regulation of the embryo implantation pathways. Gene and protein expression analyses, as well as biochemical and functional studies, revealed suppressed expression of Hsp90a in testicular tissues from MC-LR-exposed males. Decreased Hsp90 alpha in testicular tissues impaired the development of the offspring. In this study, we revealed that MC-LR alters the expression of Hsp90 alpha in testicular tissues to cause changes in the expression profiles of sperm piRNAs produced by paternal mice. These changes lead to aberrant activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in pulmonary tissues of offspring mice, causing lung tissue damage and abnormal development. We hereby confirmed that MC-LR-induced alterations in epigenetic inheritance are capable of contributing to intergenerational developmental defects in paternal-exposed offspring mice.

A Weather-Type-Based Cross-Time-Scale Diagnostic Framework for Coupled Circulation Models	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study proposes an integrated diagnostic framework based on atmospheric circulation regime spatial patterns and frequencies of occurrence to facilitate the identification of model systematic errors across multiple time scales. To illustrate the approach, three sets of 32-yr-long simulations are analyzed for northeastern North America and for the March-May season using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's Low Ocean-Atmosphere Resolution (LOAR) and Forecast-Oriented Low Ocean Resolution (FLOR) coupled models; the main difference between these two models is the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric model used. Regime-dependent biases are explored in the light of different atmospheric horizontal resolutions and under different nudging approaches. It is found that both models exhibit a fair representation of the observed circulation regime spatial patterns and frequencies of occurrence, although some biases are present independently of the horizontal resolution or the nudging approach and are associated with a misrepresentation of troughs centered north of the Great Lakes and deep coastal troughs. Moreover, the intraseasonal occurrence of certain model regimes is delayed with respect to observations. On the other hand, inter-experiment differences in the mean frequencies of occurrence of the simulated weather types, and their variability across multiple time scales, tend to be negligible. This result suggests that low-resolution models could be of potential use to diagnose and predict physical variables via their simulated weather type characteristics.

Interactions between specific phytoplankton and bacteria affect lake bacterial community succession	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Time-series observations and a phytoplankton manipulation experiment were combined to test the hypothesis that phytoplankton succession effects changes in bacterial community composition. Three humic lakes were sampled weekly May-August and correlations between relative abundances of specific phytoplankton and bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in each time series were determined. To experimentally characterize the influence of phytoplankton, bacteria from each lake were incubated with phytoplankton from one of the three lakes or no phytoplankton. Following incubation, variation in bacterial community composition explained by phytoplankton treatment increased 65%, while the variation explained by bacterial source decreased 64%. Free-living bacteria explained, on average, over 60% of the difference between phytoplankton and corresponding no-phytoplankton control treatments. Fourteen out of the 101 bacterial OTUs that exhibited positively correlated patterns of abundance with specific algal populations in time-series observations were enriched in mesocosms following incubation with phytoplankton, and one out of 59 negatively correlated bacterial OTUs was depleted in phytoplankton treatments. Bacterial genera enriched in mesocosms containing specific phytoplankton assemblages included Limnohabitans (clade betI-A), Bdellovibrio and Mitsuaria. These results suggest that effects of phytoplankton on certain bacterial populations, including bacteria tracking seasonal changes in algal-derived organic matter, result in correlations between algal and bacterial community dynamics.					; Kent, Angela/D-6124-2011; Giongo, Adriana/P-8718-2015	Brown, Chris/0000-0002-7758-6447; Giongo, Adriana/0000-0002-1412-7040; Kent, Angela/0000-0003-1837-2382													1462-2912	1462-2920				SEP	2013	15	9			SI		2489	2504		10.1111/1462-2920.12131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.12131								23663352					WOS:000323897000007

Daniel			Quantifying 3D vegetation structure in wetlands using differently measured airborne laser scanning data	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Mapping and quantifying 3D vegetation structure is essential for assessing and monitoring ecosystem structure and function within wetlands. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is a promising data source for developing indicators of 3D vegetation structure, but derived metrics are often not compared with 3D structural field measurements and the acquisition of ALS data is rarely standardized across different remote sensing surveys. Here, we compare a set of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) metrics derived from ALS datasets with varying characteristics to a standardized set of field measurements of vegetation height, biomass and Leaf Area Index (LAI) across three Hungarian lakes (Lake Balaton, Lake Fert.o and Lake Tisza). The ALS datasets differed in whether the recording type was full waveform (FWF) or discrete return, and in their point density (4 pt/m(2) and 21 pt/m(2)). A total of eight LiDAR metrics captured radiometric information as well as descriptors of vegetation cover, height and vertical variability. Multivariate regression models with field-based measurements of vegetation height, biomass or LAI as response variable and LiDAR metrics as predictors showed major differences between ALS recording types, and were affected by differences in spatial resolution, temporal offset and seasonality between field and ALS data acquisition. Vegetation height could be estimated with high to intermediate accuracy (FWF ALS data only: R-2 = 0.84; combination of ALS datasets: R-2 = 0.67), demonstrating its potential as a robust indicator of 3D vegetation structure across different ALS datasets. In contrast, the estimation of biomass and LAI in these wetlands was sensitive to variation in ALS characteristics and to the discrepancies between field and ALS data in terms of spatial resolution, temporal offset and seasonality (biomass: R-2 = 0.20-0.22; LAI: R-2 = 0.08-0.30). We recommend the use of FWF ALS data within wetlands because it captures more vegetation structural details in dense reed and marshland vegetation. We further suggest that ecologists and remote sensing scientist should better coordinate the simultaneous and standardized acquisition of field and ALS data for testing the robustness of quantitative descriptors of vegetation cover, height and vertical variability within wetlands. This is important for establishing operational and spatially contiguous ALS-based indicators of 3D ecosystem structure across wetlands.

Thad			Stoichiometric imbalance in rates of nitrogen and phosphorus retention, storage, and recycling can perpetuate nitrogen deficiency in highly-productive reservoirs	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured the nutrient stoichiometry of inputs, outputs, retention, storage, and recycling in three seasonally nitrogen (N)-deficient reservoirs by incorporating watershed mass balances with measurements of internal N and phosphorus (P) transformations. Our objective was to determine if the reservoirs were accumulating N and thereby likely to develop strict P deficiency over time. For the eutrophic reservoirs, the N: P (by atoms) of annual outputs was two to five times greater than that of inputs, reflecting higher retention efficiency for P than N (similar to 90% vs. similar to 50%, respectively) and resulting in retention stoichiometry indicative of N deficiency (N : P < 20). The N: P of these fluxes differed less for the mesotrophic reservoir because of similar N and P retention efficiencies, and the N: P of retained nutrients indicated strict P deficiency (N : P > 50). Denitrification (12-23 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) removed similar to 50-100% of N retained by the reservoirs annually, increasing N deficiency in storage relative to retention for all the reservoirs (N : P < 1-30). The combined effects of more efficient P than N retention and efficient denitrification were also evident in the low N: P (< 10) of internal recycling. N-2 fixation (7-11 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) was inefficient in balancing system N deficits and did not increase the low N: P of annual watershed inputs or seasonal epilimnion nutrient concentrations into the range of strict P deficiency. Low N: P storage and internal recycling strongly suggested that these reservoirs are not accumulating N relative to P and are thereby unlikely to become strictly P deficient over time.

Samples collected in the flood season showed higher PCB concentrations, larger PCB fluctuations and higher portions of large grain sediments in the inner estuary area compared with those collected in the dry season, indicating significant seasonal variations of PCBs. The effects of the physicochemical characteristics (TOC and grain size) of surface sediments on the distributions of PCBs were also investigated. Masked by various other factors, the TOC contents and sediment grain sizes did not exhibit a strong influence on the distributions of PCBs. Analysis of the PCB homolog and congener distribution patterns revealed a predominant proportion of light PCBs with 2-3 chlorines. According to the PCB homolog profiles and principal component analysis (PCA) of source contributions, non-point sources including atmospheric deposition and surface runoff associated with stormwater were suggested to be the major sources of PCBs in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary.

Traditional ecological assessments of lake or riverine ecosystems often require human supervision of a pre-selected reference area, using the current state of the reference area as the expected state. However, selecting an appropriate reference area has become increasingly difficult with the expansion of human activities. Here, an unsupervised biological integrity assessment framework based on environmental DNA metabarcoding without a prior reference area is proposed. Taxon richness, species dominance, co-occurrence network density, and phylogenetic distance were used to assess the aquatic communities in the Taihu Lake basin. Multi-gene metabarcoding revealed comprehensive biodiversity at multiple trophic levels including algae, protists, zooplankton, and fish. Fish sequences were mainly derived from 12S, zooplankton mainly from mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I, and algae and protists mainly from 18S. There were significant differences in community composition among lakes, rivers, and reservoirs but no significant differences in the four fundamental biological indicators. The algal and zooplankton integrities were positively correlated with protist and fish integrities, respectively. Additionally, the algal integrity of lakes was found to be significantly lower than that of rivers. The unsupervised assessment framework proposed in this study allows different ecosystems, including the same ecosystem in different seasons, to adopt the same indicators and assessment methods, which is more convenient for environmental management and decision-making.

This study revealed the annual and seasonal variations and trend prediction of water quality in the middle Yangtze River after the third impoundment stage of the Three Gorges Reservoir. Multivariate statistical methods including principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA), Mann-Kendall (M-K) tests, discriminant analysis (DA), rescaled range (R/S) analysis, and the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME-WQI) were used. Herein, eight water quality constituents including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), chloride (Cl), dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia nitrogen (NH3N), total phosphorus (TP), water temperature (T), and permanganate index (CODmn) were monthly monitored in the Jiujiang hydrological transaction during 2010-2019. The information of eight water quality constituents, related to salinity, nutrient status, and oxidation reactions efficiency, was extracted. Water quality status remained as fair-good during 2010-2019 based on the results of CCME-WQI, with the seasonal significance ranked as T > DO > Cl > pH > EC > TP > NH3N > CODmn. In the future decade, annual average T was predicted to continue to increase although it might decrease in the wet season. EC was predicted to continue increasing annually especially in the wet season while Cl might decrease. NH3N and TP might maintain a significant decreasing trend in the future wet and dry seasons. DO maintained significantly increasing especially in the future dry seasons, whereas CODmn will continue to decrease annually and seasonally. The continued alkalization trend of waterbody was predicted, which is more significant in the wet season. The results provide helpful references for the ecological protection of the middle Yangtze River.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2023	30	11					28745	28758		10.1007/s11356-022-23968-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-23968-9		NOV 2022						36402878					WOS:000885414700001

Significant precipitation and flooding anomalies have already been seen in magnitude and extension so far this year, which have been exerting much higher pressure on emergency responses in flood control and mitigation than in other years, even though a rainy season with multiple ongoing serious flood events in different provinces is not that uncommon in China. Instead of delving into the causes of the uniqueness of this year's extreme precipitation-flooding situation, which certainly warrants in-depth exploration, in this article we provide a short view toward a more general hydrometeorological solution to this annual nationwide problem. A "glocal" (global to local) hydrometeorological solution for floods (GHS-F) is considered to be critical for better preparedness, mitigation, and management of different types of significant precipitation-caused flooding, which happen extensively almost every year in many countries such as China, India and the United States. Such a GHS-F model is necessary from both scientific and operational perspectives, with the strength in providing spatially consistent flood definitions and spatially distributed flood risk classification considering the heterogeneity in vulnerability and resilience across the entire domain. Priorities in the development of such a GHS-F are suggested, emphasizing the user's requirements and needs according to practical experiences with various flood response agencies.

Long-term wetland landscape ecological risk assessments (LERAs) are able to effectively identify key elements for landscape sustainability; however, previous calculations of landscape ecological risk index (LERI) have only used an image each year. An individual LERI may introduce considerable uncertainties for long-term monitoring and spatio-temporal evolution when landscape types have significant seasonal differences. This article used Shengjin Lake wetland as a case study to propose a framework to calculate the annual LERI based on land use/land cover (LULC) data. The spatio-temporal evolution of annual LERA was then investigated over four periods from 1989 to 2019; there were three key findings from the analysis. First, the LULC types in Shengjin Lake wetland changed in time and space, particularly for water bodies, reed beach, and mudflats. Second, the individual LERI may only reflect ecological risks in a unique time or a season; however, they cannot represent ecological risks during the other seasons or over an entire year. Third, the annual LERI can fully reflect the landscape ecological risk at the annual scale, showing that the risk for Shengjin Lake initially rises, and then slows down over the last 30 years. In brief, the framework constructed in this study may be widely applicable, offering a reference for the monitoring, assessment, and management of other wetlands.

The fossil record in the Czech part of the basin, although discontinuous, spans the interval from the late Visean to the Asselian. Middle Baskhirian (late Namurian) to Asselian adpression floras collected from boreholes, coal mines and outcrops permit reconstruction of the stratigraphic ranges of individual species in considerable detail, and reveal changes in plant diversity and vegetation patterns throughout this similar to 25 Myr interval at high resolution, even to the scale of individual coal-bearing cycles. Species diversity recorded in the rock record throughout the studied interval mainly was controlled by climatically-driven potential for preservation of plant material, which was highest in poorly drained/waterlogged habitats (wetlands, lakes) concentrated in basinal lowlands and representing major windows of preservation. Low fossilization potential is typical for well-drained fluvial habitats, now represented by red beds deposited under drier (seasonal) climate. Diversity in major windows of preservation was highest during the late Langsettian and Duckmantian (>50 species), lower in the Late Pennsylvanian (25-40 species) and the lowest in the Asselian (similar to 20 species). The diversity in red bed intervals with poor preservation potential varies between 11 and 21 species. The two distinct habitat types, with high and low preservation potential, were dominated by different plant groups. Wetland habitats flourishing during the (per)humid to slightly seasonal intervals were colonized mainly by cryptogamic plants and some early gymnosperms, mainly pteridosperms and cordaitaleans. Habitats represented by red beds were dominated by cordaitaleans; from late Asturian time walchian conifers also occurred in these plant assemblages. However, conifers only became common in red beds in the Cantabrian. In the Saberian, conifers are rarely found in discrete beds associated with coal-bearing strata, however, their common occurrences start in lacustrine rocks of Asselian age. Temporal changes in vegetation patterns that show an increasing proportion of gymnosperms, in both wetland and dryland habitats are in agreement with the well known aridification trend in late Paleozoic tropical Pangea. Delays between the first appearance of walchian conifers in red beds (late Asturian) versus coal-bearing deposits (Saberian) supports the hypothesis that evolutionary innovations took place outside the windows of preservation, i.e. in well-drained, moisture-deficient areas.

Dynamic hypoxic zones in Lake Erie compress fish habitat, altering vulnerability to fishing gears	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Seasonal degradation of aquatic habitats from hypoxia occurs in numerous freshwater and coastal marine systems and can result in direct mortality or displacement of fish. Yet, fishery landings from these systems are frequently unresponsive to changes in the severity and extent of hypoxia, and population-scale effects have been difficult to measure except in extreme hypoxic conditions with hypoxia-sensitive species. We investigated fine-scale temporal and spatial variability in dissolved oxygen in Lake Erie as it related to fish distribution and catch efficiencies of both active (bottom trawls) and passive (trap nets) fishing gears. Temperature and dissolved oxygen loggers placed near the edge of the hypolimnion exhibited much higher than expected variability. Hypoxic episodes of variable durations were frequently punctuated by periods of normoxia, consistent with high-frequency internal waves. High-resolution interpolations of water quality and hydroacoustic surveys suggest that fish habitat is compressed during hypoxic episodes, resulting in higher fish densities near the edges of hypoxia. At fixed locations with passive commercial fishing gear, catches with the highest values occurred when bottom waters were hypoxic for intermediate proportions of time. Proximity to hypoxia explained significant variation in bottom trawl catches, with higher catch rates near the edge of hypoxia. These results emphasize how hypoxia may elevate catch rates in various types of fishing gears, leading to a lack of association between indices of hypoxia and fishery landings. Increased catch rates of fish at the edges of hypoxia have important implications for stock assessment models that assume catchability is spatially homogeneous.

J	Rimet, F; Bouchez, A; Montuelle, B				Rimet, Frederic; Bouchez, Agnes; Montuelle, Bernard			Benthic diatoms and phytoplankton to assess nutrients in a large lake: Complementarity of their use in Lake Geneva (France-Switzerland)	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Lakes can be monitored using different bioindicators, among which phytoplankton and benthic diatoms. We compared these two indicators in Lake Geneva for nutrient assessment. Bimonthly samplings were carried out during one year in the euphotic layer of a pelagic site. In the same time four littoral sites were sampled at 40-50 cm depth. Species compositions and abundances of both bioindicators were analyzed following European standards. Water physico-chemical composition was analyzed at the same time. Seasonal succession of benthic diatom guilds was observed. The dynamics of benthic diatom communities were better correlated to the pelagic chemistry than to the local littoral chemistry. We also observed that in the sampling sites frequently exposed to winds and waves, benthic diatoms showed lower correlations to physico-chemical dynamics, because of an increase of pioneer diatoms abundance adapted to turbulent environment, such sites must be avoided for lake monitoring. Finally, biotic indices calculated with benthic diatoms in wind protected sites showed higher correlations with pelagic nutrient concentration (PO43-) than indices calculated with phytoplankton. This unexpected situation can be explained by differences of temporal variability of chemical and biological compartments. Littoral chemistry changed faster than pelagic chemistry because of rains, diffuse flow from watershed and rivers flowing in the littoral zone whereas pelagic chemistry has a much smoother evolution because it is situated 10 km from the coast. But phytoplankton showed a high temporal variability because of wind influence, which explained the low correlation with the smooth evolution of pelagic chemistry. On the other hand, benthic diatoms from sites protected from the dominant wind, showed a lower temporal variability and were more in synchrony with the smooth evolution of pelagic chemistry. Even if we show that diatom seem to be promising indicator of nutrient level of the lake, we also underline the complementarity of using both indicators: benthic diatom and phytoplankton. Each of them brings different information about temporal variability of the lake and about the functioning of different habitats. Comparing these two bioindicators only on the basis of nutrient correlation ability would be an over-simplification whom managers must be warned. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous analyses of metaviromes or metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) failed to assess the extent of ARGs transferred by phages, particularly in the generation of antibiotic pathogens. Therefore, we have developed a bio-informatic pipeline that utilizes deep learning techniques to identify ARG-carrying phages and predict their hosts, with a special focus on pathogens. Using this method, we discovered that the predominant types of ARGs carried by temperate phages in a typical landscape lake, which is fully replenished by reclaimed water, were related to multidrug resistance and beta-lactam antibiotics. MAGs containing virulent factors (VFs) were predicted to serve as hosts for these ARG-carrying phages, which suggests that the phages may have the potential to transfer ARGs. In silico analysis showed a significant positive correlation between temperate phages and host pathogens (R = 0.503, p < 0.001), which was later confirmed by qPCR. Interestingly, these MAGs were found to be more abundant than those containing both ARGs and VFs, especially in December and March. Seasonal variations were observed in the abundance of phages harboring ARGs (from 5.62 % to 21.02 %) and chromosomes harboring ARGs (from 18.01 % to 30.94 %). In contrast, the abundance of plasmids harboring ARGs remained unchanged. In summary, this study leverages deep learning to analyze phage-transferred ARGs and demonstrates an alternative method to track the production of potential antibiotic-resistant pathogens by metagenomics that can be extended to microbiological risk assessment.					; SUN, Yanni/AHC-4163-2022; Wang, Donglin/LMP-9816-2024; Shang, Jiayu/AAS-1130-2021; Wang, Chenchen/HLH-4435-2023; liang, jinsong/AAP-5012-2021; Lin, Hui/IWM-1678-2023	SUN, Yanni/0000-0003-1373-8023; Shang, Jiayu/0000-0001-5974-4985; Bai, Yaohui/0000-0002-2086-4477; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				JAN 1	2024	248								120859	10.1016/j.watres.2023.120859	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2023.120859		NOV 2023						37976954					WOS:001124115500001

Long-term stream chemistry response to harvesting in a northern hardwood forest watershed experiencing environmental change	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Previous studies of harvest impacts on stream chemistry from deciduous forests with seasonal snow cover have shown variable responses and recovery times. We hypothesized that this variability in response and recovery was due to the interactive effects of forest harvesting with regional and global environmental changes. We investigated harvest impacts on stream solute (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, DOC, Si, NO3-, NH4+, total P) concentrations, pH and conductivity under clearcut, selection, and shelterwood harvesting using a before-after control impact experimental approach. The experiment was conducted at the Turkey Lakes Watershed, a shade-tolerant sugar maple forest within the Boreal Shield Ecozone, over a 36 year period (15 year pre-harvest and 21 year postharvest) that has experienced climate change and acidification recovery. Harvest impacts on stream chemistry were greatest in the clearcut, moderate in the selection cut, and least in the shelterwood cut. The largest impacts on stream solutes typically lasted one to six years following harvest, although some solutes were impacted during the entire 21 year post-harvest period. Different patterns in the response of stream solute concentrations included: initial deviations (increase or decrease) followed by a return to pre-harvest levels within two to four years (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, conductivity); initial increase followed by a decrease but still not recovered (K+); initial increase followed by a decrease to below pre-harvest levels (NO3-, Na+, Cl-); sustained elevated concentrations (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], Si); and a noisy response (TP, SO42-, pH). The different patterns were consistent with expected changes in nutrient demand, sources, and transport (including changes in hillslope-stream hydrologic connectivity due to harvesting). Comparing harvest impacts to long-term climate change and acidification recovery showed that harvesting had antagonistic (mitigative) effects to environmental changes for some solutes (e.g., cations), while for others (e.g., DOC) harvesting had agonistic (synergistic) effects to environmental changes. These results emphasize the need for long-term monitoring to accurately interpret the consequences of forest harvesting practices on the resilience of forests experiencing environmental change.

J	Joint, I; Doney, SC; Karl, DM				Joint, Ian; Doney, Scott C.; Karl, David M.			Will ocean acidification affect marine microbes?	ISME JOURNAL												The pH of the surface ocean is changing as a result of increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and there are concerns about potential impacts of lower pH and associated alterations in seawater carbonate chemistry on the biogeochemical processes in the ocean. However, it is important to place these changes within the context of pH in the present-day ocean, which is not constant; it varies systematically with season, depth and along productivity gradients. Yet this natural variability in pH has rarely been considered in assessments of the effect of ocean acidification on marine microbes. Surface pH can change as a consequence of microbial utilization and production of carbon dioxide, and to a lesser extent other microbially mediated processes such as nitrification. Useful comparisons can be made with microbes in other aquatic environments that readily accommodate very large and rapid pH change. For example, in many freshwater lakes, pH changes that are orders of magnitude greater than those projected for the twenty second century oceans can occur over periods of hours. Marine and freshwater assemblages have always experienced variable pH conditions. Therefore, an appropriate null hypothesis may be, until evidence is obtained to the contrary, that major biogeochemical processes in the oceans other than calcification will not be fundamentally different under future higher CO2/lower pH conditions.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Hydrological variability over seasonal and multi-annual timescales strongly shapes the ecological structure and functioning of floodplain ecosystems. The current IPCC climate scenario foresees an increase in the frequency of extreme events. This, in conjunction with other anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., river regulation or land-use changes) poses a serious threat to the natural functioning of these ecosystems. In this study we aimed to i) evaluate the long-term variability of the flooded area of the third largest floodplain lake in the Brazilian Pantanal using remote sensing techniques, and ii) analyze the possible factors influencing this variability. Changes in open-water and riparian floodplain-wetland vegetation areas were mapped by applying an ad hoc-developed remote-sensing method (including a newly developed normalized water index, NWI) to 221 Landsat-Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, acquired between 1984 and 2011. Added to the lake's natural swing between riparian floodplain-wetland vegetation expansion and retraction, our analyses revealed large interannual changes, grouped into three main periods within the studied time interval. Moreover, our results indicate that this floodplain-lake system is losing open-water area, paired with an increase in riparian flood-plain- wetland vegetation. The system's long-term dynamics are not all climate related, but are the result of a combination of drivers. The start of the Manso dam's operation upstream of the studied system, and the subsequent river regulation because of the dam operation, coupled with climatic oscillation appear to be responsible for the observed changes. However, other factors which were not considered in this study might also be important in this process and contributing to the reduction of the system's resilience to droughts (e.g., land-use changes). This study illustrates the serious conservation risks that the Pantanal faces in the near future, given the current climate-change scenario and the accumulation of dam building projects in this region.

Different Microcystis species has different choice to form blooms	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The buoyancy of Microcystis colonies is a principal factor determining blooms occurrence but the knowledge of seasonal variation in buoyancy is quite poor because of challenge in analysis method. In this study, a method based on the Stokes' Law after researching on the effects of shapes on settling velocity of Microcystis colonies, whose gas vesicles were collapsed, to accurately measure density was established. The method was used in Lake Taihu. From January to May, mean density of Microcystis colonies decreased from 995 kg m(-3) to 978 kg m(-3) and then increased to 992 kg m(-3) in December. The density of colonies in different Microcystis species was in the order M. wesenbergii > M. aeruginosa > M. ichthyoblabe. For all the Microcystis species, the density of colonies with gas vasicles increased significantly along with the increase of colony size. Our results suggested that the main driving factor of Microcystis blooms formation in Lake Taihu was low density for M. ichthyoblabe from May to July but was large colony size for M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa from August to October.

Reconstructing Greenland Ice Sheet meltwater discharge through the Watson River (1949-2017)	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Ice-sheet melting is the primary water source for the proglacial Watson River in southern west Greenland. Discharge from the large, approximately 12,000 km(2) ice-sheet catchment draining through the Watson River has been monitored since 2006. While this record is of respectable length for a Greenland monitoring effort, it is too short to resolve climate signals. Therefore, we use observed Tasersiaq lake discharge and Kangerlussuaq air temperature to reconstruct annual Watson River discharge back to 1949. The resulting sixty-five-year record shows that average ice-sheet runoff since 2003 has roughly increased by 46 percent relative to the 1949-2002 period. The time series suggests that the five top-ranking discharge years occurred since 2003. The three top-ranking discharge years (2010, 2012, and 2016) are characterized by melt seasons that were both long and intense. Interannual variability more than doubled since 2003, which we speculate to be because of hypsometric runoff amplification enhanced by albedo decrease and decreased firn permeability. The reconstructed time series proves to be a valuable tool for long-term evaluation of Greenland Ice Sheet surface mass balance models. A comparison with freshwater fluxes calculated by a downscaled version of the regional climate model RACMO2 reveals high correlation (r = 0.89), and also shows that the model possibly underestimates runoff by up to 26 percent in above-average melt years.

Identifying the individual factors that determine particle size, shape, composition, and the spatial relationships of carbonates with other constituents of the sediment are important for understanding sediment formation and nutrient cycling, and for providing input for lake management planning. We studied the formation of Mg-bearing calcite in Lake Balaton, a large, shallow, Mg-rich, calcareous lake in Hungary, by filtering particles from the water and analyzing them using X-ray powder diffraction and electron microscopy techniques. Mg-bearing calcite particles from lake Balaton have distinct and remarkably consistent morphologies, independent of seasonal and annual variations in water temperature and composition. They are typically elongated parallel to the [001] crystallographic direction, are about 4 to 8 pm long, and even though appear to be composed of many smaller units, electron diffraction patterns indicate they are perfect single crystals. The Mg content of calcite increases from west to east, reflecting a gradient in lakewater composition. The calcite crystals are invariably attached to nm-scale flakes of smectite, suggesting that the clay mineral serves as a nucleation site. The templated nucleation may direct the growth of calcite parallel to the clay flakes, resulting in its elongated shape and single crystalline character. While in deep, oligotrophic lakes calcite typically nucleates on picoplankton cells, we rarely observe this phenomenon in Lake Balaton. Because of the shallowness of the lake, sediments are stirred up by even moderate winds and the movement of organisms, making nm-scale smectite flakes readily available for templating calcite nucleation. Thus, while calcite precipitation is an indirect consequence of biological activity (photosynthesis), the physical properties of the particles are primarily determined by inorganic factors.

J	Maxwell, C; Scheller, RM; Long, JW; Manley, P				Maxwell, Charles; Scheller, Robert M.; Long, Jonathan W.; Manley, Patricia			Forest management under uncertainty: the influence of management versus climate change and wildfire in the Lake Tahoe Basin, USA.	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Climate change will accelerate forest mortality due to insects, disease, and wildfire. As a result, substantial resources will be necessary where and when forest managers seek to maintain multiple management objectives. Because of the increasing managerial requirements to offset climate change and related disturbances, the uncertainty about future forest conditions is magnified relative to climate change alone. We provide an analytical approach that quantifies the key drivers of forest change???climate, disturbance, and forest management???using scenarios paired with simulation modeling to forecast and quantify uncertainties in the Lake Tahoe Basin of California and Nevada (USA), a montane seasonally dry conifer forest. We partitioned uncertainty among climate change (including associated changes to wildfire and insect outbreaks), forest management (including thinning, prescribed fire, and fire suppression), and other sources using a fully factorial experimental design and analysis of variance. We focused on three metrics that are important for forest management objectives for the area: forest carbon storage, area burned at high severity, and total area burned by wildfire. Management explained a substantial amount of variance in the short term for area burned at high severity and longer term carbon storage, while climate explained the most variance in total area burned. Our results suggest that simulated extensive management activities will not meet all the desired management objectives. Both the extent and intensity of forest management will need to increase significantly to keep pace with predicted climate and wildfire conditions.

The photogrammetric analysis allowed for a compilation of detailed spatio-temporal information on flow velocities and thickness changes. In addition, high-resolution GNSS (global navigation satellite system) and ground surface temperature measurements were included in the analysis to provide insight into short-term changes. Over time, extremely contrasting developments and landform responses are documented. Viscous flow within the warming and already near-temperate rock glacier permafrost continued at a constant average but seasonally variable speed of typically decimetres per year, with average surface lowering limited to centimetres to a few decimetres per year. This constant flow causes the continued advance of the characteristic convex, lava-stream-like rock glacier with its oversteepened fronts. Thawing rates of ice-rich perennially frozen ground to strong climate forcing are very low (centimetres per year) and the dynamic response strongly delayed (timescale of decades to centuries). The adjacent cold debris-covered glacier tongue remained an essentially concave landform with diffuse margins, predominantly chaotic surface structure, intermediate thickness losses (decimetres per year), and clear signs of down-wasting and decreasing flow velocity. The former contact zone between the cold glacier margin and the upper part of the rock glacier with disappearing remains of buried glacier ice embedded on top of frozen debris exhibits complex phenomena of thermokarst in massive ice and backflow towards the topographic depression produced by the retreating glacier tongue. As is typical for glaciers in the Alps, the largely debris-free glacier part shows a rapid response (timescale of years) to strong climatic forcing with spectacular retreat (>10 m a(-1)) and mass loss (up to >1 m w.e. specific mass loss per year). The system of periglacial lakes shows a correspondingly dynamic evolution and had to be controlled by engineering work for hazard protection.					; Kääb, Andreas/AAG-8769-2020	Gartner-Roer, Isabelle/0000-0003-3621-488X; Delaloye, Reynald/0000-0002-2037-2018; Kaab, Andreas/0000-0002-6017-6564													1994-0416	1994-0424				MAY 31	2022	16	5					2083	2101		10.5194/tc-16-2083-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2083-2022													WOS:000803091300001

The seasonal and interannual variability of its salinity was studied, based on 3 years of monthly surveys (Dec 2017-Dec 2020). This dataset allows us to identify fine-scale salinity structures and to better understand the salinization/desalinization processes at seasonal scales. During the rainy season from May to November, under the influence of large freshwater inflows from the rivers on its northern shores, the lagoon desalinizes to a salinity of zero in October-November. During the dry season from December to April, under the effect of the ocean tide, Nokoue lagoon becomes progressively saltier, reaching typical salinities of similar to 25 in April. On average, the Nokoue lagoon is saltier in its southwestern part and fresher towards the river's mouths. Vertical salinity stratification is largest in December at the beginning of the main dry season. The lagoon displays a very marked interannual variation with mean surface (bottom, respectively) salinity of 25 (25) in April 2018 and 2020, respectively, against 16 (18) in April 2019. In the absence of river inflow data, a box model shows that the average salinity of the lagoon is very sensitive to small changes in river inflow (or discharge), with observed interannual differences in salinity induced by small variations of 10-15 m(3) s(-1) in inflow during the dry season. During the salinization phase, the model suggests that similar to 30% of the seawater entering the lagoon during flood-tides remains trapped and enhances the Nokoue lagoon salinity. This model also indicates that a complete desalinization of the lagoon occurs for river inflow greater than similar to 50-60 m(3) s(-1). The general mixing time scale of the lagoon is of 30-40 days.

A thorough understanding of various CH4 biogeochemical processes occurring in the ponds is essential for the prediction and management of CH4 emissions arising from aquaculture. However, the variations in pond CH4 biogeochemical processes among estuaries and aquaculture stages remain poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the net sediment release, oxidation, and dissolved concentrations of CH4 in aquaculture ponds in two subtropical estuaries among three shrimp growth stages in Southeast China. Overall, porewater CH4 concentrations and sediment CH4 release rates varied greatly among different stages in the order: middle stage > final stage > initial stage. Water column CH4 concentrations and overlying water CH4 oxidation rates showed an increasing trend over the study period. Sediment CH4 release rates and dissolved CH4 concentrations also varied considerably between the two estuaries. In the more saline Jiulong River Estuary, sediment CH4 release rate was lower while the shrimp survival rate and yield were higher as compared to the Min River Estuary with a lower water salinity. Our results suggest that both high water salinity and feed utilization efficiency can effectively mitigate CH4 emissions from the coastal shrimp ponds. Overall, the large magnitude of net CH4 emissions observed in our shrimp ponds highlights the urgency of formulating appropriate policies and building sustainable institutions that can strike a balance between land-based aquaculture development and greenhouse gas mitigation in the subtropical coastal regions.					; huang, jiafang/KGM-5757-2024; Lai, Derrick Y.F./B-1387-2009; Lai, Derrick/B-1387-2009; Yang, Hong/C-1739-2008	yang, ping/0000-0002-5212-6065; huang, jiafang/0000-0001-9800-7048; Lai, Derrick Y.F./0000-0002-1225-9904; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN	2019	124	6					1430	1445		10.1029/2018JG004794	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004794													WOS:000477719400004

Improving efficacy of landscape interventions in the (sub) humid Ethiopian highlands by improved understanding of runoff processes	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Despite millions of dollars invested in soil and water conservation (SWC) practices in the (sub) humid Ethiopian highlands and billions of hours of food-for-work farm labor, sediment concentration in rivers is increasing. This paper reports on the research to reverse the current trend. Based on the understanding of the hydrology of highlands, we provide evidence on sources of surface runoff and sediment and on mechanisms that govern the erosion processes and approaches and how they affect SWC practices. We suggest that priority in landscape interventions should be given to re vegetation of the degraded areas so as to reduce the sediment concentration contributions originating from these areas. Additionally, efforts should be directed to gully rehabilitation in the saturated bottom landscape that may consist of vegetating shallow gullies and stabilizing head cuts of deeper gullies. Finally, rehabilitation efforts should be directed to increase the rain water infiltration in the upland areas through the hardpan layer by connecting the land surface to the original deep flow paths that exist below about 60 cm. It will reduce the direct runoff during the rainy season and increase baseflow during the dry season.

Proxies, such as sedimentary charcoal and tree-ring fire scars, have temporal or spatial limitations and do not directly detect fire intensity. We show in this study that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) produced during wildfires record local fire events and fire intensity. We demonstrate that high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD) is superior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for detecting the low concentrations of sedimentary PAHs derived from natural fires. The HPLC-FLD is at least twice as sensitive as the GC-MS in selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode for parent PAHs and five times as sensitive for retene. The annual samples extracted from varved sediments from Swamp Lake in Yosemite National Park, California are compared with the observational fire history record and show that PAH fluxes record fires within 0.5 km of the lake. The low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs (e.g., fluoranthene, pyrene and benz[a] anthracene) are the best recorders of fire, whereas the high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs likely record fire intensity. PAHs appear to resolve some of the issues inherent to other fire proxies, such as secondary deposition of charcoal. This study advances our understanding of how PAHs can be used as markers for fire events and poses new questions regarding the distribution of these compounds in the environment.

FROM A GERMPLASM BANK IN VENEZUELA	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												We studied physiological traits of 12 Criollo cocoa cultivars growing in a germplasm bank in the southern region of Maracaibo Lake Basin, during the rainy (RS) and dry seasons (DS) of 2007. A further evaluation of photosynthetic responses to changes in environmental parameters was done on three cultivars: Los Canos 001 (LCA001), Sur Porcelana 010 (SP010) and Escalante 001 (ESC001) in 2009 and 2010. Leaf water potential (Psi(L)) of most cultivars decreased during the DS of 2007, with the exception of ESC001. Maximum photosynthetic rate (A(max)), stomatal conductance and water use efficiency varied among cultivars and seasons. The CO2-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(CO2sat)) was higher in LCA001 and ESC001 than in SP010, with no differences in carboxylation efficiency. Light curve responses of the three cultivars were similar. In all cultivars, no evidence of chronic photoinhibition was observed, since maximum quantum yield of photosystem II was high (0.77-0.81). We conclude that ESC001 has the best physiological performance (Psi(L) remained unchanged, highest A(max), A(CO2sat) and photochemical activity), and it seems to be a promising cultivar for cocoa agroforestry systems in the southern region of Maracaibo.					arellano, Ramon/M-6592-2018; JAIMEZ, Ramon Eduardo/M-6592-2018; Tezara, Wilmer/W-9903-2019; Ávila-Lovera, Eleinis/AAL-5061-2020	Avila-Lovera, Eleinis/0000-0003-3529-3600; JAIMEZ, Ramon Eduardo/0000-0001-8415-0775; Pereyra, Gabriela/0000-0002-3288-300X; Tezara, Wilmer/0000-0002-2666-0571; 													0014-4797	1469-4441				JAN	2016	52	1					137	153		10.1017/S0014479714000593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0014479714000593													WOS:000365518800008
J	Hamilton, R; Stevenson, J; Li, B; Bijaksana, S				Hamilton, R.; Stevenson, J.; Li, B.; Bijaksana, Satria			A 16,000-year record of climate, vegetation and fire from Wallacean lowland tropical forests	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The tropical forests of Sulawesi represent some of the most diverse, biogeographically significant ecosystems globally. However, long-term ecological data for the region are scarce, making it difficult to predict vegetation response to future climatic and anthropogenic drivers of change. This is problematic as gauging the acclimation thresholds of forests within tropical Asia has been identified as an IPCC policy imperative. This study uses palynological and geochemical analysis of sediments from a tectonic basin - Lake Lantoa - to reconstruct the hydroclimatic, fire, and tropical rainforest dynamics of south Sulawesi over 16,000 years, and reveal the response of lowland ultramafic forest to large-scale environmental change. Our results show that the Late Pleistocene was characterised by a drier, more seasonal climate and persistent fire in the landscape. These conditions supported a slightly open, Gymnostoma-rich, semi-seasonal forest, and constrained the available habitat range for hydrophilic tropical conifers. Increased effective moisture in the Holocene, interpreted from the onset of periodic lake stratification under deeper conditions, appears to have precluded forest burning, and facilitated the expansion of a lowland ultramafic rainforest and upland tropical coniferous forest. An increase in garden/secondary forest taxa and ground ferns from similar to 2?cal kyrs BP implies increased human management of the landscape. While these data highlight the compositional dynamism of lowland forest in Wallacea to seasonality, fire, and reduced precipitation, they demonstrate biome-scale resilience to glacial-scale environmental change. This contrasts with interpretations of forest sensitivity to climatic change drawn from analysis of leaf wax isotopes from adjacent lake basins, highlighting the value of adopting multi-proxy, taxonomically high-resolution techniques for reconstructing floristic histories.

J	Touch, T; Oeurng, C; Jiang, YN; Mokhtar, A				Touch, Tharo; Oeurng, Chantha; Jiang, Yanan; Mokhtar, Ali			Integrated Modeling of Water Supply and Demand Under Climate Change Impacts and Management Options in Tributary Basin of Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia	WATER												An integrated modeling approach analyzing water demand and supply balances under management options in a river basin is essential for the management and adaptive measures of water resources in the future. This study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the hydrological regime by predicting the change in both monthly and seasonal streamflow, and identified water supply and demand relations under supply management options and environmental flow maintenance. To reach a better understanding of the consequences of possible climate change scenarios and adaptive management options on water supply, an integrated modeling approach was conducted by using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and water evaluation and planning model (WEAP). Future scenarios were developed for the future period: 2060s (2051-2070), using an ensemble of three general circulation model (GCM) simulations: GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R-CC, and IPSL-CM5A-MR, driven by the climate projection for representative concentration pathways (RCPs): 6.0 (medium emission scenario). The results indicated that, firstly, the future streamflow will decrease, resulting in a decline of future water availability. Secondly, water supply under natural flow conditions would support 46,167 ha of irrigation schemes and the water shortages will be more noticeable when environmental flow maintenance was considered. The study concludes that reservoir construction would be necessary for agriculture mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, the water resources management options considering both supply and demand management are more effective and useful than supply management only, particularly in dealing with climate change impacts.

J	Bashinskiy, IV				Bashinskiy, I. V.			Beavers in lakes: a review of their ecosystem impact	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The aim of this review is to analyze the literature on the impact of beavers on lakes, summarize their effects, describe consequences for biotic and abiotic components, and highlight unresolved issues and perspectives. Beaver activity changes vegetation structure to the greatest extent, indirectly affecting other ecosystem components. Damming of flowing lakes increases the littoral area, which affects diversity and abundance of invertebrates, amphibians, birds, and mammals. Beavers' alteration of the water regime and heterogeneity and connectivity of habitats has significant effects on zoobenthos, fish, and amphibians. Changes in hydrochemical properties directly affect phytoplankton and benthos. Unlike river ecosystems, where habitats are altered from flowing to still water, in lake ecosystems, habitat type is not usually changed (from lotic to lentic) but their quality (e.g., heterogeneity, connectivity) is. Beaver activity in rivers leads to increased limnophilic biodiversity, but in lakes, it leads to conservation of pre-existing lentic ecosystems. Therefore, impacts of beavers could be of greater importance to limnophilic complexes in lakes than to streams, especially after long time of beaver absence. Digging activity has a more significant role in lakes (especially floodplain) than in rivers. Beaver alteration of heterogeneity and connectivity of habitats is well studied, but not enough is known about impacts on the water regime of seasonally flowing waters, hydrochemical changes (especially eutrophication), amphibian life cycles, phytoplankton and zooplankton communities, parasitocenoses, and coarse woody debris. Methodological difficulties are noted, which are associated with the correct choice of control lakes. Further studies on riverine lakes are crucial. In considerations of climatic changes and anthropogenic impact, beavers may be an additional aid to conserving small lake ecosystems.

The two intermediate host species of Schistosoma mansoni in the Mwanza region are Biomphalaria sudanica, found on the banks of the lakes, and B. choanomphala, found in the lake itself. There are few longitudinal surveys documenting changing abundance and differential transmission patterns of these Biomphalaria snails across seasons and years. We undertook 15 field surveys at 26 sites over four years to determine the parameters that influence Biomphalaria abundance, presence of S. mansoni-shedding snails and impact of schistosomiasis treatment interventions on transmission potential in the Mwanza region. Results: Statistical analysis revealed seasonal difference in the abundance of B. sudanica with the highest number of snails found in the dry season (Kruskal-Wallis X-2 = 37.231, df = 3, P < 0.0001). Water measurements were not associated with B. sudanica abundance; however, high levels of rainfall did have a negative effect on B. sudanica [ coefficient effect -0.1405, 95% CI (-0.2666, -0.0144)] and B. choanomphala abundance [coefficient effect -0.4388, 95% CI (-0.8546, -0.0231)] potentially due to inundation of sites "diluting" the snails and influencing collection outcome. Biomphalaria sudanica snails were found at all sites whereas B. choanomphala were far more focal and only found in certain sites. Shedding Biomphalaria did not show any variation between dry and rainy seasons; however, a decrease in shedding snails was observed in year 4 of the study. Conclusions: Biomphalaria sudanica is uniformly present in the Mwanza region whereas B. choanomphala is far more focal. Seasonality plays a role for B. sudanica abundance, likely due to its habitat preference on the banks of the lake, but not for B. choanomphala. The decrease in shedding Biomphalaria abundance in Year 4 could be linked to ongoing schistosomiasis treatment efforts in the neighbouring human populations. The highest number of shedding Biomphalaria was observed at sites with high levels of human movement. Prioritising snail control at such sites could greatly reduce transmission in these high-risk areas.					; Gouvras, Anouk/KXR-7162-2024; Emery, Aidan/IQS-1798-2023; Kinunghi, Safari/HKP-0919-2023	Emery, Aidan/0000-0001-9028-8586; Webster, Bonnie/0000-0003-0930-9314; Gouvras, Anouk/0000-0002-7857-4309; Rabone, Muriel/0000-0002-8351-2313; Pennance, Tom/0000-0003-4898-462X													1756-3305					JUN 28	2017	10								316	10.1186/s13071-017-2252-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2252-z								28659165					WOS:000405900100001
J	Guo, H; Hu, Q; Jiang, T				Guo, Hua; Hu, Qj; Jiang, Tong			Annual and seasonal streamflow responses to climate and land-cover changes in the Poyang Lake basin, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Repeated severe floods and damages in the Poyang Lake basin in China during the 1990s have raised the concern of how the floods have been affected by regional climate variations and by human induced changes in Landscape (e.g., draining wetlands around the take) and land-use in the basin. To address this concern and related issues it is important to know how the climate, land-use and land-cover changes in the region affect the annual and seasonal variations of basin hydrology and streamflow. This knowledge is essential for tong-term planning for land-use to protect water resources and to effectively manage floods in the Poyang Lake basin as well as the Lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It also has important ecological and socioeconomic implications for the region. This study used the SWAT model to examine the climate and land-use and land-cover effects on hydrology and streamflow in the Xinjiang River basin of the Poyang Lake. A major finding of this study is that the climate effect is dominant in annual streamflow. While land-cover change may have a moderate impact on annual streamflow it strongly influences seasonal streamflow and alters the annual hydrograph of the basin. Because of the vegetation and associated seasonal variations of its impact on evapotranspiration, increase of forest cover after returning agricultural lands to forest reduces wet season streamflow and raises it in dry season, thus reducing flood potentials in the wet season and drought severity in the dry season. On the other hand, losing forests increases flood potential and also enhances drought impacts. Results of this study improve our understanding of hydrological consequences of land-use and climate changes, and provide needed knowledge for effectively developing and managing land-use for sustainability and productivity in the Poyang Lake basin.

In many cases, the effects of microphytobenthos and macrofauna on nutrient cycling were studied separately, ignoring potential synergistic effects. We measured the combined effects of microphytobenthos and chironomid larvae on sediment-water fluxes of gas (O-2, TCO2 and N-2) and nutrients (NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, and SiO2) in shallow-water sediments of a hypertrophic freshwater lagoon. Fluxes were measured in the light and in the dark in reconstructed sediments with low (L=600 ind/m(2)), high (H=1,800ind/m(2)) and no (C) addition of chironomid larvae, after 3weeks of pre-incubation under light/dark regime to allow for microalgal growth. Besides flux measurements, pore water nutrient (NH4+, and SiO2) and dissolved metal concentrations (Fe2+ and Mn2+) were analysed and diffusive fluxes were calculated. Chironomid larvae increased sediment heterotrophy, by augmenting benthic O-2 demand and TCO2 and N-2 dark production. However, on a daily basis, treatments C and L were net O-2 producing and N-2 sinks while treatment H was net O-2 consuming and N-2 producing. All treatments were net C sink regardless of chironomid density. Microphytobenthos always affected benthic nutrient exchange, as significantly higher uptake or lower efflux was measured in the light compared with dark incubations. Theoretical inorganic N, P and Si demand by benthic microalgae largely exceeded both dark effluxes of NH4+, and SiO2 and their net uptake in the light, suggesting the relevance of N-fixation, water column NO3- and solid-phase associated P and Si as nutrient sources to benthic algae. Chironomid larvae had a minor effect on inorganic N and P fluxes while they significantly stimulated inorganic Si regeneration. Their bioturbation activity significantly altered pore water chemistry, with a major reduction in nutrient (highest for NH4+ and lowest for SiO2) and metal concentration. Underlying mechanisms are combinations of burrow ventilation and bioirrigation with stimulation of element-specific processes as coupled nitrification-denitrification, co-precipitation and inhibition of anaerobic paths such as Fe3+ or Mn4+ reduction or re-oxidation of their end products. The combined activity of benthic algae and chironomid larvae may significantly attenuate internal nutrient recycling in shallow eutrophic ecosystems, and contribute to the control of pelagic primary production.

The results showed that the annual mean concentration ranges of TN, TP, and Chl-a were 0.08-14.60 mg/L, 0.02-1.08 mg/L, and 0.10-465.90 mu g/L, respectively. Our data showed that Lake Chaohu was highly eutrophic and that water quality showed no substantial improvement during 2001 through 2011. The mean concentrations of TP, TN and Chl-a in the western lake were significantly higher than in the eastern lake, which indicates a spatial distribution of the three water parameters. The annual mean ratio of TN:TP by weight ranged from 10 to 20, indicating that phosphorus was the limiting nutrient in this lake. A similar seasonality variation for TP and Chl-a was observed. Riverine TP and NH4+ loading from eight major tributaries were in the range of 1.56 x 10(4)-5.47 x 10(4) and 0.19 x 10(4)-0.51 x 10(4) tons/yr over 2002-2011, respectively, and exceeded the water environmental capability of the two nutrients in the lake by a factor of 3-6. Thus reduction of nutrient loading in the sub-watershed and tributaries would be essential for the restoration of Lake Chaohu.

J	Guo, RF; Liu, YB				Guo, Ruifang; Liu, Yuanbo			Evaluation of Satellite Precipitation Products with Rain Gauge Data at Different Scales: Implications for Hydrological Applications	WATER												Rain gauge and satellite-retrieved data have been widely used in basin-scale hydrological applications. While rain gauges provide accurate measurements that are generally unevenly distributed in space, satellites offer spatially regular observations and common error prone retrieval. Comparative evaluation of gauge-based and satellite-based data is necessary in hydrological studies, as precipitation is the most important input in basin-scale water balance. This study uses quality-controlled rain gauge data and prevailing satellite products (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43, 3B42 and 3B42RT) to examine the consistency and discrepancies between them at different scales. Rain gauges and TRMM products were available in the Poyang Lake Basin, China, from 1998 to 2007 (3B42RT: 2000-2007). Our results show that the performance of TRMM products generally increases with increasing spatial scale. At both the monthly and annual scales, the accuracy is highest for TRMM 3B43, with 3B42 second and 3B42RT third. TRMM products generally overestimate precipitation because of a high frequency and degree of overestimation in light and moderate rain cases. At the daily scale, the accuracy is relatively low between TRMM 3B42 and 3B42RT. Meanwhile, the performances of TRMM 3B42 and 3B42RT are highly variable in different seasons. At both the basin and pixel scales, TRMM 3B43 and 3B42 exhibit significant discrepancies from July to September, performing worst in September. For TRMM 3B42RT, all statistical indices fluctuate and are low throughout the year, performing worst in July at the pixel scale and January at the basin scale. Furthermore, the spatial distributions of the statistical indices of TRMM 3B43 and 3B42 performed well, while TRMM 3B42RT displayed a poor performance.

A study of the long-term statistical properties of water level variations at Chenglingji station will help with the management of water resources in Dongting Lake. In this case, 54 years of water level data for Dongting Lake were analyzed with the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test, Sen's slope test, and the Pettitt test. The results showed the following: (1) Trends in annual maximum lake water level (WLM), annual mean lake water level (WL), and annual minimum lake water level (WLm) increased from 1961 to 2014; however, the three variables showed different trends from 1981 to 2014; (2) The annual change trends in Dongting Lake between 1961-2014 and 1981-2014 were found to be from approximately 0.90 cm/year to -2.27 cm/year, 1.65 cm/year to -0.79 cm/year, and 4.58 cm/year to 2.56 cm/year for WLM, WL, and WLm, respectively; (3) A greater degree of increase in water level during the dry season (November-April) was found from 2003 to 2014 than from 1981 to 2002, but a smaller degree of increase, even to the point of decreasing, was found during the wet season (May-October); (4) The measured discharge data and numerical modeling results showed the operation of Three Gorge Reservoir (TGR) pushed to influence partly the recent inter-annual variation of water level in Dongting Lake region, especially in the flood and dry seasons. The analysis indicated that the water level of Dongting Lake has changed in the long term with decreasing of range between WLM and WLm, and may decrease the probability of future drought and flood events. These results can provide useful information for the management of Dongting Lake.

The lake model with default parameters presented significant negative bias during the day and positive bias during the night on lake surface temperature. Calibrations of water absorption and extinction coefficients, surface roughness length, and eddy diffusion coefficient were carried out to correct this bias. The added absorption and extinction coefficients increased solar radiation in upper water layer, leading to a little higher surface temperature. Compared to constant surface roughness lengths, parameterization of roughness lengths as functions of friction velocity and fetch length significantly improved simulations of lake surface temperature and sensible heat flux. In Erhai Lake, eddy diffusion coefficient of the Henderson-Sellers parameterization is smaller than that in deep lakes. The eddy diffusion coefficient was reduced by a factor of 0.05 in dry season and 0.02 in wet season, respectively, to restrict mixing strength, generating a reasonable diurnal range with observed surface temperature. The adjusted parameter simulations matched better with in situ observations in diurnal cycle of temperature and surface heat fluxes but still overestimated wind speed. Topographic correction is effective to correct the bias, indicating that topographic correction over complex terrain was necessary.					; Wang, Lei/A-7836-2018; Xu, Lujun/AAJ-5828-2020; Liu, Huizhi/AAH-6107-2020; Du, Qun/AAJ-6868-2020	xu, lujun/0000-0001-6461-1116; Du, Qun/0000-0002-2273-1854; liu, Huizhi/0000-0003-2875-419X													2169-897X	2169-8996				DEC 16	2016	121	23					13989	14005		10.1002/2016JD025396	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JD025396													WOS:000394520300010

In this study, sediment samples were collected from various areas of Taihu Lake with different trophic conditions in all four seasons from 2015 to 2017. Using high-throughput sequencing and molecular ecological network analysis, we investigated the microbial interaction patterns and the role of nitrogen cycling in sediments from lakes with different trophic conditions. The results showed distinct structures of sediment microbial networks between lake areas with different trophic conditions. In the more eutrophic region, network indices indicate higher transfer efficiency of energy, material, and information, more significant competition, and weaker niche differentiation of the microbial community. The sedimentary environment in the moderately eutrophic area exhibited greater potential for denitrification, nitrification, and anammox compared to the mesotrophic area, but the inhibition between N functional microbes and limitations in N removal processes were also more likely to occur. The topological structure of the networks showed that the carbon (C), sulfur (S), and iron (Fe) cycles had a strong influence on the nitrogen cycle in both lake areas. In the moderately eutrophic lake area, C-and S-cycling functional bacteria facilitated a closed cycle of the coupled N fixation-nitrification-DNRA (dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium) process and reduced N removal. In the mesotrophic lake area, C and S-cycling functional bacteria promoted both N fixation and mineralization, and Fe-cycling functional bacteria coupled with denitrifiers enhanced the nitrogen removal process of products from nitrogen fixation and mineralization. This study improved the understanding of the nitrogen cycling mechanism in lake sediments under different trophic conditions.

Turbidity removal of 98.4%; biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) removal of 83.3%; chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 95.8%; NH3-N removal of 99.9%; total nitrogen (TN) removal of 94.7%; NO3--N and NO2--N increased; total P (TP) removal of 99.7%, Vibrio sp. of 100%, Escherichia coli 100%; total bacterial count of 92.3%; and anaerobic bacteria reduction of 97.5% were achieved by using CWA. Seasonal variation and variation in HLRs had significant effect on performance. The modified planted CWA system enhances the removal of pollutants and could present a novel route for reducing the cost associated with integrating artificial aeration into wetlands.					; Gaballah, Mohamed S./A-9579-2019; barakat, khouloud/AAC-9770-2020; Aboagye, Dominic/AAA-1524-2021; Gaballah, Mohamed/IUQ-6313-2023	Aboagye, Dominic/0000-0003-1504-9010; Gaballah, Mohamed S./0000-0002-6064-5631; barakat, khouloud/0000-0002-4133-2058													0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2020	27	22			SI		28449	28462		10.1007/s11356-020-08669-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08669-5		MAY 2020						32418087					WOS:000533200000003

REMOTE SENSING												Tonle Sap Lake is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. Water development infrastructures are increasingly being constructed in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, which is a major concern considering its potential impact on Tonle Sap Lake. This study aimed to investigate variations in the area of the lake and discuss their possible linkage to runoff alterations in the Lancang River (Upper Mekong) by comparing runoff at the Yunjinghong hydrological station before and after significant changes in runoff trends that occurred in 2008. First, four commonly used water body extraction methods (MNDWI, NDWI, NDVI, and EVI) were compared and MNDWI was found to provide a better and more stable performance. Based on MOD09A1 data, MNDWI was used to extract the water area of the lake from 2000 to 2014, and characteristics of variations in the area before and after 2008 were analyzed. The water area of Tonle Sap Lake displayed an overall decreasing trend, and specifically decreased by 8.3% during the flood season and by 1.5% on average during the dry season after 2008. Seasonal variations in the water area of Tonle Sap Lake were dominantly influenced by runoff from the Mekong River. Compared with the period 2000-2007, runoff at Yunjinghong station were increased during the dry season (20.74%) and decreased during the flood season (34.25%) between 2008 and 2014. Changes in upstream runoff contributed to runoff at the Stung Treng station in the lower Mekong River by 6.17% (dry season) and -2.41% (flood season). Evidently, the operation of dams in the Lancang River does not primarily account for the area decrease of Tonle Sap Lake during the flood season. In contrast, runoff increase during the dry season mitigates the area decrease of Tonle Sap Lake to a certain extent.

The mean CO2 fluxes of 2013 and 2014 were - 0.316 +/- 0.0674 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and -0.173 +/- 0.242 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the bi-species polyculture system of swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus) with kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) (PM) and 0.249 +/- 0.251 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 0.426 +/- 0.151 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the tri-species polyculture system of swimming crab with shrimp and short-necked clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) (PMR) (Negative flux values refer to CO2 uptake and positive values refer to CO2 emission). During the farming season, the CO2 budgets in PM and PMR were - 113.1 g CO2 m(-2) and 154.0 g CO2 m(-2), respectively. Water pH seemed like a stable indicator for CO2 flux and Chlorophyll a concentration was a key factor regulating the CO2 flux. Subsequent decreasing in water pH and Chl a concentration was supposed to be the main contributor changing the carbon source/sink function from a CO2 sink of PM to a CO2 source of PMR. Under the condition of current study, pH of 8.26 could be considered to be the critical value between influxes and effluxes in seawater crab-shrimp and crab-shrimpclam polyculture systems.

However, the high spatial and temporal variability of ebullition limits our ability to accurately measure or predict CH4 fluxes from lakes. To explore factors controlling the spatial distribution of ebullition, we investigated free gas accumulation in bottom sediment of Lake Kinneret, Israel. Sediment cores were collected from four sites at different water depth and distance from the shore. Sediment porewater was analyzed for dissolved CH4 concentration, pH, DOC, acetate, and sulfate. Anaerobic CH4 production rates in sediment were determined by incubating sediment samples. For characterizing in situ sediment volumetric gas content, hydroacoustic measurements at various frequencies were conducted at the coring sites and along multiple transects across the lake. A minimum in CH4 production was observed in the upper 30 cm of sediment, which coincided with enriched porewater sulfate. The depth-integrated sediment CH4 production provides a robust estimate for long-term ebullition of CH4 from sediment, while short-term variability was associated with seasonal lake level change. Acoustic measurements revealed the absence of free gas in sediments of the littoral zone and low ebullition rates in the shallow water zones. For the first time, this study reports the role of CH4 production in determining the spatial variability of free gas content in freshwater sediments. The results further demonstrate the importance of sediment gas content in explaining spatial variability of gas ebullition in lakes.					; Uzhansky, Ernst/GLT-4489-2022; Katsnelson, Boris/AAF-9273-2020; Katsnelson, Boris/B-8639-2014; Katsman, Regina/NLN-5725-2025; Hilgert, Stephan/I-1289-2012; Lorke, Andreas/B-9195-2008; Ostrovsky, Ilia/M-4831-2017	Liu, Liu/0000-0002-8056-2550; Hilgert, Stephan/0000-0002-0876-123X; Katsnelson, Boris/0000-0001-8934-5504; Katsman, Regina/0000-0003-4526-474X; Sotiri, Klajdi/0000-0003-3370-7355; Wilkinson, Jeremy/0000-0001-6019-0297; Ostrovsky, Ilia/0000-0002-0247-7844													0276-0460	1432-1157				AUG	2020	40	4			SI		453	466		10.1007/s00367-019-00612-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00367-019-00612-z		NOV 2019											WOS:000495307100001

Frequent observations enable more effectively reflecting the water budgets and related driving force of Poyang Lake. This study first utilized the Sentinel-1 SAR data and cloud-free Sentinel-2 images in conjugation with lake bathymetry to reconstruct the time series of the water inundation area and storage of Poyang Lake from 2017 to 2020. Further, a simple and straightforward method, named the Fitting Curves of each Block and Total area (FCoBT), is developed to reconstruct the complete inundation area of Poyang Lake from partially cloud-free Sentinel-2 images to densify the original time series. This method takes full advantage of the significant characteristics on the strong correlations of the block areas (one small part of lake area) varying with the complete lake areas, with a mean R2 and rho value of 0.94 and 0.98, respectively. The complete inundation area of Poyang Lake can be reconstructed from 113 scenes of partially cloudless Sentinel-2 images acquired from 2017 to 2020 by using the FCoBT. After integrating the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, a maximum of 13 measurements are available within one month, with the temporal intervals of 2-3 days. Results show that our reconstructed time series of water inundation area can finely depict significant seasonal fluctuation (wet season: from April to September, dry season: from October to the next March) and inter-annual variations (larger areas: 2017 and 2020, smaller areas: 2018 and 2019) of Poyang Lake during 2017-2020. Similar to the area change, the water storage of Poyang Lake also shows evident seasonal variation and inter-annual fluctuation, reaching the peaks in July and the lowest stages during November to February. This study cannot only provide an efficient and feasible remote sensing means of constructing long-term observations for highly variable lakes at high spatial-temporal resolutions, but also greatly refine our understanding on the intra-annual and inter-annual variations of Poyang Lake.					; Liu, Kai/HWQ-3608-2023; song, li/ABE-6858-2021; Xu, Jiahui/OKS-7243-2025	Liu, Kai/0000-0002-5500-0644; Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; 													1569-8432	1872-826X				DEC 25	2021	105								102601	10.1016/j.jag.2021.102601	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.102601													WOS:000711066700002
J	Lénat, JF; Bachèlery, P; Desmulier, F				Lénat, JF; Bachèlery, P; Desmulier, F			Formation of the lava flow field of the Enclos:: an exceptional effusive eruption at Piton de la Fournaise volcano (Reunion) during the 18th century	BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE GEOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE												A large lava flow field, essentially constituted of 'pahoehoe' flows, forms a relatively monotonous area on the north-west flank of the terminal cone of Piton de la Fournaise and on a large part of the: Enclos floor. We named this unit "champ de lave de l'Enclos Fouque" (CLEF). To the east, more recent lava flows almost completely cover the CLEF. Mapping of the CLEF has been attempted using satellite imagery. Radar (SIR-C) and SPOT images have been used. Both types of images lead to comparable results for the surface of the CLEF, estimated to 11 km(2). On satellite images, only a general map of the facies of the CLEF can be done. Air photos and ground observations allow to characterize more precisely the facies defined from satellite images. On the slopes of the Central Cone, the surface of the CLEF is mostly composed of tumuli that may produce small lava flows at their downhill base. On the floor of the Enclos, the CLEF is constantly formed by a multitude of intricate small flows. Except for small 'aa' patches, surfaces are 'pahoehoe'. Tumuli, pressure ridges and collapsed plates are common features of the CLEF. Near the NW border of Enclos, the surface becomes less regular, with a higher proportion of 'aa' patches and tilted slabs. This is probably due to the increase of slope in this area. In the vicinity of Bory crater contemporaneous welded scoria cover a zone extending 150-200 m from the crater. Several elements, found in various historical documents collected by Lacroix [1936 and 1938], bring evidence that the CLEF may result from a succession of events between the years 1750's to the 1790's. During this period, the volcano has been virtually continuously in eruption. Bory crater was the only active crater until 1766, when a new summit crater was Formed by collapse, 400 m east of Bory crater. In the following years, this 1766 crater was filled by lava emissions which erected a gigantic tumulus, 50 m high, called Mamelon central. Several large lava flows, some of them reaching the sea, are unambiguously described as emitted from the summit craters. One of the main event appears to be the phase that occurred in 1753 (or 1759 according to different authors). This phase was associated to felt earthquakes and widespread ash-falls in the island. Lava flows covered most the western part of Enclos and reached the sea to the east. Whereas the activity of 1753 (1759?) appears as paroxysmal, extensive lava flows are described until 1794. In 1791, a new crater formed south of the 1766 crater. In 1801, Bory de St-Vincent [1804] observed an active lava lake inside this 1791 crater. In summary, it appears that quasi-continuous activity took place during the second half of the 18(th) century at Piton de la Fournaise, with lava flows covering almost all the Enclos and Grand Brule areas. It is obvious that the presently outcropping surface of the CLEF is only a fraction of its former extension. From the above-mentioned historic descriptions, it is reasonable to assume the CLEF may have recovered the entire surface of the Enclos Fouque and the Grand Brule depression. The surface extension of the CLEF would thus lie between 11 km(2), its presently observed area, to ca. 90 km(2). The compounded thickness of the CLEF has not been directly observed. In the rim of Dolomieu crater, a series of lava flows thought to represent the CLEF is about 25 m thick, but this thickness is that of the shield built around the vents and not that of the lava field. Using statistical laws for strombolian cones morphometry from Wood [1980], the thickness of the CLEF may be approached considering the crater diameter of 3 cones located in the north-western part of Enclos and partially flooded by the CLEF. We obtain estimates of 5 to 15 m. If Enclos has been entirely covered by the CLEF and for a mean thickness of 5 to 10 m, then the volume of the CLEF eruption is 450 to 900 x 10(6) m(3). Mineralogical and chemical compositions of the CLEF lavas are similar to those of the transitional olivine basalts of the historic period [steady-state basalts, Albarede ct al, 1997]. The chemical compositions vary somewhat due to variable modal olivine phenocrysts abundances and are characteristic of a rapid transfer of magma from deep reservoirs with virtually no low-pressure evolution. Major changes of the summit craters were associated to this eruption as a result of the unusually prolonged magmatic activity at Piton de la Fournaise during decades. The occurrence of similar phases at Piton de la Fournaise in the future can be appraised with reference to Kilauea. Holcomb [1987] reports 7 long-lived eruptions at Kilauea in the last 3 centuries. Thus, although not frequent, this type of event is not uncommon for Kilauea. By analogy, it must be considered an probable that Piton rip In Fournaise will experience new long-lived eruptions in the future.					; BACHELERY, Patrick/GQA-9756-2022	Lenat, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4828-9013; BACHELERY, Patrick/0000-0002-0108-5486													0037-9409	1777-5817					2001	172	2					177	188		10.2113/172.2.177	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/172.2.177													WOS:000168570600003

Microbial humic-like fluorophores dominated the rainwater CDOM pool, followed by tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like substances. Increased rainfall intensity had notable dilution effects on all six fluorescent components (C1-C6) identified using parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, the effect being especially pronounced for the microbial humic-like Cl, tryptophan-like C3, and tyrosine-like C5. The results also indicated that increasing pH from 7 to 9 led to decreased fluorescence intensity (Fmax) of all the six components, while a pH increase from 5 to 7, resulted in increasing F-max of terrestrial humic-like C2, tyrosine-like C5, and tryptophan-like C6 and decreasing microbial humic-like C1, tryptophan-like C3, and fulvic-like C4. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) demonstrated that synchronous fluorescence responded first to pH modifications at fulvic-like wavelength (lambda(Ex)/lambda(Em) = similar to 316/416 nm), followed by tyrosine-like wavelength (lambda(Ex)/lambda(Em) = 204/304 nm), tryptophan-like wavelength (lambda(Ex)/lambda(Em) = 226/326 nm), microbial humic-like wavelength (295/395 nm), and finally terrestrial humic-like wavelength (-360/460 nm). Our results suggest that a decrease in areas affected by acid rain in South China occurring at present may possibly result in apparent compositional changes of CDOM fluorescence. The decreased rainfall in South-West China and increased rainfall in North-West China during the past five decades may possibly accordingly result in increased and decreased F-max, of all the six components identified in South-West and North-West China, respectively.

Conifer wood assemblage dominated by Podocarpaceae, early Eocene of Laguna del Hunco, central Argentinean Patagonia	PHYTOKEYS												During the early Eocene, Patagonia had highly diverse floras that are primarily known from compression and pollen fossils. Fossil wood studies from this epoch are scarce in the region and largely absent from the Laguna del Hunco flora, which has a highly diverse and excellently preserved compression assemblage. A collection of 26 conifer woods from the Laguna del Hunco fossil-lake beds (early Eocene, ca. 52 Ma) from central-western Patagonia was studied, of which 12 could be identified to genus. The dominant species is Phyllocladoxylon antarcticum, which has affinity with early-diverging Podocarpaceae such as Phyllocladus and Prumnnopitys. A single specimen of Protophyllocladoxylon francisiae probably represents an extinct group of Podocarpaceae. In addition, two taxonomic units of cf. Cupressinoxylon with putative affinity to Podocarpaceae were found. Diverse Podocarpaceae taxa consistent with the affinities of these woods were previously reported from vegetative and reproductive macrofossils as well as pollen grains from the same source unit. Some of the woods have galleries filled with frass. Distinct growth ring boundaries indicate seasonality, inferred to represent seasonal light availability. Growth ring widths suggest that the woods came from mature trees, whereas the widths and types of some rings denote near-uniform temperature and water availability conditions.

This study investigated the temporal and spatial variations in water quality of Tangxihe River, a eutrophic urban river receiving tail water from a nearby WWTP in Hefei City, using the single-factor index (SFI) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results of SFI indicated that the most important parameters responsible for low water quality were total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia (NH4+-N). PCA showed that tail water from the WWTP greatly reduced water quality, as demonstrated by the significantly increased SFIs and integrated principal component values (F values) of the sampling points around the drain outlet of the WWTP (T-3, T-4 and T-5). The sampling points located at the upstream of the river (T-1) and up the water-gate of Chaohu Lake (T-6) had negative F values, indicating relatively higher water quality. In addition, the season had a significant effect on the water quality of the river. Moreover, we discuss measures to improve the water quality of urban rivers in order to maintain their ecological functions.																			1606-9749	1607-0798				MAR	2019	19	2					603	609		10.2166/ws.2018.107	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2018.107													WOS:000460773900028

It is a large territory with climates ranging from humid tropical to cold temperate, We performed a meta-analysis of the published data and information in technical reports published from 1945 to 2015, and included additional data from personal non-published studies. A total of 122 water bodies affected by planktonic cyanobacterial blooms were recorded and geo-referenced. The analysis showed that blooms, defined as events exceeding 5000 cells/mL, occurred in different types of water bodies, including shallow lakes, rivers, streams, reservoirs, estuaries and storage facilities, Maximum bloom abundance and species and ecological strategies (dispersive, scum-forming, nitrogen fixer) responsible for each event were related to the geographic and climatologic characteristics and type and origin of water bodies. The Puna and the Andean Patagonia eco-regions were mostly free of blooms. The most impaired aquatic systems were shallow lakes and reservoirs (46.7 and 24.6%, respectively). Deep lakes had no reports of blooms and rivers were mainly affected at the regulated reaches, with intensities generally decreasing downstream the dams. Besides, 74.3% of the blooms reported in Argentina exceeded WHO Alert Level 2 for drinking and bathing waters (100,000 cells/mL). Thirty-nine species, identified by Komarek's polyphasic approach to taxonomy, were responsible for the blooms. Microcystis aeruginosa, Dolichospermum spiroides, Dolichospermum circinale, Raphidiopsis mediternmea and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were frequently found participating in either mixed or single species blooms. The species distribution was associated with the eco-region and aquatic system typologies and affected by seasonality and climatological and geographic variables. The eco-strategies of cyanobacterial species showed stronger associations with the qualitative and quantitative indicators used in the meta-analysis, and appeared as useful tools for management measures.

However, the changes in river water chemistry in response to the dam construction remain poorly constrained. This study presents the seasonal variability of all major cations and some anions in the lower Changjiang during a full hydrological year from 2010 to 2011. The concentrations of all ions, except for HCO3-, are higher after the TGD operation than before (p<0.01), implying that the TGD has modified the river water chemistry in the mid-lower mainstream. Dissolved silicate (DSi) fluxes at Datong station thus increase slightly since the beginning of TGD impoundment. The change of mixing pattern of different water sources and alteration of hydrological and biogeochemical processes could cause the change of solute concentrations in the mid-lower Changjiang after the TGD operation. The mass balance model suggests that two factors primarily account for this increase of DSi observed at Datong: 1) an increasing loading of DSi downstream TGD due to erosion by "clean water", and 2) an enhanced "Source" role of Lake Poyang in the mid-lower reaches. Our study would provide insights into the damming effect on river water chemistry and the complexity of a large river system facing rapid climate change and strong human activities.

However, the extent to which phytoplankton community succession influences changes in bacterial community composition (BCC) is largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the correlations between bacteria and phytoplankton communities and determined the relative contribution of phytoplankton community succession to temporal variation of BCC in a subtropical drinking water reservoir (Tingxi Reservoir, southeast China). Bacterial communities were investigated by quantitative PCR and 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes, while phytoplankton communities were analyzed by light microscopy. A remarkable seasonal succession from Cyanophyta to Bacillariophyta was observed during the study period, and this succession can accurately predict the distribution and abundance of the bacterial OTUs based on the discriminant function analysis. Association networks revealed that 38 of the 46 abundant bacterial OTUs exhibited significant correlations with phytoplankton. More interestingly, the positive correlations dominated the associated network, which may suggest that facilitative correlations between phytoplankton and bacteria are more important than inhibitory correlations in the Tingxi Reservoir. In addition, some bacterial OTUs were closely correlated with the dynamics of Microcystis, and they were affiliated with the divisions Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Structural equation model showed that succession of phytoplankton community explained the largest part of temporal variation in BCC. Therefore, our data suggest that the distinct succession of phytoplankton community may mediate the temporal dynamics of bacterial community in the Tingxi Reservoir.

J	Li, J; Ma, RH; Xue, K; Loiselle, S				Li, Jing; Ma, Ronghua; Xue, Kun; Loiselle, Steven			Drivers to spatial and temporal dynamics of column integrated phytoplankton biomass in the shallow lake of Chaohu, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Eutrophication of inland freshwater bodies is a major threat to the ecosystem services. Many studies have focused on using surface or near surface phytoplankton biomass to determine trophic status or bloom conditions. However, surface phytoplankton biomass can change quickly due to the vertical migration of phytoplankton. A more appropriate indicator is column integrated biomass which considers the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton. In this study, we estimated the spatial and temporal dynamics of column integrated biomass in a shallow eutrophic lake, Lake Chaohu in China, using a biomass estimation algorithm and fourteen years of satellite data. The built algorithm was validated by in situ datasets with a significant correlation with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.89, mean absolute relative difference, MARD = 25.97%, the root-mean-square error, RMSE = 20.17 mg.m(-2). We decomposed the temporal dynamics of the satellite-based time series into inter-annual trends, seasonal and irregular behaviors of biomass in different lake sections. We compared these individual dynamics to nutrients, meteorological and climate variables, in particular with respect to ongoing effort to manage nutrients in this complex lake and catchment. Nutrient concentrations were shown to be determinant in the inter-annual trends. Irregular variation of biomass was found to be sensitive to global climate change events (ENSO) which influence regional conditions of precipitation and temperature. By taking the vertical profile of phytoplankton into consideration, the derived temporal and spatial distribution of phytoplankton biomass, rather than surface biomass, provided new sights into lake conditions and were seen to be a good support for lake management efforts.					; ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022; Loiselle, Steven/ABA-3324-2020	Ma, Ronghua/0000-0002-4485-4636; Loiselle, Steven/0000-0001-7414-0389; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2020	109								105812	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105812	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105812													WOS:000500940400021

We describe the evolution of saline deposits in the Qaidam Basin (including DLT), based on investigative findings accumulated over the course of 60 years of geological surveys. In addition, we report regional meteorological patterns recorded for the past 32 years along with meteorological station recorded data at DLT since 2012. Overall, the DLT area on the Tibetan Plateau has low atmospheric pressure, high ultraviolet radiation, low annual mean temperatures (T) but large seasonal and diurnal T cycles, and extremely low relative humidity, all of which bear some similarities with the equatorial region on Mars. In addition, salt types similar to those found on Mars, such as magnesium-sulfates, chlorides, and perchlorates, are found at the surface and subsurface in the DLT area (and the other two playas in the Qaidam Basin), thus supporting DLT as a Mars analogue in terms of mineralogy and geochemistry.

Health Impacts and Recovery From Prolonged Freshwater Exposure in a Common Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE												Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) exposed to freshwater or low salinity (<10 practical salinity units; PSU) for prolonged periods of time have been documented to develop skin lesions, corneal edema and electrolyte abnormalities, and in some instances they have died. Here we review a case of an out-of-habitat subadult, female common bottlenose dolphin that remained in a freshwater lake in Seminole, Alabama for at least 32 days. Due to concerns for the dolphin's health a rescue was initiated. At the time of rescue bloodwork results indicated minor electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypoosmolality). Renal function was not affected (normal creatinine and urea nitrogen) and all other bloodwork parameters (hemogram; serum biochemistry analytes) were within normal limits. The dolphin was deemed healthy enough for immediate relocation and release. A satellite-linked tag was attached to the dorsal fin to track the dolphin following its relocation to a nearby brackish water bay (Perdido Bay, AL), a known habitat for bottlenose dolphins. Twelve weeks following release, the dolphin was found dead as a result of a fisheries interaction (peracute underwater entrapment). A full necropsy was conducted and there was complete resolution of the skin pallor and skin lesions and no evidence of chronic renal or central nervous system lesions. Post-mortem analysis of vitreous humor (used as a proxy for serum analytes and to determine post-mortem interval) was challenging to interpret and has not been validated in dolphins. This supports the need for future research in cetaceans to establish a species-specific approach. Elevated barium (Ba) concentrations in tooth dentin corresponded to increased seasonal freshwater discharge patterns, confirming repeated annual exposure to low salinity conditions prior to death and indicating freshwater exposure may pose an ongoing threat to dolphins in the region. This case provides a unique opportunity to follow the progression of prolonged freshwater exposure and recovery in a bottlenose dolphin and highlights that dolphins in nearshore habitats face a combination of persistent natural and human associated threats.					rotstein, david/K-6691-2019	Carmichael, Ruth/0000-0002-6033-3777; Hodanbosi, Matthew/0000-0001-5216-4005; rotstein, david/0000-0001-7438-2281														2297-1769				MAY 7	2020	7								235	10.3389/fvets.2020.00235	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00235								32457921					WOS:000536647600001

In 2017, we collected precipitation samples from ten weather stations located along an altitudinal transect ranging from 1304 to 4375 m a.s.l. The delta O-18(prec) and delta H-2(prec) values varied from -8.7 to +3.7 parts per thousand and -38 to +29 parts per thousand, respectively. The local meteoric water line is characterised by a lower slope, a higher intercept and more positive d-excess values (delta H-2 = 5.3 +/- 0.2 * delta O-18 + 14.9 +/- 0.9) compared to the global meteoric water line. Both altitude and amount of precipitation clearly correlate with our isotope data. However, the delta O-18(prec) and delta H-2(prec) values show at the same time a seasonal pattern reflecting rainy versus dry season. More enriched isotope values prevailed shortly after the end of the dry season; more depleted isotope values coincided with high precipitation amounts recorded in May, August and September. Moreover, HYSPLIT trajectories reveal that during the dry season water vapour originates primarily from the Arabian Sea, whereas during the wet season it originates primarily from the Southern Indian Ocean. These findings challenge the traditional amount effect interpretation of paleoclimate isotope records from East Africa and rather point to a previously underestimated source effect.

Using dynamic time warping self-organizing maps to characterize diurnal patterns in environmental exposures	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Advances in measurement technology are producing increasingly time-resolved environmental exposure data. We aim to gain new insights into exposures and their potential health impacts by moving beyond simple summary statistics (e.g., means, maxima) to characterize more detailed features of high-frequency time series data. This study proposes a novel variant of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm called Dynamic Time Warping Self-Organizing Map (DTW-SOM) for unsupervised pattern discovery in time series. This algorithm uses DTW, a similarity measure that optimally aligns interior patterns of sequential data, both as the similarity measure and training guide of the neural network. We applied DTW-SOM to a panel study monitoring indoor and outdoor residential temperature and particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) for 10 patients with asthma from 7 households near Salt Lake City, UT; the patients were followed for up to 373 days each. Compared to previous SOM algorithms using timestamp alignment on time series data, the DTW-SOM algorithm produced fewer quantization errors and more detailed diurnal patterns. DTW-SOM identified the expected typical diurnal patterns in outdoor temperature which varied by season, as well diurnal patterns in PM2.5 which may be related to daily asthma outcomes. In summary, DTW-SOM is an innovative feature engineering method that can be applied to highly time-resolved environmental exposures assessed by sensors to identify typical diurnal (or hourly or monthly) patterns and provide new insights into the health effects of environmental exposures.

Seasonal variations in source-sink balance of CO2 in subtropical earthen aquaculture ponds: Implications for carbon emission management	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Aquaculture ponds serve as focal points for carbon cycling and act as anthropogenic contributors to the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2). To understand the seasonal CO2 dynamics within the ponds, we measured the CO2 concentrations in sediment porewater and the water column in aquaculture ponds in the Shanyutan Wetland in China. Subsequently, the sediment-to-water and water-to-air CO2 fluxes were calculated based on the gas transfer coefficient model. Our results showed that that CO2 flux ranged 0.01-4.58 mmol m- 2h-1 across the sediment-towater interface and -0.08 to 0.45 mmol m- 2h-1 across the water-to-air interface throughout the farming period. Photosynthetic activity was the key driver of the temporal variations in water column CO2 concentration and water-to-air CO2 flux, while the change in porewater CO2 concentration and sediment-to-water CO2 flux were governed by sediment temperature which drive the microbial decomposition of organic matter. Based on a simple mass balance approach, the apparent CO2 consumption (ACC) in the water column across all seasons ranged from 0.24 to 2.32 mmol m- 2h-1, indicating that the pond water body had a high capacity to "consume" the excess CO2. Our results highlight that the contrasting roles between the sediment compartment and water column compartment in CO2 dynamics, and the possibility to manipulate ACC to reduce the aquaculture carbon footprint.

Seasonal fluctuation patterns for neurotoxins were determined in samples collected from eutrophic lakes during July-September. Strains of Aphanizomenon gracile, A. flos-aquae, Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi, Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides and Anabaenopsis cf. elenkinii were also isolated from the lakes and screened for the occurrence of neurotoxic STXs, ANTX-a and for the cytotoxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN). The highest concentration of STX (up to 1.06 mu g l(-1) in Lake Jieznas) was detected during July-August and coincided with a predominance of A. gracile in the phytoplankton. Of the isolated strains, only A. gracile was confirmed to be a producer of STXs by chemical (LC-MS/MS) and genetic (sxtA) methods. Sequencing of the phycocyanin intergenic spacer and flanking regions (cpcBA) revealed that A. gracile formed a genetically homogenous group. Only trace amounts of ANTX-a were detected in field samples (up to 0.31 mu g l(-1) in Lake Sirvys). CYN was detected in neither the bloom samples nor in the isolated strains.					; Mazur-Marzec, Hanna/J-8511-2017; Koreiviene, Judita/GNM-7260-2022	Torunska-Sitarz, Anna/0000-0003-1274-2688; Koreiviene, Judita/0000-0002-8156-7548; Mazur-Marzec, Hanna/0000-0002-6526-4045; 													0967-0262	1469-4433				JUL 2	2020	55	3					327	338		10.1080/09670262.2020.1734667	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2020.1734667		MAY 2020											WOS:000532210200001

With this in mind, we provide a description and paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the Late Pleistocene Middle Stone Age (MSA) artifact- and fossil-bearing sediments from Karungu, located along the shores of Lake Victoria in western Kenya. Artifacts recovered from surveys and controlled excavations are typologically MSA and include points, blades, and Levallois flakes and cores, as well as obsidian flakes similar in geochemical composition to documented sources near Lake Naivasha (250 km east). A combination of sedimentological, paleontological, and stable isotopic evidence indicates a semi-arid environment characterized by seasonal precipitation and the dominance of C-4 grasslands, likely associated with a substantial reduction in Lake Victoria. The well-preserved fossil assemblage indicates that these conditions are associated with the convergence of historically allopatric ungulates from north and south of the equator, in agreement with predictions from genetic observations. Analysis of the East African MSA record reveals previously unrecognized north south variation in assemblage composition that is consistent with episodes of population fragmentation during phases of limited dispersal potential. The grassland-associated MSA assemblages from Karungu and nearby Rusinga Island are characterized by a combination of artifact types that is more typical of northern sites. This may reflect the dispersal of behavioral repertoires and perhaps human populations-during a paleoenvironmental phase dominated by grasslands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The increase/decrease in the level of water leads to an increase/decrease in the volume of water, which influences the interactions of fishes and catching capability. We examine how seasonal variations in water level and harvesting affect the outcome of prey-predator interactions in an artificial lake. A seasonal variation of the water level is introduced in the predation rate. We derive conditions for the persistence and extinction of the populations. Using the continuation theorem, we determine the conditions for which the system has a positive periodic solution. The existence of a unique globally stable periodic solution is also presented. Moreover, we obtain conditions for the existence, uniqueness and stability of a positive almost periodic solution. We find that if the autonomous system has a stable focus, the corresponding nonautonomous system exhibits a unique stable positive periodic solution. But, whenever the autonomous system shows limit cycle oscillations, the corresponding nonautonomous system exhibits chaotic dynamics. The chaotic behavior of system is confirmed by the positivity of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. For higher values of the assimilation fraction of prey population, the persistent oscillations of the autonomous system are eliminated and this system becomes stable. On the other hand, chaotic nature of the nonautonomous system is converted into periodicity if the assimilation fraction of prey is large. Moreover, populations behave almost periodically if the seasonally varied rate parameters are almost periodic functions of time. Our findings show that water level plays an important role in the persistence of prey-predator system.					; Bona, Francesca/B-6404-2013; Pal, Samares/AAO-1297-2020; Sarkar, Abhijit/HTN-7966-2023	Bona, Francesca/0000-0003-2260-8001; Sarkar, Abhijit/0000-0001-9285-801X; PAL, SAMARES/0000-0002-8792-0031													0218-3390	1793-6470				DEC	2020	28	4					865	900		10.1142/S0218339020500205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218339020500205													WOS:000610056900003

To do this, this study evaluated changing trends and detected transition years for both streamflow and sediment discharge using long-term historical records at seven hydrological stations in the Ganjiang River basin over the past 50 years. The double mass curve (DMC) method was used to quantify the effects of both climate change and human activities on hydrological regime shifts. The results showed that the distributions of precipitation, streamflow, and sediment discharge within a year are extremely uneven and mainly concentrated in the flood season of Jiangxi Province. None of the stations showed significant trends over time for either annual precipitation or streamflow, while the annual sediment discharge at most stations decreased significantly over time. The estimation of sediment discharge via DMC indicated that after the transition years, there were rapid reductions in sediment discharge at all hydrological stations, and the average decline degree of midstream and downstream were much larger than that of upstream. Human activities, especially the increase of vegetation cover and construction of large and medium-sized reservoirs, provided a significantly greater contribution to the reduction of sediment discharge than did precipitation changes. As a case study of river evolution under global change environment, this study could provide scientific basis for the control of soil erosion and the management of water resources in Ganjiang River, as well as for the related research of Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River basin of China.

Antarctic ice-free areas, where rare lakes are located, are influenced by such sources. In this work we determine polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, including the non-Aroclor CB-11) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in water and sediment samples of 6 lakes in Northern Victoria Land and in soils near the Italian research station Mario Zucchelli. Determinations were performed through gas chromatography (GC) coupled both to low-resolution and high-resolution mass spectrometry (LRMS, HRMS). POP concentrations in lakes resulted low and rather similar across the sites despite their distance: Sigma(PCBs) range between 46 and 143 pg L-1 in water and 10 and 634 pg g(-1) in sediments, while Sigma(PBDEs) range between 60 and 151 pg L-1 in water and 193 and 1682 pg g(-1) in sediments. Lakes exhibited limited amplification phenomena in water during the melting season. PBDEs in the soils near the base yielded more concerning results, reaching a concentration of 33 ng g(-1).

The metabolism of tropical systems may differ profoundly from temperate systems due to the higher temperatures and wider variations in precipitation. Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of the variability in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and its drivers in a set of 102 low-latitude lakes and reservoirs that encompass wide gradients of precipitation, productivity and landscape properties (lake area, perimeter-to-area ratio, catchment size, catchment area-to lake area ratio, and types of catchment land use). We used multiple regressions and structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine the direct and indirect effects of the main in-lake variables and landscape properties on the water pCO(2) variance. We found that these systems were mostly supersaturated with CO2 (92% spatially and 72% seasonally) regardless of their trophic status and landscape properties. The pCO(2) values (9-40,020 mu atm) were within the range found in tropical ecosystems, and higher (p < 0.005) than pCO(2) values recorded from high latitude ecosystems. Water volume had a negative effect on the trophic state (r = -0.63), which mediated a positive indirect effect on pCO(2) (r = 0.4), representing an important negative feedback in the context of climate change-driven reduction in precipitation. Our results demonstrated that precipitation drives the pCO(2) seasonal variability, with significantly higher pCO(2) during the rainy season (F = 16.67; p < 0.001), clue to two potential main mechanisms: (1) phytoplankton dilution and (2) increasing inputs of terrestrial CO2 from the catchment. We conclude that at low latitudes, precipitation is a major climatic driver of pCO(2) variability by influencing volume variations and linking lentic ecosystems to their catchments.

Enhanced methylmercury (MeHg) production in periphyton has been well documented, but the re-distribution of MeHg from periphyton remains unknown. In this study, periphyton, sediments, surface water, periphyton overlying water, and periphyton porewater were collected from Everglades for analyzing the distribution of MeHg and total Hg (THg). Results showed that there were no significant differences in THg and MeHg in different types of periphyton, but they all displayed higher MeHg levels than sediments. MeHg distribution coefficients (logkd) in periphyton were lower than in sediments, suggesting that periphyton MeHg could be more labile entering aquatic cycling and bioaccumulation. In water, the more the distance of water samples taken from periphyton, the lower the MeHg and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were detected. In extracellular polymeric substances of periphyton, MeHg in colloidal fractions was significantly higher than that in capsular fractions. It was estimated that approximately 10% (or 1.35 kg) of periphyton MeHg were passed on to mosquitofish entering the food web during wet season, contributing 73% of total Hg stocked in mosquitofish. These results revealed the importance of periphyton on water MeHg distribution and MeHg bioaccumulation in Everglades.					; Cai, Yong/K-9868-2015; Yin, Yongguang/D-1695-2010	Yin, Yongguang/0000-0002-7287-8598; yin, yong guang/0000-0001-9392-6256; Cai, Yong/0000-0002-2811-4638; 													0304-3894	1873-3336				MAY 15	2021	410								124551	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124551		MAR 2021						33223320					WOS:000635542000008

Microcystis is the dominat genus in most freshwater bodies and is one of the main pmducter of micmcystins. Using 454-pyrosequencing we characterized the bacterial community, with special emphasis on Microcystis, in three recreational urban lakes from Mexico City in both wet and dry seasons. We also evaluated some physicochemical parameters that might influence the presence of Microcystis blooms, and we associated the relative abundance of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacterial communities with their possible metabolic capacities. A total of 14 phyla, 18 classes, 39 orders, 53 families and 48 bacterial genera were identified in both seasons in the three urban lakes. Cyanobacteria had the highest relative abundance followed by Pmteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Microcystis was the dominant taxon followed by Arthrospira, Planktothrix and Synechococcus. We also found heterotrophic bacteria associated with the blooms, such as Rhodobacter, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas and, Porphyrobacter. The highest richness, diversity and dominance were registered in the bacterial community of the Virgilio Uribe Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Track in both seasons, and the lowest values were found in the Chapultepec Lake. The canonical correspondence analysis showed that dissolved oxygen and NO3-N concentrations might explain the presence of Microcystis blooms. The metabolic prediction indicated that these communities are involved in photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, methane metabolism, carbon fixation, and nitrogen and sulfur metabolism. The lakes studied had a high prevalence of Microcystis, but average values of microcystins did not exceed the maximum permissible level established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for recreational and cultural activities. The presence of cyanobacteria and micmcystins at low to moderate concentrations in the three lakes could result in ecosystem disruption and increase animal and human health risks.

J	Chen, CZ; Litt, T				Chen, Chunzhu; Litt, Thomas			Dead Sea pollen provides new insights into the paleoenvironment of the southern Levant during MIS 6-5	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The paleoclimate of the southern Levant, especially during the last interglacial (LIG), is still under debate. Reliable paleovegetation information for this period, as independent evidence to the paleoenvironment, was still missing. In this study, we present a high-resolution pollen record encompassing 147-89 ka from the Dead Sea deep drilling core 5017-1A. The sediment profile is marked by alternations of laminated marl deposits and thick massive halite, indicating lake-level fluctuations. The pollen record suggests that steppe and desert components predominated in the Dead Sea surroundings during the whole investigated interval. The late penultimate glacial (147.3-130.9 ka) and early last glacial (115.5-89.1 ka) were cool and relatively dry, with sub-humid conditions confined to the mountains that sustained moderate amounts of deciduous oaks. Prior to the LIG optimum, a prevalence of desert components and a concomitant increase in frost-sensitive pistachio trees demonstrate the occurrence of an arid initial warming phase (130.9-124.2 ka). The LIG optimum (124.2 ka-115.5 ka) was initiated by an abrupt grass expansion that was followed by a rapid spread of woodlands in the mountains due to increased moisture availability. The remarkable sclerophyllous expansion points to a strong seasonal moisture deficit. These results contradict previous Dead Sea lake-level investigations that suggested pluvial glacials and a warm, dry LIG in the southern Levant. Prominent discrepancies between vegetation and Dead Sea lake stands are also registered at 128-115 ka, and the potential causes are discussed. In particular, while the pollen spectra mirror increased effective moisture during the LIG optimum, the massive halite deposition is indicative of an extremely low lake level. Given that the climate amelioration triggered the migration of early modern humans to the southern Levant, we speculate that the diverse ecosystems in the region provided great potential for their residence. Across the eastern Mediterranean region, an analogous vegetation succession pattern is observed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Poinar, K; Andrews, LC				Poinar, Kristin; Andrews, Lauren C.			Challenges in predicting Greenland supraglacial lake drainages at the regional scale	CRYOSPHERE												A leading hypothesis for the mechanism of fast supraglacial lake drainages is that transient extensional stresses briefly allow crevassing in otherwise compressional ice flow regimes. Lake water can then hydrofracture a crevasse to the base of the ice sheet, and river inputs can maintain this connection as a moulin. If future ice sheet models are to accurately represent moulins, we must understand their formation processes, timescales, and locations. Here, we use remote-sensing velocity products to constrain the relationship between strain rates and lake drainages across similar to 1600 km(2) in Pakitsoq, western Greenland, between 2002-2019. We find significantly more extensional background strain rates at moulins associated with fast-draining lakes than at slow-draining or non-draining lake moulins. We test whether moulins in more extensional background settings drain their lakes earlier, but we find insignificant correlation. To investigate the frequency at which strain-rate transients are associated with fast lake drainage, we examined Landsat-derived strain rates over 16 and 32 d periods at moulins associated with 240 fast-lake-drainage events over 18 years. A low signal-to-noise ratio, the presence of water, and the multi-week repeat cycle obscured any resolution of the hypothesized transient strain rates. Our results support the hypothesis that transient strain rates drive fast lake drainages. However, the current generation of ice sheet velocity products, even when stacked across hundreds of fast lake drainages, cannot resolve these transients. Thus, observational progress in understanding lake drainage initiation will rely on field-based tools such as GPS networks and photogrammetry.					; Andrews, Lauren/D-8274-2017	Poinar, Kristin/0000-0002-1386-9659; 													1994-0416	1994-0424				MAR 24	2021	15	3					1455	1483		10.5194/tc-15-1455-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1455-2021													WOS:000634629200001

Soil and water conservation measures (SWC) have been applied to counteract land degradation in the endangered areas, but SWC efficiency may vary related to the heterogeneity of the landscape. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to model hydrology and sediment dynamics of a 53.7 km(2) watershed, located in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. Spatially distributed stone bund impacts were applied in the model through modification of the surface runoff ratio and adjustment of a support practice factor simulating the trapped amounts of water and sediment at the SWC structure and watershed level. The resulting Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for daily streamflow simulation was 0.56 for the calibration and 0.48 for the validation period, suggesting satisfactory model performance. In contrast, the daily sediment simulation resulted in unsatisfactory model performance, with the NSE value of 0.07 for the calibration and -1.76 for the validation period and this could be as a result of high intensity and short duration rainfall events in the watershed. Meanwhile, insufficient sediment yield prediction may result to some extent from daily based data processing, whereas the driving runoff events and thus sediment loads occur on sub-daily time scales, probably linked with abrupt gully breaks and development. The calibrated model indicated 21.08 Mg/hm(2) average annual sediment yield, which is far beyond potential soil regeneration rate. Despite the given limits of model calibration, SWAT may support the scaling up and out of experimentally proven SWC interventions to encourage sustainable agriculture in the Ethiopian Highlands.					; Addis, Hailu/R-1595-2019; Addis, Hailu/U-2481-2019	Klik, Andreas/0000-0002-3299-1721; Addis, Hailu/0000-0003-0265-0261; Strohmeier, Stefan/0000-0002-2106-739X; Melaku, Nigus Demelash/0000-0001-7042-4501													1934-6344	1934-6352				SEP	2016	9	5					51	66		10.3965/j.ijabe.20160905.2483	http://dx.doi.org/10.3965/j.ijabe.20160905.2483													WOS:000386351300007

Changes in lakes water volume and runoff over ungauged Sahelian watersheds	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A large part of the Sahel consists of endorheic hydrological systems, where reservoirs and lakes capture surface runoff during the rainy season, making water available during the dry season. Monitoring and understanding the dynamics of these lakes and their relationships to the ecohydrological evolution of the region is important to assess past, present and future changes of water resources in the Sahel. Yet, most of Sahelian watersheds are still ungauged or poorly gauged, which hinders the assessment of the water flows feeding the lakes and the overall runoff over their watershed. In this paper, a methodology is developed to estimate water inflow to lakes for ungauged watersheds. It is tested for the Agoufou lake in the Gourma region in Mali, for which in situ water height measurements and surface areas estimations by remote sensing are simultaneously available. A Height-Volume-Area (HVA) model is developed to relate water volume to water height and lake surface area. This model is combined to daily evaporation and precipitation to estimate water inflow to the lake, which approximates runoff over the whole watershed. The ratio between annual water inflow and precipitation increases over the last sixty years as a result of a significant increase in runoff coefficient over the Agoufou watershed. The method is then extended to derive water inflow to three other Sahelian lakes in Mauritania and Niger. No in situ measurements are available and lake surface areas estimation by remote sensing is the only source of information. Dry season surface area changes and estimated evaporation are used to select a suited VA relationship for each case. It is found that the ratio between annual water inflow and precipitation has also increased in the last 60 years over these watersheds, although trends at the Mauritanian site are not statistically significant. The remote sensing approach developed in this study can be easily applied to recent sensors such as Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8, to quantify the evolution of hydrological systems in ungauged Sahelian regions.

Late Pleistocene Alberca de Guadalupe maar volcano (Zacapu basin, Michoacan): Stratigraphy, tectonic setting, and paleo-hydrogeological environment	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Late Pleistocene (similar to 21,000 yr BP) Alberca de Guadalupe maar is one of the few phreatomagmatic volcanoes occurring within the scoria-cone dominated Plio-Quaternary Michoacan-Guanajuato Volcanic Field. The scarcity of this type of volcano implies that conditions favoring their formation are rarely met in this region. We identify these factors by implementing current methods of investigation with emphasis on hydrogeological conditions. We present the stratigraphy (including a set of 40Ar/39Ar and C-14 dates) of the SE margin of the Zacapu intermontane tectonic basin, where the maar just forms a hole (similar to 1 km in diameter, similar to 150 m deep, bearing a similar to 9 m deep lake) in the otherwise planar topography of the underlying early Pleistocene lava flows of the Cerro Pelon scoria cone. The maar is composed of typical phreatomagmatic surge deposits that are poorly sorted and rich in accidental lithics (>60 wt.% of the deposit) with few juveniles (basaltic andesite, SiO2 = 54-58 wt.%). The entire structure is cut by an ENE-WSW trending normal fault and is underlain by andesite lavas and silicic ignimbrites (partly inferred from xenoliths encountered in the maar deposits) that are Miocene to Early Pleistocene in age. The crater is at the center of a N-S elongated drainage basin surrounded by topographic highlands that channel water with high hydraulic pressure from most directions towards the location of the mar. This geometric configuration was already in existence at the time of the maar-forming eruption, but the climate was different. Colder and more humid conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (Cw2-climate type, annual precipitation of >1000 mm) favored the saturation of the fractured shallow aquifer system (hydraulic conductivity of 10(-8) to 10(-7) m/s) that supplied sufficient groundwater at a high flow rate directed towards the center of the basin. Upon contact near surface (<200 m) with the rising dike of basaltic andesite magma, the continuous supply of both dike-fed basaltic andesite magma and groundwater at an optimal ratio of 0.2 allowed explosive interaction for the entire duration of the eruption (17-57 days) creating a >150 m deep crater with steep inner walls and an underlying shallow diatreme (<300 m). Since then, partial collapse of the walls along listric ring-fractures has reduced crater steepness. The present climate is much drier (Cw1 climate conditions with annual precipitation of 697.5-874.8 mm) and it seems unlikely that a maar would form if these conditions persist. Nonetheless, precipitation is still high enough to sustain a similar to 9-m-deep lake in the crater with insignificant seasonal water table fluctuations. These findings lend further support to the notion that maars can be used as paleoclimate indicators in central Mexico. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A 2-year (2012-2013) field experiment was conducted at a typical paddy rice field in a rural suburb of Shanghai, China. N losses and GHG emissions from the paddy field with alternative fertilizer management practices were simultaneously measured. Four treatments were tested in the experiment: applications of only chemical synthetic fertilizer urea (CT), only organic manure (OT), a combination of the two types of fertilizers (MT) and a control (CK). Results from the field study indicated that CT produced the highest seasonal N loading rate (18.79 kg N/ha) and N2O emissions (1.81 kg N2O/ha) but with the lowest seasonal CH4 emissions (69.09 kg CH4/ha). With organic manure applied, MT and OT respectively reduced N loading by 21.86% and 30.41%, reduced N2O emissions by 28.34% and 69.41%, but increased CH4 emissions by 137% and 310% in comparison with CT. However, the net impact of CH4 and N2O emissions on global warming was enhanced when organic manure was applied. In addition, CF and MT produced the optimal rice yield during the experimental period, while OT treatment led to a yield reduction by 9.29% compared with CT. In conclusion, the impacts of alternative fertilizer management practices on ecosystem services ought to be assessed specifically due to the great variations across rice yields, N loss and GHG emissions.

Ice tectonic deformation during the rapid in situ drainage of a supraglacial lake on the Greenland Ice Sheet	CRYOSPHERE												We present detailed records of lake discharge, ice motion and passive seismicity capturing the behaviour and processes preceding, during and following the rapid drainage of a similar to 4 km(2) supraglacial lake through 1.1-km-thick ice on the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Peak discharge of 3300 m(3) s(-1) coincident with maximal rates of vertical uplift indicates that surface water accessed the ice-bed interface causing widespread hydraulic separation and enhanced basal motion. The differential motion of four global positioning system (GPS) receivers located around the lake record the opening and closure of the fractures through which the lake drained. We hypothesise that the majority of discharge occurred through a similar to 3-km-long fracture with a peak width averaged across its wetted length of similar to 0.4 m. We argue that the fracture's kilometre-scale length allowed rapid discharge to be achieved by combining reasonable water velocities with sub-metre fracture widths. These observations add to the currently limited knowledge of in situ supraglacial lake drainage events, which rapidly deliver large volumes of water to the ice-bed interface.

Altaf; Ensminger, Ingo			Remotely sensed carotenoid dynamics improve modelling photosynthetic phenology in conifer and deciduous forests	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Detecting the phenology of photosynthesis, which conveys the length of the growing season, is key for terrestrial ecosystem models to constrain total annual carbon uptake and estimate gross primary productivity (GPP). However, some of the vegetation indices that are widely used for modelling GPP lack the ability to represent changes in the magnitude of photosynthesis, leading to errors in detecting phenology and large uncertainties. Crucially, remotely sensed vegetation indices such as the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and chlorophyll/ carotenoid index (CCI) can detect changes in foliar carotenoid composition that represent adjustments in photosynthetic light-use-efficiency (LUE) and changes in phenology. We modeled GPP from remote sensing data using PRI and CCI to represent foliar carotenoid changes as proxies for LUE. GPP values estimated from these PRI and CCI modified LUE models were compared against GPP from eddy covariance flux tower measurements, MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP product, conventional meteorological driven LUE-model, and process-based dynamic global vegetation model (ie. JULES) in an evergreen needleleaf and a deciduous broadleaf forest in the Great Lakes region. Overall, and in particular for evergreen needleleaf forests, estimates of start and end of growing season using PRI and CCI LUE-models showed less year-to-year variability than estimates obtained by process-based meteorological models. Although many process-based models provide reasonable estimates of start and end of growing season, our results demonstrate that using regulatory carotenoids and photosynthetic efficiency can improve remote monitoring of the phenology of forest vegetation.

J	Ramillien, G; Frappart, F; Seoane, L				Ramillien, Guillaume; Frappart, Frederic; Seoane, Lucia			Application of the Regional Water Mass Variations from GRACE Satellite Gravimetry to Large-Scale Water Management in Africa	REMOTE SENSING												Time series of regional 2 x 2 Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) solutions of surface water mass change have been computed over Africa from 2003 to 2012 with a 10-day resolution by using a new regional approach. These regional maps are used to describe and quantify water mass change. The contribution of African hydrology to actual sea level rise is negative and small in magnitude (i.e., -0.1 mm/y of equivalent sea level (ESL)) mainly explained by the water retained in the Zambezi River basin. Analysis of the regional water mass maps is used to distinguish different zones of important water mass variations, with the exception of the dominant seasonal cycle of the African monsoon in the Sahel and Central Africa. The analysis of the regional solutions reveals the accumulation in the Okavango swamp and South Niger. It confirms the continuous depletion of water in the North Sahara aquifer at the rate of -2.3 km(3)/y, with a decrease in early 2008. Synergistic use of altimetry-based lake water volume with total water storage (TWS) from GRACE permits a continuous monitoring of sub-surface water storage for large lake drainage areas. These different applications demonstrate the potential of the GRACE mission for the management of water resources at the regional scale.

J	Xin, XK; Li, KF; Finlayson, B; Yin, W				Xin, Xiao-kang; Li, Ke-feng; Finlayson, Brian; Yin, Wei			Evaluation, prediction, and protection of water quality in Danjiangkou Reservoir, China	WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												The water quality in the Danjiangkou Reservoir has attracted considerable attention from the Chinese public and government since the announcement of the Middle Route of the South to North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), which commenced transferring water in 2014. Integrated research on the evaluation, prediction, and protection of water quality in the Danjiangkou Reservoir was carried out in this study in order to improve environmental management. Based on 120 water samples, wherein 17 water quality indices were measured at 20 monitoring sites, a single factor evaluation method was used to evaluate the current status of water quality. The results show that the main indices influencing the water quality in the Danjiangkou Reservoir are total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), dissolved oxygen (DO), and five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), and the concentrations of TP, BOD5, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), CODMn, DO, and anionic surfactant (Surfa) do not reach the specified standard levels in the tributaries. Seasonal Mann-Kendall tests indicated that the CODMn concentration shows a highly significant increasing trend, and the TP concentration shows a significant increasing trend in the Danjiangkou Reservoir. The distribution of the main water quality indices in the Danjiangkou Reservoir was predicted using a two-dimensional water quality numerical model, and showed that the sphere of influence from the tributaries can spread across half of the Han Reservoir if the pollutants are not controlled. Cluster analysis (CA) results suggest that the Shending River is heavily polluted, that the Jianghe, Sihe, and Jianhe rivers are moderately polluted, and that they should be the focus of environmental remediation.

The temporal distribution pattern and sources of nitrate are of great concern for water quality. The nitrogen (N) cycling processes in a subtropical watershed located in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, China were greatly influenced by the temporal variations of precipitation and temperature during the study period (September 2011 to July 2012). The highest NO3- concentration in water was in May (wet season, mean +/- SD = 17.45 +/- 9.50 mg L-1) and the lowest concentration occurred in December (dry season, mean SD = 10.54 +/- 6.28 mg L-1). Nevertheless, no water sample in the study area exceeds the WHO drinking water limit of 50 mg L-1 NO3-. Four sources of NO3- (atmospheric deposition, AD; soil N, SN; synthetic fertilizer, SF; manure & sewage, M&S) were identified using both hydrochemical characteristics [Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, sO(4)(2-), Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Na+, disscilved oxygen (DO)] and dual isotope approach (delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-. Both chemical and isotopic characteristics indicated that denitrification was not the main N cycling process in the study area. Using a Bayesian model (stable isotope analysis in R, SIAR), the contribution of each source was apportioned. Source apportionment results showed that source contributions differed significantly between the dry and wet season, AD and M&S contributed more in December than in May. In contrast SN and SF contributed more NO3- to water in May than that in December. M&S and SF were the major contributors in December and May, respectively. Moreover, the shortcomings and uncertainties of SIAR were discussed to provide implications for future works. With the assessment of temporal variation and sources of NO3-, better agricultural management practices and sewage disposal programs can be implemented to sustain water quality in subtropical watersheds.

Furthermore, their relationships as well as recorded environmental variables were explored by co-occurrence networks. Bacterial community composition was different in two size fractions, as well as along the salinity gradient across two seasons. Free-living (FL) communities were dominated by pico-sized Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus CC9902) while Exiguobacterium, Halomonas and Pseudomonas were predominantly associated with particle-associated (PA) lifestyle, and Cyanobium PCC-6307 exhibited seasonal shifts in lifestyles in different seasons. In wet season, bacterial community composition was characterized by abundance of Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bac-teroidetes, which were tightly linked with high riverine inflow. While in dry season, Proteobacteria increased in prevalence, especially for Psychrobacter, NOR5/OM60 clade and Pseudomonas, which were thrived in lower water temperature and higher salinity. Moreover, we discovered that differences between PA and FL composition were more significant in the wet season than in the dry season, which may be due to better nutritional conditions of particles (indicated by POC%) in the wet season and then attract more diverse PA populations. Based on the analysis of plastidial 16 S rRNA genes, abundant small-sized mixotrophic phytoplankton (Dinophyceae, Euglenida and Haptophyta) were identified in the PRE. The complexity of co-occurrence network increased from FL to PA fractions in both seasons, which suggested that suspended particles can provide ecological niches for particle -associated colonizers contributing to the maintenance of a more stable community structure. In addition, the majority of phytoplankton species exhibited positive co-occurrences with both other phytoplankton species and bacterial counterparts, indicating the mutual cooperation between phytoplankton assemblages and specific bacterial populations e likely benefited from phytoplankton-derived organic compounds. This study enhances our understanding of the seasonal and spatial dynamics of bacterial communities and their potential relationship with phytoplankton assembly in estuarine waters.					; Huang, xp/JRX-2837-2023; Liu, Songlin/CAG-5973-2022; Longji, Cui/A-4033-2017	Zhang, Xia/0000-0002-3213-9352; 													0141-1136	1879-0291				NOV	2023	192								106193	10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106193		OCT 2023						37832281					WOS:001097910000001

However, wetland ponds are being replaced rapidly by small constructed reservoirs in agricultural regions, yet it is unclear whether these two water body types exhibit similar physical, chemical, and environmental controls of GHG content and fluxes. Here, we compared the content and regulatory mechanisms of all three major GHGs in 20 pairs of natural wetland ponds and constructed reservoirs in Canada's largest agricultural region. Carbon dioxide content was associated primarily with metabolic indicators in both water body types; however, primary production was paramount in reservoirs, and heterotrophic metabolism a stronger correlate in wetland ponds. Methane concentrations were correlated positively with eutrophication of the reservoirs alone, while competitive inhibition by sulfur-reducing bacteria may have limited CH4 in both waterbody types. Contrary to expectations, N2O was undersaturated in both water body types, with wetlands being a significantly stronger and more widespread N2O sink. Varying regulatory processes are attributed to differences in age, depth, morphology, and water-column circulation between water body types. These results suggest that natural and constructed water bodies should be modeled separately in regional GHG budgets.					; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; Simpson, Gavin/KFQ-1110-2024; Webb, Jackie/JMQ-8492-2023; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012	Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Jensen, Sydney/0000-0001-6671-2172; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Webb, Jackie/0000-0003-1274-363X; Finlay, Kerri/0000-0001-6835-8832; Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				APR	2023	128	4							e2022JG007261	10.1029/2022JG007261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JG007261													WOS:001000228500001

Kilimanjaro (Tanzania), to examine the provenance of GDGTs in lake sediments and their potential application as palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic proxies. The study material included samples collected at monthly intervals in a sediment trap over one complete annual cycle, particles suspended in the stratified water column, profundal surface sediments, and soils surrounding the lake. The sediment trap time series revealed that crenarchaeol and related isoprenoid GDGTs were predominantly produced in January and February, following the locally prominent short rain season (November-December). The TEX86-inferred temperature derived from sedimenting particles corresponded well with lake surface-water temperature at this time of largest crenarchaeol flux. Molecular ecological analysis showed that Group 1.1a and 1.1b crenarchaeota are the most likely source organisms of these GDGTs. GDGT-0 in the lake sediments does not only originate from lake surface-dwelling crenarchaeota but seems predominantly derived from archaea residing in the deeper, anoxic part of the water column. The main flux of branched GDGTs to the sediment was during the short rain season and is most probably derived from eroded catchment soils in surface run-off. However, a contribution from in-situ production of branched GDGTs in the lake sediment or water, or in groundwater cannot be fully excluded. We conclude that palaeoclimatic reconstruction based on branched GDGT distributions in lake sediments should only be performed when the origin of those branched GDGTs is well constrained.

In this study, we analyzed 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), air, soil and sediment in the Poyang Lake, which is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast China. The samples were collected from intertidal zone of the Poyang Lake, in both the dry and wet seasons, corresponding to the exposure and submersion periods, respectively. Concentrations of target PAHs in air, water, SPM and sediments were 0.8-13.5 ng/m3, 5.1-62.0 ng/l, 117-4651 ng/g and 16.4-775 ng/g, respectively. Concentrations of PAHs in sediments were found to be significantly related to total organic carbon and water content (p < 0.01). Compared to the sediment samples, the low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs (2-3 rings) accounted for greater proportions in water, SPM and air. Results suggest that the occurrences of PAH species are affected by their lipophilic properties. Molecular diagnostic ratios of PAH isomers in multimedium indicated that PAH presence in the Poyang Lake were attributed to both pyrogenic and petrogenic sources, and source contributions in different medium were shown to vary. Sediment-water and soil-air exchanges showed that the sediment plays a role of secondary emission sources for most LMW PAHs, and some high molecular weight PAHs (e.g., BghiP, IcdP and DahA) had different transmission directions in the alternate process of exposure and submersion. These findings provide a better understand of migration mechanism among the air, water body (including water and SPM) and sediment PAHs driven by dry-wet cycles.

J	Arat, S; Bullerjahn, GS; Laubenbacher, R				Arat, Seda; Bullerjahn, George S.; Laubenbacher, Reinhard			A Network Biology Approach to Denitrification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	PLOS ONE												Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a metabolically flexible member of the Gammaproteobacteria. Under anaerobic conditions and the presence of nitrate, P. aeruginosa can perform (complete) denitrification, a respiratory process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrogen gas via nitrite (NO2), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). This study focuses on understanding the influence of environmental conditions on bacterial denitrification performance, using a mathematical model of a metabolic network in P. aeruginosa. To our knowledge, this is the first mathematical model of denitrification for this bacterium. Analysis of the long-term behavior of the network under changing concentration levels of oxygen (O-2), nitrate (NO3), and phosphate (PO4) suggests that PO4 concentration strongly affects denitrification performance. The model provides three predictions on denitrification activity of P. aeruginosa under various environmental conditions, and these predictions are either experimentally validated or supported by pertinent biological literature. One motivation for this study is to capture the effect of PO4 on a denitrification metabolic network of P. aeruginosa in order to shed light on mechanisms for greenhouse gas N2O accumulation during seasonal oxygen depletion in aquatic environments such as Lake Erie (Laurentian Great Lakes, USA). Simulating the microbial production of greenhouse gases in anaerobic aquatic systems such as Lake Erie allows a deeper understanding of the contributing environmental effects that will inform studies on, and remediation strategies for, other hypoxic sites worldwide.

J	Zou, F; Tenzer, R; Jin, SG				Zou, Fang; Tenzer, Robert; Jin, Shuanggen			Water Storage Variations in Tibet from GRACE, ICESat, and Hydrological Data	REMOTE SENSING												The monitoring of water storage variations is essential not only for the management of water resources, but also for a better understanding of the impact of climate change on hydrological cycle, particularly in Tibet. In this study, we estimated and analyzed changes of the total water budget on the Tibetan Plateau from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission over 15 years prior to 2017. To suppress overall leakage effect of GRACE monthly solutions in Tibet, we applied a forward modeling technique to reconstruct hydrological signals from GRACE data. The results reveal a considerable decrease in the total water budget at an average annual rate of -6.22 +/- 1.74 Gt during the period from August 2002 to December 2016. In addition to the secular trend, seasonal variations controlled mainly by annual changes in precipitation were detected, with maxima in September and minima in December. A rising temperature on the plateau is likely a principal factor causing a continuous decline of the total water budget attributed to increase melting of mountain glaciers, permafrost, and snow cover. We also demonstrate that a substantial decrease in the total water budget due to melting of mountain glaciers was partially moderated by the increasing water storage of lakes. This is evident from results of ICESat data for selected major lakes and glaciers. The ICESat results confirm a substantial retreat of mountain glaciers and an increasing trend of major lakes. An increasing volume of lakes is mainly due to an inflow of the meltwater from glaciers and precipitation. Our estimates of the total water budget on the Tibetan Plateau are affected by a hydrological signal from neighboring regions. Probably the most significant are aliasing signals due to ground water depletion in Northwest India and decreasing precipitation in the Eastern Himalayas. Nevertheless, an integral downtrend in the total water budget on the Tibetan Plateau caused by melting of glaciers prevails over the investigated period.

It therefore presents a unique model system to address ecological questions regarding niche adaptation and Baas Becking's long standing hypothesis of "everything is everywhere, but the environment selects." Here, we present the first assessment of the microbial diversity in these lakes. We sampled the lakes in August and December and used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons to analyze the microbial diversity. The diversity patterns between lakes and seasons were compared and the bacterial community composition was correlated with key chemical and physical parameters. Distinct patterns of bacterial diversity only emerged at the level of individual OTUs (operational taxonomic units), but not at the level of the major bacterial phyla. This emphasizes the high functional and physiological diversity among bacterial species within a phylum and calls for analysis of biodiversity at the level of OTUs in order to understand fine scale biogeography. We were able to identify a number of cosmopolitan OTUs as well as specialist OTUs that were restricted to certain lakes or seasons, suggesting adaptation to specific ecological niches.					; Geist, Juergen/C-4933-2008; Zwirglmaier, Katrin/H-9799-2014	Keiz, Katharina/0000-0003-4529-6362; Geist, Juergen/0000-0001-7698-3443; Zwirglmaier, Katrin/0000-0001-8598-9572													1664-302X					OCT 28	2015	6								1168	10.3389/fmicb.2015.01168	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01168								26579082					WOS:000364169200001

In this study, aiming at a major water source reservoir in hot and humid areas in southern China, which encountered seasonable odor problems in recent years, an integrated approach including comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), flavor profile analysis (FPA) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was adopted to investigate the odor occurrence. Results: The results indicated that earthy-musty odor is blamed to the seasonable odor problems, and it is consistent with the complaints results from consumers. Fifty-four typical odor compounds were investigated in the reservoir and twelve were detected, of which, 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) was significantly increased during the odor event. Pseudanabaena sp. is the dominant species in the reservoir, which can be further represented by the number of mic gene with qPCR method (R-2=0.746, P<0.001). Oxygen consumption (CODMn) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have great influence on growth of Pseudanabaena sp., and the release of 2-MIB from the Pseudanabaena sp. cells is affected by temperature and light. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that 2-MIB is the odor-caused substance in the reservoir and Pseudanabaena sp. is the main 2-MIB producer, which was confirmed as a benthic filamentous algae. Due to CODMn and DOC have great influence on Pseudanabaena sp. growth, further measures to reduce the CODMn and DOC input should be performed. We also demonstrated that the 2-MIB release is affected by temperature and light. The risk of sudden increase of 2-MIB will be reduced by raising the depth of water in the reservoir. Our study will improve the understanding of T&O problems in this city, as well as in other hot and humid area.

Here, we used photo-identification recapture data to quantify site fidelity of the endangered Saimaa ringed seal (Pusa hispida saimensis) over four successive moulting seasons. We identified 337 seals based on their permanent fur patterns, and 192 of them were observed during at least 2 years. Over the study period, the median number of terrestrial haul-out sites used by an individual seal was four, and nearly 50% of the seals reused them over the years. Although eight seals performed movements (up to 48 km) between the different water basins of Lake Saimaa, most of the studied seals remained in the same water basin over the years. The median distance between successive moulting sites used by an individual seal was 643 m. While these distances were similar within years in both sexes, the distances between years were longer in females, suggesting post-nursing related behaviour. The extreme site fidelity of the Saimaa ringed seal has important implications for its conservation, especially in the land use management of the Lake Saimaa shoreline.

Serious Microcystis bloom was observed in July-December 2008 and Bacillariophyta and Cryptophyta dominated in January-June 2009. BCC was characterized by DGGE of 16S rRNA gene with subsequent sequencing. The DGGE banding patterns revealed a remarkable seasonality which was closely related to phytoplankton community succession. Variation trend of Shannon-Wiener diversity index in bacterioplankton community was similar to that of phytoplankton community. CCA revealed that temperature and phytoplankton played key roles in structuring BCC. Sequencing of DGGE bands suggested that the majority of the sequences were affiliated with common phylogenetic groups in freshwater: Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. The cluster STA2-30 (affiliated with Actinobacteria) was found almost across the sampling time at the two study sites. we observed that the family Flauobacteriaceae (affiliated with Bacteroidetes) tightly coupled to diatom bloom and the cluster ML-5-51.2 (affiliated with Actinobacteria) dominated the bacterioplankton communities during Microcystis bloom. These results were quite similar at the two sampling sites, indicating that BCC changes were not random but with fixed pattern. Our study showed insights into relationships between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton communities at species level, facilitating a better understanding of microbial loop and ecosystem functioning in the lake.

In this study, we investigated the water exchange rate in dry and wet seasons, and assessed the influence of seasonal water exchange on brine concentration and crystallization process in the Nalenggele (NLGL) catchment of Qaidam Basin, China. The results show that the surface water infiltration and groundwater recharge rates in the wet season were 2.81 x 10(-3) and 1.15 x 10(-3) m(3)/(s.m) in upstream, 1.63 x 10(-3 )= and 1.53 x 10(-2) m(3)/(s.m) in midstream, and 2.83 x 10(-4) and 6.82 x 10(-5) m(3)/(s.m) in downstream, respectively; while their counterparts in the dry season were 9.81 x 10(-4) and 5.05 x 10(-4) m(3)/(s.m) in upstream, and 8.34 x 10(-3) and 7.78 x 10(-3) m(3)/(s.m) in midstream, respectively. The water exchange strongly influenced brine concentration and crystallinzation process, with brine chemistry belonging to 3K(2)SO(4)-Na2SO4 and KCl types in wet and dry seasons. respectively. The strong water exchange in wet season destroyed the water-salt balance, while the low , water exchange rate in dry season facilitated preparation of KCl products.

J	Skinner, M				Skinner, Megan			Wetland phosphorus dynamics and phosphorus removal potential	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Wetlands are typically defined as inundated areas with hydric soils forming a transitional zone between terrestrial and aquatic systems. Wetlands have numerous ecosystem benefits, one of which is the potential to mitigate or reverse eutrophication of surface water bodies. The physical, chemical, and biological processes governing phosphorus cycling in wetlands are nuanced and complex; understanding these has direct relevance to the restoration of wetlands, particularly for projects aimed at improving water quality in adjacent water bodies. This literature review summarizes these processes and provides recommendations relevant to restoration of permanent and semipermanent flow-through wetlands, such as those in the Upper Klamath Basin of Oregon. It also reviews several wetland restoration studies assessing phosphorus removal. In summary, appropriately designed and managed wetlands can remove 25% to 44% of inflowing total phosphorus. Deposition of particulate matter, adsorption, uptake by biomass, and peat accretion are the primary phosphorus sequestration mechanisms in wetlands, depending on site-specific conditions (e.g., growing season length, vegetation communities, and soil type). In areas with relatively short growing seasons and where wintertime loads are targeted for treatment, as in the Upper Klamath Basin, deposition of particulate matter will be the primary mechanism for phosphorus sequestration in wetlands given that two of the three remaining processes occur during the growing season. Recommendations to maximize phosphorus sequestration in wetlands include the following: designing wetlands for hydraulic residence time of several days to weeks, managing wetlands for rapid establishment of wetland vegetation with limited decomposition potential (e.g., tule [hardstem bulrush] to facilitate peat accretion), and flooding during periods with low water temperatures and initially isolating restored wetlands from adjacent water bodies (both to minimize diffusive flux of phosphorus from wetland sediment to the water column). Relevant to the Upper Klamath Basin, there is also justification to prioritize areas with relatively high particulate phosphorus load given the potential limited capacity for phosphorus treatment associated with other sequestration mechanisms. Finally, a combination of mitigation and restoration strategies is necessary to achieve water quality objectives, meaning that wetland restoration alone may not be sufficient. Monitoring is advised to facilitate application of adaptive management principles. Practitioner Points Appropriately designed and managed wetlands can remove 25% to 44% of inflowing total phosphorus.

We used an unmanned surface vessel (USV) to collect sonar depth measurements for 24 ponds to derive the first empirical relationship between their area and volume applicable to the size distribution of ponds commonly encountered on debris-covered glaciers. Additionally, we instrumented nine ponds with thermistors and three with pressure transducers, characterizing their thermal regime and capturing three pond drainage events. The deepest and most irregularly-shaped ponds were those associated with ice cliffs, which were connected to the surface or englacial hydrology network (maximum depth=45.6m), whereas hydrologically-isolated ponds without ice cliffs were both more circular and shallower (maximum depth=9.9m). The englacial drainage of three ponds had the potential to melt similar to 100 +/- 20x10(3)kg to similar to 470 +/- 90x10(3)kg of glacier ice owing to the large volumes of stored water. Our observations of seasonal pond growth and drainage with their associated calculations of stored thermal energy have implications for glacier ice flow, the progressive enlargement and sudden collapse of englacial conduits, and the location of glacier ablation hot-spots where ponds and ice cliffs interact. Additionally, the evolutionary trajectory of these ponds controls large proglacial lake formation in deglaciating environments. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Due to the shallowness and large size of Lake Taihu, it is quite complex to set the optimal transferred inflow rate for each route or the combination of routes to maximize the benefits for improving the lake's water exchange with minimum economical cost and environmental impact. In this study, the appropriate transferred inflow rates and environmental impacts of the different water transfer routes on both Lake Taihu ("receiver") and the Yangtze River ("supplier") were assessed using the concept of water age and Lagrangian particle tracking based on a three-dimensional Environmental Fluid Dynamic Code (EFDC) model. The results showed that the appropriate flow rates were quite different from the single route diversion to the combination of routes, depending on priorities such as lowest economical cost and high-est water quality improvement for specific lake regions or the entire lake. Two optimal combinations of routes to achieve specific results in different seasons were determined to improve the water exchange of the lake. During the algal bloom seasons, the objective of the combination focused on enhancing water exchange in the specified lake regions such as Meiliang Bay and Zhushan Bay. The optimal flow rates for Route One to Route Four were 80, -70 ("-" means outflow), 100 and 20 m(3)/s, respectively. In the non-algal bloom seasons, the combination concentrated on lowering water ages in the entire lake. The optimal flow rates for Route One to Route Four were 90, -40, 70 and 20 m(3)/s, respectively. The results suggested that the Yangtze River Diversion, as an emergency stopgap measure, played important roles on enhancing water exchange in the lake, but had minimal impact on the Yangtze River. The findings of this study provide useful information for the local government and decision-makers to better understand the physical and hydrological processes of water transfer projects and to assist in managing the water transfer projects.

The study evaluated the concentration of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) in six fish species in the uMgeni River, and the edibility thereof. Water, sediment and fish were sampled during low and high flow seasons in the Inanda and Nagle dams. Metals were below detection level in the water column whereas notable concentrations were observed in sediment. Arsenic and Se concentrations were within the guidelines for all species, whereas Hg exhibited concentrations exceeding the guidelines except for Clarias gariepinus, Micropterus salmoides, and Cyprinus carpio. For non-carcinogenic risks, the THQs > 1 was observed for As and Hg for all species except C. carpio whereas Se showed THQs < 1 for all species. These findings suggest that consuming fish from the uMgeni River could result in As and Hg related non-carcinogenic health hazards.

J	Leoni, B; Patelli, M; Soler, V; Nava, V				Leoni, Barbara; Patelli, Martina; Soler, Valentina; Nava, Veronica			Ammonium Transformation in 14 Lakes along a Trophic Gradient	WATER												Ammonia is a widespread pollutant in aquatic ecosystems originating directly and indirectly from human activities, which can strongly affect the structure and functioning of the aquatic foodweb. The biological oxidation of NH4+ to nitrite, and then nitrate is a key part of the complex nitrogen cycle and a fundamental process in aquatic environments, having a profound influence on ecosystem stability and functionality. Environmental studies have shown that our current knowledge of physical and chemical factors that control this process and the abundance and function of involved microorganisms are not entirely understood. In this paper, the efficiency and the transformation velocity of ammonium into oxidised compounds in 14 south-alpine lakes in northern Italy, with a similar origin, but different trophic levels, are compared with lab-scale experimentations (20 degrees C, dark, oxygen saturation) that are performed in artificial microcosms (4 L). The water samples were collected in different months to highlight the possible effect of seasonality on the development of the ammonium oxidation process. In four-liter microcosms, concentrations were increased by 1 mg/L NH4+ and the process of ammonium oxidation was constantly monitored. The time elapsed for the decrease of 25% and 95% of the initial ion ammonium concentration and the rate for that ammonium oxidation were evaluated. Principal Component Analysis and General Linear Model, performed on 56 observations and several chemical and physical parameters, highlighted the important roles of total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations on the commencement of the oxidation process. Meanwhile, the natural concentration of ammonium influenced the rate of nitrification(mu g NH4+/L day). Seasonality did not seem to significantly affect the ammonium transformation. The results highlight the different vulnerabilities of lakes with different trophic statuses.					; Nava, Veronica/E-6989-2018; Nava, Veronica/LDG-5826-2024	LEONI, BARBARA/0000-0001-9448-9457; Patelli, Martina/0000-0002-7029-9875; Nava, Veronica/0000-0002-2770-1937; 														2073-4441				MAR	2018	10	3							265	10.3390/w10030265	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10030265													WOS:000428516000030

Feeding ecology and niche overlap of Lake Ontario offshore forage fish assessed with stable isotopes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The forage fish communities of the Laurentian Great Lakes continue to experience changes that have altered ecosystem structure, yet little is known about how they partition resources. Seasonal, spatial, and body size variation in delta C-13 and delta N-15 was used to assess isotopic niche overlap and resource and habitat partitioning among the five common offshore Lake Ontario forage fish species (n = 2037; alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and deepwater (Myoxocephalus thompsonii) and slimy (Cottus cognatus) sculpins). Round goby had the largest isotopic niche (6.1 parts per thousand(2), standard ellipse area), followed by alewife (3.4 parts per thousand(2)), while rainbow smelt, slimy sculpin, and deepwater sculpin had the smallest and similar niche size (1.7 parts per thousand(2)-1.8 parts per thousand(2)), with only the sculpin species showing significant isotopic niche overlap (>63%). Stable isotopes in alewife, round goby, and rainbow smelt varied with location, season, and size, but did not vary in the sculpin species. Lake Ontario forage fish species have partitioned food and habitat resources, and non-native alewife and round goby have the largest isotopic niche, suggestive of a boarder ecological niche, and may contribute to their current high abundance.

Climate-driven terrestrial inputs in ultraoligotrophic mountain streams of Andean Patagonia revealed through chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fluvial networks transport a substantial fraction of the terrestrial production, contributing to the global carbon cycle and being shaped by hydrologic, natural and anthropogenic factors. In this investigation, four Andean Patagonian oligotrophic streams connecting a forested catchment (similar to 125 km(2)) and draining to a double-basin large and deep lake (Lake Moreno complex, Northwestern Patagonia), were surveyed to analyze the dynamics of the allochthonous subsidy. The results of a 30 month survey showed that the catchment supplies nutrients and dissolved organicmatter (DOM) to the streams. The eruption of the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle at the beginning of the study overlapped with seasonal precipitation events. The largest terrestrial input was timed with precipitation which increased particulate materials, nutrients and DOM through enhanced runoff. Baseline suspended solids and nutrients were very low in all the streams (suspended solids: similar to 1 mg/L; total nitrogen: similar to 0.02 mg/L; total phosphorus: similar to 5 mu g/L), increasing several fold with runoff. Baseline dissolved organic carbon concentrations (DOC) ranged between 0.15 and 1 mg/L peaking up to three-fold. Chromophoric and fluorescent analyses characterized the DOM as of large molecular weight and high aromaticity. Parallel factor modeling (PARAFAC) of DOM fluorescence matrices revealed three components of terrestrial origin, with certain degree of microbial processing: C1 and C2 (terrestrial humic-like compounds) and C3 (protein-like and pigment derived compounds). Seasonal changes in MOD quality represent different breakdown stages of the allochthonous DOM. Our survey allowed us to record and discuss the effects of the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle eruption, showing that due to the high slopes, high current and discharge of the streams the volcanic material was rapidly exported to the Moreno Lake complex. Overall, this survey underscores the magnitude and timing of the allochthonous input revealing the terrestrial subsidy to food webs in Patagonian freshwaters, which are among the most oligotrophic systems of the world.

Modeling nutrient removal using watershed-scale implementation of the two-stage ditch	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) is the most intensively farmed region of the Great Lakes. Because of the flat topography and poorly-drained soils many farmers rely on drainage management practices (e.g., subsurface tile drainage, ditch channelization) to maintain productive agriculture. However, these practices also facilitate the delivery of excess nutrients and sediments to Lake Erie, which have been linked to recurring harmful algal blooms (HABs) and associated environmental degradation. Implementation of inset floodplains in formerly channelized waterways via the two-stage ditch can improve water quality but the efficacy has been tested using only implementation in short reaches. Watershed models are critical tools for assessing watershed-scale implementation and as such can guide effective management. We evaluated the effectiveness of the two-stage ditch in improving water quality in the River Raisin Watershed (RRW), a major subbasin in the WLEB, combining empirical measurements for nutrient reductions from two-stage ditches across the Midwest with output from a Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. We modeled two-stage implementation in 25, 50, and 100% of headwater reaches in the RRW, and found that the practice could reduce total annual NO3--N export by 2, 5 and 10%, respectively. The two-stage was even more effective at reducing total phosphorus (TP) export, which was reduced by 12, 20 and 31%, respectively. Compared to other conservation practices, nutrient reduction efficiency for the two-stage ditch was good, both in terms of percent load reduction and cost, but watershed-scale adoption will be required in order to achieve significant nutrient reductions as called for by policymakers.

The results show that: (1) influenced by the barrier of the permafrost layer, the suprapermafrost water level in the permafrost area rises significantly, while in the seasonally frozen ground area, the soil moisture infiltration is dominated by lateral flow and downward infiltration. (2) With the thawing of soil, the soil water content in the permafrost area gradually increases to reach a saturated state. Influenced by terrain, soil texture, evapotranspiration and infiltration capacity, the variation in the topsoil moisture content is large in the seasonally frozen ground area. (3) The presence of regional talik groundwater leads to a slight increase in the water level on the uphill slope. In addition to rainfall infiltration, the change in water level on the downhill slope is also affected by talik groundwater, which causes the rapid rise of water level on the down slope.																			0262-6667	2150-3435				FEB 17	2021	66	3					525	543		10.1080/02626667.2021.1883619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2021.1883619		MAR 2021											WOS:000627012900001
J	Vera, RB; Krapovickas, V				Vera, Rocio B.; Krapovickas, Veronica			Paleobiology and paleoecology of ungulates from the Miocene of South America based on an ichnological analysis	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We analyze fossil footprints and trackways from the middle to late Miocene Vinchina Formation of La Rioja Province, northwestern Argentina. Ichnofossils are preserved in floodplain deposits of anastomosing and meandering fluvial systems and in ephemeral lake facies deposited under arid and semi-arid conditions. The tridactyl ungulate tracks are assigned to the novel ichnotaxa, Macrauchenichnus troyana and Llastaya yesera. Based on comparisons with phylogenetic character states observable on the postcrania of functionally tridactyl ungulates, the trackmaker of M. troyana was a litoptern macraucheniid whereas early toxodontids produced L. yesera. Based on the isometric relationship of footprint area and body mass in modern unguligrade mammals, we propose body mass estimate for these extinct ungulates. Facies analysis of this fossil footprint assemblage reveals that this previously undocumented fauna inhabited mixed grassland-woodland ecosystems developed under warm and seasonal climates in mid-palaeolatitudes. Findings support the idea of a faunal link between high and low latitude ecosystems of South America during the middle to late Miocene.

This study presents fluxes based on sediment porewater measurements from different water depths of five deep lakes of differing trophic states. In meso-to eutrophic lakes F-red was directly proportional to the total organic carbon mass accumulation rate (TOC-MAR) of the sediments. TOC-MAR and thus F-red in eutrophic lakes decreased systematically with increasing mean hypolimnion depth (z(H)), suggesting that high oxygen concentrations in the deep waters of lakes were essential for the extent of organic matter mineralization leaving a smaller fraction for anaerobic degradation and thus formation of reduced compounds. Consequently, F-red was low in the 310 m deep meso-eutrophic Lake Geneva, with high O-2 concentrations in the hypolimnion. By contrast, seasonal anoxic conditions enhanced F-red in the deep basin of oligotrophic Lake Aegeri. As TOC-MAR and z(H) are based on more readily available data, these relationships allow estimating the areal O-2 consumption rate by reduced compounds from the sediments where no direct flux measurements are available.

Climate change, fire management, and ecological services in the southwestern US	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The diverse forest types of the southwestern US are inseparable from fire. Across climate zones in California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, fire suppression has left many forest types out of sync with their historic fire regimes. As a result, high fuel loads place them at risk of severe fire, particularly as fire activity increases due to climate change. A legacy of fire exclusion coupled with a warming climate has led to increasingly large and severe wildfires in many southwest forest types. Climate change projections include an extended fire season length due to earlier snowmelt and a general drying trend due to rising temperatures. This suggests the future will be warmer and drier regardless of changes in precipitation. Hotter, drier conditions are likely to increase forest flammability, at least initially. Changes in climate alone have the potential to alter the distribution of vegetation types within the region, and climate-driven shifts in vegetation distribution are likely to be accelerated when coupled with stand-replacing fire. Regardless of the rate of change, the interaction of climate and fire and their effects on Southwest ecosystems will alter the provisioning of ecosystem services, including carbon storage and biodiversity. Interactions between climate, fire, and vegetation growth provide a source of great uncertainty in projecting future fire activity in the region, as post-fire forest recovery is strongly influenced by climate and subsequent fire frequency. Severe fire can be mitigated with fuels management including prescribed fire, thinning, and wildfire management, but new strategies are needed to ensure the effectiveness of treatments across landscapes. We review the current understanding of the relationship between fire and climate in the Southwest, both historical and projected. We then discuss the potential implications of climate change for fire management and examine the potential effects of climate change and fire on ecosystem services. We conclude with an assessment of the role of fire management in an increasingly flammable Southwest. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The impact of biodiversity on ecosystem functions and services remains a hot topic in ecology, especially under increasing biodiversity loss. Studies on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have identified two regulatory mechanisms: i.e., "niche complementarity" and "selection effect". However, the relative importance of these mechanisms within communities and how they change along ecological gradients remain unclear. Moreover, most studies have focused on relatively stable ecosystems (e.g., forest, grassland), with limited attention paid to ecosystems with obvious seasonal changes, e.g., freshwater ecosystems. In this study we conducted a seasonal survey of submerged macrophyte communities to clarify the mechanisms of biodiversity on biomass productivity accounting for seasons and water depth. Our results showed that (1) seasonal variations of community indicators exhibited different trends along the water depth gradient. Biomass productivity showed high seasonal variation at intermediate depth while temporal beta diversity showed the opposite pattern. (2) Water depth not only inhibited biomass productivity directly but also indirectly by reducing species richness and enhancing temporal beta diversity. (3) The positive effect of species richness on biomass productivity was lower than the negative effect of evenness (path coefficients: 0.13 vs. 0.27), indicating that "selection effect" played a more important role in the relationship. (4) In shallow areas, the mechanism underlying the effects of biodiversity on biomass productivity was more from "selection effect", whereas, in deep areas, the effects were related to both "niche complementarity" and "selection effect". Our findings suggest that "niche complementarity" and "selection effect" are two complementary mechanisms underpinning the relationship between biodiversity and biomass productivity, and their relative importance varies with specific ecological gradients. Our results also provide a reference for studies on other freshwater organisms with analogous distribution patterns as submerged macrophytes with water depth. Scale dependence of the above relationship should be considered in future studies.

Contribution of zooplankton as a biological element in the assessment of reservoir water quality	LIMNETICA					19th Congress of the Iberian-Association-of-Limnology (AIL)	JUN 24-29, 2018	Coimbra, PORTUGAL	Iberian Assoc Limnol, Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Univ Coimbra, Associacao Promocao Conhecimento Ecologia Aquqtica				European water policies aim to achieve a good ecological status in all water bodies. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) defined a group of biological elements to assess water quality. In reservoirs and lakes, phytoplankton is the only biological element used for water quality evaluation. However, zooplankton is an important link in the trophic web, since it is able to control the phytoplankton community and was already described as a good bioindicator, with high sensitivity to different environmental stresses. The main goal of this work is to demonstrate the ability of zooplankton communities to be used in the evaluation of water quality in reservoirs. A group of four reservoirs in the north of Portugal (Paradela, Alto Cavado, Alto Rabagao, and Venda Nova) were sampled every three months, during one year, to assess the water quality. Physical and chemical parameters, as well as phytoplankton communities, were studied according to the metrics proposed by the WFD for this typology of water bodies. Additionally, zooplankton communities were also sampled in each reservoir, to understand if their seasonal dynamics are influenced by alterations of the water quality in the reservoirs. Results show that the reservoirs present a good ecological potential, according to WFD reference values for physical and chemical parameters and phytoplankton communities, with occasional drops to moderate ecological potential due to variations in the dissolved O-2 and total phosphorus values. The results observed in the dynamics of zooplankton communities show that this biological element is sensitive to changes in the reservoirs and provides a more detailed image of the state of the ecosystem. Zooplankton communities responded to alterations in the water level in the reservoir, to shifts in the trophic status and in the water quality, both at the taxonomic level and on a functional perspective. Therefore, the metrics proposed by WFD to evaluate water quality in reservoirs seem to be insufficient to understand all the alterations that occur in these aquatic ecosystems.

Carbon isotope data show that Australopithecus bahrelghazali individuals from Koro Toro in Chad are significantly enriched in C-13, indicating a dependence on C-4 resources. As these sites are over 3 million years in age, the results extend the pattern of C-4 dependence seen in Paranthropus boisei in East Africa by more than 1.5 million years. The Koro Toro hominin fossils were found in argillaceous sandstone levels along with abundant grazing and aquatic faunal elements that, in combination, indicate the presence of open to wooded grasslands and stream channels associated with a greatly enlarged Lake Chad. In such an environment, the most abundant C-4 plant resources available to A. bahrelghazali were grasses and sedges, neither of which is usually considered as standard great ape fare. The results suggest an early and fundamental shift in hominin dietary ecology that facilitated the exploitation of new habitats.

Fast draining lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes around the ablation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet forms an important link between water at the surface and the ice sheet base, allowing surface meltwater to reach the bed and hence increase glacial velocity. The conduits formed by lake drainages may remain open during the remainder of the melt season providing a pathway for further meltwater to reach the base. We investigated the drainage behavior of lakes from all regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet for the period 2005-2009. We mapped the evolution of 2600 lakes from 3704 MODIS images detecting a mean of 263 drainage events per year, of which 61% occurred in the south-west region. Only 1% of lake drainages occurred in the rapidly thinning south-east region. Our results show marked differences between the hydrology of the different regions of the ice sheet, with few lake drainages occurring in the regions where the highest dynamic mass loss is occurring. In the south-west and north-east, lake drainages are common and could impact glacier dynamics; in the south-east they are rare and are thus unlikely to do so. Citation: Selmes, N., T. Murray, and T.

In this study, we used floating chambers to study methane emission fluxes and their temporal and spatial variations in three temperate cascade reservoirs with different nutrient levels and morphologies in northern China. We measured the methane production rate, sediment properties and water quality to identify key factors driving methane emissions. The results showed that the three cascade reservoirs were persistent sources of atmospheric methane during the ice-free period, and the methane flux ranged from 1.01 to 107.17 mu mol m-2h- 1, with a mean of 11.17 mu mol m-2h- 1. The mean methane flux of the eutrophic reservoir was more than 2 and 4 times that of the two mesotrophic reservoirs. Overall, methane flux showed high spatial and temporal variability within and among reservoirs, and the three reservoirs showed different patterns of spatial and temporal variability. Statistical analysis showed that the three reservoirs had different key drivers, indicating that the methane emissions of the three reservoirs were regulated by different underlying mechanisms. When all three reservoirs were pooled, we found that Chl-a was the most important driver of methane emissions. Our results suggest that to obtain an accurate estimate of whole-reservoir methane flux, different reservoir zones and seasons must be considered. Our results also highlight that regional and global methane budget upscaling should include considerations of reservoir diversity (different climatic zones, morphology and trophic levels).					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023; Sun, Chuanzhe/LWH-6780-2024	Sun, Chuanzhe/0000-0003-4405-6391													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2023	626		A						130170	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130170		SEP 2023											WOS:001083875200001

The development of several microscopic methods allows the distinction between live and dead zooplankton in field samples, and the reported percentages of dead zooplankton average 11.6 (minimum) to 59.8 (maximum) in marine environments, and 7.4 (minimum) to 47.6 (maximum) in fresh and inland waters. Common causes of non-predatory mortality among zooplankton include senescence, temperature change, physical and chemical stresses, parasitism and food-related factors. Carcasses resulting from non-predatory mortality may undergo decomposition leading to an increase in microbial production and a shift in microbial composition in the water column. Alternatively, sinking carcasses may contribute significantly to vertical carbon flux especially outside the phytoplankton growth seasons, and become a food source for the benthos. Global climate change is already altering freshwater ecosystems on multiple levels, and likely will have significant positive or negative effects on zooplankton non-predatory mortality. Better spatial and temporal studies of zooplankton carcasses and non-predatory mortality rates will improve our understanding of this important but under-appreciated topic.

The infor-mation of vegetation type on the water-land ecotone is important for detecting the health of the wetland, and its protection. Seasonal flooding is a key factor in controlling the environment in water-land ecotone. Even pre-venting direct detection of the flooded vegetation with satellites, seasonal flooding has effects on the distribution of plants, which may provide potential information on vegetation classification with satellites. Therefore, the study induces flooding index in vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone with satellites. We applied Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to map vegetation in the Dongting Lake with random forest method. The Sentinel-1 SAR images were used to obtain the flooding index (i.e. inundation frequency), and Sentinel-2 images were applied to acquire the optical characteristic of vegetation. A comparative experiment based on whether the flooding index was added or not during vegetation mapping in the Dongting Lake was carried out to explore the role of flooding index in vegetation mapping. The results concluded that (1) seasonal flooding will hinder vegetation mapping using a single phase of optical information; (2) the classification accuracy of single phase scenario was signifi-cantly improved with the aid of flooding index especially in wet season; (3) the classification accuracy can be somewhat improved by adding flooding index for the multi-temporal scenario. The study implies that inundation frequency information can be used for vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone, especially for complex regions with insufficient cloud-free satellite images.					lei, guangbin/HTN-8455-2023; Li, Ainong/G-5569-2010														1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2022	144								109448	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109448	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109448		SEP 2022											WOS:000864629100002

This deformation is especially pronounced in South and Southeast Asia, where the annual monsoon produces large-amplitude hydrological loads. The Myanmar-India-Bangladesh-Bhutan (MIBB) network of about 20 continuously operating Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) stations, established in 2011, provides an opportunity to study the Earth's response to these loads. In this study, we use GRACE temporal gravity products as an estimate of long-wavelength surface water distribution and use this estimate in an elastic loading calculation. We compare the predicted vertical deformation from GRACE with that observed with GNSS. We find that elastic loading inferred from the GRACE gravity model is able to explain the phase and much of the peak-to-peak amplitude (typically 2-3 cm) of the vertical GNSS oscillations, especially in northeast India and central Myanmar. GRACE-based corrections reduce the RMS scatter of the GNSS data by 30 45% in these regions. However, this approach does not capture all of the seasonal deformation in central Bangladesh and southern Myarunar. We show by a synthetic test that local hydrological effects may explain discrepancies between the GNSS and GRACE signals in these places. Two independent hydrological loading models of water stored in soil, vegetation, snow, lakes and streams display phase lags compared to the GRACE and GNSS observations, perhaps indicating that groundwater contributes to the observed loading in addition to near-surface hydrology. The results of our calculations have implications for survey-mode GNSS measurements, which make up the majority of geodetic measurements in this region. By using the GNSS data together with estimates of hydrological loading from independent observations and models, we may be able to more accurately determine crustal motions caused by tectonic processes in South and Southeast Asia, while also improving our ability to monitor the annual monsoon and resulting water storage changes in the region.					; Hill, Emma/B-7037-2011; Lindsey, Eric/HMD-4962-2023; Ahsan, Aktarul/AAF-9429-2020; Feng, Lujia/F-2523-2012; Materna, Kathryn/LZH-7366-2025; Alam, A.H.M./AFM-0753-2022; Burgmann, Roland/AAE-5138-2022; Oo, KYAW/HLQ-5821-2023	Ahsan, Aktarul/0000-0001-8698-7114; Hill, Emma/0000-0003-0231-5818; Oo, Kyaw Than/0000-0003-1727-3462; Materna, Kathryn/0000-0002-6687-980X; Feng, Lujia/0000-0002-3736-5025; 													0956-540X	1365-246X				MAR	2021	224	3					1742	1752		10.1093/gji/ggaa500	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggaa500													WOS:000606573600016

Hence, it is important to understand the community structure with respect to pertinent controlling environmental factors. Seasonal down-core variations in bacterial communities were investigated at 3 mangrove sites at upstream, mid-stream and mouth region along the economically-important Mandovi estuary, west coast of India. Genomic DNA extracted from 45 sediment samples were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing. A total of 15008 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned to 54 phyla and 127 classes re-affirming mangroves to be biodiversity hotspots. Members of class Alphaproteobacteria constituted up to 35% of the tag sequences and showed marked seasonal variability at all locations (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.05). Occurrence of other abundant phyla like Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria at the study sites indicated their participation in biogeochemical cycling. Seasonal fluctuations in the environmental variables influenced the bacterial communities. Statistical analysis revealed that during the monsoon, bacterial communities proximal to the mouth region were largely influenced by pore water NH4+ concentrations due to its accumulation in the sub-surface sediments. At the upstream site, elevated organic carbon and NO2xe213; content during the post-monsoon caused variations in the bacterial community.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				JUN 5	2022	270								107791	10.1016/j.ecss.2022.107791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2022.107791		APR 2022											WOS:000793279100005

Assessment of convection-permitting versions of the Unified Model over the Lake Victoria basin region	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The Met Office runs an operational high-resolution convection-permitting model over Tropical Africa to support National Meteorological Services across the continent. This article evaluates the prediction of convective storms in two convection-permitting versions of the Met Office Unified Model over the Lake Victoria basin region in East Africa. Two model configurations are compared for a case of severe convection: the first was tuned for tropical regions and the second was based on the operational UK model configuration. The tropical configuration compares better with satellite-derived rainfall observations in terms of domain-average rain-rate and the distribution of rain-rates is better, particularly for the more intense rain-rates. However, both configurations generally produce too much rain, too many small storms, and a lack of light rain, which is compensated for by heavy rain in the cores of the storms. The tropical configuration was then assessed over two rainy seasons. In both seasons, the onset time of night-time precipitation over Lake Victoria is delayed and the amount of precipitation is underestimated, which suggests the model may miss night-time storms that occur over the lake. During the first 12-24 hr of the simulations, the precipitation field is still spinning up from the lower-resolution global model fields used to initialise the convection-permitting model. This leads to large overestimates in the domain-average precipitation during this period and highlights the need to run convection-permitting models for at least two days to reduce the impact of cold-starting from a non-convective-permitting analysis. Despite the spin-up issues, fractions skill score analysis shows that forecast skill decreases with increasing lead time. This implies that there is inherent skill in the early stages of the model forecast and underlines that short-term forecast (0-48 hr) improvements in the model are likely to be achieved when using an improved analysis for initialisation.					; Woodhams, Beth/AAF-4408-2019	Bain, Caroline/0000-0002-2993-9308; Hanley, Kirsty/0000-0002-1002-7667; Woodhams, Beth/0000-0003-2070-8279													0035-9009	1477-870X				APR	2021	147	736					1642	1660		10.1002/qj.3988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.3988		FEB 2021											WOS:000623101300001

This study aimed to investigate the diversity and abundance of microbial communities inhabiting Chott El Jerid during wet season (when it was flooded), using molecular methods [Illumina Miseq sequencing, DGGE and qPCR (qPCR)]. 16S rRNA gene analyses revealed that bacterial community was dominated by Proteobacteria (especially Ralstonia species), followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The results obtained using prokaryotic universal primers showed low relative abundance of Archaea dominated by few OTUs related to Methanosarcinaceae and Methanomassiliicoccaceae families and the presence of sulfate-reducing Archaea affiliated with Archaeoglobus. However, the results obtained using Archaea-specific primers showed that archaeal community was mainly composed of aerobic Halobacteria (especially Halorubrum species) and anaerobic members of Methanomicrobia. These results also provided evidence for the presence of members of the genus Halohasta in this environment. qPCR results revealed that Archaea were more abundant in studied samples than Bacteria. The sulfate-reducing Bacteria were also found abundant (one-third of the bacterial community) and outnumbered methanogens, suggesting their potential important role in this sulfate-rich and hypersaline ecosystem.

J	Cho, JH; Lee, JH				Cho, Jae Heon; Lee, Jong Ho			Multiple Linear Regression Models for Predicting Nonpoint-Source Pollutant Discharge from a Highland Agricultural Region	WATER												Sediment runoff from dense highland field areas greatly affects the quality of downstream lakes and drinking water sources. In this study, multiple linear regression (MLR) models were built to predict diffuse pollutant discharge using the environmental parameters of a basin. Explanatory variables that influence the sediment and pollutant discharge can be identified with the model, and such research could play an important role in limiting sediment erosion in the dense highland field area. Pollutant load per event, event mean concentration (EMC), and pollutant load per area were estimated from stormwater survey data from the Lake Soyang basin. During the wet season, heavy rains cause large amounts of suspended sediment and the occurrence of such rains is increasing due to climate change. The explanatory variables used in the MLR models are the percentage of fields, subbasin area, and mean slope of subbasin as topographic parameters, and the number of preceding dry days, rainfall intensity, rainfall depth, and rainfall duration as rainfall parameters. In the MLR modeling process, four types of regression equations with and without log transformation of the explanatory and response variables were examined to identify the best performing regression model. The performance of the MLR models was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CV(RMSE)), the ratio of the RMSE to the standard deviation of the observed data (RSR) and the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE). The performance of the MLR models of pollutant load except total nitrogen (TN) was good under the condition of RSR, and satisfactory for the NSE and R-2. In the EMC and load/area models, the performance for suspended solids (SS) and total phosphorus (TP) was good for the RSR, and satisfactory for the NSE and R-2. The standardized coefficients for the models were analyzed to identify the influential explanatory variables in the models. In the final performance evaluation, the results of jackknife validation indicate that the MLR models are robust.																				2073-4441				SEP	2018	10	9							1156	10.3390/w10091156	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10091156													WOS:000448821900048

Materials and methods The overlying water and sediment samples were collected from the Qiuxi River in the normal-water season (NWS), low-water season (LWS), and high-water season (HWS), and physicochemical properties were quantified. Total phosphorus (TP) in sediment and the inorganic phosphorus (P-i) fraction were analyzed using the standard measures technology (SMT) procedure, and organic phosphorus (P-o) was further determined to be labile P-o (LOP), moderately labile P-o (MLOP), or non-labile P-o (NLOP). The release potential of P from the sediments was studied by experiments under simulated conditions. Results and discussion The results showed that P pollution in the Qiuxi River was the most serious during the LWS, with mean TP concentrations in the sediment of 854.6 mg kg(-1), and the release risk of the sediment P was also highest during this water season. The variation in P concentration was significantly influenced by the discharge of domestic sewage, agricultural diffusion, flow rate, and OM. The concentrations of P fractions varied with water season, but P-i was constantly higher than P-o. HCl-extractable P-i (HCl-P-i) accounted for most of the P in the sediments, which was related to its characteristics and the geographical location of the Qiuxi River. The maximum P release (R-max) was 25.9 mg kg(-1) in the LWS and 15.3 mg kg(-1) in the HWS, which were positively correlated with the TP (r(2) = 0.848, p < 0.01) and OM (r(2) = 0.847, p < 0.01) concentrations in the sediments and explained why the release risk of the sediment P in the LWS was higher than that in the HWS. Conclusions Phosphorus pollution and the P release potential in the sediments of the Qiuxi River were most severe in the LWS, so more effective measures to restrain the release of P should be taken during the LWS. Moreover, OM in sediments should be given more attention owing to its significantly positive correlation with the risk of P release.					; Liu, Xiaoze/HGA-7395-2022	Guoxin, Li/0000-0003-1344-9109; Zhang, Wen/0000-0002-8656-1727; Yin, Yuepeng/0009-0008-2711-9243													1439-0108	1614-7480				JAN	2021	21	1					575	591		10.1007/s11368-020-02805-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02805-x		NOV 2020											WOS:000584368700001

However, information about the spatial and temporal variation of macrophyte and phytoplankton distribution as indicators for water contamination is limited. To gain insights into the dynamics, we analyzed lake-cover changes of Bellandur and Varthur Lake in the S-Indian megacity of Bengaluru for the post-rainy seasons of the years 2002-2019. Supervised maximum likelihood classifications were conducted on 62 freely available, true-color satellite images in order to distinguish between macrophytes, algae, and free water surface. The image-derived results were verified by supervised classification and manual mapping of two simultaneously recorded multispectral satellite images (Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2). Seasonal interrelations between macrophytes and algae distribution were similar for both lakes. The increase in macrophyte cover during post-rainy season negatively correlated with algal abundance. Macrophyte expansion progressively suppressed algae development at both lakes, reflective of increasing eutrophication caused by on-going wastewater input. Seasonal variation in precipitation, wind direction, and temperature seemed to trigger intra-annual shifts of macrophytes and algae while similar macrophyte spread intensities during the post-monsoon season indicated independence of nutrient loads in the lake water.

Lake drying and livelihood dynamics in Lake Chad: Unravelling the mechanisms, contexts and responses	AMBIO												This article examines lake drying and livelihood dynamics in the context of multiple stressors through a case study of the "Small Lake Chad" in the Republic of Chad. Livelihoods research in regions experiencing persistent lake water fluctuations has largely focused on the well-being and security of lakeshore dwellers. Little is known about the mechanisms through which lake drying shapes livelihood drawbacks and opportunities, and whether locally evolved responses are enhancing livelihoods. Here we address these gaps using empirical, mixed-methods field research couched within the framework of livelihoods and human well-being contexts. The analysis demonstrates that limited opportunities outside agriculture, the influx of mixed ethnic migrants and the increasing spate of violence all enhance livelihood challenges. Livelihood opportunities centre on the renewal effects of seasonal flood pulses on lake waters and the learning opportunities triggered by past droughts. Although drying has spurred new adaptive behaviours predicated on seasonality, traditional predictive factors and the availability of assets, responses have remained largely reactive. The article points to where lake drying fits amongst changes in the wider socio-economic landscape in which people live, and suggests that awareness of the particularities of the mechanisms that connect lake drying to livelihoods can offer insights into the ways local people might be assisted by governments and development actors.					; Okpara, Uche/AAF-3470-2021	Stringer, Lindsay/0000-0003-0017-1654; 													0044-7447	1654-7209				NOV	2016	45	7					781	795		10.1007/s13280-016-0805-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-016-0805-6								27371137					WOS:000385151100003

Fifty years later: trophic ecology and niche overlap of a native and non-indigenous fish species in the western basin of Lake Erie	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Since the introduction of white perch (Morone americana) into Lake Erie over 50 years ago, the population size of native yellow perch (Perca flavescens) has decreased up to 79 % and significant changes to the ecosystem have occurred. We examined long-term population estimates and used stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) paired with stomach content analysis to quantify the trophic ecology and niche overlap of adult yellow perch and white perch in the western basin of Lake Erie. We found that changes in yellow perch abundance since 1979 appeared to be better correlated with changes in fishery exploitation rates than with food competition effects from white perch. At the time of this study, yellow perch were found to have higher delta C-13 values, indicating greater utilization of benthic food resources than white perch, and white perch occupied higher trophic positions based on delta N-15. The diets of both species varied spatially and seasonally based on stable isotopes and stomach contents, likely driven by changes in prey abundance. Comparison of niche widths using stable isotope population metrics and Schoener diet similarity index suggested a low to moderate degree of niche overlap between species. Isotopic niches of white perch were generally larger than those of yellow perch demonstrating broader resource utilization by this non-indigenous species. We submit that isotopic niche overlap comparisons are more appropriate for studies seeking to understand interactions among populations over course temporal scales, while diet overlap indices, such as the Schoener index provide a means to study fine-scale interactions such as ontogenetic and seasonal diet shifts.

J	Jia, JJ; Gao, Y; Lu, Y; Shi, K; Li, ZX; Wang, SY				Jia, Junjie; Gao, Yang; Lu, Yao; Shi, Kun; Li, Zhaoxi; Wang, Shuoyue			Trace metal effects on gross primary productivity and its associative environmental risk assessment in a subtropical lake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The transport of trace metals in river-lake systems can potentially increase or decrease primary productivity in some basins and subsequently affect the carbon cycle of watersheds. In this study, we investigated a variety of trace metal concentrations and transport flux in the Poyang Lake basin during four seasons. Results show that the Gan River transports 78% of selenium (Se) and 42% of lead (Pb) into Poyang Lake each year, resulting in heavy metal pollution dominated by Pb and Se in 30%-75% of its water. Although toxic heavy metals, such as Pb, chromium (Cr), and copper (Cu), inhibit phytoplankton growth and decrease its gross primary productivity (GPP), excessive Se could effectually promote productivity. However, the negative effect of Pb on GPP is more significant than the positive effect of Se on GPP; hence, their interaction effectuates a decrease in total primary productivity. Additionally, under high nutrients level, the synergistic effect of heavy metals and nutrients will reduce GPP. Agricultural fertilizer is likely the source of both Pb, Cu, Se and N. Gan River contributes 35%-80% of the heavy metal inputs to Poyang Lake. It is therefore necessary to improve the ecological environment of phytoplankton and promote productivity in the Poyang Lake basin by reducing the application of agricultural chemical fertilizers to control pollution. Our results indicate that the role of certain, less studied trace elements (e.g., Pb, Cr, Cu, and Se) in regulating primary productivity of watershed ecosystems is more important than previously thought. This study also discusses potential impacting mechanisms associated with these metals on phytoplankton, whose biological functions need to be verified in future experiments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Rare earth elements in tributaries of Lake Baikal (Siberia, Russia)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												REE dissolved in waters from sixty five sampled tributaries of Lake Baikal show diversity in abundances (Sigma REE = 0.02-2.16 mu g/L) and distribution patterns ([La/Yb](N) = 0.20-5.58; [La/Tb](N) = 0.30-2.59). Total REE contents vary seasonally and yearly, while REE patterns remain generally similar. The REE patterns in stream waters correlate with those in the drained rocks and hence, seem to be predominantly controlled by watershed lithology. Rivers having small watersheds around Lake Baikal belong to six lithological provinces with different stream-water REE patterns: the Olkha plateau and the ranges of Primorsky, Baikalsky, Barguzin, Ulan-Burgassy, and Khamar-Daban. The Khamar-Daban province, in turn, is litho logically heterogeneous and comprises four subprovinces with different respective patterns of dissolved REE. Rock-water interaction in subsurface aquifers that feed the Baikal inlets provides much stronger lithological control of REE than the weak interaction of short and rapid streams with rocks on the surface. REE fractionation in stream waters show negative Ce anomalies in almost all samples (Ce-anom = 0.12 0.97), except for those of large rivers (Selenga, Turka, Barguzin, Upper Angara, and Kichera). The reason is that the great length, relatively slow current, and the presence of streambed fine alluvium make the water chemistry more uniform and the REE patterns less dependent on local variations in watershed lithology. The sampled tributaries represent a range of physico-chemical and geomorphological conditions which can be used as reference for calibrations in future studies of sediment sources and, possibly, as a valuable tool for mineral exploration.

Functional gene pyrosequencing reveals core proteobacterial denitrifiers in boreal lakes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Denitrification is an important microbial process in aquatic ecosystems that can reduce the effects of eutrophication. Here, quantification and pyrosequencing of nirS, nirK, and nosZ genes encoding for nitrite and nitrous oxide reductases was performed in sediment samples from four boreal lakes to determine the structure and seasonal stability of denitrifying microbial populations. Sediment quality and nitrate concentrations were linked to the quantity and diversity of denitrification genes, the abundance of denitrifying populations (nirS and nosZ genes) correlated with coupled nitrificationdenitrification (Dn), and the denitrification of the overlying water NO3- (Dw) correlated with the nirS/nirK ratio. The number of core nirS, nirK, and nosZ operational taxonomical units (OTUs) was low (6, 7, and 3, respectively), and most of these core OTUs were shared among the lakes. Dominant nirK sequences matched best with those of the order Rhizobiales, which was one of the main bacterial orders present in the sediment microbiomes, whereas the dominant nirS sequences were affiliated with the order Burkholderiales. Over half of the nosZ sequences belonged to a single OTU of the order Burkholderiales, but coupled nitrification-denitrification rate correlated with another dominant nosZ OTU assigned to the order Rhodospirillales. The study indicates that a few core proteobacterial clusters may drive denitrification in boreal lake sediments, as the same Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria denitrifier clusters were present in different lakes and seasons.					; Saarenheimo, Jatta/AAX-1560-2021	Saarenheimo, Jatta/0000-0002-2580-2830; Rissanen, Antti Juhani/0000-0002-5678-3361; Tiirola, Marja/0000-0001-5589-3748													1664-302X					JUL 1	2015	6								674	10.3389/fmicb.2015.00674	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00674								26191058					WOS:000357303700001

Development and application of a North American Great Lakes hydrometeorological database - Part I: Precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and air temperature	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Starting in 1983, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) has been developing and maintaining a historical time series of North American Great Lakes basin-scale monthly hydrometeorological data. This collection of data sets, which we hereafter refer to as the NOAA-GLERL monthly hydrometeorological database (GLM-HMD), is, to our knowledge, the first (and perhaps still the only) to assimilate hydrometeorological measurements into model simulations for each of the major components of the water budget across the entirety (i.e., both United States and Canadian portions) of the Great Lakes basin for a period of record dating back to the early and mid 1900s. Here, we describe the development of data sets in the first (GLM-HMD-I) of two subsets of the GLM-HMD including basin-scale estimates of over-lake and over-land precipitation and air temperature, runoff, and over-lake evaporation. Our synthesis of the GLM-HMD-I includes a summary of the monitoring network associated with each variable and an indication of how each monitoring network has changed overtime. We conclude with two representative applications of the GLM-HMD aimed at advancing understanding of seasonal and long-term changes in Great Lakes regional meteorology and climatology. These two examples implicitly reflect the historical utility of the GLM-HMD in numerous previous studies, and explicitly demonstrate its potential utility in ongoing and future regional hydrological science and climate change research.

Spatial statistical network models for stream and river temperature in New England, USA	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Watershed managers are challenged by the need for predictive temperature models with sufficient accuracy and geographic breadth for practical use. We described thermal regimes of New England rivers and streams based on a reduced set of metrics for the May-September growing season (July or August median temperature, diurnal rate of change, and magnitude and timing of growing season maximum) chosen through principal component analysis of 78 candidate metrics. We then developed and assessed spatial statistical models for each of these metrics, incorporating spatial autocorrelation based on both distance along the flow network and Euclidean distance between points. Calculation of spatial autocorrelation based on travel or retention time in place of network distance yielded tighter-fitting Torgegrams with less scatter but did not improve overall model prediction accuracy. We predicted monthly median July or August stream temperatures as a function of median air temperature, estimated urban heat island effect, shaded solar radiation, main channel slope, watershed storage (percent lake and wetland area), percent coarse-grained surficial deposits, and presence or maximum depth of a lake immediately upstream, with an overall root-mean-square prediction error of 1.4 and 1.5 degrees C, respectively. Growing season maximum water temperature varied as a function of air temperature, local channel slope, shaded August solar radiation, imperviousness, and watershed storage. Predictive models for July or August daily range, maximum daily rate of change, and timing of growing season maximum were statistically significant but explained a much lower proportion of variance than the above models (5-14% of total).																			0043-1397	1944-7973				AUG	2016	52	8					6018	6040		10.1002/2015WR018349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015WR018349													WOS:000383684400018

In streams and lakes, crayfish are an important component of freshwater ecosystems due to their habitat-modifying behaviour, substantial size, omnivorous feeding and often high abundance; however, their trophic role in reservoirs is not known. We evaluated the distribution and diet of noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) in the canyon-shaped, oligotrophic NATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTErsko reservoir in West Bohemia region, Czech Republic. Using stable isotope analysis, we quantified the trophic level of all major components of the reservoir food web and investigated seasonal isotopic variation and how the trophic role of noble crayfish varied with habitat and ontogeny. Crayfish were an important food source for both predatory and omnivorous fish and consumed food sources from multiple trophic levels, including detritus, algae, zoobenthos and other crayfish. Throughout ontogeny, crayfish had similar levels of carnivory, but cannibalism was more prevalent in adult crayfish, while juveniles and sub-adults fed more on other zoobenthos. Moreover, crayfish had high feeding plasticity in time, as the relative importance of dominant food sources varied with season. Their feeding plasticity was especially evident in crayfish populations from different habitats, which adapted their feeding strategy to local resources. In addition, pelagic source usage increased with the depth as detritus and algae usage decreased. Proportion of females increased with the depth, while population density showed a unimodal response to the depth gradient. These findings indicate that crayfish are indeed ecologically important species with both direct and indirect roles in the trophic web of this reservoir ecosystem.

However, because lakes are dynamic, results obtained from individual images acquired on a single date are not representative and do not accurately reflect ongoing changes. In this study, we used 8-day moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) composite data from 2000 to 2010 to map water surface changes over 629 lakes in China. We combined automatic extraction of training data and support vector machine classification to derive the spatial distribution of these large water bodies. The producer's and user's accuracies for MODIS images were 91.06 % and 89.81 %, respectively, when compared with interpretation results from 30 m resolution Landsat images taken on similar days. Area changes, variability, inundation intensity, and rainy seasons of the 629 lakes were analyzed based on this multi-temporal lake database. The total area of the 629 lakes increased over the study period, primarily as a result of the expansion of lake areas on the Tibetan Plateau. There were 12 lakes with a maximum area > 1,000 km(2), and six of these decreased in area from 2000 to 2010. The shrinkages of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake were -54.76 and -25.08 km(2)/a, respectively. The area of lakes on Tibetan Plateau, in northern Xinjiang, northeastern Inner Mongolia, and northeastern China varied little, while lakes on the Yangtze Plain, in southern Inner Mongolia, and central Xinjiang fluctuated considerably. Inundation intensity increased for lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, in northern Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Jilin, while inundation extent decreased in central Xinjiang, southern Tibet, southern Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and on the Yangtze Plain. This study is an attempt to develop high-frequency specific land cover maps to improve applicability of general land cover maps. The lake products serve as an important supplement to hydrologic data. The lake database enables the generation of new land surface process models, which could improve the precision of simulations, based on more accurate observations of dynamic lake systems.					dai, yongjiu/D-6261-2014; ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022; Dai, Yongjiu/D-6261-2014; Zhao, Yuanyuan/C-5890-2011; Gong, Peng/AAM-1516-2021	dai, yongjiu/0000-0002-3588-6644; Zhao, Yuanyuan/0000-0001-5447-2861; 													1001-6538	1861-9541				JAN	2014	59	2					171	189		10.1007/s11434-013-0045-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-013-0045-0													WOS:000329632300008
J	Li, XD; Zhang, ZY; Xie, Q; Wu, DY				Li, Xiaodi; Zhang, Zhiyong; Xie, Qiang; Wu, Deyi			Effect of algae on phosphorus immobilization by lanthanum-modified zeolite	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Phosphorus-inactivating agents (PTAs) as geoengineering tools in lakes have been investigated extensively, but PIA resuspension in the photic layer occurs frequently in shallow lakes and little is known about the influence of algae on PIA performance. Our results proved that algae increased the dissolved oxygen, pH and dissolved organic carbon concentration substantially. In the absence of sediment, lanthanum modified zeolite (LMZ) as a representative PIA and algae could deplete dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) from water but the former was faster than the latter. When LMZ and algae coexisted, the amount of phosphorus that was captured by LMZ was 3.1 times greater than that taken up by algae. An increase in pH or dissolved organic carbon increased the zero-equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC0) of the sediment but LMZ addition could lower the EPC0 and reduce the risk of phosphorus release during the algal blooming season. In the presence of sediment, LMZ reduced the DIP concentration more rapidly and yielded a lower final DIP concentration compared with algae. In conclusion, the influence of algae on the performance of LMZ by (i) taking up DIP to reduce the availability of DIP and convert DIP into a releasable phosphorus form and (ii) increasing the pH and dissolved organic carbon concentration to hinder the adsorption ability of DIP were recognized. The LMZ performed well, even in the presence of algae. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, SPOT-VGT imagery was used to monitor vegetation cover change in the Poyang Lake wetland. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) served as an indicator to reveal vegetation change of the wetland. Spatiotemporal trends of the NDVI time series and distribution of migratory birds in the wetland from 1999 to 2009 were investigated. Migratory birds were classified based on their feeding guilds. The correlation coefficients between a time series of NDVI and different types of migratory birds were obtained. Our results show: (1) The inter-annual NDVI shows an uneven yet increasing trend since 2000, with the average NDVI ranging between 0.17 and 0.64. Its seasonal change is roughly in line with the seasonal variability of natural vegetative growth in the area. (2) Both the number of species present and the population of migratory birds show an increasing trend, and avian biodiversity has greatly increased. In most years herbivorous birds dominated over other foraging guilds. (3) The correlation between NDVI variability and bird population, usually above 0.5 in typical reservation zones, differs in reservation zones and for foraging guilds of migratory birds. NDVI was significantly correlated with the population of herbivorous birds. (4) Land-use types can influence this correlation through its reflection of different NDVIs. Wetland is positively correlated with bird population of all species, while cropland is negatively correlated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the single and combined effects of MC-LR and nitrite on the reproductive endocrine system, a fully factorial experiment was designed and adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 9 treatment combinations of MC-LR (0, 3, 30 mu g/L.) and nitrite (0, 2, 20 mg/L) for 30 d. The results showed that both MC-LR and nitrite caused concentration-dependent effects including the growth inhibition, decreased gonad index as well as testicular injuries with widen intercellular spaces and seminiferous epithelium deteriorations. And testicular pathological changes in the co-exposure groups of MC-LR and nitrite were similar but more serious than those in single-factor exposure groups. Concurrently, exposure to MC-LR or nitrite alone could significantly decrease T levels by downregulating gene expressions (gnrh2, lh beta, ar, lhr) in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-liver-axis (HPGL-axis), and there were significant interactions between MC-LR and nitrite on them. In contrast, E2 levels as well as transcriptional levels of cypl9a1b, cypl9a1 a and vtgl showed significant inductions with increasing MC-LR concentrations, indicating an estrogen-like effect of MC-LR Our findings illustrated that co-exposure of MC-LR and nitrite synergistically cause reproductive dysfunction by interfering with the HPGL axis in male fish, which prompt us to focus more on the potential risks in fish reproduction and even population dynamics due to the wide occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms.

J	Yang, YY; Chen, JF; Li, BQ; Liu, Y; Xie, SG				Yang, Yuyin; Chen, Jianfei; Li, Baoqin; Liu, Yong; Xie, Shuguang			Anaerobic methane oxidation potential and bacteria in freshwater lakes: Seasonal changes and the influence of trophic status	SYSTEMATIC AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo), mainly carried out by n-damo bacteria, is an important pathway for mitigating methane emission from freshwater lakes. Although n-damo bacteria have been detected in a variety of freshwater lakes, their potential and distribution, and associated environmental factors, remain unclear. Therefore, the current study investigated the potential and distribution of anaerobic methanotrophs in sediments from Erhai Lake and Dianchi Lake, two adjacent freshwater lakes in the Yunnan Plateau with different trophic status. Both lakes showed active anaerobic methane oxidation potential and harbored a high density of n-damo bacteria. Based on the n-damo pmoA gene, sediment n-damo bacterial communities mainly consisted of Candidatus Methylomirabils oxyfera and Candidatus Methylomirabils sinica, as well as novel n-damo organisms. Sediment anaerobic methane oxidation potential and the n-damo bacterial community showed notable differences among seasons and between lakes. The environmental variables associated with lake trophic status (e.g. total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and total organic carbon) might have significant impacts on the anaerobic methane oxidation potential, as well as the abundance and community structure of n-damo bacteria. Therefore, trophic status could determine the n-damo process in freshwater lake sediment. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Yu, H; Wu, Y; Zhang, J; Deng, B; Zhu, ZY				Yu, Hao; Wu, Ying; Zhang, Jing; Deng, Bing; Zhu, Zhuoyi			Impact of extreme drought and the Three Gorges Dam on transport of particulate terrestrial organic carbon in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												To investigate the impact of extreme drought and the Three Gorges Dam on organic carbon (OC) exported by the Changjiang (Yangtze) River, suspended particulate matter samples collected in 2003 (normal year) and 2006 (drought year) from the middle and lower reaches of the mainstream of the river were analyzed for elemental carbon, stable carbon isotope, and lignin-phenol yields. In comparison with suspended particulate matter samples collected in 2003, the 2006 samples showed elevated organic carbon content [OC%: (1.91 +/- 0.43)% and (0.95 +/- 0.07)% respectively in 2006 and 2003], higher autochthonous OC [Chl-a/OC: (20.68 +/- 9.03) mg/g OC and (7.33 +/- 2.97) mg/g OC in 2006 and 2003], decreased lignin yields [L8: (0.90 +/- 0.41) mg/100 mg OC and (1.91 +/- 0.33) mg/100 mg OC in 2006 and 2003], and higher degradation state [(Ad/Al)v: 0.44 +/- 0.21 and 0.27 +/- 0.028 in 2006 and 2003]. These differences may be explained by changes in grain composition and concentration of the suspended particulate matter, which were caused by the lower water discharge and sediment load in 2006. Extreme drought and impoundment of water by the Three Gorges Dam not only affected the signatures and fluxes of terrestrial OC, but hid the seasonal signal of riverine OC. The impact of the Three Gorges Dam was more significant in the middle reach than in the lower reach. Lakes and tributaries in the lower Changjiang River supplied great amounts of terrestrial OC to the mainstream. In the drought year, the supplement of water provided by the lower lakes and tributaries was more significant. The absolute magnitude of reduction of terrestrial OC in the Changjiang River during drought and Three Gorges Dam influence (2006) would have severely affected the local carbon cycle and would have influenced the global carbon cycle to some extent.					; Yu, Hao/HHC-7986-2022; Zhu, Zhuoyi/HNS-4424-2023; Deng, Bing/F-7623-2014	Zhang, Jing/0009-0004-6810-5746; Zhu, Zhuo-Yi/0000-0002-0276-2418; Yu, Hao/0000-0001-6078-7552													2169-9003	2169-9011				DEC 17	2011	116								F04029	10.1029/2011JF002012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JF002012													WOS:000298252000001

In this study, we developed a spatial response analysis method that couples wavelet correlation analysis (WTC) with self-organizing maps (SOM), revealing the spatial response and variation of water level and water quality in Poyang Lake, China's largest river-connected lake, over the past decade. The results show that: (1) there was significant spatial heterogeneity in water level and quality during the dry seasons (2010-2018) compared to other hydrological stages. (2) We identified a more pronounced difference in response of water level and quality between northern and southern parts of Poyang Lake. As the distance increases from the northern lake outlet, the impact of rising water levels on water quality deterioration intensified during the dry seasons. (3) The complex spatial heterogeneity of water level and quality response in the dry seasons is primarily influenced by water level fluctuations from the northern region and the cumulative pollutant entering the lake from the south, which particularly leads to the reversal of the response in the central area of Poyang Lake. The results of this study can contribute to scientific decision-making regarding water environment zoning management in large river-connected lakes amidst complex environment conditions.					; Song, Jinxi/AAF-6060-2020; Dou, Jinghui/MFJ-5096-2025; liu, xiaoyu/AAN-9919-2021	Liu, Xiaoyu/0009-0008-4859-5951; 													2045-2322					APR 10	2024	14	1							8373	10.1038/s41598-024-59129-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-59129-w								38600262					WOS:001200298900006
J	Xiao, WX; Hui, FM; Cheng, X; Liang, Q				Xiao, Wanxin; Hui, Fengming; Cheng, Xiao; Liang, Qi			An automated algorithm to retrieve the location and depth of supraglacial lakes from ICESat-2 ATL03 data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Supraglacial lakes are widespread on the surface of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and Greenland Ice Sheet due to global warming. Estimating the location and depth of supraglacial lakes is critical for evaluating the impact of surface meltwater on ice dynamics. The accuracy of traditional image-based methods is limited, especially when supraglacial lakes are deep. Recently, Ice, Clouds, and land Elevation Satellite-2 data have been used to develop algorithms to measure the depth of supraglacial lakes. The ICESat-2-based methods are currently either semi automated or sensitive to noise, which makes them less efficient and less accurate in detecting supraglacial lakes. In this study, we develop an automated algorithm for the retrieval of the location and depth of supraglacial lakes using ICESat-2 ATL03 data. We investigated 10 supraglacial lakes as case studies over Antarctica and Greenland (4 lakes on the Amery Ice Shelf, Antarctica and 6 lakes in southwestern Greenland). The results show that our algorithm can detect supraglacial lakes at depths up to 8.25 m. The RMSE for the lake depth retrievals in Antarctica is approximately 0.30 m and that of the lakes in Greenland is approximately 0.32 m. Our algorithm reveals high robustness and accuracy, especially in shallow areas. Additionally, the fully automated algorithm does not require prior knowledge and guarantees efficiency when there is an extensive study area. This result implies that our algorithm has the potential to address large amounts of data and may even be useful to estimate meltwater volumes across the surface of the entire ice sheet.

Comparison of the FilmArray Respiratory Panel and Prodesse Real-Time PCR Assays for Detection of Respiratory Pathogens	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY												We compared the diagnostic performance and overall respiratory pathogen detection rate of the premarket version of the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) multiplex PCR assay (Idaho Technology, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) with those of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared Prodesse ProFlu+, ProFAST+, ProParaflu+, Pro hMPV+, and ProAdeno+ real-time PCR assays (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA). The assays were performed on a panel of 192 nasopharyngeal-secretion specimens collected from 81 children under 1 year of age with upper respiratory tract symptoms. To resolve discordant results and confirm pathogens detected only by the larger FilmArray panel, we performed laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays. Among viruses detectable by both commercial assays (adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, and respiratory syncytial virus), the FilmArray and Prodesse assays showed good overall agreement (181/192 [94.3%]; kappa = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.94). FilmArray RP detected more parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 than ProParaflu+ (18 versus 13) while ProAdeno+ detected more adenoviruses (11 versus 6), but these differences were not statistically significant. Additionally, FilmArray RP detected 138 pathogens (confirmed as true positives) not included in the Prodesse assays (rhinovirus [RV]/enterovirus [EV], 118; bocavirus, 8; coronavirus, 7; parainfluenza virus 4, 4; Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 1). FilmArray RP was cleared by the FDA following the completion of this study. The FDA-cleared version includes the following targets: adenovirus, coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza A virus (to type level only), influenza A H1 seasonal virus, influenza A H3 seasonal virus, influenza A virus H1-2009, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and RV/EV (no differentiation). The larger panel in the FilmArray RP assay allowed the detection of additional respiratory pathogens compared to the Prodesse assays. In this population of young children with upper respiratory tract infection, RV/EV accounted for the majority of the additional pathogens detected by FilmArray RP.

J	Chalov, S; Prokopeva, K; Habel, M				Chalov, Sergey; Prokopeva, Kristina; Habel, Michal			North to South Variations in the Suspended Sediment Transport Budget within Large Siberian River Deltas Revealed by Remote Sensing Data	REMOTE SENSING												This study presents detailed suspended sediment budget for the four Siberian river deltas, representing contrasting conditions between Northern and Southern environments. Two of the studied rivers empty their water and sediments into the marine located in the permafrost zone in the Arctic region (Lena and Kolyma), and the other two (Selenga and Upper Angara) flow into Lake Baikal located in the steppe and forest-steppe zone of Southern Siberia. For the first time, these poorly monitored areas are analyzed in terms of the long-term and seasonal changes of spatial patterns of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) over distributaries systems. Remote sensing reflectance is derived from continuous time series of Landsat images and calibrated with the onsite field measurements of SSC. Seasonal variability of suspended sediment changes over deltas was captured for the period from 1989 to 2020. We identify significant variability in the sedimentation processes between different deltas, which is explained by particularities of deltas networks and geomorphology and the existence of specific drivers-continuous permafrost impact in the North and abundant aquatic vegetation and wetland-dominated areas in the South. The study emphasizes that differences exist between Northern and Southern deltas regarding suspended sediments transport conditions. Mostly retention of suspended sediment is observed for Southern deltas due to sediment storage at submerged banks and marshlands located in the backwater zone of the delta during high discharges. In the Northern (arctic) deltas due to permafrost impacts (melting of the permafrost), the absence of sub-aquatic banks and river to ocean interactions of suspended sediment transport is mostly increased downwards, predominantly under higher discharges and along main distributary channels. These results shine light on the geochemical functions of the deltas and patterns of sequestering various metals bound to river sediments.

Seven simple, flexible, and efficient parameterization schemes originating from the WAVEWATCH III (R) IC4 were used to quantify the wave energy loss during wave propagation under ice. The reductions of wind energy input and wave energy dissipation via whitecapping and breaking due to presence of ice were also implemented (i.e., blocking effect). The model showed satisfactory performance when validated by buoy-observed significant wave height in ice-free season at eight stations and satellite-retrieved ice concentration. The simulation ran over the basin-scale, five-lake computational grid provided a whole map of ice-induced wave attenuation in the heavy-ice year 2014, suggesting that except Lake Ontario and central Lake Michigan, lake ice almost completely inhibited waves in the Great Lakes under heavy-ice condition. A practical application of the model in February 2011 revealed that the model could accurately reproduce the ice-attenuated waves when validated by wave observations from bottom-moored acoustic wave and current profiler (AWAC); moreover, the AWAC wave data showed quick responses between waves and ice, suggesting a sensitive relationship between waves and ice and arguing that accurate ice modeling was necessary for quantifying wave-ice interaction.

In this paper, we present an extended record (dry seasons 1988-2016) of the total surface water area of the lake (including both open water and flooded vegetation) derived using Land Surface Temperature (LST) data (dry seasons 2000-2016) from the NASA Terra MODIS sensor and EUMETSAT Meteosat-based LST measurements (dry seasons 1988-2001) from an earlier study. We also examine the total surface water area for Lake Chad using radar data (dry seasons 2015-2016) from the ESA Sentinel-1a mission. For the limited number of radar data sets available to us (18 data sets), we find on average a close match between the estimates from these data and the corresponding estimates from LST, though we find spatial differences in the estimates using the two types of data. We use these spatial differences to adjust the record (dry seasons 2000-2016) from MODIS LST. Then we use the adjusted record to remove the bias of the existing LST record (dry seasons 1988-2001) derived from Meteosat measurements and combine the two records. From this composite, extended record, we plot the total surface water area of the lake for the dry seasons of 1988-1989 through 2016-2017. We find for the dry seasons of 1988-1989 to 2016-2017 that the maximum total surface water area of the lake was approximately 16,800 sq. km (February and May, 2000), the minimum total surface water area of the lake was approximately 6400 sq. km (November, 1990), and the average was approximately 12,700 sq. km. Further, we find the total surface water area of the lake to be highly variable during this period, with an average rate of increase of approximately 143 km(2) per year.

There is no clear scientific evidence on the effects of human activities and climate variability on runoff and its components in typical arid areas. Therefore, in this study, a heuristic segmentation algorithm, a variable infiltration capacity model (VIC), and remote sensing data to quantify the effects of human activities and climate variability on runoff in the catchment of Lake Ebinur, Xinjiang, China. The results found: (1) The heuristic segmentation algorithm divided the study period into reference period (1964-1985) and two impact periods: I (1986-2000) and II (2001-2017). (2) Cropland and forest land showed an increasing trend, with grassland and barren land accounting for most of the increase. At the same time, the leaf area index (LAI) increased by 0.002 per year during the growing season. (3) Compared with the reference period, runoff depth decreased by 108.80 mm in impact period I due to human activities, but increased by 110.5 mm due to climate variability, resulting in an overall increase in runoff depth of 1.72 mm. Runoff depth increased by 11.10 mm in the impact period II compared to the reference period, with climate variability resulting in an increase of 154.40 mm, but human activities resulted in a decrease of 143.30 mm. Our results shed light on decision-making related to water stress in changing circumstances in arid regions.					qingling, bao/GPW-9450-2022	Han, Lijing/0000-0002-8222-2664													1932-6203					SEP 1	2022	17	9							e0272576	10.1371/journal.pone.0272576	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272576								36048872					WOS:000892263300029

To identify the main causes of harmful algal blooming and continuous water quality decline, the total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), pH, and turbidity in hypereutrophic Lake Qilu from January 2017 to December 2021 were analyzed. The results showed a complex pattern in spatiotemporal distribution and variation. WT showed no significant change in the vertical profile. DO and pH value variations were caused by both physical and biochemical processes, especially at the bottom of Lake QL with an anaerobic environment. The Trophic State Index (TSI) assessment results showed that Lake QL is a eutrophic (70.14% of all samples, 50 < TSI < 70) to a hypereutrophic lake (29.86%, 70 < TSI) with poor water quality (WQI < 25). TP and WT were the main factors controlling harmful algal blooms (HABs) based on the statistical analysis of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Random Forest Model (RFM), and Correlation Analysis (CA). In lake QL, TP loading reduction and water level increase might be the key strategies for treating HABs in the future. Based on our results, reducing TP loading may be more effective than reducing TN to prevent HABs in the highly eutrophicated Lake Qilu.

The experimental site is part of a larger experimental platform (San Niccol, Pisa) located within the Massaciuccoli Lake Basin in Central Italy (Tuscany, IT). The study also took into account the double cut strategy by evaluating the regrowth from June to September. Biomethane potentials ranged from 384 to 315 and from 412 to 283 NL CH4 kg VS-1 (normal liters of methane per kg of volatile solids) for leaves and stems, respectively. About digestion kinetics, maximum daily production rate (R (max)) was significantly affected by harvest time and not by plant partitioning. Along the harvest season, biomethane yield per unit area was mostly driven by the biomass yield showing an increasing trend from May (1659 Nm(3) ha(-1)) to September (3817 Nm(3) ha(-1)). The highest value was obtained with the double harvest option (4383 Nm(3) ha(-1)), although it was not statistically different from the single harvest carried out in September. Owing to its remarkably lower yields, P. australis cannot be considered along the same lines as crops conventionally used for biogas production, but it may represent an interesting option for paludiculture cropping systems by coupling peatland restoration with bioenergy production. September harvest management seemed the most feasible option, although further investigation on crop lifespan is needed.					; Dragoni, Federico/W-6943-2019; Giannini, Vittoria/AAB-7015-2019	Dragoni, Federico/0000-0002-0680-104X; GIANNINI, Vittoria/0000-0003-2314-6769; RAGAGLINI, GIORGIO/0000-0003-4072-089X													1939-1234	1939-1242				DEC	2017	10	4					1066	1078		10.1007/s12155-017-9866-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-017-9866-z													WOS:000414509500011

This study assessed the spatial and temporal differences in nitrate loads within the Sesan, Srepok, and Sekong (3S) Rivers, the largest tributaries of the Mekong River. Simulation results from a flow and nitrate calibrated SWAT model show large differences in year-to-year nitrate loads, a strong seasonality, and clear variability patterns in monthly nitrate loads in the 3S outlet during the wet season. The annual total nitrate loading from the 3S Rivers account for approximately 30% of the total nitrate load of the Mekong River at Pakse. Nitrate loads during the rainy season accounts for 79% of the total annual load into the Mekong River. The Sesan, Sekong, and Srepok basins have average nitrate yields of 400, 330, and 290 kg N/km(2), respectively, which is comparable with other forested catchments, but much lower than agriculture dominated catchments in the tropics. Simulations of three future climate scenarios show little variability in annual nitrate loadings under current land use/land cover (LULC), but seasonal difference in nitrate loading during rainy months was observed. Further research is needed to estimate nitrate loads in the 3S basin as influenced by LULC change and dam development, which may potentially result in complex changes to local and downstream riverine ecosystems.

Information is lacking about mercury methylation (K-m) and demethylation (K-d) rates in periphytic biofilms from the Northern Hemisphere, as well as about the drivers of net MeHg production, hampering ecosystem modeling of Hg cycling. Mercury methylation and demethylation rates were measured in periphytic biofilms growing on submerged plants in a shallow fluvial lake located in a temperate cold region (St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada). Incubations were performed in situ within macrophyte beds using low-level spikes of (HgO)-Hg-199 and (MeHg)-Hg-200 stable isotopes as tracers. A direct relationship was observed between Km (0.002 to 0.137 d(-1)) and [MeHg] in periphyton. A similar relationship was found between K-d (0.096 to 0334 d(-1)) and [inorganic Hg]. Periphyton of Lake St. Pierre reached high levels of net MeHg production that were two orders of magnitude higher than those found in local sediment. This production varied through the plant growing season and was mainly driven by environmental variables such as depth of growth, available light, dissolved oxygen, temperature, plant community structure, and productivity of the habitat.

Increase in the rate and uniformity of coastline erosion in Arctic Alaska	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Analysis of a 60 km segment of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast using a time-series of aerial photography revealed that mean annual erosion rates increased from 6.8 m a(-1) ( 1955 to 1979), to 8.7 m a(-1) ( 1979 to 2002), to 13.6 m a(-1) ( 2002 to 2007). We also observed that spatial patterns of erosion have become more uniform across shoreline types with different degrees of ice-richness. Further, during the remainder of the 2007 ice-free season 25 m of erosion occurred locally, in the absence of a westerly storm event. Concurrent arctic changes potentially responsible for this shift in the rate and pattern of land loss include declining sea ice extent, increasing summertime sea surface temperature, rising sea-level, and increases in storm power and corresponding wave action. Taken together, these factors may be leading to a new regime of ocean-land interactions that are repositioning and reshaping the Arctic coastline. Citation: Jones, B. M., C. D. Arp, M. T.

J	Ni, RJ; Wang, YQ; Lei, Y; Song, LY				Ni, Renjie; Wang, Yangqing; Lei, Yu; Song, Liyan			Response of denitrification microbiome to the nitrogen flux in three Gorges reservoir (TGR) sediments during two seasonal water fluctuation events	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) water fluctuation creates high water level (HWL) and low water level (LWL) condition in TGR aquatic ecosystem. HWL fluies significant nutrients, mainly introducing carbon and nitrogen into the ecosystem. The nitrogen input is a concern for water quality management of TGR since the possible eutrophication caused by nitrogen spike. Sediment denitrification is widely recognized as the dominant nitrogen removal process in freshwater ecosystem. Therefore, the response of TGR sediments microbiome to the input nitrogen flucatution is crucial for both nitrogen balance and the eutrophication status of the ecosystem. Using high throughout sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and the predicted denitrification enzyme, and qualitative PCR of denitrification functional genes, we investigated how TGR sediments denitrification microbiome respond to the input nitrogen flux during two seasonal water fluctuation events. Concomitant to expected input carbon and nitrogen, we observed distinct microbial community structure and denitrification microbiota in HWL and LWL, and also in seasonal sampling events. Sediments pH, total nitrogen and nitrate were the significant impact factors in shaping the microbial community structure. Important denitrification microbiota (e.g., Saprospiraceae, Gemmatimonadaceae, Pseudomonas) are the main taxa of the microbial community and also showed water level and seasonal variation. The relative abundance of denitrification enzyme (nar, nir, nor, nos) and function genes (nirS, nirK, nosZ) were higher in LWL than HWL. Denitrification enzyme were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the nitrate concentration. In addition, the relative abundance of denitrification enzyme and function genes increased during the transition from 2014 HWL to 2015 LWL. Results suggested that TGR sediments denitrification is nitrate concentration dependent. The denitrification microbiome is initially inhibited due to high nitrate input, then they developed denitrification ability in response to high nitrate concentration.

Impacts of upwind wildfire emissions on CO, CO2, and PM2.5 concentrations in Salt Lake City, Utah	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Biomass burning is known to contribute large quantities of CO2, CO, and PM2.5 to the atmosphere. Biomass burning not only affects the area in the vicinity of fire but may also impact the air quality far downwind from the fire. The 2007 and 2012 western U.S. wildfire seasons were characterized by significant wildfire activity across much of the Intermountain West and California. In this study, we determined the locations of wildfire-derived emissions and their aggregate impacts on Salt Lake City, a major urban center downwind of the fires. To determine the influences of biomass burning emissions, we initiated an ensemble of stochastic back trajectories at the Salt Lake City receptor within the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, driven by wind fields from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The trajectories were combined with a new, high-resolution biomass burning emissions inventorythe Wildfire Emissions Inventory. Initial results showed that the WRF-STILT model was able to replicate many periods of enhanced wildfire activity observed in the measurements. Most of the contributions for the 2007 and 2012 wildfire seasons originated from fires located in Utah and central Idaho. The model results suggested that during intense episodes of upwind wildfires in 2007 and 2012, fires contributed as much as 250ppb of CO during a 3 h period and 15 mu g/m(3) of PM2.5 averaged over 24 h at Salt Lake City. Wildfires had a much smaller impact on CO2 concentrations in Salt Lake City, with contributions rarely exceeding 2ppm enhancements.

Our data reveal seasonal upglacier expansion and increase in hydraulic efficiency of the subglacial drainage system, across a catchment >600 km(2), to distances >50 km from the ice-sheet margin. This expansion occurs episodically in response to the drainage of surface meltwaters into a hitherto inefficient subglacial drainage system as new input locations become active progressively further upglacier; this system is similar to Alpine glaciers. These observations provide the first synopsis of seasonal hydrological behaviour in the ablation zone of the GrIS. Citation: Bartholomew, I., P. Nienow, A. Sole, D. Mair, T. Cowton, S. Palmer, and J.

While there are indications that tropical lakes and reservoirs emit 58-400% more CH4 per unit area than similar environments in boreal and temperate biomes, direct measurements of tropical lake emissions are scarce. We measured CH4 emissions from 16 natural shallow lakes in the Pantanal region of South America, one of the world's largest tropical wetland areas, during the low water period using floating flux chambers. Measured fluxes ranged from 3.9 to 74.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1) with the average from all studied lakes being 8.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (131.8 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), of which ebullition accounted for 91% of the flux (28-98% on individual lakes). Diel cycling of emission rates was observed and therefore 24-h long measurements are recommended rather than short-term measurements not accounting for the full diel cycle. Methane emission variability within a lake may be equal to or more important than between lake variability in floodplain areas as this study identified diverse habitats within lakes having widely different flux rates. Future measurements with static floating chambers should be based on many individual chambers distributed in the various subenvironments of a lake that may differ in emissions in order to account for the within lake variability.					; Prast, Alex/AAL-4722-2021; Santoro, Ana/KPB-7353-2024; Queiroz Pinho, Luana/MAH-8560-2025; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021; Marotta, Humberto/F-9554-2012	Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Queiroz Pinho, Luana/0000-0002-7116-2221; Crill, Patrick/0000-0003-1110-3059; Marotta, Humberto/0000-0002-2828-6595													0013-936X					JUL 15	2010	44	14					5450	5455		10.1021/es1005048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es1005048								20568738					WOS:000279747100025

Diagenetic processes, affecting bones from the body deposition to the discovery, strongly depend on environmental conditions; therefore the study of diagenetic alterations provides valuable information on the taphonomic history of bones and on their burial environment. Histological analysis was performed on 58 samples of human compact bone found at Al Khiday (Khartoum, Sudan), a multi-stratified archaeological site that revealed a cemetery with distinct burial phases dating from the Early Holocene to the II century AD. The well-defined archaeological context provides a set of bone samples belonging to the same site but buried in different phases and under different environmental conditions: Central Sudan was characterised by a humid environment with seasonal swamps and palaeo-lakes in the Early Holocene, while in the II century AD the environmental conditions were more similar to the current arid climate of the Sub-Saharan belt. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution X-ray computed micro-tomography (mu t-CT) analysis revealed extensive bacterial and fungal attack, and secondary phases precipitation and dissolution in the samples. The analysis of textural relationships between each diagenetic feature enabled to establish a relative chronological sequence of events acting during burial. Moreover, different patterns of diagenetic alterations were observed for burial phases of different ages, proving a strong relationship between diagenesis and environmental conditions.

FRESHWATER SCIENCE												The ecological effects of invading adult zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis, respectively) are well-documented worldwide, but the ecology and fate of their veliger larvae are poorly understood. We addressed potential errors encountered when estimating veliger biomass. Faced with uncertainty surrounding an established length-mass relationship for veligers, we developed a new dry mass relationship that works for both fresh and formalin-preserved animals. We used this new equation to estimate that veliger dry biomass averaged 74 +/- 0.6% of the values obtained from the established equation. Therefore, researchers who assumed the established equation yielded wet mass and applied correction factors of 10 to 50% would have underestimated biomass. Use of coarse-mesh nets also leads to underestimates of biomass. We found that 153-mu m-mesh nets captured only 3 to 27% of individuals, or 10 to 66% of veliger biomass captured in 64-mu m-mesh nets. We also examined temporal trends, seasonality, and relative contribution of veliger larvae to total zooplankton biomass at several Laurentian Great Lake long-term monitoring sites in Ontario, Canada. Based on the new equation, veliger biomass generally increased from 2008 to 2014, with May to October means of 1 to 27 mg/m(3) in Lake Ontario, Georgian Bay, and Lake Erie, or up to 39% of total zooplankton biomass. Veligers were present for most of the sampling season, but abundance peaked in August and September. In contrast, crustacean biomass has declined markedly in Lake Ontario since the 1990s. Given their dominance across many sites, accurate depiction of veliger dry mass may partially offset the observed losses in crustacean biomass to the pelagic food web following P control and the dreissenid invasion of the Great Lakes.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN	2018	37	2					315	329		10.1086/697896	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/697896													WOS:000432253900011

Shylesh; Mohan, Mahesh			Total and methyl mercury in the water, sediment, and fishes of Vembanad, a tropical backwater system in India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Mercury contamination in the water bodies of developing countries is a serious concern due to its toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation. Vembanad, a tropical backwater lake situated at the southwest coast of India, is the largest Ramsar site in southern India. The lake supports thousands of people directly and indirectly through its resources and ecosystem services. It is highly polluted with toxic pollutants such as heavy metals, as it receives effluent discharges from Kerala's major industrial zone. In the present study, water, pore water, sediment, and fish samples collected from Vembanad Lake were analysed for total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MHg) contents. The maximum concentrations of THg and MHg in surface water samples were 31.8 and 0.21 ng/L, respectively, and those in bottom water samples were 206 and 1.22 ng/L, respectively. Maximum concentration of THg in surface sediment was observed during monsoon season ( 2850 ng/g) followed by that in the premonsoon season ( 2730 ng/g) and the post-monsoon season ( 2140 ng/g). The highest sediment concentration of MHg ( 202.02 ng/g) was obtained during monsoon season. The spatial variation in the mercury contamination clearly indicates that the industrial discharge into the Periyar River is a major reason for pollution in the lake. The mercury pollution was found to be much higher in Vembanad Lake than in other wetlands in India. The bioaccumulation was high in carnivorous fishes, followed by benthic carnivores. The THg limit in fish for human consumption ( 0.5 mg/kg dry wt.) was exceeded for all fish species, except for Glossogobius guiris and Synaptura orientalis. The concentration of THg was five times higher in Megalops cyprinoides and four times higher in Gazza minuta. Significant variation was observed among species with different habits and habitats. Overall, risk assessment factors showed that the mercury levels in the edible fishes of Vembanad Lake can pose serious health impacts to the human population.

Phytoplankton biomass is mainly controlled by hydrology and phosphorus concentrations in tropical hydroelectric reservoirs	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Phytoplankton is widely recognized as being regulated mainly by resources (nutrients and light) and predation by higher trophic levels. In reservoirs, these controls also can be modulated by hydrology, for example through the influence of flow pulses generated by the operation of the dam. In this study, we tested the influence of light, nutrients, and zooplankton grazing pressure, and also hydrology (as water residence time) on the phytoplankton biomass in eight tropical hydroelectric reservoirs, which differ in size, morphometry, location, trophic state, and water residence time. Our hypothesis was that, as these reservoirs are used for hydroelectric purposes, the control that would otherwise be exerted on phytoplankton biomass primarily by resource availability and grazing will also be modulated by hydrology. Low phytoplankton biomass (range of system medians = 12-299 mu g C l(-1)) occurred in most systems, except for one highly eutrophic reservoir (median = 1331 mu g C l(-1)). Our data showed that phosphorus was more often likely to be the limiting nutrient in these systems, as assessed through nutrient limitation indexes (nitrogen and phosphorus), based on concentrations and ratios. For most reservoirs, excluding the eutrophic system with high cyanobacteria biomass, seasonal water residence time was the variable that best explained phytoplankton variation among the several environmental variables analyzed in this study (P < 0.0001; adjusted r (2) = 0.38). Hydrology was an important and additional factor modulating phytoplankton in these tropical reservoirs, directly removing phytoplankton populations and their potential zooplankton grazers by washout, and also affecting nutrient availability.

Here, we characterized variations in microbial communities and physicochemical factors at two sites in a large subtropical drinking water reservoir in southern China. The microbiomes of all sites, including the diversity and abundance of microbial species, were determined via metagenomics, and the relationships between microbiomes and physicochemical factors were determined via redundancy analysis. The dominant species in sediment and water samples differed; Dinobryon sp. LO226KS and Dinobryon divergens were dominant in sediment samples, whereas Candidatus Fonsibacter ubiquis and Microcystis elabens were dominant in water. The diversity was also significantly different in microbial alpha diversity between water and sediment habitats (p < 0.01). The trophic level index (TLI) was the major factor affecting the microbial community in water samples; Mycolicibacterium litorale and Mycolicibacterium phlei were significantly positively related to TLI. Furthermore, we also studied the distribution of algal toxin-encoding genes and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in the reservoir. It found that water samples contained more phycotoxin genes, with the cylindrospermopsin gene cluster most abundant. We found three genera highly related to cylindrospermopsin and explored a new cyanobacteria Aphanocapsa montana that may produce cylindrospermopsin based on the correlation through network analysis. The multidrug resistance gene was the most abundant ARG, while the relationship between ARGs and bacteria in sediment samples was more complicated than in water. The results of this study enhance our understanding of the effects of environmental factors on microbiomes. In conclusion, research on the properties, including profiles of algal toxin-encoding genes and ARGs, and microbial communities can aid water quality monitoring and conservation.					zixin, xie/HSE-1227-2023; Zhang, Xin/AAB-9359-2020; Luo, Mingjie/LVS-3830-2024; zhao, xiaochao/GTO-3083-2022	Zhang, Xin/0000-0002-1460-3676; 														1664-302X				FEB 14	2023	14								1091818	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1091818	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1091818								36865780					WOS:000939752500001

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												yy Lakes actively transform nitrogen (N) and emit disproportionately large amounts of N2O relative to their surface area. Studies have investigated the relative importance of denitrification or nitrification on N2O emissions; however, the linkage between N2O efflux and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and carbon (DOC) remains largely unknown. Long-term (2012-2017) seasonal field observations and a series of degradation experiments were used to unravel how DON composition impacts N2O emissions from Lake Taihu, China. In the northwestern part of the lake, large riverine inflow and high N2O emissions occur in all seasons (24.6 +/- 25.2 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)), coincident with high levels of terrestrial DON and DOC here. The degradation of labile DON and DOC likely enhanced ammonification as supported by the correlations between NH4+-N and DON, DOC, a(350), and terrestrial humic-like C3. The area with large riverine inputs in the northwestern part of the lake was characterized by low DOwhichmay enhance incomplete aerobic nitrification and incomplete denitrification, both leading to N2O production. Twenty days laboratory experiments indicated greater N2O production in the northwest inflow samples (N2O on day 20: 120.9 nmol L-1 and 17.3 nmol L-1 for bio- and photo-degradation samples, respectively) compared with the central lake samples (N2O on day 20: 20.3 nmol L-1 and 12.3 nmol L-1 for bio- and photodegradation samples, respectively), despite both having low Chl-a. Our DON and DOC degradation experiments confirmed the occurrence of ammonification along with consumption of NH4+-N and thereafter NO3--N. Our results collectively suggest that terrestrial DON fueled ammonification, enhanced nitrification and incomplete denitrification, and thereby became an important contributor to the N2O efflux from Lake Taihu.

J	Pelechaty, M; Pukacz, A; Apolinarska, K; Pelechata, A; Siepak, M				Pelechaty, Mariusz; Pukacz, Andrzej; Apolinarska, Karina; Pelechata, Aleksandra; Siepak, Marcin			The significance of Chara vegetation in the precipitation of lacustrine calcium carbonate	SEDIMENTOLOGY												A significant portion of calcium carbonate is deposited in lake sediments as a result of biological processes related to the photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton in the pelagic realm and, in addition, macrophytes in the littoral zone. Lake Wigry, one of the largest lakes in Poland (north-east Poland), is characterized by: (i) carbonate sediments with a CaCO3 content exceeding 80% within the littoral zone; and (ii) large areas of submerged vegetation dominated by charophytes (macroscopic green algae, Characeae family). It is claimed that charophytes are highly effective in utilizing HCO3- and forming thick CaCO3 encrustations. Thus, this study was aimed at evaluating the CaCO3 production by dense Chara stands overgrowing the lake bottom reaching a depth of 4m. In late July 2009, the fresh and dry mass of plants, the percentage contribution of calcium carbonate and the production of CaCO3 per 1m2 were investigated along three transects at three depths (1 m, 2 m and 3m, with each sample area equal to 0 center dot 0625 m(2)) per transect. The composition and structure of phytoplankton and the physico-chemical properties of the water analysed in both the littoral and pelagic zones served as the environmental background and demonstrated moderately low fertility in the lake. The greatest dry plant mass exceeded 1000gm2 and CaCO3 encrustations constituted from 59% to over 76% of the charophyte dry weight. Thus, the maximum and average values of carbonates precipitated by charophytes were 685 center dot 5 and 438 gm(-2), respectively, which exceeded previously reported results. A correlation of carbonate production with the depth of Chara stands was detected, and intermediate depths offered the most favourable conditions for carbonate precipitation (589gm(-2) on average). As precipitated carbonates are ultimately stored in bottom deposits, the results highlight the significance of charophytes in lacustrine CaCO3 sedimentation.					; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022; Apolinarska, Karina/AAZ-3588-2020; Pukacz, Andrzej/L-7757-2014; Pukacz, Andrzej/O-1936-2019; Siepak, Marcin/L-4283-2019	Pelechata, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7487-8348; Apolinarska, Karina/0000-0002-3507-5139; Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561; Pukacz, Andrzej/0000-0002-2395-1680; Siepak, Marcin/0000-0002-6364-874X; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				JUN	2013	60	4					1017	1035		10.1111/sed.12020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12020													WOS:000319068300007

The processes responsible for the initiation, development, and propagation of the storms are poorly understood and forecast skill is limited. Key processes for the life cycle of two storms are investigated using Met Office Unified Model convection-permitting simulations with 1.5 km horizontal grid spacing. The two cases are analyzed alongside a simulation of a period with no storms to assess the roles of the lake-land breeze, downslope mountain winds, prevailing large-scale winds, and moisture availability. While seasonal changes in large-scale moisture availability play a key role in storm development, the lake-land-breeze circulation is a major control on the initiation location, timing, and propagation of convection. In the dry season, opposing offshore winds form a bulge of moist air above the lake surface overnight that extends from the surface to similar to 1.5 km and may trigger storms in high CAPE/low CIN environments. Such a feature has not been explicitly observed or modeled in previous literature. Storms over land on the preceding day are shown to alter the local atmospheric moisture and circulation to promote storm formation over the lake. The variety of initiation processes and differing characteristics of just two storms analyzed here show that the mean diurnal cycle over Lake Victoria alone is inadequate to fully understand storm formation. Knowledge of daily changes in local-scale moisture variability and circulations are keys for skillful forecasts over the lake.					; Birch, Cathryn/P-4228-2014; Marsham, John/AAA-2277-2020; Woodhams, Beth/AAF-4408-2019; Lane, Todd/A-8804-2011	Marsham, John/0000-0003-3219-8472; Woodhams, Beth/0000-0003-2070-8279; Bain, Caroline/0000-0002-2993-9308; Lane, Todd/0000-0003-0171-6927													0027-0644	1520-0493				SEP	2019	147	9					3365	3390		10.1175/MWR-D-19-0069.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-19-0069.1													WOS:000483768600001

Study findings vary across species and urban waterbodies. How the development of such changes affects the variation of biotic assemblages has only been explored to a limited extent in tropical urban lakes. Spatial and temporal variations of zooplankton community structure in 11 urban waterbodies in the Klang Valley, Malaysia were investigated along trophic and urbanization gradients. Zooplankton and water quality samples were collected three times, between May and November 2017, from two different locations in each lake. All three main zooplankton groups (rotifera, copepoda, and cladocera) were recorded from the study areas throughout the sampling period. The zooplankton community structure, particularly with regard to rotifers and cladocerans, varied between lakes and seasons. Zooplankton diversity does not vary with lake size or distance from the city center but does vary with shoreline development index and urbanization impacts. The zooplankton populations were dominated by rotifers, mainly Brachionus angularis at all study sites during the study period followed by copepods and cladocerans. The total density of zooplankton was significantly highest (p < 0.05) in the hypereutrophic lakes and during the dry season. Zooplankton diversity and rotifer species richness were negatively correlated with total phosphorus (TP). Diversity increased with urbanization and shoreline development, with rotifers as a potential bioindicator of trophic state in urban tropical lakes, due to their close relationship with TP.					; Balqis, Siti/AAN-1532-2021; Sharip, Dr. Zati/F-6300-2012	Sharip, Zati/0000-0003-3523-1178; Balqis, Siti/0000-0003-1705-4358; 														2192-1709				DEC	2019	8	1							44	10.1186/s13717-019-0196-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-019-0196-2													WOS:000498486500001

Spatial variation in landscape-level CO2 and CH4 fluxes from arctic coastal tundra: influence from vegetation, wetness, and the thaw lake cycle	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Regional quantification of arctic CO2 and CH4 fluxes remains difficult due to high landscape heterogeneity coupled with a sparse measurement network. Most of the arctic coastal tundra near Barrow, Alaska is part of the thaw lake cycle, which includes current thaw lakes and a 5500-year chronosequence of vegetated thaw lake basins. However, spatial variability in carbon fluxes from these features remains grossly understudied. Here, we present an analysis of whole-ecosystem CO2 and CH4 fluxes from 20 thaw lake cycle features during the 2011 growing season. We found that the thaw lake cycle was largely responsible for spatial variation in CO2 flux, mostly due to its control on gross primary productivity (GPP). Current lakes were significant CO2 sources that varied little. Vegetated basins showed declining GPP and CO2 sink with age (R-2 = 67% and 57%, respectively). CH4 fluxes measured from a subset of 12 vegetated basins showed no relationship with age or CO2 flux components. Instead, higher CH4 fluxes were related to greater landscape wetness (R-2 = 57%) and thaw depth (additional R-2 = 28%). Spatial variation in CO2 and CH4 fluxes had good satellite remote sensing indicators, and we estimated the region to be a small CO2 sink of -4.9 +/- 2.4 (SE) g C m(-2) between 11 June and 25 August, which was countered by a CH4 source of 2.1 +/- 0.2 (SE) g C m(-2). Results from our scaling exercise showed that developing or validating regional estimates based on single tower sites can result in significant bias, on average by a factor 4 for CO2 flux and 30% for CH4 flux. Although our results are specific to the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska, the degree of land-scape-scale variability, large-scale controls on carbon exchange, and implications for regional estimation seen here likely have wide relevance to other arctic landscapes.

The model results were validated using measurements of water temperature and of eddy covariance (EC) fluxes. The surface temperature is satisfactorily simulated by all models showing slight overestimation (by 0.1-1.1 degrees C). Both sensible and latent heat fluxes are positively biased in respect to EC data, consistent with earlier studies. However, correlation coefficients between EC-fluxes and those simulated are relatively high ranging from 0.55 to 0.74. The skill to simulate vertical temperature profiles by different models is assessed as well. It is found that the lake models underestimate the EC-derived surface drag coefficient, however providing realistic temperature profiles. It is argued that the real momentum flux from the atmosphere is larger than simulated, however it is split up between the wave development and the acceleration of lake currents. Adopting the simple parameterisation for momentum flux partitioning in one of the models showed that this mechanism can be significant. Finally, the effect of including the lake bathymetry data in k-epsilon models was the drastic overheating of water below the thermocline. This is likely to be caused by omitting the heat flux at the lake margins. Thus, the parameterisation of heat flux at the lake's margins should be included in the models; otherwise it is recommended to neglect bathymetry effects for such small water bodies as the Lake Valkea-Kotinen.					; Stepanenko, Victor/N-8467-2013; Jöhnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008; Subin, Zachary/K-5168-2012; Mammarella, Ivan/E-7782-2016; Mironov, Denis/AAM-4014-2021; MAMMARELLA, IRENE/D-1375-2014; Johnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008	Mironov, Dmitrii/0000-0002-3228-5851; Stepanenko, Victor/0000-0003-3033-6712; Subin, Zachary M/0009-0004-2244-6545; Mammarella, Ivan/0000-0002-8516-3356; Johnk, Klaus/0000-0002-5972-4201														1600-0870					2014	66								21389	10.3402/tellusa.v66.21389	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v66.21389													WOS:000330632600001

This notion has recently been challenged by successive findings of processes and mechanisms that produce CH4 in oxic environments. While some of the processes contributing to the vertical accumulation of CH4 in the oxygenated upper water layers of freshwater lakes have been identified, temporal variations as well as drivers are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the accumulation of CH4 in oxic water layers of two contrasting lakes in Germany: Lake Willersinnweiher (shallow, monomictic, eutrophic) and Lake Stechlin (deep, dimictic, eutrophic) from 2019 to 2020. The dynamics of isotopic values of CH4 and the role of potential precursor compounds of oxic CH4 production were explored. During the study period, persistent strong CH4 supersaturation (relative to air) was observed in the surface waters, mostly concentrated around the thermocline. The magnitude of vertical CH4 accumulation strongly varied over season and was generally more pronounced in shallow Lake Willersinnweiher. In both lakes, increases in CH4 con-centrations from the surface to the thermocline mostly coincided with an enrichment in 13C-CH4 and 2H-CH4, indicating a complex interaction of multiple processes such as CH4 oxidation, CH4 transport from littoral sediments and oxic CH4 production, sustaining and controlling this CH4 supersaturation. Furthermore, incubation experiments with 13C-and 2H-labelled methylated P-, N-and C-compounds clearly showed that methylphosphonate, methylamine and methionine acted as potent precursors of accumulating CH4 and at least partly sustained CH4 supersaturation. This highlights the need to better understand the mechanisms underlying CH4 accumulation by focusing on production and transport pathways of CH4 and its precursor compounds, e.g., produced via phytoplankton. Such knowledge forms the foundation to better predict aquatic CH4 dynamics and its subsequent rates of emission to the atmosphere.					; Schroll, Moritz/JAE-2974-2023; Keppler, Frank/F-4401-2012; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017	Liu, Liu/0000-0002-8056-2550; Schroll, Moritz/0000-0002-4416-1610; Einzmann, Teresa/0009-0000-7430-9711; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC 10	2023	903								166205	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166205		AUG 2023						37567306					WOS:001092279600001

Isolated Cavities Dominate Greenland Ice Sheet Dynamic Response to Lake Drainage	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Seasonal variability in the Greenland Ice Sheet's (GrIS) sliding speed is regulated by the response of the subglacial drainage system to meltwater inputs. However, the importance of channelization relative to the dewatering of isolated cavities in controlling seasonal ice deceleration remains unsolved. Using ice motion, moulin hydraulic head, and glaciohydraulic tremor measurements, we show the passing of a subglacial floodwave triggered by upglacier supraglacial lake drainages slowed sliding to wintertime background speeds without increasing the hydraulic capacity of the moulin-connected drainage system. We interpret these results to reflect an increase in basal traction caused by the dewatering of isolated cavities. These results suggest the dewatering of isolated parts of the subglacial drainage system play a key role in driving seasonal slowdowns on the GrIS.

Compared to other extremophiles, halophilic archaea are considered as cell factories for PHB production by using renewable, inexpensive carbon sources, thus decreasing the fermentation cost. This study is aimed at screening 33 halophilic archaea isolated from three enrichment cultures from Tunisian hypersaline lake, Chott El Jerid, using starch as the sole carbon source by Nile Red/Sudan Black staining and further confirmed by PCR amplification of phaC and phaE polymerase genes. 14 isolates have been recognized as positive candidates for PHA production and detected during both seasons. The identification of these strains through 16S rRNA gene analyses showed their affiliation to Halorubrum, Natrinema, and Haloarcula genera. Among them, three PHB-producing strains, CEJ34-14, CEJ5-14, and CEJ48-10, related to Halorubrum chaoviator, Natrinema pallidum, and Haloarcula tradensis were found to be the best ones reaching values of 9.25, 7.11, and 1.42% of cell dry weight (CDW), respectively. Our findings highlighted that Halorubrum, Natrinema, and Haloarcula genera were promising candidates for PHB production using soluble starch as a carbon source under high salinity (250 g L-1 NaCl).

J	Hites, RA				Hites, Ronald A.			Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Atmosphere near the Great Lakes: Why Do Their Concentrations Vary?	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations were measured in atmospheric samples collected at five sites near the shores of the North American Great Lakes once every 12 days from 1997 to 2018 (inclusive). These data were analyzed using multiple linear regression statistics to isolate the environmental variables controlling these PAH concentrations. About 74% of the variability is related to the number of people living and working within 25 km of the sampling site. Clearly, urban areas are major sources of PAH to the atmosphere. PAH concentrations at all sites lumped together are decreasing with halving times of about 25 years, and this factor represents about 1.5% of the variability. This is slower than the halving times for most banned compounds because PAH continue to be emitted directly into the atmosphere from many combustion sources. In the atmosphere, the concentrations of relatively volatile PAH maximize in July, but those of relatively nonvolatile PAH maximize in January. This seasonality factor represents about 2.5% of the variability. PAH concentrations at these Great Lakes sites tend to be elevated when the wind is coming out of the south-southeast, and this factor represents about 1.2% of the variability. PAH concentrations are lower when the wind speed is higher; this is a significant but small effect, representing only about 0.17% of the variability. The sum of these partial variabilities is about 80%, which suggests that the measurement and sampling errors are about 20%, which is a reasonable value. On the basis of two approaches, the range of atmospheric PAH transport from these sites is estimated to be on the order of 100-200 km. For these data, meteorology matters, but not by much.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 20	2021	55	14			SI		9444	9449		10.1021/acs.est.0c06905	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c06905		JAN 2021						33496581					WOS:000677482500006

In addition to extreme temperatures and high UV irradiance, SdU has high concentrations of chaotropic salts which can be important factors in controlling microbial diversity. Here, for the first time we characterize the viral diversity of this hypersaline environment during the two seasons, as well as the physicochemical characteristics and the prokaryotic communities of the analysed samples. Most of the selected samples showed a peculiar physicochemical composition and prokaryotic diversity, mostly different from each other even for samples from locations in close proximity or the same season. In contrast to most hypersaline systems Bacteria frequently outnumbered Archaea. Furthermore, an outstanding percentage of members of Salinibacter sp., likely a species different from the cosmopolitan Salinibacter ruber, was obtained in most of the samples. Viral communities displayed the morphologies normally found in hypersaline environments. Two seasonal samples were chosen for a detailed metagenomic analysis of the viral assemblage. Both viral communities shared common sequences but were dominated by sample-specific viruses, mirroring the differences also observed in physicochemical and prokaryotic community composition. These metaviromes were distinct from those detected in other hypersaline systems analysed to date.

We characterize this cycle by the number of lakes and their water levels. The cycle of the Southern Inylchek Glacier starts to increase in the beginning of April, reaches a maximum in May-June, and decreases sharply in June-July. The increase in April to June comes from an inflow of meltwater from snow and ice, and the subsequent decrease arises from a greater connectivity to the englacial drainage network. For the Southern Inylchek Glacier, 94% of the supraglacial lakes that exist and appear during 2013-2015 drain during all three years, indicating that most lakes could connect to the englacial drainage network for three years. Concerning the water level, lakes in close proximity and with the same base-level tend to synchronize their seasonal water levels through the englacial channels. Although the maximum water level of the three-year, field-measured lake is about the same from 2014 through 2016, the date of maximum water level varies between mid-May and mid-June. During this period, the lifetime and size of the supraglacial lakes are controlled by the timing of their connectivity to the englacial drainage network. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Allochthonous DOM (Al-DOM) had higher delta C-13 values than autochthonous DOM (Au-DOM). The delta C-13 of inflow DOM varied from -228.2 parts per thousand to -225.4 parts per thousand (mean -226.7 parts per thousand) and in-lake DOM varied from -228.4 parts per thousand to -26.1 parts per thousand (mean -227.2 parts per thousand). Low stable isotope (SI) signatures of Au-DOM were caused by relatively C-13-depleted values of its precursors (mainly phytoplankton) with mean delta C-13 of -28.9 parts per thousand. SI signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the inflows and in the lake were also relatively low (from -15.1 parts per thousand to -23.28 parts per thousand). SI values of DOM were lower during the active growing season from May to September and higher from October to April, with the corresponding estimated average proportions of Al-DOM 68% and 81%. The proportion of Al-DOM decreased with increasing water temperature, chlorophyll a, and pH and increased with increasing water level and concentration of yellow substances and DIC. The high proportion of Al-DOM in Vortsjarv shows that, even in this highly productive ecosystem, the labile Au-DOM produced is rapidly utilized and degraded by microorganisms and thus makes a relatively small contribution to the instantaneous in-lake DOM pool.

However, the global change in surface water area over the last decades remains unclear, as recent studies using the same satellite data disagree on its direction. Here, we reanalyze reported maps of global water classification based on that data in order to estimate the changes in long-term average surface water area from the first (1985-2000) to the second (2001-2015) half of the recent 30-year period (1985-2015). We find a net gain in global surface water area by 100,454 km(2), primarily due to seasonal water gains (83,329 km(2)). Over the world, we identify net wetting in 187 and net drying in 57 regional hydrological catchments, with the greatest water gain in Sabarmati (India) and loss in Amu Darya (Uzbekistan).

Several studies about Water Quality Criteria (WQC) for PCP had been performed to protect the aquatic ecosystem, but in most of these studies the toxicity data were not properly analyzed (e.g. screening and processing methods). Moreover, little study was carried out on the ecological risk assessment (ERA) based on environmental factors. In this study, through collecting published native toxicity data of PCP along with relationships between toxicity and pH, pH-dependent WQC was established using a standardized scientific statistical method in China. The Criterion Maximum Concentration (CMC) and Criterion Continuous Concentration (CCC) were expressed as a function of pH. These were (1) CMC = exp(1.361 x pH-8.034) and (2) CCC = exp(1.361 x pH-10.434). At pH 7.8, the derived CMC and CCC were 13.21 and 1.20 nil., respectively. In addition, four tiers of the ERA were conducted based on pH for different waterbodies at different seasons. In tiered 1, 2, 3 and 4 ERA, PCP exposure concentrations were standardized to that at pH 7.8. Results showed that all levels of ERA method in the tiered framework were consistent with each other, and the risks of PCP in Liaohe river of wet season, Taihu lake and Liaohe river of dry season increased successively. The Hazard quotient (HQ) method indicated that small fluctuations in pH would lead to misleading hazard results. PCP concentrations of 8.66 mu g/L. at pH 7.37 in one site posed more risk than PCP of 9.57 mu g/L, at pH 7.93 in another site. The joint probability suggested that ecological risks may exist 11.84% in the dry season and 1.51% in the wet season in Liaohe River, and 4.98% in Taihu Lake, respectively while 5% thresholds (HC5) were set up to protect aquatic organisms. We hope this work could provide more information to manage and control PCP pollution in Taihe Lake and Liaohe River. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Ewing, RC; Hayes, AG; Lucas, A				Ewing, Ryan C.; Hayes, Alex G.; Lucas, Antoine			Sand dune patterns on Titan controlled by long-term climate cycles	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Linear sand dunes cover the equatorial latitudes of Saturn's moon Titan and are shaped by global wind patterns(1-3). These dunes are thought to reflect present-day diurnal, tidal and seasonal winds(1,3-6), but climate models have failed to reproduce observed dune morphologies with these wind patterns(4,6). Dunes diagnostic of a specific wind(7,8) or formative timescale(9-11) have remained elusive(3,5,12). Here we analyse radar imagery from NASA's Cassini spacecraft and identify barchan, star and reoriented dunes in sediment-limited regions of Titan's equatorial dune fields that diverge by 23 degrees on average from the orientation of linear dunes. These morphologies imply shifts in wind direction and sediment availability. Using a numerical model, we estimate that the observed reorientation of dune crests to a change in wind direction would have taken around 3,000 Saturn years (1 Saturn year similar to 29.4 Earth years) or longer-a timescale that exceeds diurnal, seasonal or tidal cycles. We propose that shifts in winds and sediment availability are the product of long-term climate cycles associated with variations in Saturn's orbit. Orbitally controlled landscape evolution-also proposed to explain the distribution of Titan's polar lakes(13)-implies a dune-forming climate on equatorial Titan that is analogous to Earth.					; Lucas, Antoine/A-9752-2009; Hayes, Alexander/P-2024-2014	Ewing, Ryan/0000-0001-6337-610X; Lucas, Antoine/0000-0003-2192-4416; 													1752-0894	1752-0908				JAN	2015	8	1					15	19		10.1038/ngeo2323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2323													WOS:000346825000008

The effects of river inflow and retention time on the spatial heterogeneity of chlorophyll and water-air CO2 fluxes in a tropical hydropower reservoir	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Abundant research has been devoted to understanding the complexity of the biogeochemical and physical processes that are responsible for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from hydropower reservoirs. These systems may have spatially complex and heterogeneous GHG emissions due to flooded biomass, river inflows, primary production and dam operation. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the water-air CO2 fluxes and the phytoplanktonic biomass in the Funil Reservoir, which is an old, stratified tropical reservoir that exhibits intense phytoplankton blooms and a low partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2) ). Our results indicated that the seasonal and spatial variability of chlorophyll concentrations (Chl) and pCO(2) in the Funil Reservoir are related more to changes in the river inflow over the year than to environmental factors such as air temperature and solar radiation. Field data and hydrodynamic simulations revealed that river inflow contributes to increased heterogeneity during the dry season due to variations in the reservoir retention time and river temperature. Contradictory conclusions could be drawn if only temporal data collected near the dam were considered without spatial data to represent CO2 fluxes throughout the reservoir. During periods of high retention, the average CO2 fluxes were 10.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1) based on temporal data near the dam versus - 7.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1) with spatial data from along the reservoir surface. In this case, the use of solely temporal data to calculate CO2 fluxes results in the reservoir acting as a CO2 source rather than a sink. This finding suggests that the lack of spatial data in reservoir C budget calculations can affect regional and global estimates. Our results support the idea that the Funil Reservoir is a dynamic system where the hydrodynamics represented by changes in the river inflow and retention time are potentially a more important force driving both the Chl and pCO(2) spatial variability than the in-system ecological factors.

Influence of nutrient input on the trophic state of a tropical brackish water lagoon	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Ecosystem level changes in water quality and biotic communities in coastal lagoons have been associated with intensification of anthropogenic pressures. In light of incipient changes in Asia's largest brackish water lagoon (Chilika, India), an examination of different dissolved nutrients distribution and phytoplankton biomass, was conducted through seasonal water quality monitoring in the year 2011. The lagoon showed both spatial and temporal variation in nutrient concentration, mostly altered by freshwater input, regulated the chlorophyll distribution as well. Dissolved inorganic N:P ratio in the lagoon showed nitrogen limitation in May and December, 2011. Chlorophyll in the lagoon varied between 3.38 and 17.66 mg m (-3). Spatially, northern part of the lagoon showed higher values of DIN and chlorophyll during most part of the year, except in May, when highest DIN was recorded in the southern part. Statistical analysis revealed that dissolved NH-N and urea could combinedly explain 43% of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) variability which was relatively higher than that explained by NO-N and NO-N (12.4%) in lagoon water. Trophic state index calculated for different sectors of the lagoon confirmed the inter-sectoral and inter-seasonal shift from mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions largely depending on nutrient rich freshwater input.					; Kanuri, Vishnu Vardhan/AAI-2993-2020; K R, ABHILASH/F-5249-2016; Ganguly, Dipnarayan/J-4191-2014; Muduli, Dr.Pradipta/A-7645-2016	Kanuri, Vishnu Vardhan/0000-0001-7152-5486; K R, ABHILASH/0000-0002-4542-8516; Ganguly, Dipnarayan/0000-0003-0016-7145; 													2347-4327	0973-774X				JUL	2015	124	5					1005	1017		10.1007/s12040-015-0582-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-015-0582-9													WOS:000358329700007

This paper investigated the effects of freeze-thaw cycles on the shear strength of naturally strongly chlorine saline soil with the compactness of 85%, 90% and 95%. Three soil samples with different compactness were made. Size and mass changes were measured and recorded during freeze-thaw cycles. Shear strength under different vertical pressures was determined by direct shear tests, and the cohesion and friction angle were measured and discussed. Microstructure characteristic changes of saline soil samples were observed using scanning electron microscopy under different freeze-thaw cycles. Furthermore, numerical software was used to calculate the subsoil-bearing capacity and settlement of the electric tower foundation in the Qarhan Salt Lake region under different freeze-thaw cycles. Results show that the low-density soil shows thaw settlement deformation, but the high-density soil shows frost-heaving deformation with the increase in freeze-thaw cycles. The shear strength of the soil samples first increases and then decreases with the increase in freeze-thaw cycles. After 30 freeze-thaw cycles, the friction angle of soil samples is 28.3%, 29.2% and 29.6% lower than the soil samples without freeze-thaw cycle, the cohesion of soil samples is 71.4%, 60.1% and 54.4% lower than the samples without freeze-thaw cycle, and the cohesion and friction angle of soil samples with different compactness are close to each other. Microstructural changes indicate that the freeze-thaw cycle leads to the breakage of coarse particles and the aggregation of fine particles. Correspondingly, the structure type of soil changes from a granular stacked structure to a cemented-aggregated system. Besides, the quality loss of soil samples is at about 2% during the freeze-thaw cycles. Results suggest that there may be an optimal compactness between 90 and 95%, on the premise of meeting the design requirements and economic benefits. This study can provide theoretical guidance for foundation engineering constructions in seasonally frozen regions.

In terms of study methodology, the current research is a descriptive survey. The TOPSIS method was used to rank strengths, weaknesses, threats, opportunities, and preferred strategies after the SWOT analysis was completed. Using a questionnaire and the Delphi method, 30 regional specialists provided research data which was collected and analyzed. Thirteen internal elements and twelve external factors affecting the West Lake tourism were identified and evaluated. Additionally, fifteen strategies were presented to improve the lake's tourism. On the basis of the matrix of internal-external components in the SWOT model, an aggressive approach was determined to be the optimal strategic stance for West Lake. The results of the TOPSIS technique also revealed that internal strengths have a bigger impact than other elements; hence, aggressive strategies are emphasized for the growth of ecotourism in this region. Based on the results of the TOPSIS technique, the "optimal utilization of the lake's natural, cultural, and historical potential and attractions in order to develop and attract tourists and generate jobs and revenues" and "formulation of strategic plans to maximize potential and opportunities in order to attract tourists in all seasons of the year" strategies were identified as the most important strategies for enhancing the West Lake tourism scenario. Therefore, it is hoped that the relevant authorities would contribute to the expansion and enhancement of the region's economy through a focus on the vision and goals of the tourist sector and careful foresight in the implementation of these projects.					; Meshram, Sarita/H-2504-2013; Zhu, yihao/GZL-9169-2022	Zhang, Guodao/0000-0002-6264-5854; Meshram, Sarita Gajbhiye/0000-0001-5453-3791														2071-1050				FEB	2023	15	3							2464	10.3390/su15032464	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15032464													WOS:000930799600001

The monitoring campaign was performed during the wet, dry and intermediate season. The concentration of Cr, Fe, Pb, Zn, Al and Cd in water exceeded the limits considered as hazardous for aquatic life. The highest metal concentrations were observed in sediment, intermediate concentrations, in fish muscle, and the lowest in water, with the exception of Cr, Zn, As and Hg, which were the highest in fish muscle. Potential ecological risk analysis of heavy metal concentrations in sediment indicated that the San Roque Lake posed a low ecological risk in all sampling periods. The target hazard quotients (THQs) and carcinogenic risk (CR) for individual metals showed that As in muscle was particularly hazardous, posing a potential risk for fishermen and the general population during all sampling periods. Hg poses a potential risk for fishermen only in the intermediate season. It is important to highlight that none of these two elements exceeded the limits considered as hazardous for aquatic life in water and sediment. This result proves the importance of performing measurements of contaminants, in both abiotic and biotic compartments, to assess the quality of food resources. These results suggest that the consumption of this fish species from this reservoir is not completely safe for human health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Vegetation zonation along the desert-wetland ecosystem of Taif Highland, Saudi Arabia	SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Saudi Arabia has no permanent lakes or rivers but has wet meadows, which are desert wetlands temporarily formed due to the seasonal rainfall. This work investigates the environmental variables' impact on the vegetation pattern in the desert-wetland ecosystem in Taif highlands. Forty-one stands were randomly selected representing three main habitats (wet meadows, slopes, and terraces) to study their floristic features and vegetation analysis. A total of 142 species were recorded belonging to 111 genera and 45 families in the desert wetlands of Taif Province. About 64.1% were natural plants, while 25.4% were segetal weeds, 7.7% were aquatic plants, and 2.8% were plants that escaped from cultivation. Therophytes dominated over the other life forms, and mono-regional taxa were the dominant chorotype. Multivariate analysis of the recorded plants produced eight vegetation groups; four of them (A: Potamogeton nodosus-Nasturtium officinale, B: Lemna gibba-Leptochloa fusca, C: Typha domingensisXanthium strumarium and D: Conyza stricta- Cyperus longus) represented the wet meadows, while two (E: Acacia gerrardii- Commicarpus plumbagineus and H: Osteospermum vaillantii- Eragrostis Pilosa) for slopes and other two (F: Argemone ochroleuca-Cyperus rotundus and G: Pulicaria undulata- Solanum incanum) for the desert terraces. The vegetation zonation was clear, which started from real aquatic species in the wet meadows passing through mixed vegetation in the slopes and ended with proper xerophytic vegetation in the terraces. Conyza stricta- Cyperus longus community had the highest species diversity, while that of Potamogeton nodosus-Nasturtium officinale had the lowest. The principal component analysis indicated that HCO3, NO3, Mg, Cl, Ca, and pH values were the most effective soil variable. The presence of several segetal weeds suggests the alteration of the natural status of the desert-wetland ecosystem, and thus the conservation of these natural habitats becomes urgent.

The hydrology of interconnected bog complexes in discontinuous permafrost terrains	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Annual Meeting of Canadian-Geophysical-Union	MAY 04-07, 2014	Banff, CANADA					In the zone of discontinuous permafrost, the cycling and storage of water within and between wetlands is poorly understood. The presence of intermittent permafrost bodies tends to impede and re-direct the flow of water. In this region, the landscape is characterized by forested peat plateaus that are underlain by permafrost and are interspersed by permafrost-free wetlands. These include channel fens which convey water to the basin outlet through wide, hydraulically rough channels and flat bogs which are typically thought to retain moisture inputs as storage. Field studies conducted at a peatland-dominated landscape near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, Canada, indicate the presence of ephemeral drainage channels that form a cascade of connected bogs that ultimately discharges into a channel fen. Consequently, understanding bogs as dynamic transmitters of surface and subsurface flows, rather than simple storage regions, calls for further examination. Whether bogs act as either storage features or flow through features has a direct impact on the runoff contributing area in a basin. Here, two adjacent series of bog cascades were gauged over two consecutive years to determine spatial and temporal changes in effective runoff contributing areas. It was found that runoff varies significantly between two adjacent bog cascades with one cascade producing 125mm of runoff over the 2-year period, while the other yielded only 25mm. The bog cascades are primarily active during the snowmelt season when moisture conditions are high; however flows can also be generated in response to large rain events. It is proposed that bog cascades operate under an element threshold concept' whereby in order for water to be transmitted through a bog, the depression storage capacity of that bog must first be satisfied. Our work indicates that whether bogs act as storage features or flow-through features has a direct impact on the runoff contributing area in a basin. Neglecting to represent connected bogs as dynamic transmission features in the landscape is shown to underestimate water available for streamflow by between 5 and 15%, and these systems are therefore a key component of the water balance in discontinuous permafrost regions.

Bacterial communities in sediments of the shallow Lake Dongping in China	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aims: The purpose of this study was to discuss how the environmental inputs and anthropogenic activities impact bacterial communities in the sediments of a shallow, eutrophic and temperate freshwater lake. Methods and Results: Sediment cores were collected from Lake Dongping, located in Taian, Shandong, China. All samples were processed within 4 h of collection. Total nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon, ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen content of samples were measured by Kjeldahl determination, sulphuric acid-perchloric acid digestion and molybdenum blue colorimetry, potassium dichromate titration, Nessler's reagent colorimetric and the phenol disulphonic acid colorimetric method, respectively. Seasonal and temporal diversity of sediment bacterial communities at six stations in Lake Dongping were investigated using molecular approaches (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and 16S rDNA clone libraries). Noticeable seasonal and temporal variations were observed in bacterial diversity and composition at all six stations. Sediment bacterial communities in Lake Dongping belonged to 16 phyla: Proteobacteria (including alpha-Proteobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, delta-Proteobacteria, epsilon-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria), Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Nitrospira, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria, Deferribacteres, Actinobacteria, OP8, Spirochaetes and OP11. Members of beta-, delta- and gamma-Proteobacterial sequences were predominant in 11 of 12 clone libraries derived from sediment samples. Sediment samples collected at stations 1 and 4 in July had the greatest bacterial diversity while those collected at station 2 in October had the least diversity. TP concentration was significantly correlated with the distribution of bacterial communities. Conclusions: Our results suggested that different environmental nutrient inputs contribute to seasonal and temporal variations of chemical features and bacterial communities in sediments of Lake Dongping. TP concentration was significantly correlated with the distribution of bacterial communities.

To better understand the ecosystem functioning, we studied soil microbial communities of Salineta wetland (NE Spain) in dry and wet seasons in three different landscape stations representing situations characteristic of ephemeral saline lakes: S1 soil usually submerged, S2 soil intermittently flooded, and S3 soil with halophytes. Microbial community composition was determined according to different redox layers by 16S rRNA gene barcoding. We observed reversed redox gradient, negative at the surface and positive in depth, which was identified by PERMANOVA as the main factor explaining microbial distribution. The Pseudomonadota, Gemmatimonadota, Bacteroidota, Desulfobacterota, and Halobacteriota phyla were dominant in all stations. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) revealed that the upper soil surface layer was characterized by the predominance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated to strictly or facultative anaerobic halophilic bacteria and archaea while the subsurface soil layer was dominated by an OTU affiliated to Roseibaca, an aerobic alkali-tolerant bacterium. In addition, the potential functional capabilities, inferred by PICRUSt2 analysis, involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles were similar in all samples, irrespective of the redox stratification, suggesting functional redundancy. Our findings show microbial community changes according to water flooding conditions, which represent useful information for biomonitoring and management of these wetlands whose extreme aridity and salinity conditions are exposed to irreversible changes due to human activities.

Water pollution at Lake Natron Ramsar site in Tanzania: A threat to aquatic life	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												Lake Natron Ramsar site is a recognized Ramsar site and Important Bird and Biodiver-sity Area (IBA) in Tanzania. It is a breeding site for 75% of the global population of lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor). Water quality changes can affect the plankton composition and diversity, causing alteration of LNRS ecosystem abundance. Water quality assessment at LNRS was conducted after reported alkaline tilapines (Alcolapia species) and pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) mortalities. Water samples were collected from five sampling sites in Engaresero and Pinyinyi rivers during wet and dry seasons. Physico-chemical parameters including pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrates, chloride, sodium, ammonium, electrical conductivity and total alkalinity were assessed. Additionally, plankton composition and abundance were an-alyzed to investigate the cause of reported mortalities. Observation method was used to as-sess the anthropogenic activities taking place along inlet rivers. BOD, COD, ammonium and pH values were higher compared to the Tanzania Environmental Management Act of 2004 and World Health Organization recommended values for freshwater, resulting into low DO levels. There were no zooplankton or phytoplankton colonies observed from sampled wa-ter. The study observed anthropogenic activities (unsustainable crop cultivation, deforesta-tion and overgrazing) at the LNRS catchment. The reported physico-chemical changes could be due to such anthropogenic activities at the LNRS catchment which could have resulted into the reported fish mortalities. Watershed management using nature-based solutions such as restoration of riparian vegetation and environment management awareness are recommended for LNRS ecosystem sustainability.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

In this mini-review, we focus our attention on the distribution and community diversity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in pond water and sediments, as well as the possible ecological mechanisms involved. Moreover, we discuss the possibility of increasing the activity of ammonia-oxidizing organisms in order to improve the water quality in aquaculture ponds. Compared with eutrophic lakes, the significantly higher ammonia concentration in pond water does not lead to significantly higher AOB levels, and the abundance of AOA is too low to quantify accurately. Similar to eutrophic lakes, high abundances of AOA and AOB are present in the surface sediments at the same time, where the oxidation of ammonia is performed mainly by AOB. AOB and AOA exhibit significant seasonal variations in aquaculture ponds, which are affected by the temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen. The dominant AOB species are Nitrosomonas and the Nitrosospira lineage in pond environments. Nitrososphaera or members of the Nitrososphaera-like cluster dominate the AOA species in surface sediments, whereas the Nitrosopumilus cluster dominates the deeper sediments. AOB and AOA can be enriched on artificial substrates suspended in the pond water, thereby potentially improving the water quality.

However, due to a low spatial resolution of the gravity field models, spatially localized water storage changes, such as those occurring in lakes and reservoirs, cannot properly be represented in the GRACE estimates. As surface storage changes can represent a large part of total water storage, this leads to leakage effects and results in surface water signals becoming erroneously assimilated into other water storage compartments of neighbouring model grid cells. As a consequence, a simple mass balance at grid/regional scale is not sufficient to deconvolve the impact of surface water on TWS. Furthermore, non-hydrology-related phenomena contained in the GRACE time series, such as the mass redistribution caused by major earthquakes, hamper the use of GRACE for hydrological studies in affected regions. In this paper, we present the first release (RL01) of the global correction product RECOG (REgional COrrections for GRACE), which accounts for both the surface water (lakes and reservoirs, RECOG-LR) and earthquake effects (RECOG-EQ). RECOG-LR is computed from forward-modelling surface water volume estimates derived from satellite altimetry and (optical) remote sensing and allows both a removal of these signals from GRACE and a relocation of the mass change to its origin within the outline of the lakes/reservoirs. The earthquake correction, RECOG-EQ, includes both the co-seismic and post-seismic signals of two major earthquakes with magnitudes above Mw9. We discuss that applying the correction dataset (1) reduces the GRACE signal variability by up to 75% around major lakes and explains a large part of GRACE seasonal variations and trends, (2) avoids the introduction of spurious trends caused by leakage signals of nearby lakes when calibrating/assimilating hydrological models with GRACE, and (3) enables a clearer detection of hydrological droughts in areas affected by earthquakes. A first validation of the corrected GRACE time series using GPS-derived vertical station displacements shows a consistent improvement of the fit between GRACE and GNSS after apply-ing the correction.

This study aimed to ascertain the diversity and richness of nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities in the Ebinur Lake Wetland. The diversity of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria community of nifH genes from the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils of four plants in different seasons were examined using Illumina HiSeq PE250 high-throughput sequencing technology. The correlation between soil environmental factors and diversity and richness of nitrogen-fixing bacteria was studied using the redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that the diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the rhizosphere soil of the constructive plants was higher than that in the non-rhizosphere soil; also, the diversity in July was higher than that in October and April. Geobacter, Pseudomonas and Bradyrhizobium were the dominant common bacteria in different samples of Ebinur Lake Wetland. The RDA showed that the total nitrogen, available potassium and available phosphoruswere significantly correlated with the diversity and richness of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The diversity and community structure of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in soil samples also changed over time. The community structures of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils of the four plants were not the same during the same period. The correlation between soil environmental factors and the community structure and abundance of nitrogen-fixing bacteria can provide data basis and theoretical support for the degradation and restoration of Ebinur Lake Wetland.					xitong, jin/GQB-3220-2022														0302-8933	1432-072X				SEP	2021	203	7					3919	3932		10.1007/s00203-021-02363-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-021-02363-x		MAY 2021						34021386					WOS:000652944100001

Sinninghe			Paleoclimate reconstruction of the last 36 kyr based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers in the Padul palaeolake record (Sierra Nevada, southern Iberian Peninsula)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Quantitative continental climate reconstructions covering the last glacial cycle from the Iberian Peninsula are scarce. In order to fill this gap, we obtained for the first time a high-resolution mean annual air temperature (MAAT) record based on the distribution of specific bacterial membrane lipids (i.e., branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers; brGDGTs) from the last 36.0-4.7 kyr palaeolake record recovered by the Padul-15-05 sedimentary core (Padul, Sierra Nevada, southern Iberia). The fractional abundance of the three major groups of GDGTs present in the Padul sediments, GDGT-0, crenarchaeol and the summed brGDGTs, is comparable with that of other shallow and small (<10 km(2)) European lakes. Despite variations in the lithology in the studied section, the GDGT composition remains relatively stable, except for the uppermost 116 cm of the record, representing the ephemeral/emerged lake stage, which is characterized by higher crenarchaeol fractional abundances. The identification of a specific brGDGT that has only been detected in anoxic lakes provides evidence for in-situ brGDGT production in the water column and/or sediments in the Padul palaeolake. Its presence/absence probably denotes a succession of periods with a variable oxygen content in the bottom waters of the palaeolake. MAAT was reconstructed based on the distribution of brGDGTs using an African lake calibration and ranged between 12 and 20 degrees C. A new Bayesian calibration to mean temperature of Months Above Freezing (MAF) depicts similar temperature variations with a mean absolute difference of 0.7 degrees C. The MAAT reconstruction in the Padul palaeolake for the 36.0-4.7 kyr period reveals similarities with climate variability described at high-latitudes and in the westernmost Mediterranean area during this interval, showing cold conditions during the last three Heinrich Stadials and the Younger Dryas and warm conditions during the Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials (7-1) and the Bolling-Allerod period. Despite the more stable and warm general climate conditions during the Early and Mid-Holocene, rapid centennial-scale temperature changes are registered in the Padul palaeolake in good agreement with variations observed in the Mediterranean forest record.

The giant ice avalanches, with a total volume of 150 x 10(6) m(3), had almost melted by September 2019 (about 30 % of the second ice avalanche remained). The impact of these extreme disasters on downstream lakes has not been investigated yet. Based on in situ observation, bathymetry survey and satellite data, we explore the impact of the ice avalanches on the two downstream lakes (i.e., Am Co and Memar Co) in terms of lake morphology, water level and water temperature in the subsequent 4 years (2016-2019). After the first glacier collapse, the ice avalanche slid into Aru Co along with a large amount of debris, which generated great impact waves in Aru Co and significantly modified the lake's shoreline and underwater topography. An ice volume of at least 7.1 x 10(6) m(3) was discharged into Aru Co, spread over the lake surface and considerably lowered its surface temperature by 2-4 degrees C in the first 2 weeks after the first glacier collapse. Due to the large amount of meltwater input, Memar Co exhibited more rapid expansion after the glacier collapses (2016-2019) than before (2003-2014), in particular during the warm season. The melting of ice avalanches was found to contribute to about 23 % of the increase in lake storage between 2016 and 2019. Our results indicate that the Am glacier collapses had both short-term and long-term impacts on the downstream lakes and provide a baseline in understanding the future lake response to glacier melting on the TP under a warming climate.

However, SCM has long been overlooked in artificial reservoirs, which may lead to a serious underestimation of the primary productivity level and trophic status of reservoirs. To better understand the temporal and spatial variability of SCM and the mechanisms leading to SCM development, this study conducted a detailed survey in a large subtropical reservoir (Xinanjiang Reservoir, XAJR) from September 2020 to August 2021. The seasonal thermal stratification, in situ variables (WT, pH, DO and Chla), nutrient concentrations (DSi, NO3-, DIP and DCO2), Chla maxima depth and magnitude of the riverine region (S1), transition region (S2) and the central part of the XAJR (S3 and S4) were all thoroughly investigated. Thermal stratification and SCM in XAJR exhibited significant seasonal and spatial heterogeneity. Phytoplankton biomass in the epilimnion was limited by dissolved CO2 from June to October in the warm seasons, while it was primarily limited by phosphorus in the other seasons, according to the nutrient limitation analysis. Along the water column, dissolved CO2 limitation occurred mainly above the SCM layer, and the water column below the SCM layer gradually transitioned from dissolved CO2 limitation to phosphorus limitation. Furthermore, as the thermal stratification developed, the upstream water mass moves along the middle of the water column as density flow toward the reservoir, providing nutrients for the development of the SCM. This research contributes to a better understanding of the temporal and spatial variation of SCM and nutrient supply in deep and large stratified reservoirs.					liu, liu/JEO-6900-2023; Yang, Meilin/OHR-7472-2025														0043-1354	1879-2448				AUG 15	2022	222								118912	10.1016/j.watres.2022.118912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118912		AUG 2022						35932705					WOS:000883186700003

Bacterial Communities Along Environmental Gradients in Tropical Soda Lakes	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Soda lake environments are known to be variable and can have distinct differences according to geographical location. In this study, we investigated the effects of different environmental conditions of six adjacent soda lakes in the Pantanal biome (Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil) on bacterial communities and their functioning using a metagenomic approach combined with flow cytometry and chemical analyses. Ordination analysis using flow cytometry and water chemistry data from two sampling periods (wet and dry) clustered soda lakes into three different profiles: eutrophic turbid (ET), oligotrophic turbid (OT), and clear vegetated oligotrophic (CVO). Analysis of bacterial community composition and functioning corroborated this ordination; the exception was one ET lake, which was similar to one OT lake during the wet season, indicating drastic shifts between seasons. Microbial abundance and diversity increased during the dry period, along with a considerable number of limnological variables, all indicative of a strong effect of the precipitation-evaporation balance in these systems. Cyanobacteria were associated with high electric conductivity, pH, and nutrient availability, whereas Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria were correlated with landscape morphology variability (surface water, surface perimeter, and lake volume) and with lower salinity and pH levels. Stress response metabolism was enhanced in OT and ET lakes and underrepresented in CVO lakes. The microbiome dataset of this study can serve as a baseline for restoring impacted soda lakes. Altogether, the results of this study demonstrate the sensitivity of tropical soda lakes to climate change, as slight changes in hydrological regimes might produce drastic shifts in community diversity.

J	Mouri, G; Takizawa, S; Oki, T				Mouri, Goro; Takizawa, Satoshi; Oki, Taikan			Spatial and temporal variation in nutrient parameters in stream water in a rural-urban catchment, Shikoku, Japan: Effects of land cover and human impact	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Seasonal and spatial variations in major ion chemistry and isotope composition in the rural-urban catchment of the Shigenobu River were monitored to determine the influences of agricultural and urban sewage systems on water quality. Temporal patterns of biochemical oxygen demand (BOO), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and suspended sediment (SS) were examined at four sites in the rural-urban catchment. Urban land cover, incorporating the effects of increased population, domestic water use, and industrial wastewater, was positively associated with increases in water pollution and was included as an important explanatory variable for the variations in all water quality parameters. Significant trends were found in each parameter. BOD concentrations ranged widely, and were high in urban regions, due to the presence of a waste water treatment plant. TN and SS showed various trends, but did not vary widely, unlike TP. TP concentrations varied greatly, with high concentrations in cultivated areas, due to fertilizer use. Local water quality management or geology could further explain some of the variations in water quality. Non-point-source pollution exhibited strong positive spatial autocorrelation, indicating that incorporating spatial dimensions into water quality assessment enhances our understanding of spatial patterns of water quality. Data from the Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport (MUT) and Environment Ministry (EM) were used to investigate trends in land management. Stepwise regression analysis was used to test the correlation between specific management practises and substance concentrations in surface water and sediment. MLIT and EM data for 1981-2003 showed an increase in TN, TP, and SS concentrations in surface water. High levels of fertilizer in dormant sprays and domestic water use were associated with high pesticide concentrations in water and sediment. This paper presents a novel method of studying the environmental impact of various agricultural management practises and recommends a management strategy that combines the use of reduced-risk pesticides with irrigation and non-irrigation periods in paddy fields.

Sand mining in Poyang Lake has significantly impacted the wetland ecosystem over the past 20 years, yet a quantitative analysis of these impacts remains insufficient. Here, we used 63 Landsat images taken from 2000 to 2020 along with the support vector machine (SVM) method and a retrieval model of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) to identify sand mining vessels and areas affected by sand mining. Then, we analyzed the changes in landscape patterns in the areas affected by sand mining. The potential impact of underwater noise generated by sand mining vessels on Yangtze finless porpoises was analyzed by a sound propagation model. The number of sand mining vessels in Poyang Lake during the flood, normal, and dry seasons increased from 2000 to 2016 but rapidly decreased from 2017 to 2020. Sand mining vessels were mainly distributed in the northern channel from 2000 to 2006, moved toward the center of the lake from 2007 to 2010, then moved northward in 2017. Within the areas affected by sand mining, water and mudflats declined, grassland and sandbars increased, and the landscape discontinuity increased. The habitat of the Yangtze finless porpoise affected by underwater noise from sand mining vessels in all seasons has significantly increased overtime. The mean area of the affected habitats was 70.65% (dry), 64.48% (normal), and 63.30% (flood) of the total habitat areas. The porpoise habitats in the northern channel and the west branch of the Ganjiang River are more seriously affected by the underwater noise of sand mining vessels than the southern lake. The impact of sand mining activities on wetland landscape and aquatic species demands systematic investigation in the future.

This study investigated various water quality parameters, including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and major and trace elements such as Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sr, Tl, and V, which were investigated during the dry and wet seasons from samples collected at Meulsteenpan Lake, Coalplex Stream, and Natref Stream in Sasolburg, Free State, South Africa (2019-2020). The results revealed that the pH of water collected from Meulsteenpan Lake (7.86-7.89) and Coalplex stream (7.13-7.37) were within the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF), World Health Organization (WHO), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permissible guideline values for domestic and agricultural use. On the other hand, the pH from Natref stream (6.16-7.68) was within the permissible guideline values set by the DWAF for domestic use but below the permissible guideline values set by the WHO and EPA for domestic use, and the DWAF for agricultural use. The mean TDS and EC values in Meulsteenpan Lake (796-980 mg/L) and (1.20-2.00 mS/m) exceeded permissible guideline values set by the DWAF and WHO domestic use for TDS, Coalplex stream (309-326 mg/L) and (0.65 mS/m), and Natref Stream (269-413 mg/L) and (0.89-0.96 mS/m) were within the permissible guideline values for the DWAF and WHO domestic use for TDS. The results obtained for metal concentration revealed higher mean concentrations for Al, Fe, and Mo, Mn in the study area, which could pose adverse health risks to aquatic life and humans. Various pollution and health assessments (Cf, m-C-d, m-HPI, HEI, NEI, and WQI) were used to evaluate the quality status of the surface water on all sampling sites. WQI revealed that in the wet and dry seasons, surface waters from Coalplex Stream and Natref Stream had "excellent" water quality, while Meulsteenpan Lake had "excellent" water quality in the dry season, but in the wet season, the water quality was "unsuitable for drinking".

Are large-scale, high-severity disturbances (similar to the recent windthrow and bark beetle outbreaks in the region) within the historical range of variability for this forest ecosystem? Can past disturbances explain the previously described gradient in stand structure that had been attributed to an elevation gradient? Location: S. umava National Park (the Bohemian Forest) of the southwest Czech Republic. Methods: We reconstructed the site's disturbance history using dendroecological methods in a 20-ha study plot, established to span an elevation gradient. Growth patterns of 400 increment cores were screened for: (1) abrupt increases in radial growth indicating mortality of a former canopy tree and (2) rapid early growth rates indicating establishment in a former canopy gap. Results: Spatial and temporal patterns of canopy accession varied markedly over the 20-ha study area, resulting in disturbance pulses that corresponded to an elevation gradient. On the lower slope of the plot, the majority of the trees reached the canopy during two pulses (1770-1800 and 1820-1840), while most trees on the upper slope accessed the canopy in one pulse (1840-1860). Historically documented windstorms roughly coincide with peaks in our disturbance reconstruction. Conclusions: Our study provides strong evidence that these forests were historically shaped by infrequent, moderate-to high-severity natural disturbances. Our methods, however, could not definitively identify the agent(s) of these disturbances. Nevertheless, the recent mid-1990s windstorm and the ensuing spruce bark beetle outbreak may provide an analogue for past disturbance, as the duration and severity of these events could easily explain past patterns of growth response and recruitment in our results. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume the interaction of windstorms and bark beetles seen in the contemporary landscape has occurred historically. Finally, our results suggest that the previously documented elevation gradient in forest structure may not be related to elevation per se (lower temperatures and shorter growing season) but rather to changes in disturbance severity mediated by elevation.

Poyang Lake is a dynamic wetland system of critical ecological importance and connected with the Yangtze river. However, in the context of disturbed water regime in Poyang Lake resulting from human activities and climate change, the responses of vegetation dynamics to the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) have not been investigated. We addressed this knowledge gap by using daily water level data and Landsat images from 1987 to 2018. Landsat images were acquired between October and December to ensure similar phenological conditions. Object-oriented Artificial Neural Network Regression for wetland classification was developed based on abundant training and validation samples. Interactions between vegetation coverage and water regimes pre and post the operation of the TGD were compared using classification and regression trees and the random forest model. Since the implementation of the TGD in 2003, Poyang Lake has become drier, especially during the dry season. A more rapid plant growth rate was observed post TGD (44.74 km(2) year(-1)) compared to that of the entire study period (12.9 km(2) year(-1)). Average water level for the antecedent 20 days most significantly affected vegetation before 2003, whereas average water level for the antecedent 5 or 10 days was more important after 2003. The impoundment of the TGD after the flood season accelerated the drawdown processes of Poyang Lake, and the rapidly exposed wetlands accelerated vegetation expansion during the dry seasons, resulting in shrinkage and degradation of the lake area. This study deepens our knowledge of the influences of newly developed dams on lakes and rivers.					; Wang, XiaoLong/AGP-5220-2022; Xu, Ligang/K-2584-2013	Zheng, Lilin/0000-0002-6170-930X; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				FEB	2021	35	2							e14026	10.1002/hyp.14026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14026		JAN 2021											WOS:000606352200001
J	Ivory, SJ; Russell, J				Ivory, Sarah J.; Russell, James			Climate, herbivory, and fire controls on tropical African forest for the last 60ka	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in Africa was drier than today and was followed by rapid step-wise climate changes during the last deglacial period. In much of Africa, these changes led to a drastic reduction of lowland forest area during the LGM, followed by recolonization of the lowlands by forest and woodland in concert with regional warming and wetting. However, the history of southeastern African vegetation contrasts with that observed further north. In particular, forest expansion appears to have occurred in southeastern Africa during episodes of high-latitude northern hemisphere cooling. Although vegetation history in Africa is generally assumed to relate purely to climate, previous studies have not addressed potential feedbacks between climate, vegetation, and disturbance regimes (fire, herbivory) that may create tipping points in ecosystems. This climate-vegetation history has profound implications for our understanding of the modern architecture of lowland and highland forests, both thought to be at risk from future climate change. Here we present analyses of fossil pollen, charcoal, and Sporormiella (dung fungus) on a continuous 60 kyr record from central Lake Tanganyika, Southeast Africa, that illustrates the interplay of climate and disturbance regimes in shaping vegetation composition and structure. We observe that extensive forests dominated the region during the last glacial period despite evidence of decreased rainfall. At the end of the LGM, forest opening at similar to 17.5 ka followed warming temperatures but preceded rising precipitation, suggesting that temperature-induced water stress and disturbance from fire and herbivory affected initial landscape transformation. Our Sporormiella record indicates that mega-herbivore populations increased at the early Holocene. This higher animal density increased plant species richness and encouraged landscape heterogeneity until the mid-Holocene. At this time, regional drying followed by the onset of the Iron Age in the late Holocene resulted in expansion of thicket, more open woodland, and disturbance taxa that still characterize the landscape today. This climate-vegetation history has important implications for our' understanding of the modern and future distribution of lowland and highland forests, which are at risk from future climate change.

Chlorophyll-a (Chla) is a prominent phytoplankton pigment and a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, reflecting the trophic status of waters. Regularly monitoring Chla concentrations is vital for issuing timely warnings of this lake's eutrophication. Owing to its higher spatial and temporal coverages, remote sensing can provide a synoptic complement to traditional measurement methods by targeting the optical Chla absorption signals, especially for the lakes that lack regular in situ sampling cruises, like Lake Xingkai. This study calibrated and validated several commonly used remote sensing Chla retrieval algorithms (including the two-band ratio, three-band method, four-band method, and baseline methods) by applying them to Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) images in Lake Xingkai. Among these algorithms, the four-band model (FBA), which removes the absorption signal of detritus and colored dissolved organic matter, was the best-performing model with an R-2 of 0.64 and a mean absolute percentage difference of 38.26%. With the FBA model applied to OLCI images, the monthly and spatial distributions of Chla in Lake Xingkai were studied from 2016 to 2022. The results showed that over the seven years, the Chla concentrations in Small Lake Xingkai were higher than in Big Lake Xingkai. Unlike other eutrophic lakes in China (e.g., Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu), Lake Xingkai did not display a stable seasonal Chla variation pattern. We also found uncertainties and limitations of the Chla algorithm models when using a larger satellite zenith angle or applying it to an algal bloom area. Recent increases in anthropogenic nutrient loading, water clarity, and warming temperatures may lead to rising phytoplankton biomass in Lake Xingkai, and the results of this study can be applied for the satellite-based monitoring of its water quality.

Based on field observations in 2010, thermal stratification was significant in most months of the year. Through field data analysis and numerical simulations, the seasonal and spatial variation of thermal stratification as related to the impact of the operation of TGR were investigated. Thermal stratification was most pronounced from April to September in the Xiangxi River tributary. Air temperature (AT) and water level (WL) were the two dominant variables impacting thermal stratification. AT affected the surface water temperature promoting the formation of thermal stratification, and high WLs in TGR deepened the thermocline depth and thermocline bottom depth. These results provide a preliminary description of the seasonal variation and spatial distribution of thermal stratification, which is important for better understanding how thermal stratification affects algae blooms in Xiangxi River.

Effects of type and amount of crop residue in rainfed rice based cropping systems in Madagascar	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Weeds are a major constraint to crop yields in tropical production systems, especially for smallholder farmers who cannot afford to purchase herbicides. It has been argued that the practice of mulching with crop residues can suppress weeds in conservation agriculture systems. However, few data are available on the effect of crop residue mulching on weed infestation. In this study we quantified the effect of increasing amounts of surface crop residues on weed emergence, weed biomass production and rice yield. The experiment was conducted during four growing seasons in the Lake Alaotra region, Madagascar. Two types of mulch were applied on a no-tilled soil, Stylosanthes guianensis and a mixture of maize and Dolichos lablab, with different amounts ranging from 0 to 45 Mg dry matter ha(-1). Weed emergence was measured every week from the day of the first rain that triggered weed germination to 100 days thereafter, and weed biomass was monitored at four dates during the cropping season. Our results show that weed emergence and weed biomass decreased with increasing amount of residue. More than 10 Mg ha(-1) was, however, needed to significantly reduce weed emergence and weed biomass as compared to the bare soil treatment without surface residues. Rice grain yields decreased by 16% for an increase in weed biomass of one Mg ha(-1). Our results indicate that mulching is not a viable option of weed control for smallholder farmers, given the low amounts of residue currently retained on their fields, which is at best about 4 Mg ha(-1) in the case of a stylosanthes crop and about 5 Mg ha(-1) in case of dolichos intercropped with maize.					; Ripoche, Aude/AAV-3641-2020; Corbeels, Marc/ABA-3249-2022; Naudin, Krishna/G-3119-2010	Ripoche, Aude/0000-0001-6756-9777; Corbeels, Marc/0000-0002-8084-9287; Ranaivoson, Lalaina/0000-0002-7305-921X; Naudin, Krishna/0000-0002-9108-2456													0378-4290	1872-6852				MAR	2018	217						20	31		10.1016/j.fcr.2017.11.027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.11.027													WOS:000424187800003

A cluster analysis divided the 15 sampling sites into four significant spatial groups (Spatial Groups I-IV, respectively) that generally reflected the trends from north to south. The underwater light conditions in the northern spatial group (SG I) were significantly poorer than those in the other areas. All nutrient variables reached relatively higher concentrations in the southern spatial group (SG III) and the northern parts of the lake. At the annual scale, the water quality in Lake Poyang generally worsened during the study period, and the degradation was severe compared with that in the period from 1987 to 1988; the water quality also exhibited strong seasonality. The characteristics of the lake and the freshwater input from the watersheds with high human activity are the main contributors to the spatial heterogeneity in water quality in Lake Poyang. Dredging appears to play an important role in the underwater light conditions and nutrient distributions in Lake Poyang, especially in SG I, and non-point source pollution from industry and upstream mines may contribute to the high nutrient concentrations in SG I and SG III. Because human exploitation of the Lake Poyang Basin has increased, external pollution loads are the likely causes of the generally deteriorating water quality at the annual scale. Additionally, combined with the external loads, substantial fluctuations in water level contribute to a strong seasonality in water quality, especially variable nutrient concentrations. Degradation in Lake Poyang has occurred more rapidly than in the other 4 largest freshwater lakes in China. Our findings may be beneficial for preventing and controlling water pollution in Lake Poyang.

Distinctive Patterns of Water Level Change in Swedish Lakes Driven by Climate and Human Regulation	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Despite having approximately 100,000 lakes, Sweden has limited continuous gauged lake water level data. Although satellite radar altimetry (RA) has emerged as a popular alternative to measure water levels in inland water bodies, it has not yet been used to understand the large-scale changes in Swedish lakes. Here, we quantify the changes in water levels in 144 lakes using RA data and in situ gauged measurements to examine the effects of flow regulation and hydroclimatic variability. We use data from several RA missions, including ERS-2, ENVISAT, JASON-1,2,3, SARAL, and Sentinel-3A/B. We found that during 1995-2022, around 52% of the lakes exhibited an increasing trend and 43% a decreasing trend. Most lakes exhibiting an increasing trend were in the north of Sweden, while most lakes showing a decreasing trend were in the south. Regarding the potential effects of regulation, we found that unregulated lakes had smaller trends in water level and dynamic storage than regulated ones. While the seasonal patterns of water levels in the lakes in the north are similar in regulated and unregulated lakes, in the south, they differ substantially. This study highlights the need to continuously monitor lake water levels for adaptation strategies in the face of climate change and understand the downstream effects of water regulatory schemes. Energy production and water consumption have led to the regulation of many lakes in Sweden. To understand the consequences of human activities, we studied water level changes in 144 regulated and non-regulated lakes, utilizing satellite data. We found that regulated lakes show larger water level changes and variability compared to non-regulated ones. These findings underscore the need for effective adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of water regulatory schemes.

Daily, biweekly, and seasonal temporal scales of pCO2 variability in two stratified Mediterranean reservoirs	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Temporal scales of variability for the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in the surface waters of two stratified Mediterranean reservoirs were examined through the temporal decomposition of 5month time series with hourly sampling frequency. pCO(2) time series included similar patterns of variability at daily, biweekly, and seasonal scales regardless of the difference in amplitude of the pCO(2) variation in the two reservoirs studied. Daily variability was strongly related to the day-night cycles of metabolic activity, accounting for about one third of the total amplitude in pCO(2) variation. At a biweekly scale, wind forcing led to higher rates of air-water CO2 exchange and subsequently temporary partial mixing events associated to relevant increase of CO2 concentration in surface waters. Seasonal variability accounted for one third of the amplitude of the pCO(2) variability and was coupled to the seasonal dynamics of water temperature and thermal stratification of the water column. Our results provide evidence that CO2 emission from stratified water bodies shows significant variability at daily, biweekly, and seasonal scales; all of which should be taken into consideration in the analyses of the carbon fluxes. The wind-induced mixing events, operating at temporal scales between daily and seasonal cycles, may become a major factor controlling the pCO(2) dynamics. Hence, some of the most common models for computing CO2 fluxes from pCO(2) were not able to reproduce the biweekly response patterns of CO2 emissions to wind forcing.

Paleoecology of Early Pennsylvanian vegetation on a seasonally dry tropical landscape (Tynemouth Creek Formation, New Brunswick, Canada)	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The distribution and community ecology of Early Pennsylvanian ( middle Bashkirian, Langsettian) vegetation on a seasonally dry fluvial megafan is reconstructed from plant assemblages in the Tynemouth Creek Formation of New Brunswick, Canada. The principal motif of the redbed-dominated succession consists of degraded interfluve surfaces overlain by coarsening-upward aggradational sequences, a pattern that expresses the approach of an active channel system over a part of the megafan where landscape stasis prevailed. Accrual under a (dry) subhumid tropical climate, typified by a protracted dry season and a short wet season with torrential rainfall, resulted in Vertisol-like paleosols, episodic discharge and sedimentation, shallow channels incised into partially indurated interfluve strata, and scattered 'waterhole' deposits. Plant fossils, including many upright stumps, are preferentially preserved above paleosol-mantled interfluve surfaces, recording the inundation of a vegetated landscape. Quantitative analysis of 41 census-sampled megafloral assemblages collected in fades context indicates that a cordaitalean-rich flora dominated the dryland ecosystem. Less common was a wetland flora typical of tropical lowlands at coeval localities, comprising medullosalean pteridosperms and calamitaleans with rare ferns and lycopsids. 'Enigmatic thyland' plants, taxa of ambiguous affinity including Megalopteris, Pseudadiantites, and Palaeopteridium, were rare but surprisingly diverse. The taphonomic and sedimentologic context of fossiliferous horizons indicates that low-diversity, old-growth stands of gigantic cordaitaleans blanketed distal interfluves and inactive parts of the megafan, environs marked by limited deposition and extended paleosol development. Small patches of the pteridosperm-dominated wetland flora were interspersed within the dense cordaitalean forest, restricted to landforms that acted as waterholes during the dry season, such as perennial lakes, stagnant ponds, and seasonally active interfluve channels. In contrast, cordaitaleans and wetland plants formed mixed communities in disturbance-prone proximal interfluves and fluvial tracts, where more flooding and sedimentation resulted in less moisture-stressed conditions and a wider range of habitable landforms. Dense calamitalean groves persisted alongside fluvial channels, and an array of wetland plants occupied seasonally active abandoned channels that retained water throughout the year (waterholes). Rare 'enigmatic dryland' species were more prevalent in flood-prone fluvial tracts, and were dispersed within cordaitalean-dominated and wetland communities rather than forming discrete, compositionally unique patches. Although frequently characterized as 'extrabasinal' or 'upland' elements, this study confirms that these unusual plants occupied Pennsylvanian tropical lowlands during episodes of climatic drying.

Pilot and full scale applications of floating treatment wetlands for treating diffuse pollution	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Floating treatment wetlands (FTW) are nature-based solutions for the purification of open water systems such as rivers, ponds, and lakes polluted by diffuse sources as untreated or partially treated domestic wastewater and agricultural run-off. Compared with other physicochemical and biological technologies, FTW is a technology with low-cost, simple configuration, easy to operate; has a relatively high efficiency, and is energy-saving, and aesthetic. Water remediation in FTWs is supported by plant uptake and the growth of a biofilm on the water plant roots, so the selection of the macrophyte species is critical, not only to pollutant removal but also to the local ecosystem integrity, especially for full-scale implementation. The key factors such as buoyant frame/raft, plant growth support media, water depth, seasonal variation, and temperature have a considerable role in the design, operation, maintenance, and pollutant treatment performance of FTW. Harvesting is a necessary process to maintain efficient operation by limiting the re-pollution of plants in the decay phase. Furthermore, the harvested plant biomass can serve as a green source for the recovery of energy and value-added products.

As a trend of enhanced human activities and climate change, the mechanisms of burial remain poorly understood. In this study, diverse biogeochemical techniques were applied to analyze the temporal variation of organic carbon and nitrogen burial rates in Chaohu Lake. The results showed that burial rates have ranged from 9.39 to 35.87 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for carbon and from 1.66 to 5.67 g N m(-2) yr(-1) for nitrogen since the 1860s. The average rates were 19.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 3.14 g N m(-2) yr(-1) after the 1970s, which were significantly higher than the rate before the 1970s, showing an increasing trend. The decrease of C/N ratios as well as organic matter C-13 values indicates that the major organic matter source in sediment has been algal production since the 1970s. The increase of N-15 values indicated that the promotion in productivity was stimulated by nutrient input from sewage and agricultural runoff. The burial rates of organic carbon and nitrogen were significantly positively related to socio-economics and temperature, indicating that Chaohu Lake will become an increasing carbon and nitrogen pool under conditions of enhanced human activities and intensive precipitation.

The last 7 millennia of vegetation and climate changes at Lago di Pergusa (central Sicily, Italy)	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The aim of this study is to investigate climate changes and human activities under the lens of palynology. Based on a new high-resolution pollen sequence (PG2) from Lago di Pergusa (667 m a.s.l., central Sicily, Italy) covering the last 6700 yr, we propose a reconstruction of climate and landscape changes over the recent past in central Sicily. Compared to former studies from Lago di Pergusa (Sadori and Narcisi, 2001), this work provides a reconstruction of the evolution of vegetation and climate over the last millennia in central Sicily, indeed completing previous results with new pollen data, which is particularly detailed on the last 3000 yr. Joint actions of increasing dryness, climate oscillations, and human impact shaped the landscape of this privileged site. Lago di Pergusa, besides being the main inland lake of Sicily, is very sensitive to climate change and its territory was inhabited and exploited continuously since the Palaeolithic. The lake sediments turned out to be a good observatory for natural phenomena that occurred in the last thousands of years. Results of the pollen-based study are integrated with changes in magnetic susceptibility and a tephra layer characterization. The tephra layer was shown to be related to the Sicanians' event, radiocarbon dated at 3055 +/- 75 yr BP (Sadori and Narcisi, 2001). We performed palaeoclimate reconstructions by MAT (Modern Analogues Technique) and WAPLS (Weighted Average Partial Least Square). Palaeoclimate reconstructions based on the core show important climate fluctuations throughout the Holocene. Climate reconstruction points out four phases of cooling and enhanced wetness in the last three millennia (2600-2000, 1650-1100, 850-550, 400-200 cal BP, corresponding to the periods between 65050 BC, and 300-850, 1100-1400, 1550-1750 AD, respectively). This appears to be the evidence of local responses to global climate oscillations during the recent past.

In this study, snow cover dynamics of the four characteristic lake basins, Cedo Caka, Selin Co, Nam Co, and Yamzhog Yumco during hydrological years 2001-2010 (September through August) are examined at the basin scale using the flexible multiday combined MODIS snow cover products. The time series of multiday, seasonal, and annual snow covered area (SCA), onset/disappearance dates of snow, snow covered days (SCD), peaks of maximum SCA, and snow cover index (SCI) for each hydrological year (HY) are examined. Results show there is no obvious trend of snow cover change in the examined period, although Nam Co basin has the greatest SCA in all four basins and in all years, and Cedo Caka and Selin Co basins show the smallest SCA in most of the years. Overall, the HY2007 shows a greater snow extent and HY2010 a smaller for the region, with exceptions for the Nam Co basin where the HY2003 is the greatest and for Cedo Caka basin where the HY2004 is the smallest. Statistical analysis between lake level changes and lake basin's SCA, precipitation and pan evaporation (ETpan) changes shows that (1) Cedo Caka's water level rise was highly correlated with the basin's SCA changes (r = 0.94, p = 0.063); (2) Selin Co's water level rise was significantly correlated with the basin's SCA, precipitation and ETpan changes (r = 0.99, p = 0.029); and (3) lake level changes of Nam Co and Yamzhog Yumco were correlated with their corresponding lake basin's SCA, precipitation and ETpan changes (r = 0.87 and r = 0.86, respectively), although insignificant at the 95% level. This could have been due to precipitation and ETpan data of a distant meteorological station for Nam Co lake basin and the complex hydrological processes in the Yamzhog Yumco basin. This study suggests that the examination of time series snow cover dynamics is important to evaluate the water budget of lake basins with snow as a major component of water balance.

J	Pareeth, S; Karimi, P				Pareeth, S.; Karimi, P.			Evapotranspiration estimation using Surface Energy Balance Model and medium resolution satellite data: An operational approach for continuous monitoring	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Monitoring spatial and temporal trends of water use is of utmost importance to ensure water and food security in river basins that are challenged by water scarcity and climate change induced abnormal weather patterns. To quantify water consumption by the agriculture sector, continuous monitoring is required over different spatial scales ranging from field (< 1 ha) to basin. The demand driven requirement of covering large areas yet providing spatially distributed information makes the use of in-situ measurement devices unfeasible. Earth observation satellites and remote sensing techniques offer an effective alternative in estimating the consumptive use of water (Actual EvapoTranspiration (ETa) fluxes) by using periodic observations from the visible and infrared spectral region. Optical satellite data, however, is often hindered by noises due to cloud cover, cloud shadow, aerosols and other satellite related issues such as Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure in Landsat 7 breaking the continuity of temporal observations. These gaps have to be statistically filled in order to compute aggregated seasonal and annual estimates of ETa. In this paper, we introduce an approach to develop a gap-filled multi-year monthly ETa maps at medium spatial resolution of 30 m. The method includes two major steps: (i) estimation of ETa using the python based implementation of surface energy balance model called PySEBAL and (ii) temporal interpolation using Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) model followed by spline based spatial interpolation to fill the gaps over time and space. The approach is applied to a large endorheic Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) basin with a surface area of similar to 52,970 km(2) in Iran for the years 2013-2015 using Landsat 7 and 8 satellite data. The results show that the implemented gap filling approach could reconstruct the monthly ETa dynamics over different agriculture land use types, while retaining the high spatial variability. A comparison with a similar dataset from FAO WaPOR reported a very high correlation with R-2 of 0.93. The study demonstrates the applicability of this approach to a larger basin which is extendible and reproducible to other geographical areas.

The historical dependency of organic carbon burial efficiency	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Many studies have viewed lakes as quasi-static systems with regard to the rate of organic carbon (OC) burial, assuming that the dominant control on BE is sediment mineralization. However, in systems undergoing eutrophication or oligotrophication (i.e., altered nutrient loading), or climatic forcing, the changes in primary production will vary on both longer (> 10 yr) and shorter (seasonal) timescales, influencing the rate of OC accumulation and subsequent permanent burial. Here, we consider the extent to which permanent OC burial reflects changing production in a deep monomictic lake (Rostherne Mere, UK) that has been culturally eutrophied (present TP > 200 mu g L-1), but has undergone recent reductions in nutrient loading. We compare multi-year dynamics of OC fluxes using sediment traps to longer-term burial rates estimated from two 210 Pb-dated sediment cores. The recent sediment record demonstrates that most of the autochthonous OC is preserved (similar to 95% of OC captured in the deep trap and 86% of the NEP in the contemporary system), contrary to widely held assumptions that this more labile, algal-dominated OC component is not well preserved in lake sediments. A revised method for calculating BE for lakes which have undergone changes in primary productivity in recent decades is developed, which reduces some of problems inherent in existing approaches using historical sediment records averaged over the last 25-150 yr. We suggest that an appreciation of lakes in all biomes as ecosystems responding dynamically to recent human impact and climate change (for example) can improve up-scaled regional and global estimates of lake OC burial.

In Lake Erie, hypoxia typically occurs between July and October in the central basin; however, there is considerable interannual variability both spatially and temporally. The processes driving this interannual variability as well as the small-scale time variation in oxygen depletion (e.g., -0.7 to +0.3 mg L-1 d(-1)) were examined in a field study conducted in the western part of the central basin of Lake Erie in 2008 and 2009. Data were obtained from a spatial array of moorings as well as sampling cruises that examined the physical and biological conditions needed to investigate the dynamics of the oxygen depletion and create a vertical oxygen budget. The flux of oxygen through the thermocline to the hypolimnion was a significant source of oxygen equivalent to approximate to 18% of the total oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion over the stratified period. The total oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion was due to equivalent amounts of hypolimnetic oxygen demand due to respiration in the water column and flux of oxygen to the bottom due to sediment oxygen demand. This latter finding was strongly dependent on hypolimnion thickness in Lake Erie, which also appeared to be an important parameter driving the rate of oxygen depletion by controlling the vertical volumetric fluxes and hence the competition between vertical flux and community respiration in the hypolimnion of shallow lakes.

However, the extent and magnitude of these changes still remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the effects of periodically hydrologic alterations on physicochemical variables and Chl-a in the dam-induced urban Han-feng Lake, upstream of Three Gorges Reservoir. Shifts in Chl-a and 13 physicochemical variables were recorded monthly in the lake from January 2013 to December 2014. Chl-a was neither seasonal nor inter-annual differences while a few physical variables such as flow velocity (V) exhibited significantly seasonal variabilities, and chemical variables like total nitrogen (TN), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved silica (DSi) were markedly inter-annual differences. Higher TN:TP (40:1) and lower NO3-N:DSi (0.8:1) relative to balanced stoichiometric ratios suggested changes in composition of phytoplankton communities and potentially increased proportion of diatom in Hanfeng Lake. Chl-a was predicable by combination of dissolved oxygen (DO), TN and DSi in dry season, and by V alone in wet season. During the whole study period, Chl-a was solely negatively correlated with TN: TP, indicating decline in N concentration and increase in P could therefore increase Chl-a. Our results highlight pronounced decoupling of linkages between Chl-a and physicochemical variables affected by periodically hydrologic alterations in dam-induced aquatic systems.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) governs the spatial and temporal variations in CO2, yet relationships of the CO2 concentration (cCO(2)) and emission flux (FCO2) with DOM in urban lakes have rarely been reported. In this study, we monitored levels of cCO(2), FCO2, and the composition of DOM over a 24 h period at three sites during the dry and wet seasons in China's largest urban lake, Tangxun Lake. Our study found the ratio of day/night FCO2 (millimoles per square meter per day) decreased from the dry season (0.79; 7.68/9.68) to the wet season (0.25; 6.05/24.16), averaging 0.42 (6.77/15.97), implying that accounting for nighttime CO2 emissions can increase regional estimates by 70%. This study revealed that eutrophication affected diurnal CO2 emissions with greater algal growth enhancing daytime CO2 uptake and subsequently increasing nighttime CO2 emissions via DOM degradation (larger protein-like DOM fraction). We anticipate that the relative magnitude of FCO2 between day and night from lakes is likely to increase due to urbanization and climate change, underscoring the importance of treating urban lakes as a distinct group and integrating DOM dynamics into carbon cycling in future research.

With changing land use and climatic conditions, the need for improved understanding of nutrient loss from agricultural field to surface water is imperative to reduce consequences on human and aquatic life, such as perpetual algal blooms and contaminated drinking water. There remains a gap in holistic rural water management studies that investigate the understanding of the water cycle in rural settings and the interconnections between different components of the water cycle, including artificial drainage. In the current study, a year-round paired investigation of subsurface and nutrient dynamics was conducted in a small, intensively managed agricultural watershed within southwestern Ontario, Canada. Nutrients (Nitrate and Phosphorus) and stable isotopes of water (delta H-2 and delta O-18) were sampled at varying scales (i.e., field and watershed), from multiple hydrologic components (e.g., groundwater, surface water, tile flow, and soil water), from 2020 to 2022. Results indicate that nutrient concentrations in surface water were elevated during the growing season, while nutrient loading was greater during the non-growing season in surface water. Monthly nitrate loads were found to be significantly (p < 0.01) related to groundwater elevation, soil moisture and tile flow, whereas total phosphorus loading was found to be significantly (p < 0.01) related to soil moisture and tile flow. delta H-2 and delta O-18 signatures revealed that during the growing season nutrient movement was predominantly through interflow pathways (including tile drainage) comprised of event-water. In the non-growing season, there was an increased subsurface influence on nutrient transport. This study highlights the importance of including subsurface characterization in nutrient management studies. A comprehensive understanding of varying seasonal hydrologic mechanisms that control nutrient movement within an agricultural watershed is essential to sustain growing rural communities.

Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI) and Pearson product moment correlation were used to estimate monthly concentrations and associations between annual and seasonal rainfall. Similar methods were used to analyze the association of ENSO with rainfall variability using Eastern Equatorial Pacific (Nino 3.4) data, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Rainfall and temperature series were tested for trends using the Mann-Kendall test. Rainfall in the catchment is highly seasonal and concentrated in Kiremt (June-September), followed by Belg (February-May). Belg rainfall was highly variable. Annual rainfall was relatively stable in the upper catchment and variable in the lower catchment. PCI values are expected to increase as annual and seasonal rainfall decrease. The middle catchment had significant negative trends in annual and Belg rainfall. November-March SST is strongly associated with Belg rainfall variations throughout the catchment, and ~49% of the variability can be explained by Equatorial Pacific SST. Annual and seasonal temperature significantly increased in middle and lower parts of the catchment in the past 30 years. Warming was ~0.05 degrees C/yr to 0.17 degrees C/yr.

The spatiotemporal diversity of phytoplankton based on the monthly sampling between July 2011 and June 2012 was investigated in relation to physicochemical variables of the surface water column from 13 stations. The salinity was minimum (average 9) during the monsoon which was primarily due to riverine discharge. As the season progressed towards post-monsoon, average salinity of the whole lagoon reached to 10 which further increased to 20 during pre-monsoon season. A total of 259 species of phytoplankton, mostly dominated by the Bacillariophyta (138 species) followed by Dinophyta (38 species), Chlorophyta (32 species), Cyanophyta (29 species), Euglenophyta (18 species), and Chrysophyta (4 species), were recorded in this study. Different ecological sectors of the lagoon (except the northern sector) were dominated by diatoms, while the northern sector due to its freshwater regime supported large population of euglenoids. Based on the multivariate ordination analysis, salinity regime and light availability played important role in determining the distribution, diversity, and composition of phytoplankton communities. Overall, this study documented a very high diversity of phytoplankton and highlighted the importance of taking extensive sampling in getting a clearer understanding of phytoplankton community structure in less-studied environments such as Chilika lagoon.					; Srichandan, Suchismita/GRS-8988-2022; Bhadury, Punyasloke/A-2355-2008; barik, Saroja/F-7652-2019; RASTOGI, GURDEEP/AAQ-5076-2021; Muduli, Dr.Pradipta/A-7645-2016	srichandan, suchismita/0000-0002-3709-2442; Kim, Ji Yoon/0000-0001-5228-4939; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2015	187	2							47	10.1007/s10661-014-4212-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-4212-9								25638055					WOS:000349012200047

Based on phylogenetic data, members of the Isochrysidales have been classified into three groups with each group showing significant differences in alkenone profiles and preferred growth environments. Common carbon chain lengths of alkenones range from 37 to 40. Extended C-41 methyl (C41Me) and C-42 ethyl (C42Et) alkenones have been reported in hypersaline lakes in China (Lake Alahake and Lake Balikun), Canada (Lake Snakehole) and marine sediments (e.g., similar to 95 Ma in Blake-Bahama Basin). It is unclear, however, if these extended alkenones are produced by one or more groups of Isochrysidales. Here, we systematically examined alkenones from cultures of Group II (Isochrysis nuda, Isochrysis litoralis, Ruttnera lamellosa, Isochrysis galbana and Tisochrysis lutea) and Group III (Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica) Isochrysidales and environmental samples of Group I Isochysidales. C41Me and C42Et alkenones were found in all Group II species with Isochrysis nuda producing the highest percentages, but not in alkenones produced by Group I nor Group III Isochrysidales. Our results indicate that extended C41Me and C42Et alkenones are specific biomarkers for Group II Isochrysidales. We also report the first temperature calibrations of alkenones for Isochrysis nuda and Isochrysis litoralis using culture experiments, and find temperatures inferred from extended alkenones in Balikun and Alahake surface sediments match warm-season temperatures based on Isochrysis nuda calibrations, which is further corroborated by genomic data indicating the dominance of Isochrysis nuda Isochrysidales.

This study aimed to examine whether predictable patterns in water properties arise relative to oxbow lake geometry and lake-channel connectivity. We selected 24 oxbow lakes along a meandering river belt in Zoige Basin, the Tibetan Plateau, to conduct field work at the beginning (May) and the end (September) of the flood season, 2019. Six parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, total dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) were measured to represent water property. Lake surface area, length, width, length/width ratio, distance to active channel, and curvature were measured to represent lake geometry. Shrinkage ratio, defined as current lake length/initial lake length, was measured to represent lake-channel connectivity between oxbow lakes and active channel. We found an environmental gradient relative to connectivity. As oxbow lakes aged and gradually disconnected from the channel, increased DO and nutrients drove the lakes towards eutrophication. This trend however was disturbed by (i) flood pulses that diluted nutrient concentrations in oxbow lakes and narrowed the differences among different types of lakes and the channel through altering lake-channel connectivity, and (ii) lateral meander migration passed through older lakes such that regulated water properties by reconnecting older lakes to newly formed lakes. Maintenance or restoration of connectivity thus should be of great importance to prevent oxbow lakes from eutrophication in meandering river belts in Zoige Basin.

However, estimating DOC from optical remote sensing requires a robust relationship between CDOM and DOC. This is particularly problematic for reservoirs because they have variable dissolved organic matter composition that complicates the CDOM-DOC relationship. We investigated six manmade reservoirs along a temperate to tropical gradient that represent a range of reservoir types and watershed conditions to determine whether a linear relation between CDOM and DOC could be established. We measured CDOM absorption and DOC concentration during the wet and dry seasons in the six reservoirs. We found the CDOM absorption coefficient and CDOM spectral slope were uncorrelated due to exogenous DOC inputs from multiple sources. Alone, the absorption coefficient of CDOM was a poor predictor of DOC concentration. Including both CDOM absorption coefficient and spectral slope in a multiple regression accounted for both composition and concentration, significantly improving the regression r(2). By using both CDOM absorption coefficient and spectral slope, we identify a framework for a potential solution to overcome the influence of dissolved organic matter source and transformation history on the CDOM-DOC relationship. We conclude that local variability, seasonality and optical complexity should be considered in remote sensing based approaches for global freshwater DOC estimation.

Although inland water bodies have been investigated intensively, few studies have looked at the effect of human activities and climate variability on surface area of inland waters at a larger scale over time and space. In this study, we used MODIS (MOD13Q1) images to determine water surface area extent at 250 m spatial resolution. We then applied this algorithm with MOD13Q1 images taken at 16-day intervals from 2000 to 2018 to a large river basin in China's northeast high latitude region with dense stream network and abundant wetlands to investigate spatiotemporal distribution and dynamics of inland water bodies. The study identified 209 ponds, lakes, and reservoirs with an average total surface area of 2080 km(2) in the past 19 years. The total water surface area fluctuated largely from 942 km(2) to 5169 km(2), corresponding to rainfall intensity and flood. We found that the total water surface area in this high latitude river basin showed an increasing trend during the study period, while the annual precipitation amount in the river basin also had an increasing trend concurrently. Precipitation and irrigation significantly contributed to the monthly change of water surface area, which reached the highest during June and August. The increase of water surface area was significant in the lower basin floodplain region, where agricultural irrigation using groundwater for rice production has progressed. Four nationally important wetland preserves (Zhalong, Xianghai, Momoge, and Chagan Lake) in the river basin made up nearly 50% of the basin's total water surface area, of which Zhalong, Xianghai, and Momoge are designated by The Ramsar Convention as wetland sites of international importance. Seasonally, these water bodies reached their maximal surface area in August, when both the monsoon weather and agricultural discharge prevailed. This study demonstrates that water surface area in a high latitude river basin is affected by both human activities and climate variation, implying that high latitude regions will likely experience more changes in surface water distribution as global climate change continues and agriculture becomes intensified.

This study investigates the three approaches of bias correction, i.e., linear scaling (LS), local intensity scaling (LOCI) and power transformation (PT), on the three advanced satellite precipitation products (SPPs), i.e., CMORPH, TRMM and PERSIANN over the Langat river basin, Malaysia by focusing on five selected extreme floods due to northeast monsoon season. Results found the LS scheme was able to match the mean precipitation of every SPP but does not correct standard deviation (SD) or coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimations regardless of extreme floods selected. For LOCI scheme, only TRMM and CMORPH estimations in certain floods have showed some improvement in their results. This might be due to the rainfall threshold set in correcting process. PT scheme was found to be the best method as it improved most of the statistical performances as well as the rainfall distribution of the floods. Sensitivity of the parameters used in the bias correction is also investigated. PT scheme is found to be least sensitive in correcting the daily SPPs compared to the other two schemes. However, careful consideration should be given for correcting the CMORPH and PERSIANN estimations.

This paper presents a conceptual framework of the NSSA regional climate system components that may be linked to biomass burning, as well as detailed analyses of a variety of satellite data for 2001-2014 in conjunction with relevant model-assimilated variables. Satellite fire detections in NSSA show that the vast majority (>75%) occurs in the savanna and woody savanna land-cover types. Starting in the 2006-2007 burning season through the end of the analyzed data in 2014, peak burning activity showed a net decrease of 2-7%/yr in different parts of NSSA, especially in the savanna regions. However, fire distribution shows appreciable coincidence with land-cover change. Although there is variable mutual exchange of different land cover types, during 2003-2013, cropland increased at an estimated rate of 0.28%/yr of the total NSSA land area, with most of it (0.18%/yr) coming from savanna. During the last decade, conversion to croplands increased in some areas classified as forests and wetlands, posing a threat to these vital and vulnerable ecosystems. Seasonal peak burning is anti-correlated with annual water-cycle indicators such as precipitation, soil moisture, vegetation greenness, and evapotranspiration, except in humid West Africa (5 degrees-10 degrees latitude), where this anti-correlation occurs exclusively in the dry season and burning virtually stops when monthly mean precipitation reaches 4 mm d(-1). These results provide observational evidence of changes in land-cover and hydrological variables that are consistent with feedbacks from biomass burning in NSSA, and encourage more synergistic modeling and observational studies that can elaborate this feedback mechanism.					; Okonkwo, Churchill/Q-1224-2015; habib, Shahid/JYP-5696-2024; Policelli, Frederick/D-8994-2018; Gatebe, Charles/G-7094-2011; Bolten, John/F-9006-2012; Wang, Jun/ABE-2846-2020; Wang, Jun/A-2977-2008	Wilcox, Eric/0000-0002-1844-5046; Lee, Jejung/0000-0002-8253-3710; Ellison, Luke/0000-0002-9998-2512; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-7334-0490; 													1748-9326					SEP	2016	11	9							095005	10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/095005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/095005													WOS:000385393300001

The results showed that these antibiotics are widely present in the water bodies of this city, with a total concentration of up to 1.958 mu g L-1. The most abundant class was tetracyclines, contributing 43.7% to the total antibiotic burden. Lincomycin was detected in all samples, and the detection rate of clindamycin was 90.5%. An exploratory analysis of the data points was performed by unsupervised pattern recognition (hierarchical cluster analysis, HCA) in an attempt to clarify the pollution level in different sampling areas, and robust cluster solutions grouped the data according to their different antibiotic contaminant profiles. The safety of drinking water resources was emphasized, and the rivers, as the main receiving water body for treated and untreated wastewater in this city, were more seriously contaminated than the surrounding lakes and reservoir, not only in concentration but also in detection frequency, in our study as well as in similar research studies. A correlation analysis between the presence of antibiotics and the environmental factors was conducted, and it was found that antibiotic contamination and water quality were closely connected; the better the water quality, the lower the antibiotic contamination. Positive correlations existed between the antibiotics and tested heavy metals, as well as between antibiotics and boron and arsenic. However, whether these correlations resulted from their reaction or a common source was difficult to determine, and the mechanism requires further exploration.					liu, xinyi/KFB-4466-2024; lv, xiaojun/H-3511-2017; chen, siyi/KXR-2904-2024														0360-1234	1532-4109				MAR 3	2020	55	3					193	209		10.1080/03601234.2019.1679563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2019.1679563		OCT 2019						31658861					WOS:000493027000001

However, there is a high degree of uncertainty related to the balance between carbon and nitrogen cycling and storage. We collected 12 permafrost soil cores from six drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs) along a chronosequence north of Teshekpuk Lake in northern Alaska and analyzed them for carbon and nitrogen contents. For comparison, we included three lacustrine cores from an adjacent thermokarst lake and one soil core from a non thermokarst affected remnant upland. This allowed to calculate the carbon and nitrogen stocks of the three primary landscape units (DTLB, lake, and upland), to reconstruct the landscape history, and to analyze the effect of thermokarst lake formation and drainage on carbon and nitrogen stocks. We show that carbon and nitrogen contents and the carbon-nitrogen ratio are considerably lower in sediments of extant lakes than in the DTLB or upland cores indicating degradation of carbon during thermokarst lake formation. However, we found similar amounts of total carbon and nitrogen stocks due to the higher density of lacustrine sediments caused by the lack of ground ice compared to DTLB sediments. In addition, the radiocarbon-based landscape chronology for the past 7,000years reveals five successive lake stages of partially, spatially overlapping DTLBs in the study region, reflecting the dynamic nature of ice-rich permafrost deposits. With this study, we highlight the importance to include these dynamic landscapes in future permafrost carbon feedback models. Plain Language Summary When permanently frozen soils (permafrost) contain ice-rich sediments, the thawing of this permafrost causes the surface to sink, which may result in lake formation. This process, the thaw of ice-rich permafrost and melting of ground ice leads to characteristic landforms-known as thermokarst. Once such a thaw process is initiated in ice-rich sediments, a thaw lake forms and grows by shoreline erosion, eventually expanding until a drainage pathway is encountered and the lake eventually drains, resulting in a drained thermokarst lake basin. In our study, we show that such a thermokarst-affected landscape north of Teshekpuk Lake in northern Alaska is shaped by repeated thaw lake formation and lake drainage events during the past 7,000years, highlighting the dynamic nature of these landscapes. These landscape-scale processes have a big effect on the carbon and nitrogen stored in permafrost soils. We show that large amounts of carbon (>45kg C/m(2)) and nitrogen (>2.6kg N/m(2)) are stored in unfrozen lake sediments and in frozen soil sediments. The findings are important when considering the potential effect that permafrost thaw has for the global climate through releasing carbon and nitrogen, which was frozen and therefore locked away for millennia, from the active carbon cycle.					; Günther, Frank/O-5226-2015; Gunther, Frank/O-5226-2015; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011; Strauss, Jens/P-6544-2014; Fuchs, Matthias/JKI-2484-2023	Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Nitze, Ingmar/0000-0002-1165-6852; Gunther, Frank/0000-0001-8298-8937; Fuchs, Matthias/0000-0003-3529-8284; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141; Strauss, Jens/0000-0003-4678-4982; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAY	2019	124	5					1230	1247		10.1029/2018JG004591	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004591								31341754					WOS:000477719600013

Fire, climate and vegetation linkages in the Bolivian Chiquitano seasonally dry tropical forest	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES					Royal-Society Scientific Meeting	SEP 14-15, 2015	Royal Soc, London, ENGLAND		Royal Soc			South American seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) are critically endangered, with only a small proportion of their original distribution remaining. This paper presents a 12 000 year reconstruction of climate change, fire and vegetation dynamics in the Bolivian Chiquitano SDTF, based upon pollen and charcoal analysis, to examine the resilience of this ecosystem to drought and fire. Our analysis demonstrates a complex relationship between climate, fire and floristic composition over multi-millennial time scales, and reveals that moisture variability is the dominant control upon community turnover in this ecosystem. Maximum drought during the Early Holocene, consistent with regional drought reconstructions, correlates with a period of significant fire activity between 8000 and 7000 cal yr BP which resulted in a decrease in SDTF diversity. As fire activity declined but severe regional droughts persisted through the Middle Holocene, SDTFs, including Anadenanthera and Astronium, became firmly established in the Bolivian lowlands. The trend of decreasing fire activity during the last two millennia promotes the idea among forest ecologists that SDTFs are threatened by fire. Our analysis shows that the Chiquitano seasonally dry biome has been more resilient to Holocene changes in climate and fire regime than previously assumed, but raises questions over whether this resilience will continue in the future under increased temperatures and drought coupled with a higher frequency anthropogenic fire regime.

The mean concentration of total PFAAs (TPFAAs) was 14.46 +/- 6.84 ng/L PFOA was the predominant contaminant (8.62 +/- 4.40 ng/L), followed by PFBA (2.04 +/- 1.16 ng/L) and PFHxA (1.23 +/- 1.50 ng/L). The TPFAAs concentrations peaked in August 2012 in each area, except for the western river. The opposite spatial trends were found for PFOA and PFOS in both the lake and river areas. Except for PFOS and PFUdA, the levels of TPFAAs and PFAAs were significantly related to the composition of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) but not related to total DOM expressed by dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The risk of PFOS determined by a species sensitivity distribution model was notably above that of PFOA.

J	Rocha, MDD; Neto, IEL				Delmiro Rocha, Maria de Jesus; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo			Phosphorus mass balance and input load estimation from the wet and dry periods in tropical semiarid reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The dynamics of total phosphorus (TP) in 18 strategic reservoirs of the high-density reservoir network of the Brazilian semiarid was evaluated during the wet and dry periods for the past 12 years. Seasonal overlying concentrations presented no significant differences for about 90% of the reservoirs (p>0.05). This was attributed to a trade-off between the hydrological/limnological processes occurring in the two seasons. Then, a transient complete-mix mass balance model was applied with particular adaptations for the tropical semiarid reservoirs to estimate the TP load for each season. Because of the relatively well-mixed conditions and high hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations during the wet season, the wet load was assumed to represent the external TP load. On the other hand, because of the absence of reservoir inflow during the dry season, phosphorus release under anoxic sediment conditions and wind-induced resuspension under shallow water depths, the dry load was assumed to reflect the internal TP load. The maximum external loads were related to peak inflows, notably after drought periods. Consistently, the largest internal loads were obtained during the drought periods, when the reservoirs were shallower and more prone to phosphorus release and resuspension. By comparing the impact of the two input load types, the wet period load was predominant in 72% of the reservoirs. The areal phosphorus loads ranged from 0.66 to 7.29 gP m(2) year(-1), which were consistent with the literature, despite the very high density of reservoirs. Finally, power-law curves including data for all studied reservoirs were adjusted between the dry period load and volume, dry and wet period loads, wet period load and inflow, and total load and catchment area, resulting in satisfactory R-2 (0.84-0.98).

Traditional organochlorine pesticides were not enough to reflect ecological risk. We performed the high-throughput and non-targeted screening to identify the high-residue and wide-distribution pesticides at farmland-river interlaced area. We firstly reported the residue level and spatio-temporal distribution of typical pesticides in soils and waters (SP1-SP13) near Fuhe river in 2020-2021. The mean recoveries of eight pesticides ranged from 79.4 to 129%. The residues were 0.250-3530 ng/L (water) and 2.79 x 10(-3)-647 mu g/kg dw (soil), respectively. Thiamethoxam was dominant with the high-residue proportion (HRP) of 53-95% (water, HRP > 50%) and 63-97% (soil, HRP > 60%), respectively. Most of pesticides almost have no significant season-change. The risk quotient (RQ) model results showed that although most pesticides have no aquatic risk (RQ < 0.01), carbendazim and propionazole deserved attention. The individual thiamethoxam at nearly half of the sites exhibited high terrestrial risk (RQ, 1.070-1.682), while propiconazole was at medium risk (SP1, SP2, SP8, and SP9) and high risk (SP12). The RQ(all) were in the range of 0.4541-3.327 (earthworm), 0.0239-0.4552 (algae), 0.1094-1.103 (aquatic invertabrates), and 0.1657-1.923 (fish), respectively, so co-residue caused joint toxic effect to aquatic invertebrates.

Water Quality Monitoring Using Remote Sensing and an Artificial Neural Network	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												In remotely located watersheds or large waterbodies, monitoring water quality parameters is often not feasible because of high costs and site inaccessibility. A cost-effective remote sensing-based methodology was developed to predict water quality parameters over a large and logistically difficult area. Landsat spectral data were used as a proxy, and a neural network model was developed to quantify water quality parameters, namely chlorophyll-a, turbidity, and phosphorus before and after ecosystem restoration and during the wet and dry seasons. The results demonstrate that the developed neural network model provided an excellent relationship between the observed and simulated water quality parameters. These correlated for a specific region in the greater Florida Everglades at R (2) > 0.95 in 1998-1999 and in 2009-2010 (dry and wet seasons). Moreover, the root mean square error values for phosphorus, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a were below 0.03 mg L-1, 0.5 NTU, and 0.17 mg m(-3), respectively, at the neural network training and validation phases. Using the developed methodology, the trends for temporal and spatial dynamics of the selected water quality parameters were investigated. In addition, the amounts of phosphorus and chlorophyll-a stored in the water column were calculated demonstrating the usefulness of this methodology to predict water quality parameters in complex ecosystems.

We address this challenge in the thermokarst landscape of Old Crow Flats (OCF) using a combination of remote sensing imagery and monitoring of stable isotope compositions of lake waters over three thaw seasons (2007-2009). Quantitative analysis confirmed that the hydrological behavior of lakes is strongly influenced by catchment vegetation and physiography. Catchments of snowmelt-dominated lakes, typically located in southern peripheral areas of OCF, encompass high proportions of woodland/forest and tall shrub vegetation (mean percent land cover = ca. 60%). These land cover types effectively capture snow and generate abundant snowmelt runoff that offsets lake water evaporation. Rainfall-dominated lakes that are not strongly influenced by evaporation are typically located in eastern and northern OCF where their catchments have higher proportions of dwarf shrub/herbaceous and sparse vegetation (ca. 45%), as well as surface water (ca. 20%). Evaporation-dominated lakes, are located in the OCF interior where their catchments are distinguished by substantially higher lake area to catchment area ratios (LA/CA = ca. 29%) compared to low evaporation-influenced rainfall-dominated (ca. 10%) and snowmelt-dominated (ca. 4%) lakes. Lakes whose catchments contain >75% combined dwarf shrub/herbaceous vegetation and surface water are most susceptible to evaporative lake-level drawdown, especially following periods of low precipitation. Findings indicate that multiple hydrological trajectories are probable in response to climate-driven changes in precipitation amount and seasonality, vegetation composition, and thermokarst processes. These will likely include a shift to greater snowmelt influence in catchments experiencing expansion of tall shrubs, greater influence from evaporation in catchments having higher proportions of surface water, and an increase in the rate of thermokarst lake expansion and probability of drainage. Local observations suggest that some of these changes are already underway.

The concentrations in the sediment phase were 47.92-88.28 & mu;g/kg, 159.87-446.64 & mu;g/kg, and 29.43-99.62 & mu;g/kg, respectively. The concentrations in the soil phase were 23.62-50.76 & mu;g/kg, 96.85-184.19 & mu;g/kg, and 21.02-37.02 & mu;g/kg, respectively. Seasonal hydrology, hydraulic retention time, precipitation, temperature, and biological metabolism all impacted the concentration and composition of pesticides, but no apparent environmental gradient effect was found within the reservoir. Redundancy analysis indicated that NO3- , Dissolved oxygen (DO), Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Organic nitrogen (ON), and Inorganic carbon (IC) were the main environmental parameters affecting pesticide concentrations. The pseudo-partitioning values in water and porewater ranged from 1.2 to 3.3 x 104 and 22.0-61.7 L/kg, respectively. The ecological risk was low for OCPs, moderate for OPPs, and high for SPs in the water phase. SPs should be considered a priority indicator for risk assessment. Future conservation efforts for reservoir system should focus on pollution prevention in the soil phase.					; Chai, Di/AAC-6063-2020; Guo, Zhi/M-8768-2018; Yu, Kai-Feng/AFU-9610-2022	CHEN, Xing/0000-0003-2762-7498; 													2213-2929	2213-3437				OCT	2023	11	5							110513	10.1016/j.jece.2023.110513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2023.110513		JUL 2023											WOS:001048569500001
J	Jones, RI; Grey, J				Jones, Roger I.; Grey, Jonathan			Biogenic methane in freshwater food webs	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P> It has long been known that substantial amounts of methane are produced in anoxic lake sediments, and the components of the methane cycle in lakes have been well described. At oxic-anoxic interfaces, methane-oxidising bacteria (MOB) convert methane to microbial biomass and can be highly productive. However, only recently has methane been recognised as a potentially important carbon and energy source for lake food webs, and some instances have also been reported of methane contribution to river food webs. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) has provided compelling evidence in this respect and has been supplemented by other lines of evidence. In the benthic food webs of lakes, profundal chironomid larvae appear to be the main conduits for trophic transfer of biogenic methane via grazing on MOB. The mode of feeding of these larvae and the microhabitats they generate both promote larval ability to exploit MOB production. Support to chironomid larvae from methane is rather widespread, but its degree is highly variable; estimates suggest that in some lakes methane-carbon might contribute more than 60% of chironomid carbon biomass. Evidence of crustacean zooplankton in lakes deriving part of their carbon from methane is currently more limited. Reports from some lakes have indicated Daphnia with a substantial (> 50%) contribution of methane-carbon in their biomass. However, for this to happen, an oxic-anoxic interface where sufficient MOB production can occur needs to be within the range of vertical migrations by zooplankton, which may only rarely be the case. Hence, a significant methane subsidy of pelagic food webs in lakes is probably much less widespread than for benthic food webs. There is also recent and currently very limited evidence that some stream benthos derives biomass carbon (reported values up to 30%) from methane. This can occur in stagnant backwater pools where conditions can be analogous to those in lake sediments. However, groundwater aquifers can also supply water supersaturated with methane to some rivers, providing a basis for a microbially-mediated transfer of methane-carbon to river benthos. Evidence for significant transfer of methane-derived carbon to higher trophic levels is still very limited. Within some lakes, those fish species that feed extensively on chironomid larvae can derive a substantial part (perhaps up to 20%) of their carbon biomass from methane. It is also likely that methane-carbon produced in lakes or rivers is exported to riparian ecosystems when emerging chironomids or other insects are eaten by invertebrate or avian predators. We argue that conceptual models of freshwater food webs, and especially those for lakes, need to be modified to enable incorporation of biogenic methane as a carbon and energy source. For some types of lakes, carbon and energy budgets certainly need to take account of the production and utilisation of biogenic methane, and the accumulating evidence indicates that this is a more widespread phenomenon that has generally been acknowledged hitherto.

Loss of a lake system in a megacity: The impact of urban expansion on seasonal meteorology in Mexico City	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) has undergone significant urban expansion in a closed basin that once supported a large lacustrine system. While urbanization has been mentioned as a factor in observed meteorological trends, a systematic study of the effects of land use-land cover change (LULCC) on seasonal meteorology is lacking. In this study, we utilize the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) system to determine the spatiotemporal changes in near-surface air temperature, precipitation, and boundary layer conditions induced by the modern-day urban landscape relative to presettlement conditions. We capture the MCMA extent through an improved Landsat-based multicategory urban classification and therefore account for intraurban spatial heterogeneity and further conduct additional experiments to examine the sensitivity to anthropogenic heating within WRF. We find that accounting for these factors produced the best simulations of thermal conditions, with RMSE values less than 1.5 degrees C at all measurement stations, and an improved diurnal cycle of air temperature and precipitation. We then assessed the impacts of LULCC in the MCMA, finding that thermal changes were largest during daytime hours, with temperature increasing, on average, by more than 4 degrees C. Furthermore, we utilize these simulations to mechanistically link the built environment-induced increase in air temperature to simulated increases in rainfall during the evening hours. To our knowledge, this study provides the first dynamical and thermodynamical evidence to support the rainfall enhancements documented through observations in the MCMA and link it quantitatively to the warming effects associated with urbanization. These results have important implications for understanding the meteorological conditions leading to widespread urban flooding in the MCMA.

J	Swenson, S; Wahr, J				Swenson, Sean; Wahr, John			Monitoring the water balance of Lake Victoria, East Africa, from space	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Using satellite gravimetric and altimetric data, we examine trends in water storage and lake levels of multiple lakes in the Great Rift Valley region of East Africa for the years 2003-2008. GRACE total water storage estimates reveal that water storage declined in much of East Africa, by as much as 60 mm/year, while altimetric data show that lake levels in some large lakes dropped by as much as 1-2 m. The largest declines occurred in Lake Victoria, the Earth's second largest freshwater body. Because the discharge from the outlet of Lake Victoria is used to generate hydroelectric power, the role of human management in the lake's decline has been questioned. By comparing catchment water storage trends to lake level trends, we confirm that climatic forcing explains only about 50decline. This analysis provides an independent means of assessing the relative impacts of climate and human management on the water balance of Lake Victoria that does not depend on observations of dam discharge, which may not be publically available. In the second part of the study, the individual components of the lake water balance are estimated. Satellite estimates of changes in lake level, precipitation, and evaporation are used with observed lake discharge to develop a parameterization for estimating subsurface inflows due to changes in groundwater storage estimated from satellite gravimetry. At seasonal timescales, this approach provides closure to Lake Victoria's water balance to within 17 mm/month. The third part of this study uses the water balance of a downstream water body, Lake Kyoga, to estimate the outflow from Lake Victoria remotely. Because Lake Kyoga is roughly 20 times smaller in area than Lake Victoria, its water balance is strongly influenced by inflow from Lake Victoria. Lake Kyoga has been shown to act as a linear reservoir, where its outflow is proportional to the height of the lake. This model can be used with satellite altimetric lake levels to estimate a time series of Lake Victoria discharge with an rms error of about 134 m(3)/s. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Simiyu, BM; Amukhuma, HS; Sitoki, L; Okello, W; Kurmayer, R				Simiyu, Benard Mucholwa; Amukhuma, Harold Sabula; Sitoki, Lewis; Okello, William; Kurmayer, Rainer			Interannual variability of water quality conditions in the Nyanza Gulf of Lake Victoria, Kenya	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Nyanza Gulf of Lake Victoria is considered eutrophic with degrading water quality, as shown by harmful algal blooms formed by cyanobacteria of the genus Microcystis. The dilution of gulf water occurs mainly through the wide Rusinga Channel, whereas the much narrower and shallower Mbita Channel was reopened in May 2017. Specific conductivity and phytoplankton biovolume composition were mon-itored monthly from July 2017 to July 2018 at three stations and compared with records during 2008 - 2009, when higher eutrophication was observed, in the west gulf (WG, closely located to the Mbita Channel), the mid gulf (central part of the gulf), and the east gulf (EG, close to Kisumu City). As previously observed, conductivity showed a distinct increase from the WG to the EG but compared with records 2008-2009 it had decreased. Water level fluctuations, resulting from wind possibly causing water exchange with the main basin, were related to the decrease in conductivity at the EG. When all three sta-tions were compared, the environmental variable transparency was positively related to most phyto-plankton genera, whereas the genera Dolichospermum, Microcystis, and Aulacoseira were related to eutrophication. Compared with the period 2008-2009, the proportion of Microcystis decreased, while the proportion of Aulacoseira increased. Compared with the period 2008-2009, the observed dilution at the EG was primarily related to the overall increased water level in the main basin. The observed dilu-tional influence might have led to a decline in nuisance phytoplankton and overall improved water qual-ity conditions. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Current-Use Brominated Flame Betardants in Water, Sediment, and Fish from English Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Concentrations are reported of hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) and tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A) in water (n = 27), sediment (n = 9), and fish samples (n = 30) from nine English lakes. Seasonal variation in concentrations in water is minimal. Concentrations of TBBP-A range from 140 to 3200 pig L-I (water), 330 to 3800 pg g(-1) dry weight (sediment), and <0.29 to 1.7 ng g(-1) lipid weight (fish). Those of Sigma HBCDs range between 80 and 270 pg L-1 (water), 880 and 4800 pg g(-1) dry weight (sediment), and 14 and 290 ng g(-1) lipid weight (fish). Aqueous concentrations of Sigma HBCDs and TBBP-A are significantly positively correlated, indicating a common source. Average a "freely-dissolved" phase proportions are 47 +/- 4.7% (Sigma HBCDs) and 61 +/-2.9% (TBBP-A). Average field-derived bioaccumulation factors are 5900, 1300, 810, and 2100 for alpha-, beta-,gamma-, and Sigma HBCDs, respectively. Tetrabromocyclododecadienes are detected in all sediments, with pentabromocyclododecenes present in some. This suggests HBCD degrades via sequential loss of HBr. The delta-HBCD meso form was quantified in 43% of fish samples (1.0-11% Sigma HBCDs). Its absence from temporally and spatially consistent water and sediment samples suggests it is formed via bioisomerization. While HBCD chiral signatures are racemic in water and sediment, our data reveal enantiomeric enrichment of (-)alpha-HBCD and (+)gamma-HBCD in fish.

This study focused on the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) by examining the co-occurrence of OPFRs and their metabolites and quantifying their transport fluxes using a mass balance model. The seawater concentrations of OPFRs and their metabolites exhibited significant seasonal variations (p < 0.01), while the sediment concentrations of OPFRs reflected the long-term distributional equilibrium in the PRE. The concentration of Sigma(9)OPFRs in seawater showed a relentless dilution from the entrance to the offshore region in the normal and wet seasons, which was significantly in accordance with the gradients of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and salinity (p < 0.05). Furthermore, horizontal migration dominated the transport of OPFRs, and the inventory assessment revealed that both the water column and sediment were important reservoirs in the PRE. According to the estimated fluxes from the mass balance model, riverine input emerged as the principal pathway for OPFR entry into the PRE (1.55 x 10(5), 6.28 x 10(4), and 9.00 x 10(4) kg/yr in the normal, dry and wet seasons, respectively), whereas outflow to the open sea predominantly determined the main fates of the OPFRs. The risk quotient (RQ) results showed that EHDPHP (0.835) in water posed medium ecological risk, while other OPFRs and metabolites presented relatively lower risk (RQ < 0.1). The risk control effects were evaluated through scenario simulations of mathematical fitting between controllable source factors and the RQ of risky OPFR. The risk of EHDPHP in the PRE could be effectively reduced by restricting its concentrations in entrance region (<9.31, 8.67, and 12.7 ng/L in the normal, dry and wet seasons, respectively) of the PRE. This research offers foundational insights into environmental management and pollution control strategies for emerging pollutants in estuaries.					; 李, 连之/AFS-3203-2022; Xu, Xiangrong/B-7054-2011; hou, rui/AFO-5276-2022; li, Jiaxin/GSO-0978-2022	Hou, Rui/0000-0002-9614-883X; Huang, Qianyi/0009-0002-4800-4177; 													0160-4120	1873-6750				FEB	2024	184								108478	10.1016/j.envint.2024.108478	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2024.108478		FEB 2024						38330749					WOS:001178743200001
J	Huang, CF; Anderson, E; Liu, Y; Ma, GF; Mann, G; Xue, PF				Huang, Chenfu; Anderson, Eric; Liu, Yi; Ma, Gangfeng; Mann, Greg; Xue, Pengfei			Evaluating essential processes and forecast requirements for meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding	NATURAL HAZARDS												Meteotsunamis pose a unique threat to coastal communities and often lead to damage of coastal infrastructure, deluge of nearby property, and loss of life and injury. The Great Lakes are a known hot-spot of meteotsunami activity and serve as an important region for investigation of essential hydrodynamic processes and model forecast requirements in meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding. For this work, we developed an advanced hydrodynamic model and evaluate key model attributes and dynamic processes, including: (1) coastal model grid resolution and wetting and drying process in low-lying zones, (2) coastal infrastructure, including breakwaters and associated submerging and overtopping processes, (3) annual/seasonal (ambient) water level change, and (4) wind wave-current coupling. Numerical experiments are designed to evaluate the importance of these attributes to meteotsunami modeling, including a "representative storm" scenario in the context of regional climate change in which a meteotsunami wave is generated under high ambient lake-level conditions with a preferable wind direction and speed for wind-wave growth. Results demonstrate that accurate representation of coastal topography and fully resolving associated hydrodynamic processes are critical to forecasting the realistic hazards associated with meteotsunami events. As most of existing coastal forecast systems generally do not resolve many of these features due to insufficient model grid resolution or lack of essential model attributes, this work shows that calibrating or assessing existing forecast models against coastal water level gauges alone may result in underestimating the meteotsunami hazard, particularly when gauging stations are sparse and located behind harbor breakwaters or inside estuaries, which represent dampened or otherwise unrepresentative pictures of meteotsunami intensity. This work is the first hydrodynamic modeling of meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding for the Great Lakes, and serves as a template to guide where resources may be most beneficial in forecast system development and implementation.

Remote monitoring of sediment dynamics in a coastal lagoon: Long-term spatio-temporal variability of suspended sediment in Chilika	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												We present a comprehensive analysis of sediment dynamics in a coastal lagoon by synthesizing various remote sensing datasets. The goal of the study was to monitor and analyze the spatio-temporal variability of total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration and associated environmental forcings in Chilika Lagoon, the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance cloud free data was used to calibrate a TSS model. MODIS daily 250 m surface reflectance (MOD09GQ) and 8-day composite products (MOD09Q1) were chosen because they are atmospherically corrected and available for free thus making them widely applicable for frequent monitoring of environmental phenomena. Three variants of Miller and McKee (2004) TSS model were recalibrated to establish the relationship between in situ TSS and surface reflectance value in band 1 (R-rs at 645 nm). A significant relationship (R-2 = 0.91; n = 54; p < 0.001) was obtained between in situ TSS and MODIS R-rs (645 nm) using a polynomial model. The other two models, exponential and linear, showed comparatively low R-2 (0.77 and 0.73 respectively). Accuracy of the models were assessed by comparing the field measured TSS with MODIS derived TSS. Based on R-2 values, validation analysis (RMSE = 2.64 mg/L), and residual trend, the polynomial model was found to be the best performing TSS model with an estimation range of 6.5 mg/L - 200 mg/L. The model was then implemented to derive weekly time-series TSS maps of Chilika Lagoon for 14 years (2001-2014). Marked seasonal and inter annual variations in TSS distribution were observed in different sectors (northern, central and southern) of the lagoon. It was found that the TSS variability is primarily driven by three factors: monsoon effect (precipitation and runoff), wind-driven bottom re-suspension, and river discharge into the lagoon. Further analysis of the relationship between MODIS derived time-series TSS and meteorological parameters revealed that the variability of TSS in the northern sector is highly correlated with precipitation and runoff, whereas, TSS dynamics in southern sector is mainly governed by wind induced re-suspension events. The applicability of the TSS model was demonstrated by analyzing the impact of a recent category-5 cyclone, Phailin, which showed a significant increase in TSS concentration in the lagoon. This is the first of its kind study to comprehensively examine the long term TSS dynamics of Chilika, moreover, the model developed in this research was implemented in various coastal lagoons and estuaries around the world and was proven effective in quantifying TSS.

However, little is known about how the regional spatial heterogeneity of lake biotic communities changes with restoration across a landscape. Using a long-term monitoring dataset from 20 Danish lakes, we elucidated the seasonal and long-term trends in the spatial heterogeneity of climate, local abiotic variables and phytoplankton communities over two decades of restoration and climate change at landscape level. We found significant seasonality in the spatial heterogeneity of most climatic and local drivers as well as in the total beta diversity (Sorensen coefficient) and its turnover components (Simpson coefficient) of phytoplankton communities among the lakes. The seasonality tended to be less marked in deep than in shallow lakes. We found significant spatial homogenisation of most local drivers (except for alkalinity) and phytoplankton communities after two decades of restoration and that turnover dominated the temporal responses of the total beta diversity of phytoplankton communities. Path analyses showed that the homogenisation of phytoplankton communities was mainly due to a decrease in spatial heterogeneity of total phosphorus and Schmidt stability in shallow lakes and to a decrease in spatial total phosphorus and total nitrogen heterogeneity in deep lakes. However, albeit weakly, the spatial heterogeneity of the phytoplankton communities was affected indirectly by climatic warming in both shallow and deep lakes and directly by wind speed in shallow lakes. We conclude that restoration of eutrophic lakes may lead to an increase in the local heterogeneity of phytoplankton communities at lake scale and an increase in homogeneity at landscape scale.

Landscape genetics of high mountain frog metapopulations	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Explaining functional connectivity among occupied habitats is crucial for understanding metapopulation dynamics and species ecology. Landscape genetics has primarily focused on elucidating how ecological features between observations influence gene flow. Functional connectivity, however, may be the result of both these between-site (landscape resistance) landscape characteristics and at-site (patch quality) landscape processes that can be captured using network based models. We test hypotheses of functional connectivity that include both between-site and at-site landscape processes in metapopulations of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) by employing a novel justification of gravity models for landscape genetics (eight microsatellite loci, 37 sites, n = 441). Primarily used in transportation and economic geography, gravity models are a unique approach as flow (e.g. gene flow) is explained as a function of three basic components: distance between sites, production/attraction (e.g. at-site landscape process) and resistance (e.g. between-site landscape process). The study system contains a network of nutrient poor high mountain lakes where we hypothesized a short growing season and complex topography between sites limit R. luteiventris gene flow. In addition, we hypothesized production of offspring is limited by breeding site characteristics such as the introduction of predatory fish and inherent site productivity. We found that R. luteiventris connectivity was negatively correlated with distance between sites, presence of predatory fish (at-site) and topographic complexity (between-site). Conversely, site productivity (as measured by heat load index, at-site) and growing season (as measured by frost-free period between-sites) were positively correlated with gene flow. The negative effect of predation and positive effect of site productivity, in concert with bottleneck tests, support the presence of source-sink dynamics. In conclusion, gravity models provide a powerful new modelling approach for examining a wide range of both basic and applied questions in landscape genetics.

Schistosomiasis in the People's Republic of China: the Era of the Three Gorges Dam	CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS												The potential impact of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on schistosomiasis transmission in China has invoked considerable global concern. The TGD will result in changes in the water level and silt deposition downstream, favoring the reproduction of Oncomelania snails. Combined with blockages of the Yangtze River's tributaries, these changes will increase the schistosomiasis transmission season within the marshlands along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The changing schistosome transmission dynamics necessitate a comprehensive strategy to control schistosomiasis. This review discusses aspects of the epidemiology and transmission of Schistosoma japonicum in China and considers the pathology, clinical outcomes, diagnosis, treatment, immunobiology, and genetics of schistosomiasis japonica together with an overview of current progress in vaccine development, all of which will have an impact on future control efforts. The use of synchronous praziquantel (PZQ) chemotherapy for humans and domestic animals is only temporarily effective, as schistosome reinfection occurs rapidly. Drug delivery requires a substantial infrastructure to regularly cover all parts of an area of endemicity. This makes chemotherapy expensive and, as compliance is often low, a less than satisfactory control option. There is increasing disquiet about the possibility that PZQ-resistant schistosomes will develop. Consequently, as mathematical modeling predicts, vaccine strategies represent an essential component in the future control of schistosomiasis in China. With the inclusion of focal mollusciciding, improvements in sanitation, and health education into the control scenario, China's target of reducing the level of schistosome infection to less than 1% by 2015 may be achievable.

The Comparison of Fatty Acid Composition and Lipid Quality Indices of Roach, Perch, and Pike of Lake Gusinoe (Western Transbaikalia)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												This paper describes the study of the fatty acid (FA) composition of three fish species (roach, perch, and pike) from Lake Gusinoe (western Transbaikalia). Using principal component analysis, the fatty acid composition of the studied fish species was shown to be species specific. The muscle tissue of roach, perch, and pike was found to contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including essential docosahexaenoic (DHA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and arachidonic acids. Indicators of nutritional quality based on the fatty acid composition showed that the values of the hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic (HH) ratio indices were sufficiently high. The atherogenicity (AI) and thrombogenicity (TI) indices, which are indicators for the nutritional value, were less than 1 in the studied fish. In terms of flesh lipid quality (FLQ), pike and perch had the highest proportion of total EPA + DHA. According to the obtained data for the composition of fatty acids in the muscle tissue of the studied fish from Lake Gusinoe, the anthropogenic load exerted on Lake Gusinoe has not yet statistically significantly affected the fish muscle quality.

Prolific Lightning and Thunderstorm Initiation over the Lake Victoria Basin in East Africa	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The Lake Victoria basin of East Africa is home to over 30 million people, over 200 000 of whom are employed in fishing or transportation on the lake. Approximately 3000-5000 individuals are killed by thunderstorms yearly, primarily by outflow winds and resulting large waves. Prolific lightning activity and thunderstorm initiation in the basin are examined using continuous total lightning observations from the Earth Networks Global Lightning Network (ENGLN) for September 2014-August 2018. Seasonal shifts in the intertropical convergence zone produce semiannual lightning maxima over the lake. Diurnally, solar heating and lake and valley breezes produce daytime lightning maxima north and east of the lake, while at night the peak lightning density propagates southwestward across the lake. Cluster analysis reveals terrain-related thunderstorm initiation hot spots northeast of the lake; clusters also initiate over the lake and northern lowlands. The most prolific clusters initiate between 1100 and 1400 LT, about 1-2 h earlier than the average cluster. Most daytime thunderstorms dissipate without reaching Lake Victoria, and annually 85% of clusters producing over 1000 flashes over Lake Victoria initiate in situ. Initiation times of prolific Lake Victoria clusters exhibit a bimodal seasonal cycle: equinox-season thunderstorms initiate most frequently between 2200 and 0400 LT, while solstice-season thunderstorms initiate most frequently from 0500 to 0800 LT, more than 12 h after the afternoon convective peak over land. More extreme clusters are more likely to have formed over land and propagated over the lake, including 36 of the 100 most extreme Lake Victoria thunderstorms. These mesoscale clusters are most common during February-April and October-November.

J	Djihouessi, MB; Aina, MP				Djihouessi, Metogbe Belfrid; Aina, Martin Pepin			A review of hydrodynamics and water quality of Lake Nokoue: Current state of knowledge and prospects for further research	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify the significant changes that have affected the hydrodynamics and the water quality of Lake Nokoue (Benin, West Africa) since 1960 and to emphasise the relationship between both. It appeared that the construction of the port of Cotonou in early 1950 permanently opened Lake Nokoue to the Atlantic Ocean and subsequently its retention time has considerably decreased from more than one year to about 40 days. During low water periods from December to mid-May, the hydrodynamics of the lake is influenced by tidal variation. This leads to a significant increase in the salinity of the lake from freshwater to brackish water with an average salinity of 16 ppt. During high water periods, freshwater inflows from tributaries invade the lake and keep the sea water out. Inorganic nutrient concentrations in the lake increase from the low water to the high water period, partially as a result of inputs from the lake tributaries. Yet, to date, the other external sources of nutrient loads in the lake, as well as the internal nutrient loads of the lake, have not been quantified. Therefore an important management question is whether the control of external nutrient loads alone is sufficient to significantly reduce the eutrophication problems of Lake Nokoue. This implies that further research on the lake could investigate the components of the nutrient budget including the influence of seasonal water hyacinth death during low water periods (caused by increased salinity), on the internal nutrient loads. Urgent management actions should consider a continuous spatio-temporal monitoring of the system in order to generate long time series data which will help to model the relationship between hydrodynamics and water quality and to understand the linkage of both with the biodiversity occurring in Lake Nokoue and more generally in tropical coastal lakes.

The deep chlorophyll layer in Lake Ontario: extent, mechanisms of formation, and abiotic predictors	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Epilimnetic production has declined in Lake Ontario, but increased production in metalimnetic deep chlorophyll layers (DCLs) may compensate for these losses. We investigated the spatial and temporal extent of DCLs, the mechanisms driving DCL formation, and the use of physical variables for predicting the depth and concentration of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) during April-September 2013. A DCL with DCM concentrations 2 to 3 times greater than those in the epilimnion was present when the euphotic depth extended below the epilimnion, which occurred primarily from late June through mid-August. In situ growth was important for DCL formation in June and July, but settling and photoadaptation likely also contributed to the later-season DCL. Supporting evidence includes: phytoplankton biovolume was 2.4x greater in the DCL than in the epilimnion during July, the DCL phytoplankton community of July was different from that of May and the July epilimnion (p = 0.004), and there were concurrences of DCM with maxima in fine particle concentration and dissolved oxygen saturation. Higher nutrient levels in the metalimnion may also be a necessary condition for DCL formation because July metalimnetic concentrations were 1.5 x (nitrate) and 3.5 x (silica) greater than in the epilimnion. Thermal structure variables including epilimnion depth, thermocline depth, and thermocline steepness were useful for predicting DCM depth; the inclusion of euphotic depth only marginally improved these predictions. However, euphotic depth was critical for predicting DCM concentrations. The DCL is a productive and predictable feature of the Lake Ontario ecosystem during the stratified period.

Patterson			Microplastic contamination in Indian rural and urban lacustrine ecosystems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study investigates the microplastics (MPs) pollution of the lacustrine ecosystems of Tamil Nadu, South India. It examines the seasonal distribution, characteristics and morphology of MPs and assesses the risk posed by MPs pollution. MPs abundance in the 39 rural and urban lakes studied varies from 16 & PLUSMN; 2.69 to 118.17 & PLUSMN; 22.17 items/L (water) and 19.50 & PLUSMN; 4.75 to 156.23 & PLUSMN; 36.41 items/kg (sediment). The water and sediment of urban lakes show average MPs abundances of 88.06 items/L and 115.24 items/kg respectively, while the rural lakes exhibit average MPs abundances of 42.98 items/L and 53.29 items/kg. The results demonstrate that study areas with more residential and urban centers with higher population density and larger discharge of sewage have greater MP abundance. Urban zones have greater MP diversity integrated index (MPDII = 0.73) than rural zones (MPDII = 0.59). Fibres are the dominant group and polyethylene and polypropylene are the most commonly found polymers, possibly gaining entry through land-based plastic litter and urban activities in this region. The weathering index values, 50 % of MPs exhibit high degree of oxidation (WI >0.31) with an age of >10 years. SEM-EDAX results reveal that the weathered MPs from urban lakes have a wider variety of metal elements (Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Hg, Pb and Cd) than those from rural lakes (Na, Cl, Si, Mg, Al, Cu). Though PLI shows low risk (<10) in terms of abundance, PHI reflects pollution status III (10-100) and IV (100-1000) in rural areas and IV and V (>1000) in urban areas based on the toxicity score of the polymer. Ecological risk assessment shows minor risks (<150) at present. The assessment indicates the risk posed by the MPs to the lakes studied and emphasizes the necessity for best MP management practices in future.					; Patterson, Jamila/GXW-1295-2022	jeyasanta, Dr. K.Immaculate/0000-0002-7547-4468; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 15	2023	895								165146	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165146		JUL 2023						37385488					WOS:001037869900001
J	Wang, ZR; Xie, F; Ling, F; Du, Y				Wang, Zirui; Xie, Fei; Ling, Feng; Du, Yun			Monitoring Surface Water Inundation of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake in China Using Sentinel-1 SAR Images	REMOTE SENSING												High-temporal-resolution inundation maps play an important role in surface water monitoring, especially in lake sites where water bodies change tremendously. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) that guarantees a full time-series in monitoring surface water due to its cloud-penetrating capability is preferred in practice. To date, the methods of extracting and analyzing inundation maps of lake sites have been widely discussed, but the method of extracting surface water maps refined by inundation frequency map and the distinction of inundation frequency map from different datasets have not been fully explored. In this study, we leveraged the Google Earth Engine platform to compare and evaluate the effects of a method combining a histogram-based algorithm with a temporal-filtering algorithm in order to obtain high-quality surface water maps. Both algorithms were conducted on Sentinel-1 images over Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, the two largest lakes in China, respectively. High spatiotemporal time-series analyses of both lakes were implemented between 2017 and 2021, while the inundation frequency maps extracted from Sentinel-1 data were compared with those extracted from Landsat images. It was found that Sentinel-1 can monitor water inundation with a substantially higher accuracy, although minor differences were found between the two sites, with the overall accuracy for Poyang Lake (95.38-98.69%) being higher than that of Dongting Lake (95.05-97.5%). The minimum and maximum water areas for five years were 1232.96 km(2) and 3828.36 km(2) in Poyang Lake, and 624.7 km(2) and 2189.17 km(2) in Dongting Lake. Poyang Lake was frequently inundated with 553.03 km(2) of permanent water and 3361.39 km(2) of seasonal water while Dongting Lake was less frequently inundated with 320.09 km(2) of permanent water and 2224.53 km(2) of seasonal water. The inundation frequency maps from different data sources had R-2 values higher than 0.8, but there were still significant differences between them. The overall inundation frequency values of the Sentinel-1 inundation frequency maps were lower than those of the Landsat inundation frequency maps due to the severe contamination from cloud cover in Landsat imagery, which should be paid attention in practical application.					; Wang, Zirui/GYQ-8416-2022; Ling, Feng/E-4811-2013	wang, zi rui/0009-0005-7630-243X; Ling, Feng/0000-0002-0685-4897														2072-4292				JUL	2022	14	14							3473	10.3390/rs14143473	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14143473													WOS:000831914200001
J	Sharma, RC; Tateishi, R; Hara, K; Nguyen, LV				Sharma, Ram C.; Tateishi, Ryutaro; Hara, Keitarou; Luong Viet Nguyen			Developing Superfine Water Index (SWI) for Global Water Cover Mapping Using MODIS Data	REMOTE SENSING												Monitoring of water cover and shorelines at a global scale is essential for better understanding climate change consequences and modern human disturbances. The level and turbidity of the surface water, and the background objects in which they interact with, vary significantly at a global scale. The existing water indices applicable to detection and extraction of water cover at local and regional scales cannot work efficiently everywhere in the globe. In this research, a new water index called Superfine Water Index (SWI) was developed for robust detection and discrimination of the surface water at a global scale using MODIS based multispectral data. The SWI was designed in such a way that it provides high contrast between the water and non-water areas. Achieving high contrast is vital for discriminating the surface water mixed with a variety of objects. The sensitivity analysis of the SWI demonstrated its high sensitivity to the surface water compared to the existing water indices. One single-layered global mosaic of a 90-percentile SWI image was used as a master image for global water cover mapping by reducing the large volume of MODIS data available between 2012 and 2014 globally. The random walker algorithm was applied in the SWI image with the support of reference training data for the extraction and mapping of water cover. This research produced an up-to-date global water cover map of the year 2013. The performance of a new map was evaluated with a number of case studies and compared with existing maps. The supremacy of the SWI over the existing water indices, and high performance of the SWI based water map confirmed the reliability of the new water mapping methodology developed. We expect that this methodology can contribute to seasonal and annual change analysis of the global water cover as well.

J	Gajardo, GM; Beardmore, JA				Gajardo, Gonzalo M.; Beardmore, John A.			The brine shrimp Artemia: adapted to critical life conditions	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY												The brine shrimp Artemia is a micro-crustacean, well adapted to the harsh conditions that severely hypersaline environments impose on survival and reproduction. Adaptation to these conditions has taken place at different functional levels or domains, from the individual (molecular-cellular-physiological) to the population level. Such conditions are experienced by very few equivalent macro-planktonic organisms; thus, Artemia can be considered a model animal extremophile offering a unique suite of adaptations that are the focus of this review. The most obvious is a highly efficient osmoregulation system to withstand up to 10 times the salt concentration of ordinary seawater. Under extremely critical environmental conditions, for example when seasonal lakes dry-out, Artemia takes refuge by producing a highly resistant encysted gastrula embryo (cyst) capable of severe dehydration enabling an escape from population extinction. Cysts can be viewed as gene banks that store a genetic memory of historical population conditions. Their occurrence is due to the evolved ability of females to "perceive" forthcoming unstable environmental conditions expressed by their ability to switch reproductive mode, producing either cysts (oviparity) when environmental conditions become deleterious or free-swimming nauplii (ovoviviparity) that are able to maintain the population under suitable conditions. At the population level the trend is for conspecific populations to be fragmented into locally adapted populations, whereas species are restricted to salty lakes in particular regions (regional endemism). The Artemia model depicts adaptation as a complex response to critical life conditions, integrating and refining past and present experiences at all levels of organization. Although we consider an invertebrate restricted to a unique environment, the processes to be discussed are of general biological interest. Finally, we highlight the benefits of understanding the stress response of Artemia for the well-being of human populations.

MCs were detected in epilimnetic water samples at concentrations up to 14 mu g/L, but their levels in raw water in DWTPs were below 1 mu g/L WHO guideline value for drinking water. Conventional treatment technologies (coagulation/filtration) eliminated cyanobacteria and intracellular toxins but had a limited removal efficiency for extracellular toxins. MCs were regularly detected in final treated water, especially in DWTPs equipped only with the conventional treatment, but their concentrations were below the quantitation limit of discrete sampling (<25 ng/L). Passive samplers in combination with LC-MS/MS analysis provided excellent sensitivity allowing to detect time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of MCs as low as 20-200 pg/L after 14-d deployment. Median MC TWA concentrations in the treated water from the individual DWTP5 were 1-12 ng/L, and most likely did not present significant health risks. Passive samplers well reflected spatiotemporal variations of MCs, actual concentrations of extracellular toxins, MC removal efficiency in DWTP5, and toxin concentrations in the treated water. Passive sampling can be effectively used for assessment and management of MC health risks during DWTP operation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

F.; Yang, Hong; Tong, Chuan			Carbon dioxide dynamics from sediment, sediment-water interface and overlying water in the aquaculture shrimp ponds in subtropical estuaries, southeast China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Aquaculture ponds can emit a large amount carbon dioxide (CO2), with the consequence of exacerbating global climate change. Many studies about CO2 dynamics across the water-air interface, but CO2 in sediment and overlying water received relative less attention. In this study, CO2 concentration in sediment porewater, the diffusive CO2 fluxes across the sediment-water interface (SWI), and the CO2 production rates in the overlying water (CO2-wp) were determined in the shrimp ponds in the Min River Estuary (MRE) and Jiulong River Estuary (JRE), southeast China, to analyze the dynamics of CO2 among different growth stages of shrimps. Our results showed large variations in porewater CO2 concentrations, CO2 diffusive fluxes and CO2-wp rates among different growth stages, with markedly larger values in the middle stage of shrimp growth. The temporal variation of CO2 in both estuarine ponds followed closely the seasonal change of temperature. The internal CO2 production (CO2 JO in these ponds was dominated by sediments. A significantly larger mean porewater CO2 concentrations, diffusive fluxes and production rate were observed in the MRE ponds than those in the JRE ponds, which could be attributed to the lower water salinity and a larger source of carbon substrates in the former estuary. Considering a total surface area of 6.63 x 10(3) km(2) across the mariculture ponds in subtropical estuaries, it is estimated conservatively that approximately 100 Gigagram (Gg) of dissolved organic carbon and 190 Gg of dissolved inorganic carbon were transported annually from the mariculture ponds into China's coastal areas. Because of the substantial supply of dissolved carbon, the adjacent coastal waters receiving effluent discharge from the mariculture ponds could become "hotspots" of CO2 emissions. Our results highlight the role of aqua culture pond as a major CO2 source in China's coastal areas, and effective actions are needed to alleviate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these ponds.

Until now, little research has been carried out on the distribution of Hg methylators here, which maybe important to explain the higher fish MeHg levels. MeHg concentrations were remarkably different between the soil and sediment samples in both seasons. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons showed that species richness estimates of the soil and sediment samples were both quite low based on Ace and Chao estimators. Community composition differed between the sediment and bank soil samples. DsrB gene quantities were relatively high, but the hgcA quantities were low, which indicated that most of the SRB found may not be Hg methylators. It is predicted that strains in Ruminococcaceae may be the main Hg methylators in the sediment, whose Hg methylation abilities were lower comparing with those in delta-proteobacteria. The relative abundances of the genera that contain known Hg methylators were all below 0.8%, which may explain the relatively lower levels of MeHg in the sediment of.

This may also reflect that Hg methylators were relatively rare among most clades and abiotically regulated Hg methylation may exert relatively more important role here. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

LFL is a long-term monitoring station operated under the Northern Contaminants Program (NCP) and one of only a few stations that contribute to the assessment of air pollution levels and pathways to the sub-Arctic region. BDE-47 was the most abundant congener among the 14 PBDEs, followed by BDE-99. Non-BDE FRs pentabromotoluene (PBT) and dechlorane plus (DP) were detected in all the samples. Dechlorane 602, 2,3-dibromopropyl-2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (DPTE), hexabromobenzene (HBB), and 2-ethylhexy1-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (EH-TBB) were also detected in >75% of all samples. PBDEs have shown a decreasing tendency as of 2013, which may reflect the phase-out of penta- and octa-BDE mixtures has led to significant decline in the atmosphere. The highest concentrations of OCPs were observed for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), with a median concentration of 61 pg/m(3), followed by alpha-hexachlorocydohexane (alpha-HCH) and alpha-endosulfan. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) highlights Northern Canada, Pacific, and East Asia as potential sources in warm seasons; whereas in cold seasons, the chemicals mainly came from the Pacific Rim.

In this study, aiming to evaluate potential impacts of metallic mining activities on the quality of a transboundary river (Selenge) in central northern Mongolia, we performed hydrochemical investigations of rivers (Tuul, Khangal, Orkhon, Haraa, and Selenge). Hydrochemical analysis of river waters indicates that, while major dissolved ions originate from natural weathering (especially, dissolution of carbonate minerals) within watersheds, they are also influenced by mining activities. The water quality problem arising from very high turbidity is one of the major environmental concerns and is caused by suspended particles (mainly, sediment and soil particles) from diverse erosion processes, including erosion of river banks along the meandering river system, erosion of soils owing to overgrazing by livestock, and erosion by human activities, such as mining and agriculture. In particular, after passing through the Zaamar gold mining area, due to the disturbance of sediments and soils by placer gold mining, the Tuul River water becomes very turbid (up to 742 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU)). The Zaamar area is also the contamination source of the Tuul and Orkhon rivers by Al, Fe, and Mn, especially during the mining season. The hydrochemistry of the Khangal River is influenced by heavy metal (especially, Mn, Al, Cd, and As)-loaded mine drainage that originates from a huge tailing dam of the Erdenet porphyry Cu-Mo mine, as evidenced by delta S-34 values of dissolved sulfate (0.2 to 3.8 aEuro degrees). These two contaminated rivers (Tuul and Khangal) merge into the Orkhon River that flows to the Selenge River near the boundary between Mongolia and Russia and then eventually flows into Lake Baikal. Because water quality problems due to mining can be critical, mining activities in central northern Mongolia should be carefully managed to minimize the transboundary movement of aquatic contaminants (in particular, turbidity, dissolved organic carbon, Fe and Al) from mining activities.					; Lee, Young/ABA-7224-2020; Batsaikhan, Bayartungalag/ODM-9077-2025; Lee, Jeong/G-7361-2012	Yun, Seong-Taek/0000-0001-9443-2872; Kim, Kyoung-Ho/0000-0001-6934-0482													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	2					2019	2034		10.1007/s11356-016-7895-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7895-3								27807785					WOS:000394254000085

Fisheries and water level fluctuations in the world's largest desert lake	ECOHYDROLOGY												Hydrological regimes are significant drivers of fisheries production in many African Lakes due to their influence on fish habitat and food availability, breeding success, and catchability. Lake Turkana, Kenya, will undergo substantial changes in hydrology due to water regulation and extraction along the Omo River in neighboring Ethiopia, which provides over 90% of its water. The objective of this study was to predict how the lake's fisheries, which provide an important livelihood and protein source in the region, will respond to hydrological change. While variations in fishing effort are poor predictors of fisheries catch in the lake, water levels and their fluctuations strongly influence fisheries production. Seasonal oscillations play a particularly important role, and with complete loss of these oscillations, the lake's predicted fisheries yield will decrease by over two thirds. The fishery is predicted to collapse at a lake level decline of 25 m, regardless of seasonal amplitude magnitude. The lake's total littoral habitat, where fisheries are currently concentrated, will increase in surface area with lake level declines of <25 m. However, the extent of productive, dynamic littoral habitat will decrease with dampening of the lake's seasonal oscillations. The most severe habitat loss will occur in the lake's Turkwel Sector, which hosts the region's highest human population densities, and North Sector, where inter-tribal conflict over resources is common and likely to be exacerbated by lake level decline. The continued ecological functioning of Lake Turkana necessitates immediate efforts to develop and apply a water resource management plan rooted in science.

Extraction and detection of MC-LR from the water and fish samples was conducted by the SPE and HPLC-UV apparatus. Our results showed that among toxic cyanobacteria, Anabaena was the dominant genera during the study period. The results indicated that MC-LR content in water ranged from 0.18 to 3.02 mu g/L in dissolved fraction and undetectable level to 1.13 mu g/L in cellular fraction, in all three seasons. The results of PCA revealed that the environmental parameters including EC, Chl-a, PO43-, pH and temperature were the most effective factors influencing the MC-LR production. Results further showed the mean concentration of MC-LR in muscle and liver of silver carp ranged from 10.12 to 40.98 and from undetectable to 44.34 mu g/kg w.w, respectively. The mean concentration of MC-LR in northern pike was 15.18 to 35.1 mu g/kg w.w in muscle and undetectable to 51.91 mu g/kg w.w in liver samples. Our results suggest that consumption of fish harvested from the Anzali wetland seems to be unsafe for humans, based on obtained estimated daily intake values which were higher than the tolerable daily intake value recommended by WHO. In addition, bioaccumulation factor of MC-LR in edible tissues of fish was estimated based on lipid normalization. The results showed that the BAF of MC-LR in silver carp (1047 +/- 185 L/kg of lipid) was lower than the northern pike (1272 +/- 185 L/kg of lipid), although the difference was not significant.

Versatile methanotrophs form an active methane biofilter in the oxycline of a seasonally stratified coastal basin	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The potential and drivers of microbial methane removal in the water column of seasonally stratified coastal ecosystems and the importance of the methanotrophic community composition for ecosystem functioning are not well explored. Here, we combined depth profiles of oxygen and methane with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomics and methane oxidation rates at discrete depths in a stratified coastal marine system (Lake Grevelingen, The Netherlands). Three amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to different genera of aerobic Methylomonadaceae and the corresponding three methanotrophic metagenome-assembled genomes (MOB-MAGs) were retrieved by 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic analysis, respectively. The abundances of the different methanotrophic ASVs and MOB-MAGs peaked at different depths along the methane oxygen counter-gradient and the MOB-MAGs show a quite diverse genomic potential regarding oxygen metabolism, partial denitrification and sulphur metabolism. Moreover, potential aerobic methane oxidation rates indicated high methanotrophic activity throughout the methane oxygen counter-gradient, even at depths with low in situ methane or oxygen concentration. This suggests that niche-partitioning with high genomic versatility of the present Methylomonadaceae might contribute to the functional resilience of the methanotrophic community and ultimately the efficiency of methane removal in the stratified water column of a marine basin.					; Dalcin Martins, Paula/AAZ-1698-2020; Veraart, Annelies/E-1927-2014; Wallenius, Anna/JLM-9812-2023; Slomp, Caroline/A-9406-2012; Jetten, Mike/B-8834-2011	van Helmond, Niels/0000-0003-0024-7217; Zygadlowska, Olga/0000-0003-1457-4454; Venetz, Jessica/0000-0002-9654-0532; Dalcin Martins, Paula/0000-0003-1242-0267; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				NOV	2023	25	11					2277	2288		10.1111/1462-2920.16448	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16448		JUN 2023						37381163					WOS:001021600800001
J	Tariku, TB; Gan, TY				Tariku, Tebikachew Betru; Gan, Thian Yew			Regional climate change impact on extreme precipitation and temperature of the Nile river basin	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												In recent decades the water resource of Nile river basin (NRB) has suffered from increasing demands from competing users, and global warming impact that exacerbate occurrences of hydrologic extremes. To investigate climate change impact on the future precipitation and temperature of NRB, a regional climate model, weather research and forecasting (WRF) was set up at one domain, 36-km resolution to dynamically downscale the base period (1976-2005), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios of four General Circulation Model (GCMs) of CMIP5 over NRB for 2050s and 2080s. For base periods, WRF simulated surface temperature and precipitation that agree well with observed CRU and GPCC data of NRB, respectively. Under downscaled RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, the annual precipitation of Blue Nile, Atbara, and Sobat river basin, Bahar El Ghazal and Lake Victoria regions are projected to change by about [-7, 14.2], [-19, 25.3], [-7, 39], [-5.9, 23], and [3.6, 27] % in the 2050s, and [-14, 25], [-22.5, 39], [-4.7, 60.4], [-11, 31], and [11.8, 41] % in the 2080s, respectively. The mean annual air temperature for sub-basins of NRB is projected to increase by 1.67-2 degrees C in the 2050s, 2-2.5 degrees C in the 2080s under RCP4.5, and by 2.5-3 degrees C in the 2050s and 3.9-4.6 degrees C in the 2080s under RCP8.5, respectively. Most precipitation extreme indices investigated are projected to increase, which implies that NRB could experience more severe and frequent extreme precipitation in future. Furthermore, extreme temperature indices of NRB are projected to decrease in cold, but increase in warm night/days.

In this study, to assess seasonal changes in the sources of organic matter in Lake Sihwa (Korea), biodegradability, fluorescence property, and stable isotopic compositions (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) of the organic matter were determined. Water samples were collected from the inner lake (n = 9) and inland creeks (n = 10) in five separate events, from November 2012 to October 2013. Organic matter originating from rural, urban, and industrial areas was examined as the potential sources. The organic matter contents and biodegradability in the industrial area were the highest, whereas low concentrations and poor biodegradability of organic matter were found in the rural area, and moderate properties were observed in the urban area. In Lake Sihwa, a large concentration of total organic matter and enhanced biodegradability were observed during March and August. However, main source of organic matter differed between the sampling events. The largest contribution of organic matter, deriving from marine phytoplankton, was found in March. On the other hand, in August, the organic matter originating from the industrial area, which is characterized by high levels of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants, was significantly increased. Our results could be useful to enhance the management of water bodies aimed at reducing the organic matter concentrations and improving the water quality of Lake Sihwa, and even that of the Yellow Sea.

In this study, we determined the concentrations of OCPs that have either been banned or restricted for use in the Kibos-Nyamasaria River during two seasons: wet (April-May) and dry (February-March). OCPs were analyzed using GC-MS. Nineteen pesticide residues were detected in the river (water) and sediments. In water, aldrin had the highest concentration of 8.33 +/- 0.58 mu g/L, dieldrin (8.67 +/- 0.5 mu g/L), endosulfan sulphate (0.23 +/- 0.00 mu g/L), a-endosulfan (0.19 +/- 0.00 mu g/L), methoxychlor (4.57 +/- 0.03 mu g/L) and a-HCH (3.47 +/- 0.00 mu g/L) during the wet season, while dieldrin (6.03 +/- 5.1 mu g/L), methoxychlor (3.43 +/- 0.06 mu g/L), and a-HCH (8.27 +/- 0.06 mu g/L) were above 0.1 mu g/L detection limit during the dry season. In sediments, aldrin, methoxychlor, and 8-HCH were not detected in either season; however, dieldrin and p-endosulfan were detected only during the dry season. Additionally, OCPs were above 0.2 mu g/kg (maximum residue level (MRLs). The concentration of OCPs increased downstream as the river approached Lake Victoria. Because some pesticides were present at levels beyond the recommended limits, strategies must be developed to reduce them and identify potential sources of banned pesticides.

However, few studies have explored how enhanced thermal stratification affects the occurrence and regulation of odorants in large drinking water reservoirs. Through systematic monitoring and investigation of Xin'anjiang Reservoir, we found that enhanced thermal stratification promotes filamentous cyanobacteria, particularly Leptolyngbya sp., as the primary contributor to 2-MIB production within the 1-10 m layer of the water column. The highest 2-MIB concentration, 92.5 ng/L, was recorded in the riverine region, which was 2.54 and 14.52 times higher than that in the transitional and central parts of the reservoir, respectively. Temperature indirectly impacted algal growth and odorant production by modulating TN/TP ratios. Geosmin concentration responded rapidly to relatively low TN/TP ratios (< 25). Our findings suggest that phosphorus control in estuaries should be enhanced during thermal stratification period. In summary, our study provides valuable insights to inform pragmatic water intake strategies and the distribution and release of odorants caused by thermal stratification. This is particularly relevant in the context of future global warming and extremely high temperatures during the warm season.

The total concentrations of target antibiotics in surface water ranged from limit of quantification to 3107 and 5.32-107 ng L-1 in the dry season and wet season, respectively. Among these studied antibiotics, ciprofloxacin (CIP) and lomefloxacin were as the main components in the dry season, while CIP, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline were the main components in the wet season. The concentrations of target compounds exhibited obvious temporal-spatial variation characteristic in the studied region, suggesting their different emission sources related to pig breeding, aquaculture, and human activities, as well as possible degradation in the aquatic system. We estimated that the daily total input and output masses of antibiotics in the influent and effluent from the swine farm were 12.1 mg d(-1) pig(-1) and 7.49 mu g d(-1) pig(-1), while they were 103 mu g d(-1) inhabitant(-1) and 22.9 mu g d(-1) inhabitant(-1) in the WWTP. The risk assessment results indicated that CIP posed a moderate or high risk to algae in most locations in Dongting Lake.					hu, qiongpu/GVU-5879-2022														0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC 2	2020	192	12							804	10.1007/s10661-020-08761-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08761-w								33263891					WOS:000596914500001

Oxygenation and hydrologic controls on iron and manganese mass budgets in a drinking-water reservoir	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Munger ZW, Carey CC, Gerling AB, Doubek JP, Hamre KD, McClure RP, Schreiber ME. 2018. Oxygenation and hydrologic controls on iron and manganese mass budgets in a drinking-water reservoir. Lake Reserv Manage. 35:277-291. In seasonally stratified lakes and reservoirs, fluctuating hypolimnetic oxygen and hydrologic conditions in the watershed can influence the retention of metals and their exchange between the sediments and water column. In particular, iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) cycling at the sediment-water interface can be dynamic in response to variability in the watershed and within the waterbody, which has substantial implications for drinking water quality. We calculated a mass budget for Fe and Mn in a shallow drinking-water reservoir over a 2-year period in which we manipulated the tributary inflow rate and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the hypolimnion at the reservoir scale. We found that the net Fe and Mn release from the sediments into the water column was suppressed during oxygenation; however, both metals continued to be released from the sediments, even during well-oxygenated conditions. Oxygenation in the hypolimnion had no effect on the net export of metals from the reservoir to downstream. Instead, the overall net export of Fe and Mn during the stratified period was influenced by hydrologic inflows. In summary, we found that manipulating hypolimnetic oxygenation had an important effect on the cycling of Fe and Mn within the hypolimnion, but that the net retention of metals in the reservoir was driven primarily by hydrology.					; McClure, Ryan/AAN-1371-2020; Schreiber, Madeline/A-5356-2009; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016	Doubek, Jonathan/0000-0003-2651-4715; Schreiber, Madeline/0000-0002-1858-7730; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				JUL 3	2019	35	3			SI		277	291		10.1080/10402381.2018.1545811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2018.1545811													WOS:000487548600005
J	Zhang, JZ; Huang, XL				Zhang, Jia-Zhong; Huang, Xiao-Lan			Effect of Temperature and Salinity on Phosphate Sorption on Marine Sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Our previous studies on the phosphate sorption on sediments in Florida Bay at 25 degrees C in salinity 36 seawater revealed that the sorption capacity varies considerably within the bay but can be attributed to the content of sedimentary P and Fe. It is known that both temperature and salinity influence the sorption process and their natural variations are the greatest in estuaries. To provide useful sorption parameters for modeling phosphate cycle in Florida Bay, a systematic study was carried out to quantify the effects of salinity and temperature on phosphate sorption on sediments. For a given sample, the zero equilibrium phosphate concentration and the distribution coefficient were measured over a range of salinity (2-72) and temperature (15-35 degrees C) conditions. Such a suite of experiments with combinations of different temperature and salinity were performed for 14 selected stations that cover a range of sediment characteristics and geographic locations of the bay. Phosphate sorption was found to increase with increasing temperature or decreasing salinity and their effects depended upon sediment's exchangeable P content. This study provided the first estimate of the phosphate sorption parameters as a function of salinity and temperature in marine sediments. Incorporation of these parameters in water quality models will enable them to predict the effect of increasing freshwater input, as proposed by the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, on the seasonal cycle of phosphate in Florida Bay.					; Zhang, Jia-Zhong/B-7708-2008; Huang, Xiao-Lan/E-9159-2010; Huang, Xiaolan/E-9159-2010	Zhang, Jia-Zhong/0000-0002-1138-2556; Huang, Xiaolan/0000-0002-3330-4858													0013-936X					AUG 15	2011	45	16					6831	6837		10.1021/es200867p	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es200867p								21707091					WOS:000293758400016

The major economic activity in the region is agriculture, but the effect of agricultural crops on water resources is poorly understood. Understanding the crop water interaction is important to design proper water management plans. Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to investigate the effect of different agricultural crops on the spatial and seasonal variability of water balance components of Gilgelabay, Gumara, and Ribb catchment areas of Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. To this end, the hydrologic model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was used to simulate the water fluxes between 1980 and 2014. The water balance components, which were mapped for each hydrologic response unit, indicated the spatial variations of water fluxes in the study. Cereal crops like teff and millet had significant effect in enhancing groundwater recharge, whereas leguminous crops like peas had significant impact in increasing runoff generation. Moreover, the model outputs showed that the total streamflow is dominated by baseflow and about 13%, 9%, and 7% of the annual rainfall goes to the deep aquifer system of Gilgelabay, Gumara, and Ribb catchment areas, respectively.					; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola Fohrer/C-6313-2011; Tigabu, Tibebe/ABG-3837-2020; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola/C-6313-2011	Hormann, Georg/0000-0002-3141-9264; Wagner, Paul/0000-0002-1594-398X; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola/0000-0002-7456-6301; Tigabu, Tibebe/0000-0003-0104-5924													0029-1277	2224-7955				OCT	2019	50	5					1376	1396		10.2166/nh.2019.170	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2019.170													WOS:000491432000013

Southern Africa International Ctr	Spatio-temporal heterogeneity of malaria vectors in northern Zambia: implications for vector control	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: Despite large reductions in malaria burden across Zambia, some regions continue to experience extremely high malaria transmission. In Nchelenge District, Luapula Province, northern Zambia, almost half the human population carries parasites. Intervention coverage has increased substantially over the past decade, but comprehensive district-wide entomological studies to guide delivery of vector control measures are lacking. This study describes the bionomics and spatio-temporal patterns of malaria vectors in Nchelenge over a two and a half year period, investigates what household factors are associated with high vector densities and determines why vector control may not have been effective in the past to better guide future control efforts. Methods: Between April 2012 and September 2014, twenty-seven households from across Nchelenge District were randomly selected for monthly light trap collections of mosquitoes. Anopheline mosquitoes were identified morphologically and molecularly to species. Foraging rates were estimated and sporozoite rates were determined by circumsporozoite ELISAs to calculate annual entomological inoculation rates. Blood feeding rates and host preference were determined by PCR. Zero-inflated negative binomial models measured environmental and household factors associated with mosquito abundance at study households such as season, proximity to the lake, and use of vector control measures. Results: The dominant species in Nchelenge was An. funestus (s.s.) with An. gambiae (s.s.) as a secondary vector. Both vectors were found together in large numbers across the district and the combined EIRs of the two vectors exceeded 80 infectious bites per person per annum. An. funestus household densities increased in the dry season whilst An. gambiae surged during the rains. Presence of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and closed eaves in the houses were found to be associated with fewer numbers of An. gambiae but not An. funestus. There was no association with indoor residual spraying (IRS). Conclusion: In Nchelenge, the co-existence of two highly anthropophagic vectors, present throughout the year, is likely to be driving the high malaria transmission evident in the district. The vectors here have been shown to be highly resistant to pyrethroids used for IRS during the study. Vector control interventions in this area would have to be multifaceted and district-wide for effective control of malaria.

In this article, we presented a systematic investigation of the anthropogenic overprints on trace elements geochemistry in three streams of the human-impacted (agriculture, urban area, and abandoned mining), located at Lake Aha, Guiyang, Southwest China. Concentrations reported in the study demonstrated that the abandoned mining stream showed the highest trace elements (608.16 mu g/L), followed by the urban stream (566.11 mu g/L) and agricultural stream (457.51 mu g/L) Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), used to display sampling dates and trace elements, showed discernible temporal variation in trace element concentrations. Trace element concentrations in months (May, September, and October) with less rainfall were higher than in June, July, and August indicated by NMDS. Principal component analysis (PCA) had shown that As, Ba, Mo, and Zn were mainly impacted by the urbanized streams, and Fe and Sr influenced by the mine. Risk assessment of human beings to trace elements demonstrated that As may pose a detrimental health risk. The research found that trace elements were potential tracers for the presence of human activities and environmental changes.																			2325-1026					APR 5	2021	9	1								10.1525/elementa.2021.00133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2021.00133													WOS:000667010300001

To understand the N balance and environmental impact, a 3-yr field experiment was conducted to determine the integrated N input and output in a rice-wheat rotation system in this region. The results indicated little N surplus in the soil despite different patterns of N input and output in rice and wheat seasons. Although total N input was higher for rice than wheat, the output was also proportionately higher so that the balance was similar between the two crops. Crop harvest removed 48% of N input for both rice and wheat seasons. Denitrification and NH3 volatilization were the primary paths for N loss (22% each of total output) in the rice season, while runoff and leaching (22%) and denitrification (21%) were the main paths for N loss in the wheat season. Although the total annual N input reached up to 606 kg N ha(-1), the annual N output was as high as 599 kg N ha(-1), of which 52% was lost into the environment, leaving little N in the soil. These results demonstrated that the overwhelming majority of N input did not remain in the soil but rather was quickly emitted. Proper practices are imperative to optimize the N balance and minimize N loss.

Photochemical and microbial transformation will liberate a fraction of this carbon to the atmosphere in the form of CO2 and CH4. We quantified these fluxes in a series of permafrost thaw ponds in the Canadian Subarctic and Arctic and further investigated how optical properties of the carbon pool, the type of microbial assemblages, and light and mixing regimes influenced the rate of gas release. Most ponds were supersaturated in CO2 and all of them in CH4. Gas fluxes as estimated from dissolved gas concentrations using a wind-based model varied from -20.5 to 114.4 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1), with negative fluxes recorded in arctic ponds colonized by benthic microbial mats, and from 0.03 to 5.62 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1). From a time series set of measurements in a subarctic pond over 8 d, calculated gas fluxes were on average 40% higher when using a newly derived equation for the gas transfer coefficient developed from eddy covariance measurements. The daily variation in gas fluxes was highly dependent on mixed layer dynamics. At the seasonal timescale, persistent thermal stratification and gas buildup at depth indicated that autumnal overturn is a critically important period for greenhouse gas emissions from subarctic ponds. These results underscore the increasingly important contribution of permafrost thaw ponds to greenhouse gas emissions and the need to account for local and regional variability in their limnological properties for global estimates.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Francus, Pierre/0000-0001-5465-1966; Pienitz, Reinhard/0000-0002-3613-1673; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Laurion, Isabelle/0000-0001-8694-3330													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2010	55	1					115	133		10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0115	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0115													WOS:000272759900004

Quantifying suspended sediment dynamics in mega deltas using remote sensing data: A case study of the Mekong floodplains	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Temporal and spatial concentrations of suspended sediment in floodplains are difficult to quantify because in situ measurements can be logistically complex, time consuming and costly. In this research, satellite imagery with long temporal and large spatial coverage (Landsat TM/ETM +) was used to complement in situ suspended sediment measurements to reflect sediment dynamics in a large (70,000 km(2)) floodplain. Instead of using a single spectral band from Landsat, a Principal Component Analysis was applied to obtain uncorrelated reflectance values for five bands of Landsat TM/ETM +. Significant correlations between the scores of the 1st principal component and the values of continuously gauged suspended sediment concentration, shown via high coefficients of determination of sediment rating curves (R-2 ranging from 0.66 to 0.92), permit the application of satellite images to quantify spatial and temporal sediment variation in the Mekong floodplains. Estimated suspended sediment maps show that hydraulic regimes at Chaktomuk (Cambodia), where the Mekong, Bassac, and Tonle Sap rivers diverge, determine the amount of seasonal sediment supplies to the Mekong Delta. The development of flood prevention systems to allow for three rice crops a year in the Vietnam Mekong Delta significantly reduces localized flooding, but also prevents sediment (source of nutrients) from entering fields. A direct consequence of this is the need to apply more artificial fertilizers to boost agricultural productivity, which may trigger environmental problems. Overall, remote sensing is shown to be an effective tool to understand temporal and spatial sediment dynamics in large floodplains.

Nitrogen removal processes in lakes of different trophic states from on-site measurements and historic data	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Freshwater lakes are essential hotspots for the removal of excessive anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loads transported from the land to coastal oceans. The biogeochemical processes responsible for N removal, the corresponding transformation rates and overall removal efficiencies differ between lakes, however, it is unclear what the main controlling factors are. Here, we investigated the factors that moderate the rates of N removal under contrasting trophic states in two lakes located in central Switzerland. In the eutrophic Lake Baldegg and the oligotrophic Lake Sarnen, we specifically examined seasonal sediment porewater chemistry, organic matter sedimentation rates, as well as 33-year of historic water column data. We find that the eutrophic Lake Baldegg, which contributed to the removal of 20 +/- 6.6 gN m(-2) year(-1), effectively removed two-thirds of the total areal N load. In stark contrast, the more oligotrophic Lake Sarnen contributed to 3.2 +/- 4.2 gN m(-2) year(-1), and had removed only one-third of the areal N load. The historic dataset of the eutrophic lake revealed a close linkage between annual loads of dissolved N (DN) and removal rates (NRR = 0.63 x DN load) and a significant correlation of the concentration of bottom water nitrate and removal rates. We further show that the seasonal increase in N removal rates of the eutrophic lake correlated significantly with seasonal oxygen fluxes measured across the water-sediment interface (R-2 = 0.75). We suggest that increasing oxygen enhances sediment mineralization and stimulates nitrification, indirectly enhancing denitrification activity.

Aquatic Invertebrate Community Resilience and Recovery in Response to a Supra-Seasonal Drought in an Ecologically Important Naturally Saline Lake	WATER												Climate induced drought is a prominent threat to natural saline aquatic ecosystems by modifying their hydrology and salinity, which impacts the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Lake Nyamithi is a naturally saline lake in South Africa that experienced the effects of a two-year supra-seasonal drought (2015-2016). This study aimed to determine potential effects of the drought and accompanying increased salinity (between 9.8 and 11.5 g L-1) on aquatic invertebrate communities of Lake Nyamithi, and assess their potential recovery following the drought. Aquatic invertebrates and water were collected for biodiversity and chemical assessments during predrought conditions (2014), the peak of the drought (2016) and after the site had received water (2017). Taxon richness was considerably reduced during the peak of the drought as many biota could not tolerate the increased salinity. Ecological resilience and recovery was evident in the lake since numerous biota (re)colonized the lake promptly after the site received water and salinity decreased (<8 g L-1). By the end of 2017, invertebrate biodiversity exceeded that of predrought conditions. Although some biota may be able to temporarily cope with extreme weather conditions, frequent or prolonged periods of drought and increased salinity pose a threat to naturally saline lakes such as Nyamithi and dilution with fresh water is vital for the persistence of species diversity and ecological integrity.					de Necker, Lizaan/JBR-9734-2023; Wepener, Victor/AAV-2116-2020; Smit, Nico J/L-4905-2013; Smit, Nico/L-4905-2013	Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420; Janse van Vuren, Johannes Hendrik/0000-0003-1482-9074; de Necker, Lizaan/0000-0003-3612-9968; Smit, Nico J/0000-0001-7950-193X; Wepener, Victor/0000-0002-9374-7191														2073-4441				APR	2021	13	7							948	10.3390/w13070948	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13070948													WOS:000638938800001

Wind as a Main Driver of Spatial Variability of Surface Energy Balance Over a Shallow 102-km2 Scale Lake: Lake Kasumigaura, Japan	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Lakes have often been treated as one-dimensional entities for energy balance (EB) studies mostly based on point measurements. Therefore, our knowledge of the spatial variability of lake EB is quite limited. We created EB maps of Lake Kasumigaura, a 172-km(2) shallow lake in Japan, with a 90-m horizontal resolution at a 3-hr interval over 5 years based on spatially interpolated meteorological variables and water surface temperature, with turbulent fluxes estimated by the bulk equations. The results indicate that turbulent fluxes and total energy flux into water body G were spatially variable while radiative fluxes were more uniform. The spatial variability of turbulent fluxes averaged over a season, a year, and 5 years was mainly caused by wind speed difference; a longer fetch in downwind areas of the lake resulted in strong winds and higher turbulent fluxes. The spatial difference of turbulent fluxes and quasi-uniform net radiation caused a total energy flux out of the water in the downwind area and a total energy flux into the lake in an upwind area. This spatial difference of G appeared to be compensated by heat transport from the upwind to downwind area through advection due to lake current.

The specific identity of snakes that caused the envenomings was inferred (a) from the diagnosis of patient symptoms and signs upon hospital admission, (b) by enzyme immunoassay for detection of Bothrops atrox and Lachesis muta venom from serum samples taken from patients before antivenom therapy, or (c) by direct identification of the snake, when it was brought along to the hospital or photographed. There were 133 snakebites (76.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) registered during one year (July 2017 to June 2018). Most snakebites (88.7%) were caused by Bothrops spp., and the rest by non-venomous snakes or dry bites. Snakebites tended to occur more often during the rainy season, coinciding with the period of greater reproductive activity of the snakes and greater availability of their prey. In addition, the increase in the water level of rivers and lakes during the rainy season tends to concentrate snakes in dry places and, thus, to increase encounters with humans. Information campaigns on prevention and first aid, specially among the most vulnerable groups (indigenous people, farmers, and children and teenagers in rural areas), and the importance of using protective equipment (boots, leggings, leather gloves) in certain high risk activities (e.g. agriculture and extractivism in forests) are fundamental for the reduction of snakebite morbidity.					; Colombini, Monica/ABD-5421-2020; Medeiros Martorano, Rodrigo/F-5564-2016; Medeiros Martorano, Rodrigo/F-4749-2014; Fapesp, Biota/F-8655-2017; Sérgio Bernarde, Paulo/ABG-3565-2021; Moura-da-Silva, Ana/A-5247-2008; Monteiro, Wuelton/F-3463-2015	Moura-da-Silva, Ana Maria/0000-0003-1787-6634; Sergio Bernarde, Paulo/0000-0002-2191-7817; Medeiros Martorano, Rodrigo/0000-0002-7775-6901; Fapesp, Biota/0000-0002-9887-8449; 													0044-5967	1809-4392				JAN-MAR	2020	50	1					90	99		10.1590/1809-4392201901561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1809-4392201901561													WOS:000516587600010

Samples were obtained from transects of 100 m long extending from Luika and Songwe River mouths to offshore. Water and sediment samples were collected directly from the study sites while fish were obtained from fisherfolk operating in the Lake. Sampling was done in dry and wet seasons. Heavy metals analysis was done using the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. Concentration of heavy metals was higher in catfish than in tilapia (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in metal concentration between seasons except for Zn (p < 0.05). In this study only Zn was above standard WHO concentrations in fish muscles. Likewise, the concentrations of heavy metals were within recommended limits in water except Pb. The detected metals in sediment were above recommended limits. Other heavy metals in particular Hg, Ni and Cr were not detected in all samples. Therefore, studied fish from Lake Rukwa may threaten human health upon consumption. The detected heavy metals in water were within the maximum residual levels (MRLs) permitted by WHO. Sustainable Lake Rukwa's fish, ecosystem management and conservation are recommended to discourage heavy metals discharge from elevating beyond permissible limits and thus prevent harmful health effects to fish consumers and water users.																			0375-6742	1879-1689				JAN	2020	208								106413	10.1016/j.gexplo.2019.106413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gexplo.2019.106413													WOS:000498684300009

The karst aquifer system is a groundwater-dependent ecosystem and is the world's second largest underwater karst cave system. The area's geology allows precipitation to infiltrate into the groundwater system and prevents accumulation of surface water; as such, groundwater is the only source of fresh water on the peninsula. The sampling locations consisted of three karst sinkholes that extend through the freshwater zone into the saline water, and an abandoned drinking water well of an ocean-side resort, during the dry and rainy seasons. The analysis showed that highly diverse microbial communities are present in the Yucatan groundwater, sustained by permanently warm temperatures and high nutrient input from human activity. Proximity to densely populated areas, such as tourist resorts, is the most important factor influencing both the diversity and presence of fecal bacteria and the antibiotic resistance profile.																			0008-4166	1480-3275				JAN	2020	66	1					46	58		10.1139/cjm-2019-0173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2019-0173								31622563					WOS:000505672500007

Water quality protection for the lake is necessary because it is a potable water supply for more than one million people. However, nitrogen exchanges between the soil profile (SP) and shallow groundwater (SW) accelerate nitrogen loss from the soil into groundwater in the nearshore vegetable fields of Erhai Lake due to excessive nitrogen accumulation in the SP and shallow and variable groundwater tables. More nitrogen enrichment in the groundwater increases the nitrogen input to lake water from groundwater migration and threatens the water safety of the water in Erhai Lake. However, there is a lack of information on the effect of fluctuations in the SW table on nitrogen concentrations in the SW and SP in this region. Materials and methods Field monitoring of plots at different elevations was conducted to monitor the SW table and nitrogen concentrations in the SW and SP from June 2015 to May 2016. Results and discussion With increasing SW depth, TN and NO3--N concentrations in the SW decreased exponentially, and the NH4+-N concentration increased. The NO3--N, DTN, and NH4+-N concentrations in the SP were positively linearly correlated with SW depth. With an increase in the NO3--N, DTN, and NH4+-N concentrations in the soil of the groundwater level fluctuation zone, NO3--N, TN, and NH4+-N concentrations in the SW showed exponential increases. Multiple factors, including nitrogen application rates, properties of the SP, rainfall, and topography, affected the SW table and the nitrogen distribution in the SP. Then, TN, NO3--N, and NH4+-N concentrations in the SW presented temporal-spatial variations via nitrogen exchange between the SP and SW. Conclusions The SW table fluctuations significantly affected the nitrogen concentrations in the SW and SP. These results provide a scientific basis for regulating seasonal SW tables and preventing nitrogen loss from the SP.

However, their spatiotemporal variation and its driving factors remain unclear, especially for drinking reservoirs, which are strongly affected by human consumption. Using quantitative PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing, we investigated the bacterial and archaeal communities in the sediments of a drinking reservoir, the Miyun Reservoir, one of the most important drinking sources for Beijing City. The abundance of bacteria and archaea presented no spatiotemporal variation. With respect to community diversity, visible spatial and temporal differences were observed in archaea, whereas the bacterial community showed minor variation. The bacterial communities in the reservoir sediment mainly included Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Nitrospirae, Acidobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. The bacterial community structure showed obvious spatial variation. The composition of the bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and main phyla were dam-specific; the composition of samples in front of the dam were significantly different from the composition of the other samples. The archaeal communities were mainly represented by Woesearchaeota and Euryarchaeota. Distinctly spatial and seasonal variation was observed in the archaeal community structure. The sediment NH4 (+)-N, pH, and water depth were identified as the key driving factors of changes in the composition of the bacterial and archaeal communities. Water depth might have the greatest influence on the microbial community structure. The dam-specific community structure may be related to the greater water depth in front of the dam. This finding indicates that water depth might be the greatest contributor to the microbial community structure in the Miyun Reservoir.					; wang, xiaoyan/ABE-3431-2021	Liu, Yang/0000-0001-8959-1529; 													0175-7598	1432-0614				APR	2017	101	8					3379	3391		10.1007/s00253-016-8019-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-8019-1								27942905					WOS:000399167800031
J	Chu, T; Lindenschmidt, KE				Chu, Thuan; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Integration of space-borne and air-borne data in monitoring river ice processes in the Slave River, Canada	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												River ice plays an important role in the physical, biological, and human systems in northern regions. Due to the large extent and poor accessibility of many river systems, remote sensing techniques are a potential tool for collecting information and analyzing characteristics of river ice covers. Optical data with high temporal resolution (e.g. MODIS products) are suitable for monitoring river ice phenology and mapping river ice cover extent, while radar data (e.g. RADARSAT-2 imagery) offer an optimal approach to characterizing river ice thickness, ice types and seasonal changes of ice-cover characteristics. An integrated automated approach, utilizing remotely sensed data from both active and passive sensors, was developed and applied to characterize river ice processes along the Slave River, Northwest Territories, Canada. The results show that the analysis of MODIS band 2 (841-876 nm) time series can detect the date of river ice freeze onset (FO) and water clear of ice (WCI) with a deviation of up to 12 days and 3 days, respectively. The rate of river ice breakup is much faster than the rate of river freezeup. The profiles of MODIS band 2 reflectance data along the river, however, showed insignificant differences between different breakup stages and ice types, making it challenging to map breakup ice types. In this case, RADARSAT-2 imagery can be used successfully to characterize and map four classes of water and ice covers during the breakup period, including intact ice, smooth rubble ice, rough rubble ice and open water. In association with hydrometeorological parameters, the thermal deterioration of the ice cover during breakup appears to be the primary breakup event in the Slave River. The results obtained from the analysis of MODIS and RADARSAT-2 data were compared with ground measurements of weather, flow and ice conditions (2000-2015), time-lapse photos and aerial surveys (2013-2015) along the Slave River, and show strong agreement.

Introduced salmonids have coexisted with native fish since the early 20th century in Patagonian water bodies, thus generating questions about the mechanisms that facilitate their coexistence. We analyzed the trophic and spatial intra-and inter-specific relationships established among native and salmonid species in a deep oligotrophic lake of Patagonia in order to determine niche partitioning patterns as strategies for their coexistence. Salmonids were more generalist feeders, while native species had narrower trophic niches. Native fish and introduced salmonids partitioned food, mainly through the consumption of the crayfish Samastacus sp. and the native galaxiid Galaxias maculatus, respectively. The diet of most species changed with body size, shifting from insects/amphipods to the larger G. maculatus and crayfish. Trophic interactions varied with season, in association with prey seasonality. In general, fishes feeding on the same prey were captured in the same depth strata, indicating common use of food and space. Our results provide new evidence on the trophic ecology of a mixed fish community (exotic-native), supporting the idea that native and non-native fishes could be avoiding negative interactions (e.g., competition) through trophic and spatial resource partitioning.

Chemical analysis, ultraviolet-visible absorbance, and three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy were used to characterize CDOM. The CDOM absorption coefficient at 254 nm (0254) had a significant seasonal variation, with a mean of 3.67 +/- 1.69 m(-1) in the wet season (from April to early August), which was significantly lower than the means in the two dry seasons (8.26 +/- 2.94 m(-1) from January to March, and 7.60 +/- 3.80 m(-1) from late August to December). The mean humification index and the mean index of recent autochthonous contribution were 0.74 +/- 0.48 and 1.31 +/- 0.35, respectively, indicating that rainwater CDOM was dominated by an atmospheric microbial origin component. We identified four fluorescence components using parallel factor analysis modeling in the rainwater CDOM, i.e., two protein-like components (C1 and C2) and two fulvic-like components (C3 and C4), which had characteristics similar to those of protein and humic-like substances, respectively. The a254 was significantly and positively (p < 0.001) correlated with each of the five nutrient parameters: total dissolved nitrogen (r(2) = 0.76), ammonium (r(2) = 0.65), nitrate (r(2) = 036), total dissolved phosphorus (r(2) = 0.55), and phosphate (r(2) = 0.50) showing the tightly coupling between CDOM and nutrients. Based on the deposition of the rainwater CDOM and the storage of the CDOM in Lake Taihu, the annual relative contribution of rainwater CDOM to the lake water was 11.7% in 2012. The results showed the important effect of wet deposition on CDOM sources in Lake Taihu, which is located in a region with severe air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Century-Long Warming Trends in the Upper Water Column of Lake Tanganyika	PLOS ONE												Lake Tanganyika, the deepest and most voluminous lake in Africa, has warmed over the last century in response to climate change. Separate analyses of surface warming rates estimated from in situ instruments, satellites, and a paleolimnological temperature proxy (TEX86) disagree, leaving uncertainty about the thermal sensitivity of Lake Tanganyika to climate change. Here, we use a comprehensive database of in situ temperature data from the top 100 meters of the water column that span the lake's seasonal range and lateral extent to demonstrate that long-term temperature trends in Lake Tanganyika depend strongly on depth, season, and latitude. The observed spatiotemporal variation in surface warming rates accounts for small differences between warming rate estimates from in situ instruments and satellite data. However, after accounting for spatiotemporal variation in temperature and warming rates, the TEX86 paleolimnological proxy yields lower surface temperatures (1.46 degrees C lower on average) and faster warming rates (by a factor of three) than in situ measurements. Based on the ecology of Thaumarchaeota (the microbes whose biomolecules are involved with generating the TEX86 proxy), we offer a reinterpretation of the TEX86 data from Lake Tanganyika as the temperature of the low-oxygen zone, rather than of the lake surface temperature as has been suggested previously. Our analyses provide a thorough accounting of spatiotemporal variation in warming rates, offering strong evidence that thermal and ecological shifts observed in this massive tropical lake over the last century are robust and in step with global climate change.

In this paper, a digital image processing technique was implemented to extract water area information from SAR images and the result is used to monitor the water area variation of Lake Dongting, the second largest freshwater lake in China. 8-year time series of European Space Agency's ENVISAT ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired between 2002 and 2009 were obtained and a land-water classification scheme was implemented. Using independent in situ water level data measured at a lake-side hydrologic station during study period, we derived the relationship between water level and water area of Lake Dongting. The results show that, (1) during dry seasons, the water area is 518 km(2) larger than that in the 1990s reported by Yangtze BHYRWRC (Bureau of Hydrology and Yangtze River Water Resources Commission), 2000; (2) the water area of Lake Dongting increased significantly in the 2000s after the Chinese Government's "return land to lake" policy took effect in 1998; (3) the water level of lake Dongting could be low during a rainy season due to drought; but could be high in a dry season due to discharges from the upstream Three Gorges Dam. In addition, the relationship between water storage change and water area/level change is obtained. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, there are no studies on the effects of sediment changes (which caused changes in soil texture) on soil ARGs in wetland. Here, we collected topsoil samples from 12 study sites that were deposited in early (prior to the 1970s) or recent years to reveal the responses of soil ARGs to the decrease in grain size of sediment discharged into Dongting Lake. The results indicated that it caused significant increases in clay content, soil organic matter (SOM), moisture, and bacterial abundance. The absolute abundance of 38 % ARG subtypes, 62 % ARG types, and the total ARG concentrations showed a significant increase. The composition of ARG profiles also showed significant changes. For mobile genetic elements (MGEs), the levels of plasmid, insertional, and transposase were significantly elevated. Notably, clay content, moisture, SOM, and bacterial abundance presented very strong positive correlation with most ARG and total ARG abundance. The contributions of physicochemical characteristics and bacterial abundance to ARG variations were ranked as follows: 16S rRNA > SOM > moisture > pH > soil texture (clay, sand and silt) > nitrate nitrogen > ammonium nitrogen. Bacterial abundance, SOM, moisture, and soil texture were the primary environmental parameters contributing to the soil ARG variations in this research. These changes of ARGs may pose risks to ecosystems and public health.

St.			Using wavelet analyses to examine variability in phytoplankton seasonal succession and annual periodicity	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In most north temperate lakes, phytoplankton biomass oscillates on an annual scale. While phytoplankton seasonal succession within a year has been described for many lakes, much less is known about variability in seasonal succession over multiple years. Here, we describe how continuous wavelet transforms can be used to identify variation in the periodicity in phytoplankton time series at multiple timescales. To demonstrate our approach, we analyzed 16 years of biweekly phytoplankton data from eutrophic Lake Mendota, USA, that coincided with substantial variability in climate and nutrient loading. Throughout the time series, the wavelet transforms identified the annual scale as the dominant scale of variation in aggregated phytoplankton, except for a 3-year period when there was no significant dominant scale. This period coincided with drought and decreased nutrient loading. During this time, phytoplankton biomass was markedly lower, and the phytoplankton community exhibited a unimodal, not bimodal, pattern of seasonal succession. Our results highlight the utility of wavelet techniques for identifying changes in seasonal succession in long-term phytoplankton records, which are becoming more available for many lakes. As aquatic ecosystems increasingly experience exogenous forcings at multiple timescales, wavelet analyses provide a powerful tool for determining how phytoplankton communities may respond.

Contrasting synchrony in root and leaf phenology across multiple sub-Arctic plant communities	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Roots account for > 50% of net primary production in many ecosystems and are widely accepted as playing a fundamental role in ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. Despite this, the timing and controls of root production and the relationships between root and leaf phenology are still poorly understood in many plant communities, making it challenging to elucidate broad scale patterns and to predict ecosystem responses to a changing climate. Here, we investigate and compare the extent of synchrony of community-level fine root and leaf production in 10 widespread sub-Arctic plant communities, including deciduous forest, evergreen shrub, deciduous shrub and sedge-dominated communities. 2. We show that across contrasting plant communities, timing of leaf production does not vary substantially, but there are considerable differences in timing of root production between woody plant- and sedge-dominated vegetation. In sedge communities, root production occurs early in the growing season, soon after the peak of leaf production, whereas in woody plant communities, leaf and root production are highly asynchronous, with the majority of root production occurring late in the growing season. 3. Seasonal dynamics of root growth were not consistently correlated with soil temperature, suggesting that differences in timing of production relate to inherent differences between plant functional types. This raises important questions as to the drivers of root production, the functional reasons underlying these contrasting plant strategies, as well as the consequences for microbial communities and nutrient cycling of such contrasting timing of carbon inputs to soil. 4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that major differences exist in the synchrony of temporal dynamics of leaf and root production between woody plant and sedge-dominated sub-Arctic vegetation. The substantially greater asynchrony in root and leaf production in woody plants compared with sedges suggests that vegetation change associated with climate warming will result in significant shifts in timing of carbon fluxes to soil, and highlights the need for separate leaf and root components in ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycle models.

In this study, we develop a robust algorithm, which automatically detects and tracks individual supraglacial lakes using visible satellite imagery, to document the evolution of a population of West Greenland supraglacial lakes over ten consecutive melt seasons. Validation tests indicate that the algorithm is highly accurate: 99.0% of supraglacial lakes can be detected and tracked and 96.3% of reported lakes are true supraglacial lakes with accurate lake properties, such as lake area, and timing of formation and drainage. Investigation of the interannual evolution of supraglacial lakes in the context of annual melt intensity reveals that during more intense melt years, supraglacial lakes drain more frequently and earlier in the melt season. Additionally, the lake population extends to higher elevations during more intense melt years, exposing an increased inland area of the ice sheet to sudden lake drainage events. These observations suggest that increased surface meltwater production due to climate change will enhance the spatial extent and temporal frequency of lake drainage events. It is unclear whether this will ultimately increase or decrease the basal sliding sensitivity of interior regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Yet, microorganisms intervene in biogeochemical cycling and impact water quality. Because of their small size, these ecosystems are in principle more sensitive to disturbances, seasonal variation and pluri-annual climate change. However, how microbial community composition varies over space and time, and whether archaeal, bacterial and microbial eukaryote communities behave similarly remain unanswered. Here, we aim to unravel the composition and intra/interannual temporal dynamic patterns for archaea, bacteria and microbial eukaryotes in a set of small freshwater ecosystems. We monitored archaeal and bacterial community composition during 24 consecutive months in four ponds and one brook from northwestern France by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (microbial eukaryotes were previously investigated for the same systems). Unexpectedly for oxic environments, bacterial Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) were highly diverse and locally abundant. Our results suggest that microbial community structure is mainly driven by environmental conditions acting over space (ecosystems) and time (seasons). A low proportion of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (<1%) was shared by the five ecosystems despite their geographical proximity (2-9 km away), making microbial communities almost unique in each ecosystem and highlighting the strong selective influence of local environmental conditions. Marked and similar seasonality patterns were observed for archaea, bacteria and microbial eukaryotes in all ecosystems despite strong turnovers of rare OTUs. Over the 2-year survey, microbial community composition varied despite relatively stable environmental parameters. This suggests that biotic associations play an important role in interannual community assembly.

M.; Zech, Michael			A Holocene temperature (brGDGT) record from Garba Guracha, a high-altitude lake in Ethiopia	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Eastern Africa has experienced strong climatic changes since the last deglaciation (15 000 years ago). The driving mechanisms and teleconnections of these spatially complex climate variations are yet not fully understood. Although previous studies on lake systems have enhanced our knowledge of Holocene precipitation variation in eastern Africa, relatively few studies have reconstructed the terrestrial temperature history of eastern Africa from lake archives. Here, we present (i) a new branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT) temperature calibration that includes Bale Mountains surface sediments and (ii) a quantitative record of mean annual air temperature (MAT) over the past 12 ka cal BP using brGDGTs in a sediment core collected from Garba Guracha (3950 m a.s.l.) in the Bale Mountains. After adding Bale Mountains surface sediment (n = 11) data (Baxter et al., 2019) to the existing East African lake dataset, additional variation in 6-methyl brGDGTs was observed, which necessitated modifying the MBT5mE' calibration (MBT denotes methylation of branched tetraethers) by adding 6-methyl brGDGT IIIa' (resulting in the MBT Bale Mountains index, r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.05). Comparing the MBT5mE' and the new MBT Bale Mountains index, our high-altitude Garba Guracha temperature record shows that warming occurred shortly after the Holocene onset when the temperature increased by more than 3.0 degrees C in less than 600 years. The highest temperatures prevailed between 9 and 6 ka cal BP, followed by a temperature decrease until 1.4 ka cal BP. The reconstructed temperature history is linked to supraregional climatic changes associated with insolation forcing and the African Humid Period (AHP), as well as with local anomalies associated with catchment deglaciation and hydrology.					; Zech, Michael/F-8026-2018; De Jonge, Cindy/GLN-7785-2022; De Jonge, Cindy/I-5411-2014; Gil-Romera, Graciela/C-9262-2016	Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766; Zech, Michael/0000-0002-9586-0390; De Jonge, Cindy/0000-0002-1127-8433; Gil-Romera, Graciela/0000-0001-5726-2536; Bittner, Lucas/0000-0003-2521-5596													1726-4170	1726-4189				NOV 30	2022	19	23					5357	5374		10.5194/bg-19-5357-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5357-2022													WOS:000892435600001

The elemental geochemical variation of sediments is to understand the mechanism influencing the estuarine environment, and it becomes baseline data to assess the environmental impact in the near future. Twenty surface sediments samples were collected at different seasons, and the grain size results showed that the estuary sediments were carpeted by the mixture of sand, silt, clay, organic matter (OM), and CaCO3. The seasonal variation of elements is slightly more in the pre-monsoon than in the post-monsoon season. Fe showed maximum variation, while Cd showed minimum variation in total heavy metal concentrations of detrital sediments. The order of abundance of metals based on their mean values is as Fe > Mn > Cr > Zn > Cu > Pb > Ni > Co > Cd in pre-monsoon and Fe > Mn > Zn > Cr > Ni > Co > Cu > Pb > Cd > in post-monsoon, respectively. Different elemental ratios and enrichment factors were used to assess the abundance of major and trace elements in both seasons. The ecological risk assessment clearly shows the higher concentration of a few metals in the estuarine sediments during post- monsoon. Correlation and factor analysis show that from geogenic along with the anthropogenic input of industrial effluents, agriculture, urban, municipal wastes and slum sewage are the major sources for derived metals in the estuarine sediments.

Modeling phosphorus losses from soils amended with cattle manures and chemical fertilizers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Whi le applied manure/fertilizer is an important source of P loss in surface runoff, few models simulate the direct transfer of phosphorus (P) from soil-surface-appliedmanure/fertilizer to surface runoff. The SurPhos model was tested with 2008-2010 growing season daily surface runoff data from clay loam experimental plots subject to different manure/fertilizer applications. Model performance was evaluated on the basis of the coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed values (RSR). The model offered an acceptable performance in simulating soil labile P dynamics (R-2 = 0.75, NSE = 0.55, PBIAS = 10.43%, and RSR = 0.67) and dissolved reactive P (DRP) loss in surface runoff (R-2 >= 0.74 and NSE >= 0.69) for both solid and liquid cattle manure, as well as inorganic fertilizer. Simulated direct P loss in surface runoff from solid and liquid cattle manure accounted for 39% and 40% of total growing season DRP losses in surface runoff. To compensate for the unavailability of daily surface runoff observations under snow melt condition, the whole four years' (2008-2011) daily surface runoff predicted by EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) was used as SurPhos input. The accuracy of simulated DRP loss in surface runoff under the different manure/fertilizer treatments was acceptable (R-2 >= 0.55 and NSE >= 0.50). For the solid cattle manure treatment, of all annual DRP losses, 19% were derived directly from the manure. Beyond offering a reliable prediction of manure/fertilizer P loss in surface runoff, SurPhos quantified different sources of DRP loss and dynamic labile P in soil, allowing a better critical assessment of different P management measures' effectiveness in mitigating DRP losses.

Molecular prediction of lytic vs lysogenic states for Microcystis phage: Metatranscriptomic evidence of lysogeny during large bloom events	PLOS ONE												Microcystis aeruginosa is a freshwater bloom-forming cyanobacterium capable of producing the potent hepatotoxin, microcystin. Despite increased interest in this organism, little is known about the viruses that infect it and drive nutrient mobilization and transfer of genetic material between organisms. The genomic complement of sequenced phage suggests these viruses are capable of integrating into the host genome, though this activity has not been observed in the laboratory. While analyzing RNA-sequence data obtained from Microcystis blooms in Lake Tai (Taihu, China), we observed that a series of lysogeny-associated genes were highly expressed when genes involved in lytic infection were down-regulated. This pattern was consistent, though not always statistically significant, across multiple spatial and temporally distinct samples. For example, samples from Lake Tai (2014) showed a predominance of lytic virus activity from late July through October, while genes associated with lysogeny were strongly expressed in the early months (June-July) and toward the end of bloom season (October). Analyses of whole phage genome expression shows that transcription patterns are shared across sampling locations and that genes consistently clustered by co-expression into lytic and lysogenic groups. Expression of lytic-cycle associated genes was positively correlated to total dissolved nitrogen, ammonium concentration, and salinity. Lysogeny-associated gene expression was positively correlated with pH and total dissolved phosphorous. Our results suggest that lysogeny may be prevalent in Microcystis blooms and support the hypothesis that environmental conditions drive switching between temperate and lytic life cycles during bloom proliferation.

However, differences in definitions and methods have led to spatial and typological inconsistencies among individual data sources, confounding their complementary use and integration. The Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD), published in 2004, with its globally seamless depiction of 12 major vegetated and non-vegetated wetland classes at 1 km grid cell resolution, has emerged over the last few decades as a foundational reference map that has advanced research and conservation planning addressing freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem services, greenhouse gas emissions, land surface processes, hydrology, and human health. Here, we present a new iteration of this map, termed GLWD version 2, generated by harmonizing the latest ground- and satellite-based data products into one single database. Following the same design principle as its predecessor, GLWD v2 aims to avoid double counting of overlapping surface water features while differentiating between natural and non-natural lakes, rivers of multiple sizes, and several other wetland types. The classification of GLWD v2 incorporates information on seasonality (i.e., permanent vs. intermittent vs. ephemeral); inundation vs. saturation (i.e., flooding vs. waterlogged soils), vegetation cover (e.g., forested swamps vs. non-forested marshes), salinity (e.g., salt pans), natural vs. non-natural origins (e.g., rice paddies), and stratification of landscape position and water source (e.g., riverine, lacustrine, palustrine, coastal/marine). GLWD v2 represents 33 wetland classes and - including all intermittent classes - depicts a maximum of 18.2 x106 km2 of wetlands (13.4 % of the global land area excluding Antarctica). The spatial extent of each class is provided as the fractional coverage within each grid cell at a resolution of 15 arcsec (approximately 500 m at the Equator), with cell fractions derived from input data at resolutions as small as 10 m. The upgraded GLWD v2 offers an improved representation of inland surface water extents and their classification for contemporary conditions (similar to 1984-2020). Despite being a static map, it includes classes that denote intrinsic temporal dynamics. GLWD v2 is designed to facilitate large-scale hydrological, ecological, biogeochemical, and conservation applications, aiming to support the study and protection of wetland ecosystems around the world. The GLWD v2 database is available at 10.6084/m9.figshare.28519994 (Lehner et al., 2025).

Antarctic Supraglacial Lake Identification Using Landsat-8 Image Classification	REMOTE SENSING												Surface meltwater generated on ice shelves fringing the Antarctic Ice Sheet can drive ice-shelf collapse, leading to ice sheet mass loss and contributing to global sea level rise. A quantitative assessment of supraglacial lake evolution is required to understand the influence of Antarctic surface meltwater on ice-sheet and ice-shelf stability. Cloud computing platforms have made the required remote sensing analysis computationally trivial, yet a careful evaluation of image processing techniques for pan-Antarctic lake mapping has yet to be performed. This work paves the way for automating lake identification at a continental scale throughout the satellite observational record via a thorough methodological analysis. We deploy a suite of different trained supervised classifiers to map and quantify supraglacial lake areas from multispectral Landsat-8 scenes, using training data generated via manual interpretation of the results from k-means clustering. Best results are obtained using training datasets that comprise spectrally diverse unsupervised clusters from multiple regions and that include rock and cloud shadow classes. We successfully apply our trained supervised classifiers across two ice shelves with different supraglacial lake characteristics above a threshold sun elevation of 20 degrees, achieving classification accuracies of over 90% when compared to manually generated validation datasets. The application of our trained classifiers produces a seasonal pattern of lake evolution. Cloud shadowed areas hinder large-scale application of our classifiers, as in previous work. Our results show that caution is required before deploying 'off the shelf' algorithms for lake mapping in Antarctica, and suggest that careful scrutiny of training data and desired output classes is essential for accurate results. Our supervised classification technique provides an alternative and independent method of lake identification to inform the development of a continent-wide supraglacial lake mapping product.					; Trusel, Luke/E-2578-2013; Moussavi, Mahsa/B-4051-2016; Halberstadt, Anna Ruth/JPW-9990-2023	Halberstadt, Anna Ruth/0000-0003-2582-7074; Pope, Allen/0000-0001-9699-7500; Trusel, Luke/0000-0002-7792-6173; 														2072-4292				APR	2020	12	8							1327	10.3390/rs12081327	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12081327													WOS:000534628800100

Multiscale drivers of phytoplankton communities in north-temperate lakes	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Multiple factors operating across different spatial and temporal scales affect beta-diversity, the variation in community composition among sites. Disentangling the relative influence of co-occurring ecological drivers over broad biogeographic gradients and time is critical to developing mechanistic understanding of community responses to natural environmental heterogeneity as well as predicting the effects of anthropogenic change. We partitioned taxonomic beta-diversity in phytoplankton communities across 75 north-temperate lakes and reservoirs in Alberta, Canada, using data-driven, spatially constrained null models to differentiate between spatially structured, spatially independent, and spuriously correlated associations with a suite of biologically relevant environmental variables. Phytoplankton beta-diversity was largely independent of space, indicating spatial processes (e.g., dispersal limitation) likely play a minor role in structuring communities at the regional scale. Our analysis also identified seasonal differences in the importance of environmental factors, suggesting a general shift toward greater relevance of local, in-lake (e.g., nutrients and Secchi depth) over regional, atmospheric and catchment-level (e.g., monthly solar radiation and grassland coverage) drivers as the open-water growing season progressed. Several local and regional variables explained taxonomic variation jointly, reflecting climatic and land-use linkages (e.g., air temperature and water column stability or pastureland and nutrient enrichment) that underscore the importance of understanding how phytoplankton communities integrate, and may serve as sentinels of, broader anthropogenic changes. We also discovered similar community composition in natural and constructed water bodies, demonstrating rapid filtering of regional species to match local environmental conditions in reservoirs comparable to those in natural habitats. Finally, certain factors related to human footprint (e.g., cropland development) explained the composition of bloom-forming and/or toxic cyanobacteria more than the overall phytoplankton community, suggesting their heightened importance to integrated watershed management.

The flounder and cod were caught in the Gulf of Gdansk (the Baltic Sea), while the eels were sampled in the Vistula and Szczecin lagoons (the Baltic Sea) and in the inland waters of the Masurian Lake District. NP concentrations in muscles were low in all the samples analyzed and ranged from 14.2 to 28.2 mu g(-1)kg ww. In contrast, a wide range of NP concentrations were observed in livers, which seemed to depend on both the species and the feeding status of the fishes. NP levels in flounder and eel livers were from three to twenty times higher than those in the muscles, but they were below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) in all the cod liver samples. The mean concentration of NPs in the liver of flounder caught in the Gulf of Gdansk was 222 mu g kg(-1)ww, while in that of the eel ranged from 57 mu g kg(-1)ww in fish caught in the Masurian Lake District to 519 mu g kg(-1)ww in eels caught in the Vistula Lagoon. NPs were detected in bile in only a few eel samples, which indicated that bile analysis has limited applications for estimating NP contamination in marine fish. The NPEOs in all the samples analyzed were below the LOQ.

Kirk; Dold, Bernhard; Romero Orue, Maria; Kirschbaum, Alicia			Origin and geochemistry of arsenic in surface and groundwaters of Los Pozuelos basin, Puna region, Central Andes, Argentina	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Los Pozuelos is a closed basin in the Puna region of NW Argentina, Central Andes. This is a semi-arid region where closed basins are the most important feature for the hydrologic systems. The center of the basin is occupied by a fluctuating playa lake called Los Pozuelos lagoon, which constitutes a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. This is one of the most populated closed basins in the Argentinian Puna and residents use groundwater for drinking and cooking. Lowest concentrations of As and dissolved solids are in the headwaters of the rivers (1.46-27 mu g/L) and the highest concentrations are in the lagoon (43.7-200.3 mu g/L). In groundwater, arsenic concentrations increase from the outer ring aquifer (3.82-29.7 mu g/L) composed of alluvial-alluvial fan sediments to the inner lacustrine aquifer (10-113 mu g/L) that surround the playa lake. Moreover, high concentrations of As during the dry season (90.2 and 113 mu g/L), Na/K mass ratios (0.2 and 0.3), and formation of Na-rich efflorescent salts suggest that high evaporation rates increases As concentration, while rainwater dilutes the concentration during the wet season. As(V) is the dominant species in all the water types, except for the lagoon, where As(III) occasionally dominates because of organic matter buildup. There are at least three potential sources for As in water i) oxidation of As sulfides in Pan de Azucar mine wastes, and acid mine drainage discharging into the basin; ii) weathering and erosion of mineralized shales; iii) weathering of volcanic eruptive non-mineralized rocks. Because it is a closed basin, the arsenic released from the natural and anthropogenic sources is transported in solution and in fluvial sediments and finally accumulates in the center of the basin where the concentration in water increases by evaporation with occasional enhancement by organic matter interaction in the lagoon.

The spatial distribution of these habitats influence the abundance and interactions of animal species, and the change or destruction of habitat can cause the disturbance of key biological processes. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR, C-band RADARSAT-2, and ENVISAT/ASAR data to map ecosystems and create a lake distribution map of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, backscattering analysis was conducted on individual training objects to gain a better understanding of the backscattering characteristics of each class. Then, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification based on hierarchical principles first classified the region into "Lakes" and "Not Lakes". This was followed by a Level 2 classification defining six vegetation habitats (Forest Woodland, Open Wood Savanna, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland and Vazantes) which was achieved at an overall accuracy of 83%. A Level 3 classification defined the "Lakes" class into a) Fresh (baias) and Brackish (salinas) lakes (accuracy results of 98%); and a further classification level dividing the fresh lakes, b) Fresh lakes with floating and emergent vegetation (baias), and Fresh lakes with the presence of Typha (salobras), and including the Brackish lakes (salinas) (overall accuracy results of 81%). The results of this study provide the first fine spatial resolution classification showing the spatial distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the entire subregion of Lower Nhecolandia using dual season, dual polarization C and L-band SAR imagery. The produced maps will provide valuable habitat information to help define conservation strategies and aid further research in the area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Influence of aquatic plant architecture on epiphyte biomass on a tropical river floodplain	AQUATIC BOTANY												Tropical floodplains are highly productive because of seasonal replenishment of water and nutrients, which substantially boost primary productivity. This study examined how the architecture of aquatic macrophytes affect the light and water quality and consequently the attachment and biomass of epiphytes on a floodplain in northern Australia. Results show that macrophyte structural complexity is not only important for water column light penetration but also for the development of epiphytes on macrophytes. Emergent grasses with simple vertical structure and high plant densities, limit light penetration and consequently the development and biomass of epiphytic algae. In contrast, submerged macrophytes growing just below the water surface, allow greater light penetration. The complex architecture of submerged macrophytes also provides a large surface area for the development of a dense covering of epiphytic algae. Other plant structural forms (e.g., plants with floating leaves) have a simple structure, variable light penetration and low epiphytic algae biomass. The emergent grass Pseudoraphis spinescens (R.Br.) Vickery also had low light penetration but the horizontal alignment of stems across the water surface allow greater exposure to sunlight of the stems and the consequent development of epiphytic algae. We conclude that (1) the complex structure of submerged plants effectively creates a "false bottom" in deeper waters so that they function similarly to the floodplain's littoral zone, and (2) that their extremely large surface area for attachment allows greater production of epiphytic algae than would occur on the sediment surface.

By focusing on segmented surface water images, we demonstrate that combining optical and SAR data is generally effective and straightforward using a simple statistical thresholding algorithm. Kappa coefficients(kappa) ranging from 0.80 to 0.95 indicate very strong harmony for integration across reservoirs, lakes, and river environments. In vegetative environments, integration with S1SAR shows weak harmony, with kappa values ranging from 0.27 to 0.45, indicating the need for further studies. Global revisit interval maps reveal significant improvement in median revisit intervals from 15.87 to 22.81 days using L8/9 alone, to 4.51 to 7.77 days after incorporating S2, and further to 3.48 to 4.62 days after adding S1SAR. Even during wet season months, multi-satellite fusion maintained the median revisit intervals to less than a week. Maximizing all available open-source earth observation satellites is integral for advancing studies requiring more frequent surface water observations, such as flood, inundation, and hydrological modeling.

Since nitrate (NO3-) is one of the key factors causing water eutrophication, its rapid qualification plays critical role in the eutrophication control and management. In this study, water samples were collected from typical water bodies from Nanjing in different seasons, and Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) was employed for the quantitative determination of NO3- coupled with algorithms of deconvolution and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Results indicated that the typical absorption band of NO3- at 1500-1200 cm(-1) was observed and the intensity of the band around 1360 cm( -1) was positively correlated with the concentration of NO(3)(- )through spectra deconvolution. PLSR models were established based on the deconvolution spectra, which were excellent with the correlation coefficients (R-2) of more than 0.8886 and the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) of more than 2.76; it was found that the carbonate in water might impact the prediction due to its absorption around 1450 cm(-1), but the prediction model performed well in condition that the carbonate content in a low level with less than 10 mg L-1. Significant temporal and spatial variations of NO3- were observed in the typical water bodies, and the Qinhuai River having the highest NO3- content, which mainly was influenced by human activities, and the impact of water pH and temperature were not significantly observed. Therefore, FTIR-ATR combined with deconvolution and PLSR, allowed a rapid determination of NO3- in urban water bodies, providing an alternative option for the monitoring of nitrate in natural water body, which will benefit the prevention and control of eutrophication.

Estimating Suspended Sediment Fluxes from the Largest Glacial Lake in Svalbard to Fjord System Using Sentinel-2 Data: Trebrevatnet Case Study	WATER												Glacier-fed hydrological systems in high latitude regions experience high seasonal variation in meltwater runoff. The peak in runoff usually coincides with the highest air temperatures which drive meltwater production. This process is often accompanied by the release of sediments from within the glacier system that are transported and suspended in high concentrations as they reach the proglacial realm. Sediment-laden meltwater is later transported to the marine environment and is expressed on the surface of fjords and coastal waters as sediment plumes. Direct monitoring of these processes requires complex and time-intensive fieldwork, meaning studies of these processes are rare. This paper demonstrates the seasonal dynamics of the Trebrevatnet lake complex and evolution of suspended sediment in the lake and sediment plumes in the adjacent Ekmanfjorden. We use the Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index (NDSSI) derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images for the period between 2016-2021. We propose a new SSL index combining the areal extent of the sediment plume with the NDSSI for quantification of the sediment influx to the marine environment. The largest observed sediment plume was recorded on 30 July 2018 and extended to more than 40 km(2) and a SSL index of 10.4. We identified the greatest sediment concentrations in the lake in the beginning of August, whereas the highest activity of the sediment plumes is concentrated at the end of July. The temporal pattern of these processes stays relatively stable throughout all ablation seasons studied. Sediment plumes observed with the use of optical satellite remote sensing data may be used as a proxy for meltwater runoff from the glacier-fed Trebrevatnet system. We have shown that remote-sensing-derived suspended sediment indexes can (after proper in situ calibration) serve for large scale quantification of sediment flux to fjord and coastal environments.					; Strzelecki, Mateusz/Y-9851-2019; Wieczorek, Iwo/KEJ-6377-2024; Kavan, Jan/ACU-4986-2022	Demidionov, Mihail/0009-0009-6853-319X; Tallentire, Guy/0000-0002-0389-6581; Strzelecki, Mateusz C/0000-0003-0479-3565; Kavan, Jan/0000-0003-4524-3009; Wieczorek, Iwo/0000-0002-1194-7860; 														2073-4441				JUN	2022	14	12							1840	10.3390/w14121840	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14121840													WOS:000816034100001

Spatially heterogeneous trends in nearshore and offshore chlorophyll a concentrations in lakes Michigan and Huron (1998-2013)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Nutrient abatement programmes have been successfully implemented around the globe to reduce nutrient loading into aquatic ecosystems. Concurrently, the worldwide spread of invasive filter feeders, such as dreissenid mussels, may alter nutrient dynamics in invaded systems by sequestering nutrients away from pelagic zones and reducing primary production in offshore areas. Such is the case in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America, where decades of nutrient abatement and the establishment of dreissenid mussels have seemingly resulted in more oligotrophic conditions and altered spatial patterns of nutrient availability and primary production. Recent studies have focused on whole lake trends in primary production despite spatial differences in tributary inputs, bathymetry, and other environmental conditions that can affect primary production in nearshore areas. Thus, we hypothesised that trends in nearshore chlorophyll concentrations in different areas may diverge in a manner consistent with spatial differences in nutrient input. To evaluate these differences in surface chlorophyll responses, we assessed temporal trends in four different areas of Lake Michigan and three different areas of Lake Huron. We hypothesised that in lakes Huron and Michigan, nearshore zones have experienced slower declines of chlorophyll concentrations relative to offshore zones. To assess this hypothesis, we estimated temporal trends of surface water chlorophyll concentrations (a proxy for primary production) from satellite imagery from 1998 to 2013. We calculated average surface chlorophyll concentrations for 10-m depth intervals ranging from the shore (0-10 m) to offshore (>90 m) during representative months of May, July, and September. We then analysed these data to determine if long-term trends in surface chlorophyll varied by season, proximity to the shoreline, and water depth. The rates of annual change in chlorophyll concentrations in nearshore areas were markedly different to offshore trends in both lakes. Chlorophyll concentrations declined overtime in offshore areas, but nearshore chlorophyll concentrations were either stable (in May) or increased (in July and September) throughout the time series. Differences in chlorophyll concentrations among areas were prominent in Lake Michigan. While differences between the northern and southern basin have been previously documented, trends in chlorophyll concentrations also differed between the eastern and western sides of Lake Michigan. Despite similar bathymetry and geographic features to Lake Michigan, regional trends were not observed in Lake Huron. The results of this study are generally consistent with the nearshore shunt hypothesis, which predicts that dreissenid filtering, nutrient re-suspension, and continued nutrient loading from tributaries can cause an increase in primary production in nearshore areas during periods of offshore oligotrophication. Thus, the localised effects of nutrient abatement programmes in a given lake will be influenced by complex interactions between lake bathymetry and the presence of non-native filter feeding organisms.

J	Liu, X; Qian, KM; Chen, YW				Liu, Xia; Qian, Kuimei; Chen, Yuwei			Effects of water level fluctuations on phytoplankton in a Changjiang River floodplain lake (Poyang Lake): Implications for dam operations	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												As one of the few remaining lakes that is freely connected with the Changjiang (Yangtze) River, Poyang Lake exhibits highly variable water level fluctuations. In this study, we examined the phytoplankton biomass and community including two hydrological and climatic variables (high water flow velocity, low water temperature in low water season and low water flow velocity, high water temperature in high water season). Diatoms dominated (40-87% of total) the community in periods of low water levels. In periods of high water levels, the community was dominated by cyanobacteria (45-93% of total). Various functional groups were also analyzed to assess the effects of hydrological conditions on phytoplankton community structure. The well-developed populations during the low water periods were representatives of functional groups P (Aulacoseira granulata, 28.7% of total) and Y (Cryptomonas spp., 12.4% of total). In the high water periods, A. granulata and Micro cystis spp. (M and L-M) increased to 39.8% and 12.7% of the total phytoplankton biomass, respectively. We then used parabolic curves to identify the optimal lake water levels for each phytoplankton group. The total phytoplankton, diatom, cyanobacteria, and green algae responded positively to low water level and negatively to high water level. The water level of 14-15 m is crucial for phytoplankton biomass patterns and succession through the alternations of washing-out and dilution effects and biological competition. These results support the hypothesis that water level control projects (e.g., dams) may affect phytoplankton biomass and assemblage structure patterns in Poyang Lake by altering its seasonal hydrology.

However, few studies have assessed the Madeira River sediment budget and the transport processes occurring in the main stem of the river. In this study, MODIS space-borne sensors were used to analyze the suspended sediment transport processes along the main stem of the Madeira River. Field measurements of suspended sediment concentration, spectral radiometry and granulometry were performed during 10 cruises from 2007 to 2011. The relationship between the spectral reflectance and the surface suspended sediment concentration (SSSC) was analyzed using both field radiometric measurements and satellite data. Ten-day SSSC samples acquired by the HYBAM monitoring network were used to match satellite observations with field measurements performed from 2000 to 2011. Over 900 MODIS images of 6 different locations were processed to monitor the SSSC dynamics in space and time. Satellite reflectance was found to be significantly correlated with the SSSC. However, a seasonal dependency was demonstrated, most likely caused by a variable granulometric distribution along the annual cycle. The ratio between the red and near-infrared bands was found to be free of the seasonal dependency (r = 0.79, N = 282), and a SSSC retrieval model was built from the satellite data using a bootstrap resampling technique. The satellite-retrieved SSSC time series showed excellent accuracy over the 11-year period and at two different stations located 800 km from each other. The satellite data were averaged to analyze the SSSC pattern temporally and spatially along the entire Madeira River, which provided evidence of significant sedimentation and resuspension. The backwater effect caused by the two-to-three-month lag between peak water in the Madeira and Amazon Rivers was used to predict local sedimentation near the Madeira River mouth. Our results facilitated a precise assessment of such sedimentation, which demonstrated an SSSC decrease 400 km upstream from the Madeira Amazon confluence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 512 specimens were collected using gillnets of different mesh sizes. Of these, 348 (67.9 %) fish had different foods, while 164 (32.1%) fish had empty stomachs. Mud was the main food item that accounted for 89.1% of estimated stomachs and 55.1% of the total volume in the diet. Detritus and phytoplankton were the second most important food items contributing 25.1% and 14.1% of the total volume respectively. Prey items differed depending on the fish size (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The smallest-sized fish preferred detritus, zooplankton, and mud while the food items such as mud and phytoplankton were preferred by the larger-sized fish species from the Ribb Reservoir. The seasonal variations in food composition were observed (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The volumetric contribution of foods such as mud and detritus were higher in the dry season and contributed in 61.2% and 19.2% respectively. During the wet season, phytoplankton and detritus were the most important food items and their corresponding volumetric contributions were 52.3% and 42.1% of the total volume in the stomach O. niloticus Generally, O. niloticus exhibited omnivorous feeding habits in their diet from the newly established Ribb Reservoir. It is possible to conclude that food and feeding habits of O. niloticus influenced by seasons, and fish sizes from Ribb Reservoir. Therefore, water buffer zone management is needed to improve the food and feeding habits of this fish for the better sustainable utilization.					; Tesfahun, Agumassie/KDN-9068-2024	Alebachew, Sale/0000-0002-4981-3198; Tesfahun, Agumassie/0000-0001-6387-0546													2331-1932					DEC 31	2023	9	1							2212457	10.1080/23311932.2023.2212457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2023.2212457													WOS:000987825700001

Major ion composition and seasonal variation in the Lesser Himalayan lake: case of Begnas Lake of the Pokhara Valley, Nepal	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The Begnas Lake in the Pokhara Valley is one of the threatened habitats in Nepal. The major ion chemistry explains the status of most of the inorganic nutrients and their possible sources. However, the earlier studies mostly cover limnological investigations, and phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity. Thus, the present study has been conducted to investigate the geochemical processes and to examine the seasonal variation of chemical composition within Begnas Lake. The results showed that SO (4) (2-) , PO (4) (3-) , and NO (3) (-) increased compared with the previous values. The domination of Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO (3) (-) explains the influence of carbonate weathering on the major ion concentration. In general, pH and dissolved oxygen decreased with the depth of water-column, while electric conductivity, total dissolved solids, HCO (3) (-) , Cl-, H4SiO4, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and Fe increased. Among the cations, the predominance of Ca2+ and Mg2+ as characterized by high (> 0.6) (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/(Tz(+)) and (> 0.8) (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/(Na+ + K+) equivalent ratios, also suggests prevalence of carbonate weathering. The low value of (Na+ + K+)/Tz(+) ratio shows deficiency of Na+ and K+, suggesting low contribution of cations via aluminosilicate weathering. The C-ratio suggests a proton source derived both from oxidation of sulfide and dissolution and dissociation of atmospheric CO2 during different seasons. Though the major hydro-chemical parameters are within permissible limit, the increase in trophic state of the lake suggests that inherent biogeochemical processes make the limiting nutrients available, rendering eutrophic effect. Therefore, further comprehensive studies incorporating sediment-water interaction ought to be carried out to explain the ongoing phenomena and curb the eutrophication process in the lake.					; AL, Ramanathan/E-7217-2012	AL, Ramanathan/0000-0002-3491-2273; Khadka, Udhab Raj/0000-0003-0009-7263													1866-7511	1866-7538				NOV	2013	6	11					4191	4206		10.1007/s12517-012-0677-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-012-0677-4													WOS:000325774500009

This study investigates future (2021-2100) changes in rainfall based on CMIP6 datasets over Uganda. The projection period is divided into two sub-periods: 2021-2060 (near future) and 2061-2100 (far future), relative to the baseline period (1985-2014). Two emission scenarios: SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, are considered. The results reveal a larger decrease (increase) in rainfall during March-April (November-December) under both SSPs. Moreover, an enhanced decline (increase) is projected under SSP2-4.5 (SSP5-8.5). The spatial distribution of future changes in seasonal rainfall reveals a decrease in MAM rainfall in the near future over most parts of the country under both emission scenarios. However, a recovery is exhibited towards the end of the century with more increase in the south-western parts of the country, and a higher magnitude under SSP5-8.5. In contrast, SON rainfall reveals wetter conditions during both timelines and emission scenarios. Maximum (minimum) wet conditions are expected in the north-western parts of the country (around the Lake Victoria basin). The linear trend analysis shows a non-significant (z = - 0.714) decreasing trend for MAM rainfall during the historical period. This pattern is reflected in the near future with z-scores of - 0.757 and - 1.281 under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. However, a significant increase for MAM and annual rainfall (z-scores of 2.785 and 3.46, respectively) is projected towards the end of the century under SSP5-8.5. These findings provide guidance to policy makers in devising appropriate adaptation measures to cope with expected changes in the local climate. Given the increase in intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall over the study region, future work should focus on examining projected changes in rainfall extremes under different global warming scenarios with consideration of model performance and independence.

The historical analysis is based on local weather station data from Environment Canada and the projections are based on selective ensembles of seasonal global climate model projections, statistically downscaled to create local-daily climate change scenarios. Average growing season temperatures have already been warming and growing degree days are increasing, both at statistically significant rates, and are both projected to continue increasing over the course of the twenty-first century. For Niagara Peninsula and Lake Erie North Shore, these one-time cool climate wine regions have already evolved into intermediate climate wine regions and are projected to transition into warm or even hot climate regions by the 2080s. There is also evidence showing that heat stress has and will likely continue to increase, while freeze damage has and likely will continue to decrease. Pruning and shading are the key short-term adaptation strategies while varietal selection is the key long-term adaptation strategy to minimize risks and maximise opportunities in response to these observed and projected regional climate change impacts.

Microbial assemblages were correlated to environmental factors by statistical analyses. Principal component analysis of the environmental data grouped SN and CG samples separately from G samples owing to G's higher pH values and sulfate concentration. Differences in microbial assemblages were also found. Many archaeal sequences belonged to uncultured members of Haloquadratum and Haloquadratum-related genera, with different environmental optima. Notably, nearly half of the archaeal sequences were affiliated to the recently described 'Candidatus Haloredividus' (phylum Nanohaloarchaeota), not previously detected in salt-saturated environments. Most bacterial sequences belonged to Salinibacter representatives, while sequences affiliated to the recently described genus Spiribacter were also found. Seasonal analysis showed at least 40% of the microbiota from the three salterns was prevalent through the year, indicating they are well adapted to environmental fluctuations. On the other hand, a minority of archaeal and bacterial sequences were found to be seasonally distributed. Five viral morphotypes and also eukaryal predators were detected, suggesting different mechanisms for controlling prokaryotic numbers. Notably, Guatrach, was the saltern that harbored the highest virus-to-cell ratios reported to date for hypersaline environments.

J	Korhonen, JJ; Soininen, J; Hillebrand, H				Korhonen, Jenni J.; Soininen, Janne; Hillebrand, Helmut			A quantitative analysis of temporal turnover in aquatic species assemblages across ecosystems	ECOLOGY												Recent meta-analyses have shown that beta diversity through space is jointly driven by species traits, geographical gradients, and ecosystem properties. Spatial variation is, however, only one aspect of beta diversity. The other component is variation in species assemblages through time, that is, temporal turnover. We examined the decrease of assemblage similarity in time in aquatic ecosystems in relation to several ecological, physical, and geographical factors using an extensive data set derived from the literature. The data set was first divided into intra-annual and interannual studies depending on the temporal extent of the studies. Sampling duration was one the most significant variables affecting the degree of temporal turnover, and we found that turnover was faster in studies with shorter temporal extent. Our results further suggested that the rate of temporal turnover increased with increasing ecosystem size, thus contradicting the general species-time-area relationship. Temporal turnover also varied among the ecosystem types: lake assemblages showed faster turnover than stream or marine assemblages in the interannual data set. We found that temporal turnover exhibited large-scale geographical variation, as there was a latitudinal gradient in turnover. Turnover was faster in the tropics in the intra-annual data set, but the pattern was reversed in the interannual data set, where turnover was faster at high latitudes. Finally, we found that the degree of temporal turnover was related to organism characteristics, as larger organisms with active mobility showed slower temporal turnover than smaller organisms. Our results suggest that the degree of species turnover in time is jointly driven by several ecological, physical, and geographical factors in aquatic ecosystems and that the turnover is not uniform across taxonomic groups. Our findings have important consequences for understanding how different biotic assemblages track temporal changes in the environment and how resilient assemblages are toward such changes.					; Soininen, Janne/A-4205-2008; Hillebrand, Helmut/I-1717-2014	Soininen, Janne/0000-0002-8583-3137; Hillebrand, Helmut/0000-0001-7449-1613													0012-9658	1939-9170				FEB	2010	91	2					508	517		10.1890/09-0392.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-0392.1								20392015					WOS:000275816900022

Antimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli prevalence in freshwaters in Belgium and human exposure risk assessment	HELIYON												The objective of this work was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistant (AR) E. coli prevalence in recreational waters in Belgium and to assess the exposure risk for bathers. Nine stations were sampled during the 2021 bathing season. A total of 912 E. coli strains were isolated and tested by the disk diffusion method in accordance with EUCAST recommendations, including ExtendedSpectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) production. AR E. coli were counted at each bathing sites, 24% of strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 6% were Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR). A Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index was calculated to compare the bathing sites. The Lesse river had the highest MAR index as well as the highest E. coli absolute abundance and the largest number of ESBL-producing E. coli. Conversely, the 3 lakes showed lower E. coli contamination levels and AR rates. A human health risk assessment of exposure to AR E. coli, based on the calculation of measured prevalence, was performed considering four different dose-response model scenarios. The human health risk (Pd) ranged from 10-9 to 0.183 (children). The exposure probabilities were low, except for scenario 3 (E. coli O157:H7), which is the most severe.

Sinninghe			Constraints on the application of the MBT/CBT palaeothermometer at high latitude environments (Svalbard, Norway)	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers; (GDGTs) are membrane lipids of unknown bacteria that are ubiquitous in soil and peat. Two indices based on the distribution of these lipids in soils, the Cyclization of Branched Tetraethers (CBT) and the Methylation of Branched Tetraethers (MBT) indices have been shown to correlate with soil pH, and mean annual air temperature (MAT) and soil pH, respectively, and can be used to reconstruct MAT in palaeoenvironments. To verify the extent to which branched GDGTs in marine sediments reflect the distribution pattern on land and whether these proxies are applicable for palaeoclimate reconstruction in high latitude environments with a MAT of <0 degrees C, we compared the branched GDGT distribution in Svalbard soils and nearby fjord sediments. Although branched GDGT concentrations in the soil are relatively low (0.02-0.95 mu g/g dry weight (dw)) because of the cold climate and the short growing season, reconstructed MATs based on the MBT/CBT proxy are ca. -4 degrees C, close to the measured MAT (ca. -6 degrees C). Concentrations of branched GDGTs (0.01-0.20 mu g/g dw) in fjord sediments increased towards the open ocean and the distribution was strikingly different from that in soil, i.e. dominated by GDGTs with one cyclopentane moiety. This resulted in MBT/CBT-reconstructed MAT values of 11-19 degrees C, well above measured MAT. The results suggest that at least part of the branched GDGTs in marine sediments in settings with a low soil organic matter (OM) input may be produced in situ. In these cases, the application of the MBT/CBT palaeothermometer will generate unrealistic MAT reconstructions. The MBT/CBT proxy should therefore only be used at sites with a substantial input of soil OM relative to the amount of marine OM, i.e. at sites close to the mouth of rivers with a catchment area where sufficient soil formation takes place and the soil thus contains substantial amounts of branched GDGTs.

Precipitation Over Southern Africa: Moisture Sources and Isotopic Composition	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Southern Africa, with its vast arid to semiarid areas, is considered vulnerable to precipitation changes and amplifying weather extremes. However, during the last 100 ka, huge lakes existed in the currently dry central Kalahari. It has been suggested that these lakes could have existed due to altered atmospheric circulation pattern, leading to an increase in precipitation or to changes in the annual precipitation distribution. Past climate changes are recorded in paleo-archives, yet, for a proper interpretation of paleo-records, for example, from sedimentological archives or fossils, it is essential to put them in a context with recent observations. This study's objective is, therefore, to analyze spatially differing annual precipitation distributions at multiple locations in southern Africa with respect to their stable water isotope composition, moisture transport pathways, and sources. Five different precipitation distributions are identified by end-member modeling and respective rainfall zones are inferred, which differ significantly in their isotopic compositions. By calculating backward trajectories, different moisture source regions are identified for the rainfall zones and linked to typical circulation patterns. Our results furthermore show the importance of the seasonality, the amount effect, and the traveled distance of the moisture for the general isotopic composition over the entire southern Africa. The identified pattern and relationships can be useful in the evaluation of isotope-enabled climate models for the region and are potentially of major importance for the interpretation of stable water isotope composition in paleo-records in future research.					; Geppert, Marielle/AAN-9179-2020; Pfahl, Stephan/G-4194-2014	Hartmann, Kai/0000-0003-2540-6798; Kirchner, Ingo/0000-0002-4103-6849; Geppert, Marielle/0000-0002-6478-4508; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 16	2022	127	21							e2022JD037005	10.1029/2022JD037005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JD037005													WOS:000885880900001

Here, we compared the planktonic bacterial community composition (BCC) and diversity of three tropical lakes located in the high Andean plateau (>= 4400 m above sea level) during the dry and wet season. Diversity in these lakes was higher in the cool and wet season than in the warm and dry one. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) composition was significantly different among lakes and between seasons. Members of the class Opitutae, Spartobacteria, Burkholderiales and Actinobacteria were dominant, but only the hgcI clade (Actinobacteria) and the Comamonadaceae family (Burkholderiales) were shared between seasons among the three lakes. In general, a large percentage (up to 42%) of the rare OTUs was unclassified even at the family level. In one lake, a pycnocline and an anoxic water layer with high abundance of Thiocapsa sp. was found in the wet season indicating that the known polymictic thermal condition is not always given. Our study highlights the particular BCC of tropical high-elevation lakes and also how little is known about the variability in physico-chemical conditions of these ecosystems.

Water column and sediment stable carbon isotope biogeochemistry of permanently redox-stratified Fayetteville Green Lake, New York, USA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Carbon cycling in natural ecosystems is a biologically mediated process with global consequences. Recent work has revealed the important role that lakes play in the global carbon cycle, suggesting organic carbon burial in small lakes and reservoirs matching and even surpassing that of the world's oceans. While much is known regarding biogeochemical cycling of carbon in the water column and underlying sediments of freshwater and marine systems, less is known about permanently redox-stratified water bodies. The modern ocean is fully oxygenated, however, the ocean is thought to have been redox-stratified throughout much of Earth's history, and seasonal redox-stratification is an increasing problem in many freshwater systems due to eutrophication driven by human land usage and warming resulting from global climate change. To better understand carbon signals preserved in the rock record from times of ocean redox-stratification as well as the effects of increasing redox-stratification on carbon cycling in modern freshwater systems, we have characterized the concentration and stable isotopic signal of inorganic and organic carbon in permanently redox-stratified Fayetteville Green Lake (FGL), New York. The results of these analyses indicate that: (1) groundwater is the primary source of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) at FGL; (2) organic carbon is extensively cycled within the water column and upper sediments resulting in an increasingly isotopically depleted DIC pool; (3) cyanobacteria-driven carbonate precipitation in the oxic zone is the primary source of carbonate in the sediments; (4) methane concentrations increase below the chemocline with extremely negative delta C-13 values (-99.1 parts per thousand to -102.3 parts per thousand).

Since the year 2000, toxic cyanobacteria have been observed frequently in Poyang Lake. In the present study, spatial and seasonal variations of microcystins (MCs; MC-RR, MC-YR, and MC-LR) in water column were examined monthly from January to December (except the months of March, May, and November) in 2013, by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem triple quadrupole/mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). MC-RR was the most dominant variant, followed by MC-LR, while MC-YR was detected in low concentration. Total MC concentrations (intracellular + extracellular MCs) ranged from 1.26 to 9916.05 ng/L, with an average of 469.99 ng/L, and only 3.14% (6 out of 192 samples) of the water samples contained MC concentrations that exceeded the drinking water guideline level of 1 mu g/L for MC-LR proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). MC concentrations in water column showed obvious seasonal variations in Poyang Lake. Intracellular and extracellular MCs were both at a low level from January to April but increased quickly from June to August and decreased dramatically thereafter. Intracellular MCs exhibited similar spatial distribution pattern with extracellular MCs. Both intracellular and extracellular MC concentrations in eastern bays and around Songmen Mountain of Poyang Lake were higher than other regions. Intracellular MC concentrations were positively correlated with Chl a (r = 046, P < 0.01), pH (r = 0.25, P < 0.01), cyanobacterial biomass (r = 0.40, P < 0.01), and temperature (r = 0.36, P < 0.01) but negatively correlated with TN (r = - 0.28, P < 0.01), suggesting that TN, cyanobacteria biomass, pH, and temperature might be regulating factors for MC production in Poyang Lake.

Large alpine deep lake as a source of greenhouse gases: A case study on Lake Fuxian in Southwestern China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												However, the spatiotemporal patterns of GHG emissions have not been adequately quantifled in large deep lakes, resulting in substantial uncertainties in the estimated GHG budgets in global lakes. In this study, the spatial and seasonal variability of diffusive GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions from Lake Fuxian located on a plateau in Southwestern China were quantifled. The results showed that the surface lake water was oversaturated with dissolved GHG concentrations, and the average concentrations were 24.25 mu M CO2, 0.044 mu M CH4, and 14.28 nM N2O, with diffusive emission rates of 8.82 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1, 31.94 mu mol CH4 m-2 d-1, and 4.94 mu mol N2O m-2 d-1, respectively. Diffusive CH4 flux exhibited high temporal and spatial variability similar to that in most lakes. In contrast, diffusive CO2 and N2O flux showed distinct seasonal variability and similar spatial patterns, emphasizing the necessity for increasing the temporal resolution in GHG flux measurements for integrated assessments. Water temperature and/or oxygen concentrations were crucial in regulating seasonal variability in GHG emissions. However, no limnological parameter was found to govern the spatial GHG patterns. The frequent advection mixing caused by wind-driven currents might be the reason for the low spatial heterogeneity in GHGs, in which the inconspicuous mechanism requires further research. It was recommended that at least 11 locations were needed for representative whole lake flux estimates at each sampling campaign. In addition, the maximum peak of CH4 in the oxycline from Lake Fuxian indicated that low CH4 oxidation					Li, Biao/KYR-3506-2024; Wu, Qinglong/B-7625-2011														0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 10	2022	838		2						156059	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156059		MAY 2022						35598672					WOS:000806516100011

Zooplankton communities possess major position in freshwater ecosystems, which play essential parts in maintaining biological balance of freshwater habitats. Knowledge of processes and mechanisms for affecting variations in abundance, biomass, and diversity of zooplankton is important for maintaining biological balance of freshwater ecosystems. Here, we analyzed that the temporal and spatial changes in the structure of zooplankton community and their temporal and spatial variations respond to changes in environmental factors in the middle reach of Yangtze River floodplain lakes. The results showed that zooplankton samples were classified into 128 species, and Rotifera was the most common taxa. Significant seasonal differences were found among the abundance and diversity of zooplankton. Similarly, we also found significant seasonal differences among the biomass of zooplankton functional groups. The spatial turnover component was the main contributor to the beta diversity pattern, which indicated that study areas should establish habitat restoration areas to restore regional biodiversity. The NMDS plot showed that the structure of zooplankton community exhibited significant seasonal changes, where the community structure was correlated with pH, water temperature, water depth, salinity, total nitrogen, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus based on RDA. This study highlights that it is very important to ensure the floodplain ecosystem's original state of functionality for maintaining the regional diversity of the ecosystem as a whole.					/AAB-6512-2020; xuemei, qiu/HNB-5101-2023														2045-7758					DEC	2021	11	24					17885	17900		10.1002/ece3.8353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8353		DEC 2021						35003645					WOS:000730410600001

Estimation of Suspended Sediment Concentration from Remote Sensing and In Situ Measurement over Lake Tana, Ethiopia	ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING												Discharge from basins joining a lake is the main factor determining the lake volume and sediment inflow to the lake. Suspended sediment is an important parameter for describing the water quality of aquatic ecosystems. Lake Tana is an important and the largest lake in Ethiopia for the local ecological system. However, environmental change and anthropogenic activities in the area threaten its water quality. The conventional methods of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) observation are unable to determine and compare spatial and temporal SSC patterns for the lake over a period of years. Remote sensing methods have made it possible to map SSC. The objective of this study is to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of suspended sediment of Lake Tana using in situ measurement and remote sensing applications and specifically to develop a relationship between in situ and remote sensing observation to retrieve suspended sediment concentration and map the spatal distribution of SSC. This study used MODIS-Terra and in situ data to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of SSC in the rainy season. Four sampling campaigns (20 samples per campaign) were carried out on Lake Tana, and the first three sampled campaigns on May 11-13, 2018, June 08-10, 2018, and July 15-17, 2018, were used for calibration of regression models. MODIS-Terra reflectance in NIR was found best related to in situ water quality data and varies linearly with SSC (r(2) = 0.81) and turbidity (r(2) = 0.85). Secchi disc depth (SDD) found the best fit for a power relation with NIR band reflectance (r(2) = 0.74). The MODIS-Terra reflectance in red was found to be poorly related to in situ measurements. The relation in NIR reflectance was validated using the LOOCV (leave-one-out-cross-validation) technique and the fourth sampled data set collected on August 12-14, 2018. Developed models are validated with RMSE of 42.96 mg/l, 14.6 NTU, and 0.17 m, ARE of 23.3%, 27.6%, and 12.4%, and RRMSE of 25.1%, 44.5%, and 29.6% for SSC, turbidity, and SDD, respectively, using LOOCV. The equation was also validated using August 2018 collected data sets with RMSE of 87.6 mg/l, 11.7 NTU, 0.08 m, ARE of 20.8%, 25.9%, and 28.8%, and RRMSE of 17.8%, 20.5%, and 27.9% for SSC, turbidity, and SDD, respectively. Applying the developed regression model, a 10-year time series of SSC from 2008-2017 for May-August was estimated and the trend was tested using the Mann-Kendall trend test. It was found that an increasing trend was observed from the period 2008 to 2017. The result shows that satellite data like the MODIS-Terra imagery could be used to monitor and obtain past records of SSC with the developed equation. The increasing SSC can be reduced by implementing selected management practices in the surrounding watersheds of the lake to reduce nutrient and sediment inflow.

This study aims at empirically determining the biotransformation rate constants for 35 MPs at different periods of the year and depths of a meso-eutrophic lake. We then tested statistically the association of environmental parameters and microbial community composition with the biotransformation rate constants obtained. Biotransformation was observed for 14 out of 35 studied MPs for at least one sampling time. Large variations in biotransformation rate constants were observed over the seasons and between compounds. Overall, the transformation of MPs was mostly influenced by the lake's temperature, phytoplankton density and bacterial diversity. However, some individual MPs were not following the general trend or association with microorganism biomass. The antidepressant mianserin, for instance, was transformed in all experiments and depths, but did not show any relationship with measured environmental parameters, suggesting the importance of specific microorganisms in its transformation. The results presented here contribute to our understanding of the fate of MPs in surface waters and thus support improved risk assessment of contaminants in the environment.

J	Tan, XZ; Gan, TY				Tan, Xuezhi; Gan, Thian Yew			Non-stationary analysis of the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation over Canada and their relations to large-scale climate patterns	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												In recent years, because the frequency and severity of floods have increased across Canada, it is important to understand the characteristics of Canadian heavy precipitation. Long-term precipitation data of 463 gauging stations of Canada were analyzed using non-stationary generalized extreme value distribution (GEV), Poisson distribution and generalized Pareto (GP) distribution. Time-varying covariates that represent large-scale climate patterns such as El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Oscillation (NP) were incorporated to parameters of GEV, Poisson and GP distributions. Results show that GEV distributions tend to under-estimate annual maximum daily precipitation (AMP) of western and eastern coastal regions of Canada, compared to GP distributions. Poisson regressions show that temporal clusters of heavy precipitation events in Canada are related to large-scale climate patterns. By modeling AMP time series with non-stationary GEV and heavy precipitation with non-stationary GP distributions, it is evident that AMP and heavy precipitation of Canada show strong non-stationarities (abrupt and slowly varying changes) likely because of the influence of large-scale climate patterns. AMP in southwestern coastal regions, southern Canadian Prairies and the Great Lakes tend to be higher in El Nio than in La Nia years, while AMP of other regions of Canada tends to be lower in El Nio than in La Nia years. The influence of ENSO on heavy precipitation was spatially consistent but stronger than on AMP. The effect of PDO, NAO and NP on extreme precipitation is also statistically significant at some stations across Canada.

In this context, the biomanipulation of the higher trophic levels, such as zooplankton, can efficiently control these blooms. Based on this, this study aimed to verify the potential of a medium-sized cladoceran, Macrothrix spinosa, to control the phytoplankton biomass from the Apipucos reservoir, a shallow tropical hypereutrophic lake. For this, grazing experiments were carried out during different seasonal periods, which were characterized by the dominance of cyanobacteria in the dry season and of chlorophytes in the rainy season. The experiments were carried out in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing filtered water from the environment and different densities of the cladocerans: 0 (control), 100, 200 and 300 ind L-1. The results varied between the seasonal periods; however, M. spinosa reduced phytoplankton biomass mainly during the rainy season. In the dry season, M. spinosa significantly reduced the biomass of the morpho-functional groups IV and VII, while in the rainy season all groups were significantly reduced, except for group V. The cladoceran was also able to reduce the mean length of filamentous cyanobacteria with aerotopes (group III); one possible explanation for this result is that M. spinosa could cut the filaments before consuming them. In this way, the seasonal variations in the phytoplankton structure influenced the top-down control of M. spinosa in a shallow hypereutrophic lake, showing its potential to control algal blooms, especially of chlorophytes, and could be used in biomanipulation strategies in eutrophic freshwater environments.

However, the development of sulfur in water-sediment systems during heavy algae accumulation still remains unclear, especially in hyper-eutrophic shallow lakes. In this study, a quarterly field investigation was carried out for a year in the algae accumulated embay area of Lake Taihu, accompanied by a short-term laboratory experiment on algae accumulation. The results show that hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol dominated the volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in the water during non-accumulation seasons, whereas the concentrations of dimethyl sulfides increased during heavy algae accumulation, both in the field and the laboratory. An increase in the acid volatile sulfide (AVS) in the surface sediments was also discovered together with the increase in dimethyl sulfides. The depletion of oxygen in the overlying water and sediment-water interface during the heavy algae accumulation and decomposition was found to be closely related to both the increase in VSCs in the overlying water and increase in AVS in the sediment. The increased concentrations of these reductive sulfocompounds might aggravate the eutrophication and HABs and should be given more consideration in future eutrophication control plans for lakes.

Phytoplankton functional groups in the reservoir were investigated and a comparison made between the succession observed in 2008, an exceptionally wet year, and 2009, an average year. The reservoir shows strong annual fluctuations in water level caused by monsoon rains and artificial drawdown. Altogether 28 functional groups of phytoplankton were identified, including 79 genera. Twelve of the groups were analyzed in detail using redundancy analysis. Because of the oligo-mesotrophic and P-limited condition of the reservoir, the dominant functional groups were those tolerant of nutrient (phosphorus) deficiency. The predominant functional groups in the succession process were Groups A (Cyclotella with greatest axial linear dimension < 10 mu m), B (Cyclotella with greatest axial linear dimension >10 mu m), L-O (Peridinium),L-M (Ceratium and Microcystis), E (Dinobryon and Mallomonas), F (Botryococcus), X-1 (Ankistrodesmus, Ankyra, Chlorella and Monoraphidium) and X-2 (Chlamydomonas and Chroomonas). The development of groups A, B and L-O was remarkably seasonal. Group A was dominant during stratification, when characteristic small size and high surface/volume ratio morphology conferred an advantage. Group L-O was dominant during dry stratification, when motility was advantageous. Group B plankton exhibited a high relative biomass during periods of reduced euphotic depth and isothermy. Groups L-M, E, F, X-1 and X-2 occasionally exhibited high relative biomasses attributable to specific environmental events (e.g. drawdown, changes in zooplankton community). A greater diversity of phytoplankton functional groups was apparent during isothermy. This study underscores the usefulness of functional algal groups in studying succession in subtropical impoundments, in which phytoplankton succession can be significantly affected by external factors such as monsoonal hydrology and artificial drawdown, which alter variables such as retention time, mixing regime and thermal structure and influence light and nutrient availability.

Linking the distribution of microbial deposits from the Great Salt Lake (Utah, USA) to tectonic and climatic processes	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The Great Salt Lake is a modern hypersaline lake, in which an extended modern and ancient microbial sedimentary system has developed. Detailed mapping based on aerial images and field observations can be used to identify non-random distribution patterns of microbial deposits, such as paleoshorelines associated with extensive polygons or fault-parallel alignments. Although it has been inferred that climatic changes controlling the lake level fluctuations explain the distribution of paleoshorelines and polygons, straight microbial deposit alignments may underline a normal fault system parallel to the Wasatch Front. This study is based on observations over a decimetre to kilometre spatial range, resulting in an integrated conceptual model for the controls on the distribution of the microbial deposits. The morphology, size and distribution of these deposits result mainly from environmental changes (i.e. seasonal to long-term water level fluctuations, particular geomorphological heritage, fault-induced processes, groundwater seepage) and have the potential to bring further insights into the reconstruction of paleoenvironments and paleoclimatic changes through time. New ra-diocarbon ages obtained on each microbial macrofabric described in this study improve the chronological framework and question the lake level variations that are commonly assumed.					; Visscher, Pieter/T-7464-2017; Yokoyama, Yusuke/N-9623-2013; Bourillot, Raphael/AAG-3775-2021; Visscher, Peter/J-4729-2013; Brayard, Arnaud/E-4711-2011	Yokoyama, Yusuke/0000-0001-7869-5891; Visscher, Pieter/0000-0001-6911-1532; Visscher, Peter/0000-0002-2143-8760; Goslar, Tomasz/0000-0002-1346-3122; Thomazo, Christophe/0000-0002-2475-0514; Bourillot, Raphael/0000-0003-4641-9125; Brayard, Arnaud/0000-0003-1304-6553; Bouton, Anthony/0000-0002-1414-5708													1726-4170	1726-4189				OCT 5	2016	13	19					5511	5526		10.5194/bg-13-5511-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5511-2016													WOS:000384643600002

Fate and Persistence of Particulate and Dissolved Microcystin-LA from Microcystis Blooms	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												Few studies have estimated fate and persistence of the hepatotoxic microcystins (MCs) in situ, making ecological and human health risk assessments challenging. We determined fate and persistence of MC congeners during 2years of Microcystis blooms in a small, shallow, closed-basin lake in Ontario, Canada. In situ half-lives were compared to estimates obtained in vitro under controlled temperature and light. The blooms produced elevated microcystin-LA (MC-LA) (maximum approximate to 4.2mg L-1) with minor concentrations of MC-LR, -RR, and -YR. Dissolved MC-LA declined more slowly and persisted longer than particulate MC-LA with in situ half-lives (total 1.5-8.5days) shorter than in vitro (total 6.8-60.0days). Half-lives in 2010 were two to eight times shorter compared to 2009, likely due to differences in bloom phenology and species/strain composition. In vitro, higher temperature (4 degrees C 25 degrees C in dark), and irradiance (dark 45 260E m(-2)s(-1) at 25 degrees C) accelerated particulate and dissolved MC-LA decline, respectively. MC-RR accumulated in surface sediments while MC-LA was near detection despite elevated surface water concentrations. MC-LA appears to persist longer in surface waters than the equally toxic MC-LR, requiring almost the entire recreational season (9.5 weeks) to reach guideline concentrations (20g L-1).

J	Enawgaw, Y; Wagaw, S				Enawgaw, Yirga; Wagaw, Solomon			Phytoplankton communities and environmental variables as indicators of ecosystem productivity in a shallow tropical lake	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The water quality and ecosystem productivity of a tropical lake in Ethiopia (Lake Arkiet) was evaluated using phytoplankton and environmental factors. This was to ascertaining the lake's potential for various applications. Phytoplankton communities and some selected environmental variables were collected from two predefined sampling sites (open water and littoral) using a seasonal campaign between March to May (dry season) and June to August (wet season) in 2022. The analysis of the physicochemical characteristics of this study showed that the lake's water was well-oxygenated (6.8-16.7 mg/L), warm (25.8-29.8 degrees C), turbid (154-317 NTU), had poor water transparency (4.3-16.1 cm), and was alkaline (pH = 7.29-11.31). The concentrations of inorganic nutrients (phosphate and nitrate) were notably high, ranging from 2.12-5.26 and 2.19-10.64 mg/L, respectively. A total of 34 phytoplankton taxa from four divisions were identified in Lake Arekit. Bacillariophyceae (18 taxa) and Chlorophyceae (10 taxa) were the major groups of phytoplankton which together represented the largest (82%) phytoplankton taxa. The total biovolume of phytoplankton in the lake was to be 384.15 mm3/L. Cyanobacteria contributed the largest (41%) phytoplankton biovolume followed by Bacillariophyta (32%). The highest biovolume (about 75%) was constituted in the Microcystis aeruginosa, Cylindrospermopsis raphidiopsis, Anabaena spiroides, Pediastrum duplex, Aulacoseira granulate, Navicula schroeteri, and Nitzschia palea. The distribution of environmental factors and phytoplankton communities showed greater seasonality. High phytoplankton biovolume was observed in the dry season at both sampling sites concurrently with high water transparency and low water temperature. Findings from this study revealed that Lake Arkeit was a moderately polluted but productive lacustrine ecosystem that can still support aquatic life, fish production, irrigation, and aquaculture. The primary source of the pollution is the entry of inorganic and organic wastes from a brewery and other water bottling industries nearby and around the lake, as well as possible excessive nutrient levels due to the lake's geological background. It is advised that commercial factories stop producing or releasing waste in open spaces that are heavily washed and enter the lake via flooding and tributary rivers and streams. Additionally, the local government should work with the nearby communities to set up a buffer zone where people are prohibited from engaging in agricultural activities to protect and reduce pollution, which will help to preserve the lake's water and ecosystem.

Data about dams are crucial for practitioners, scientists, and policymakers for various purposes, such as seasonal forecasting of water availability or flood mitigation. However, detailed information on dams on the national level for Germany is so far not freely available. We present the most comprehensive open-access dam inventory for Germany (DIG) to date. We have collected and combined information on dams using books, state agency reports, engineering reports, and internet pages. We have applied a priority rule that ensures the highest level of reliability for the dam information. Our dam inventory comprises 530 dams in Germany with information on name, location, river, start year of construction and operation, crest length, dam height, lake area, lake volume, purpose, dam structure, and building characteristics. We have used a global, satellite-based water surface raster to evaluate the location of the dams. A significant proportion (63 %) of dams were built between 1950-2013. Our inventory shows that dams in Germany are mostly single-purpose (52 %), 53% can be used for flood control, and 25% are involved in energy production. The inventory is freely available through GFZ (GeoForschungsZentrum) Data Services (https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.4.4.2020.005) (Speckhann et al., 2020).					; Kreibich, Heidi/HNR-9624-2023; Kreibich, Heidi/G-9408-2012	Merz, Bruno/0000-0002-5992-1440; Speckhann, Gustavo Andrei/0000-0002-0236-6079; Kreibich, Heidi/0000-0001-6274-3625													1866-3508	1866-3516				MAR 2	2021	13	2					731	740		10.5194/essd-13-731-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-731-2021													WOS:000629001800002

Turbulence and Gas Transfer Velocities in Sheltered Flooded Forests of the Amazon Basin	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Seasonally flooded forests along tropical rivers cover extensive areas, yet the processes driving air-water exchanges of radiatively active gases are uncertain. To quantify the controls on gas transfer velocities, we combined measurements of water-column temperature, meteorology in the forest and adjacent open water, turbulence with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter, gas concentrations, and fluxes with floating chambers. Under cooling, measured turbulence, quantified as the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (epsilon), was similar to buoyancy flux computed from the surface energy budget, indicating convection dominated turbulence production. Under heating, turbulence was suppressed unless winds in the adjacent open water exceeded 1 m/s. Gas transfer velocities obtained from chamber measurements ranged from 1 to 5 cm/hr and were similar to or slightly less than predicted using a turbulence-based surface renewal model computed with measured E and s predicted from wind and cooling. Plain Language Summary Flooded forests are widespread in the tropics and occur elsewhere. Within the lowland Amazon basin, seasonally inundated forests cover about 15% of the total area and are important to the ecology of the region. Concentrations of greenhouse gases can be high, indicating that flooded forests are likely an appreciable source of these gases to the atmosphere. To understand drivers of gas exchange, measurements of meteorology, temperature, and turbulence in the water were performed in Amazonian flooded forests. While air in flooded forests is often still, water immediately below is in motion and turbulent. The combination of wind-driven flows from outside the forest and nocturnal cooling within the forests indicates that near-surface turbulence is sustained in the flooded forest. Consequently, the extensive area of flooded forests will release appreciable amounts of greenhouse.					forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020; Amaral, João Henrique/AAC-4315-2022	Amaral, Joao Henrique/0000-0002-8992-6082													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 28	2019	46	16					9628	9636		10.1029/2019GL083948	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL083948													WOS:000490966700037

Nutrient Subsidies from Iteroparous Fish Migrations Can Enhance Stream Productivity	ECOSYSTEMS												Migratory animals often transfer nutrients between ecosystems, enhancing productivity in the subsidized system. Most research on nutrient subsidies by migratory fishes has focused on Pacific salmon, whose semelparous life history is unusual among migratory fishes. To test whether iteroparous species can provide ecologically important nutrient inputs to stream ecosystems, we experimentally blocked the migration of suckers (Catostomidae) midway up an oligotrophic tributary of Lake Michigan. Comparing reaches upstream of the barrier to downstream reaches containing thousands of breeding fish, we found that suckers elevated phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations three- to five-fold. Algal accrual was doubled and caddisflies grew 12% larger in subsidized reaches relative to reference reaches. An enclosure experiment demonstrated that caddisflies with access to a fish carcass rapidly became enriched in N-15 and C-13, and experimental carcass additions were rapidly colonized by high densities of caddisflies. However, under natural conditions below the experimental barrier, caddisflies became enriched in N-15 but not C-13, indicating that fish-derived nutrients entered the stream food web primarily through indirect pathways rather than direct consumption of carcasses or gametes. At pupation, an average of 18% of caddisfly tissue N below the barrier was sucker-derived. In comparison to our focal stream, a reference stream with few suckers showed no seasonal or longitudinal patterns in nutrients and stable isotopes. These results demonstrate that iteroparous fish migrations can spur productivity via nutrient subsidies, despite low mortality rates. Thus, concerns about negative ecosystem-level consequences of blocking migrations of semelparous fishes are also applicable to iteroparous species when migrations are large.

The disease occurs in sporadic outbreaks that involve livestock, wildlife, and humans, but knowledge on factors that affect the geographic distribution of these outbreaks is limited, challenging public health intervention planning. Methods Anthrax surveillance data reported in southern Kenya from 2011 to 2017 were modeled using a boosted regression trees (BRT) framework. An ensemble of 100 BRT experiments was developed using a variable set of 18 environmental covariates and 69 unique anthrax locations. Model performance was evaluated using AUC (area under the curve) ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curves. Results Cattle density, rainfall of wettest month, soil clay content, soil pH, soil organic carbon, length of longest dry season, vegetation index, temperature seasonality, in order, were identified as key variables for predicting environmental suitability for anthrax in the region. BRTs performed well with a mean AUC of 0.8. Areas highly suitable for anthrax were predicted predominantly in the southwestern region around the shared Kenya-Tanzania border and a belt through the regions and highlands in central Kenya. These suitable regions extend westwards to cover large areas in western highlands and the western regions around Lake Victoria and bordering Uganda. The entire eastern and lower-eastern regions towards the coastal region were predicted to have lower suitability for anthrax. Conclusion These modeling efforts identified areas of anthrax suitability across southern Kenya, including high and medium agricultural potential regions and wildlife parks, important for tourism and foreign exchange. These predictions are useful for policy makers in designing targeted surveillance and/or control interventions in Kenya. We thank the staff of Directorate of Veterinary Services under the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, for collecting and providing the anthrax historical occurrence data. Author summary Anthrax is a neglected zoonosis worldwide. In Kenya, outbreaks have been reported in wildlife, livestock, and humans, resulting in severe public health burden and socio-economic impacts. Because of this, anthrax is ranked as the highest priority disease in the country. To identify factors that influence the spatial distribution of the disease in Kenya, we analyzed surveillance on available anthrax outbreaks recorded in the southern half of the country. Areas predicted to be highly suitable for the disease were predominantly in the southwestern region around the shared Kenya-Tanzania border running as a belt through central regions and central highlands of Kenya. These suitability regions extend westwards to cover large areas in western highlands and the western regions around Lake Victoria and bordering Uganda. The entire eastern and lower-eastern regions towards the coastal region were predicted to have lower suitability for anthrax. Cattle density, rainfall of wettest month, soil clay content, soil pH, soil organic carbon, length of longest dry season, vegetation index and temperature seasonality were key variables predicting the distribution of anthrax in the region. The study generated a suitability map depicting geographical areas that can be targeted for risk-based surveillance and or control measures for the disease.

We introduce here a new method that estimates nearshore topography of water bodies based on a flood frequency map and time series of water levels by assuming the equivalence between flood frequency and water level exceedance probability at a given area. Test cases are performed for two lakes and 12 hydropower reservoirs using the proposed Flood2Topo app. This new application generates the bottom level pixel by pixel and level-area-active storage relationship directly from the topography map, without the need to fit functions. Flood extent estimates from the Landsat based Global Surface Water (GSW) data set, the current state-of-the-art, were used to run Flood2Topo, together with water levels from satellite altimetry and in situ gauges. Results show bottom level root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 18.5 and 146 cm for Lake Poopo (Bolivia) and Lake Curuai (Amazon basin), respectively. For reservoir active storage, RMSD normalized values ranged from 2% to 11% for 11 reservoirs (average NRMSD of 6.4%). The method can be applied to any seasonally flooded area using any data set. Considering the surface water occurrence map from the GSW data set, the method is applicable to 35.8% (86%) of the global seasonally flooded areas delimited by flood frequencies between 0 and 95% (99%) over 35 years. The flood frequency-based method is a promising tool for obtaining data for hydrodynamic simulations and monitoring of ungauged water bodies.

Interaction between lakes' surface water and groundwater in the Pantanal wetland, Brazil	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Nhecolandia subregion (area similar to 26,921km(2)), in central-southern Pantanal, is marked by the presence of hundreds of alkaline-saline lakes, located on the top of sand hills, and thousands of non-alkaline lakes adjacent to the sand hills. This study aimed to provide a better understanding of the hydrological dynamics in the Nhecolandia, which is scarce and controversial, based on piezometric monitoring, isotopic data and chemical analyses of the surface water and groundwater of an alkaline-saline lake, a non-alkaline lake and the sand hill between them. The potentiometric data indicated that both alkaline-saline and non-alkaline lakes act as recharge zones, the former in all seasons and the later only in the wet season. These results are corroborated by downward flow near the zones of recharge, indicated by hydraulic head measurements in multilevel wells around the non-alkaline lake and in mini-piezometers installed in the studied alkaline-saline lake and two more lakes in the region. Also, O-18 and H-2 values of the alkaline-saline lake surface water became more depleted than the surrounding groundwater in the wet season, confirming that the inflow to the alkaline-saline lake in this season was by the more depleted rainwater and not by the isotopically enriched groundwater. The water chemistry data is also in agreement with recharge from the alkaline-saline lake, even though this recharge is limited by a low-K layer. Because of this layer, the non-alkaline lake does not dry off during the dry season.

A green house experiment was carried out to testify the restoration feasible of Carex Tussock in salinization area. We used a factorial design with two soil conditions (degraded soil occurred salinization and undisturbed soil), two Carex Tussocks (degraded ones resulted from soda-salinization and well ones) and three water levels (long-term drought, seasonal inundation and long-term inundation). In soda-saline soil, degraded Carex Tussock subjected to long-term drought died finally, and could not be revived even the stress was eliminated. Degraded Carex Tussock subjected to the other two water treatments and well Carex Tussock in all water condition went dormant status until environment was improved. However, in the undisturbed soil, except for degraded Carex Tussock under the long-term drought, others successfully survived to the end of experiments, and the degraded ones could be revived when water condition was improved. In undisturbed soil, height, leaf width, leaf area, chlorophyll content and biomass (fresh biomass and dry biomass) of well ones were better than degraded ones. Above results illustrated that it was not feasible to restore Carex Tussock in the soda-saline soils no matter by water condition improvement or well Carex Tussock transplanted. However, transplanting degraded or well Carex Tussock to undisturbed soil could establish successfully. Besides, natural Carex Tussock protection should be paid more attention to avoid soil salinization or secondary salinization. Once salinization or secondary salinization extensively occurred, the degeneration of Carex Tussock would be irreversible.					; Liu, Yan/MXM-1994-2025; Lu, Xianguo/AAL-2016-2021	lu, xian guo/0000-0001-7638-2787; DONGJIE, ZHANG/0000-0002-2768-9077; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2019	98						131	136		10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.08.066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.08.066													WOS:000464891100015
J	Ho, A; Lüke, C; Reim, A; Frenzel, P				Ho, Adrian; Lueke, Claudia; Reim, Andreas; Frenzel, Peter			Resilience of (seed bank) aerobic methanotrophs and methanotrophic activity to desiccation and heat stress	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												In seasonally changing environments, aerobic methanotrophs are exposed to elevated temperatures and drought. Prior exposure to adverse conditions (site history) may leave an imprint on the methanotrophic community composition in the form of a seed bank. While the significance of a microbial seed bank is established, the potential of this seemingly preserved community following emergence from inactive states and its sensitivity to adverse conditions are still lacking. We used a paddy soil representing an environment experiencing recurring desiccation and heat stress as per agricultural practice, and two lake sediments with sporadic/limited or no exposure to desiccation and heat stress as model systems. In a microcosm study, we induced drought combined with a heat treatment by air-drying the samples at ambient (25 degrees C) and elevated (75 degrees C) temperatures, designated as mild and severe stress, respectively. Fresh soil/sediment were used as reference. Upon rewetting, we followed the recovery of the methane uptake rate, and the population dynamics was monitored using qPCR assays and a diagnostic microarray analysis. Remarkably, methane uptake rates were not adversely affected even after severe stress, and activity recovered to levels comparable to the fresh soil/sediment incubations after 40 days. In particular, the alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs (Methylosinus-Methylocystis group) exponentially increased in population size upon rewetting. Interestingly, the qPCR and microarray analyses revealed that some gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs (e.g. Methylocaldum- and Methylosarcina-related methanotrophs) increased in relative abundance after the desiccation and heat stress, indicating the unexpected resistance of this subgroup to the stress treatment. Although the initial and recovering communities were significantly different, population abundance recovered over time. The shift in the trajectory of the recovering communities suggests that repeated exposure to adverse factors will change the seed bank's composition. Overall, the indigenous (seed bank) methanotroph populations showed remarkable recovery from the induced stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

More than 3.5 km of surveyed cave passage nearly circumnavigate the East Crater, reaching within 19 m of the 4,392 m summit and extending to 144 m depth along the glacier-crater boundary. The large circum-crater passage connects entrances on the crater rim to steep transverse passages, and cave morphology is maintained by fumarole gas convection and advection. A melt- and condensate-formed lake, Lake Adelie, occupies a portion of the circum-crater passage. Hourly data were collected between August 2016 and August 2017 and included the measured temperatures at three fumaroles, the cave air temperature and pressure, the lake water temperature and depth, and the outside temperature and snow depth at Paradise Visitors Center. Time-series analyses of these data reveal complex associations between synoptic to seasonal weather, fumarole activity, and lake level. On seasonal and longer scales, fumarole temperatures follow independent pathways connected to spatial and temporal changes in volcanic heat flux and the circulation of glacial melt. Major snowfall seals the cave entrances, increasing cave air temperature and pressure from fumarole output and causing rising lake levels from increased melt until entrances reopen. Repeating freeze-thaw cycles observed in the cave monitoring data are a primary cause of crater mass wasting. Despite these transient variations, the scale and morphology of the caves is preserved over decadal or longer scales.

Here we assess the added value of the convection-permitting scale simulations on the representation of moist convective systems over and around Lake Victoria. With this aim, 10 year present-day model simulations were carried out with five regional climate models at both PARameterized (PAR) scales (12-25 km) and Convection-Permitting (CP) scales (2.5-4.5 km), with COSMO-CLM, RegCM, AROME, WRF and UKMO. Most substantial systematic improvements were found in metrics related to deep convection. For example, the timing of the daily maximum in precipitation is systematically delayed in CP compared to PAR models, thereby improving the agreement with observations. The large overestimation in the total number of rainy events is alleviated in the CP models. Systematic improvements were found in the diurnal cycle in Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiation and in some metrics for precipitation intensity. No unanimous improvement nor deterioration was found in the representation of the spatial distribution of total rainfall and the seasonal cycle when going to the CP scale. Furthermore, some substantial biases in TOA upward radiative fluxes remain. Generally our analysis indicates that the representation of the convective systems is strongly improved in CP compared to PAR models, giving confidence that the models are valuable tools for studying how extreme precipitation events may evolve in the future in the Lake Victoria basin and its surroundings.					; Demuzere, Matthias/HOF-7046-2023; Finney, Declan/B-1473-2013; Ludwig, Patrick/D-2729-2019; Belusic, Danijel/E-5672-2012; van Lipzig, Nicole/ABF-2964-2021; Fink, Andreas/F-3024-2017; Pinto, Joaquim G./A-7352-2009; Rowell, David/AAF-3674-2019; Fink, Andreas H./F-3024-2017; Thiery, Wim/AAJ-6692-2021; Wu, Minchao/AAZ-6668-2021; Marsham, John/AAA-2277-2020; Pinto, Joaquim/A-7352-2009	Demuzere, Matthias/0000-0003-3237-4077; Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145; Finney, Declan/0000-0002-3334-6935; Berthou, Segolene/0000-0002-9164-0841; Ludwig, Patrick/0000-0003-3655-7890; Belusic, Danijel/0000-0002-5665-3866; Wu, Minchao/0000-0003-3557-8462; van Lipzig, Nicole/0000-0003-2899-4046; Van de Walle, Jonas/0000-0002-7819-7419; Pinto, Joaquim G./0000-0002-8865-1769; Fink, Andreas H./0000-0002-5840-2120; Coppola, Erika/0000-0001-6944-5815; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				JUN	2023	60	11-12					4033	4054		10.1007/s00382-022-06541-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06541-5		NOV 2022											WOS:000878948800003

Impacts of climate, lake size, and supra- and sub-permafrost groundwater flow on lake-talik evolution, Yukon Flats, Alaska (USA)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												In cold regions, hydrologic systems possess seasonal and perennial ice-free zones (taliks) within areas of permafrost that control and are enhanced by groundwater flow. Simulation of talik development that follows lake formation in watersheds modeled after those in the Yukon Flats of interior Alaska (USA) provides insight on the coupled interaction between groundwater flow and ice distribution. The SUTRA groundwater simulator with freeze-thaw physics is used to examine the effect of climate, lake size, and lake-groundwater relations on talik formation. Considering a range of these factors, simulated times for a through-going sub-lake talik to form through 90 m of permafrost range from similar to 200 to > 1,000 years (vertical thaw rates < 0.1-0.5 m yr(-1)). Seasonal temperature cycles along lake margins impact supra-permafrost flow and late-stage cryologic processes. Warmer climate accelerates complete permafrost thaw and enhances seasonal flow within the supra-permafrost layer. Prior to open talik formation, sub-lake permafrost thaw is dominated by heat conduction. When hydraulic conditions induce upward or downward flow between the lake and sub-permafrost aquifer, thaw rates are greatly increased. The complexity of ground-ice and water-flow interplay, together with anticipated warming in the arctic, underscores the utility of coupled groundwater-energy transport models in evaluating hydrologic systems impacted by permafrost.

The importance of forest cover for fish richness and abundance on the Amazon floodplain	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Flooded forest is one of the most important fish habitats in Neotropical rivers, and one that is increasingly subjected to negative impacts from logging, agriculture, and other human activities. The purpose of our study was to test quantitatively whether fish richness and abundance in Amazonian floodplain lakes are associated with the area of flooded forest. We sampled fish and several other variables in 35 Amazonian floodplain lakes during the high-water season. Our results highlighted that fish richness and abundance were directly related to flooded forest, inversely related to distance from the river, and influenced by dissolved oxygen concentration < 1 mg l(-1). The same result applied to fish richness and abundance landed by fisheries. Other variables such as depth and area of open water habitat were also related but the results were less consistent and apparently reliant on sampling methodology. Our results suggest that conservation of the flooded forest is critical for the maintenance of fish assemblages in the Amazon, and that removal of flooded forest will reduce fish richness, fish abundance, and fisheries yield.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2015	750	1					245	255		10.1007/s10750-014-2040-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-2040-0													WOS:000350244600015

Rock hyrax middens: A palaeoenvironmental archive for southern African drylands	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Like many of the world's subtropical regions, southern Africa is highly sensitive to changes in the earth's climate system, but a dearth of reliable palaeoenvironmental records means that relatively little is known about how regional environments have been affected over centennial to multi-millennial timescales. To a large extent this sensitivity is a function of the position of these regions at the interface between temperate and tropical circulation systems. The resulting seasonality and irregularity of rainfall have limited the development of suitable archives, such as lakes and wetlands, for the preservation of palaeoenvironmental proxies. This paper reviews and evaluates the value of rock hyrax middens as novel palaeoenvironmental archives in southern Africa. Considered are (1) the contemporary taxonomy, distribution and ecology of hyraxes, (2) the mechanisms of hyrax midden development, their physical and chemical structure, rates of accumulation and age; and (3) the palaeoenvironmental proxies preserved within hyrax middens, including fossil pollen, stable isotopes and biomarkers. The interpretive constraints and opportunities offered by these various midden characteristics are assessed with a view to demonstrating the potential of these deposits, widespread as they are through arid and semi-arid southern Africa, in providing a more detailed and chronologically resolved view of late Quaternary palaeoenvironments across the subcontinent.

In this study, a water quality monitoring buoy was outfitted with an automated water sampler taking preserved samples every 6 h for 68.75 days over a drinking water intake. A total of 251 samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry for 21 cyanotoxin congeners in S classes producing 5020 data points. Microcystins (MCs) were the most abundant toxins measured (mean +/- sd = 3.9 +/- 3.3 mu g/L) followed by cyanopeptolins (CPs) (1.1 +/- 1.5 mu g/L), anabaenopeptins (APs) (1.0 +/- 0.6 mu g/L), anatoxin-a (AT-A) (0.03 +/- 0.06 mu g/L), and microginin-690 (MG-690) (0.002 +/- 0.01 mu g/L). Advanced time series analyses uncovered patterns in cyanotoxin production. The velocity of cyanotoxin concentration varied from -0.7 to 0.9 mu g/L/h with a maximum positive velocity just prior to peak toxin concentration during nonbloom periods. A backward-looking moving window of variance analysis detected major increases in cyanotoxin concentration and predicted the two greatest increases in MC. A wavelet analysis identified a significant (p < 0.01) 2.8-4.2 day periodicity in toxin concentration over a similar to 25 day period during peak toxin production, which is partially explained by easterly wind velocity (R = 0.2, p < 0.05). Diversity in congener profiles was explored with principle component analysis showing that cyanotoxin dynamics followed a seasonal trajectory where toxin profiles were significantly clustered (ANOSIM R = 0.7, p < 0.05) on a daily basis. Variability in toxin profiles was strongly correlated with time (R = -0.8, p < 0.001) as well as the C:N ratio of the toxin pool (R = 0.17, p < 0.05). The methods employed here should be useful for uncovering patterns in cyanotoxin dynamics in other systems.

During 14 days of darkness incubation, chlorophyll-a (Ch-alpha) concentration decreased from 2000 mu g/L to 5 mu g/L. Samples were collected on days 0, 2 and 14 for bacterial 16S rRNA analysis, based on rapid decreases in the Chl-alpha concentration of water column. The total bacterial community DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned and sequenced of selected samples. The results showed that the abundance of attached bacteria increased significantly, and the composition of the particle-attached bacterial communities varied temporally during the decomposition of Microcystis blooms. The bacterial assemblage appeared to be dominated by members of Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. Shift of some genera of Alphaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria was also observed. Additionally, we found that the family Sphingomonas, affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria, identified as a microcystin-degrading bacterium, dominated the particle-attached bacterial communities. The results from the present study, together with previously published data highlighted the need for more studies concerning the bacterial degradation process in order to trace the environmental fate of microcystins in field conditions.

This study aimed to investigate the hydrological health of the Yangtze River-Dongting Lake system from a systemic evolutionary perspective and quantify the impact of external driving forces. Based on the cross-wavelet transform method, the dynamic changes in the hydrological health of the river-lake system during the study period (1969-2019) were assessed, and the response relationship was described via multifractal analysis. Finally, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model was constructed to quantify the impact of external driving force changes on hydrolog-ical health. The results are described as follows: (1) the hydrological health of the river-lake system has declined, but the lake conditions are stable; (2) the Yangtze River-Dongting Lake system has higher synchronous changes during high-water season but lower during low-water season; (3) a positive correlation exists between the hy-drological health changes of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake, and the regulation of Dongting Lake is critical to the hydrological health of the Yangtze River, with only a minor impact of the Yangtze River on Dongting Lake; (4) the multifractal spectrum shows that the impact of large hydrological fluctuations at Zhicheng station has an advantage over small fluctuations on Luoshan station, and the response of hydrological health at the Luoshan station to lake is stronger than to upstream water, regardless of the long-short time scale; (5) climate change and non-climatic factors have jointly mediated a decline in hydrological health of Dongting Lake, with non-climatic factors being the main driving force, and an impact weight of 88.6% at the annual scale. On a monthly scale, the most favourable and unfavorable impact of non-climatic factors was reported in June (4.69) and October (-25.37), respectively.

J	Quirino, BA; Carniatto, N; Guglielmetti, R; Fugi, R				Quirino, Barbara Angelio; Carniatto, Natalia; Guglielmetti, Renata; Fugi, Rosemara			Changes in diet and niche breadth of a small fish species in response to the flood pulse in a Neotropical floodplain lake	LIMNOLOGICA												This study tested the hypothesis that the flood pulse affects the diet composition and the niche breadth of Moenkhausia forestii, a small characid fish inhabiting the littoral zone of lakes. To this end, we compared the diet composition (at the population and individual levels) between hydrological periods (high and low water phases) in a floodplain lake of the Upper Parana River. PERMANOVA revealed differences in the diet between periods (pseudoF(1,38) = 8.5; p < 0.001), with predominant consumption of chironomid larvae and Ephemeroptera (aquatic resources) in the low-water period and an increase in the contribution of terrestrial resources (Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Orthoptera) during the high-water period, Based on the PERMDISP results, inter-individual variability in M. forestii diet also differed between periods (F-1,F-38 = 5.80; p = 0.02), with higher values during the high-water period resulting in a dietary niche expansion. During the low-water period, we observed the dominance of chironomid larvae in the diets of mostindividuals, resulting in lower inter-individual variability and thus narrower niche breadth. The diet of M. forestii was affected by the flood pulse at both the population and individual levels. The most important difference was found in the origin of food items; during the low-water period, the diet consisted mainly of aquatic resources, and during the high-water period, there was a large contribution of terrestrial resources. This variation is related to the increased availability of allochthonous resources in the high period, when terrestrial areas are flooded by the overflow of the river, thereby increasing the input of resources into the aquatic environment. The increased availability of food resources during this period allowed the expansion of the trophic niche of M. forestii, accompanied by the highest richness (19 items) and the highest evenness of food items.

It is unclear where the nitrogen goes. Our enclosure experiments and batch tests suggested that Microcystis blooms could significantly reduce the nitrogen in water bodies and the key mechanisms for the nitrogen reduction in different layers were different. The assimilation was the main pathway for nitrogen reduction in the surface layer, while denitrification played an important role both at the sediment-water interface and in the overlying water. Stable nitrogen isotope experiments showed that the nitrate reduction efficiency at sediment-water interface was enhanced by Microcystis, reaching to 76.5 similar to 84.7 %. Dissimilation accounted for 63.8 similar to 67.3 % of the nitrate reduction, and the denitrification rate was 7.4 similar to 8.5 times of DNRA rate. In the water column, the Microcystis bloom facilitated the formation of dark/anoxic condition, which favored the denitrification. The Microcystis aggregates collected from the field showed a great potential in removing nitrogen, and the TN in the overly water was reduced by 3.76 similar to 6.03 mg L-1 within two days. This study provided field evidences and deeper insights into the relationship between Microcystis blooms and nitrogen reduction in the whole water column and gave more details about the enhancing effects of Microcystis on nitrogen reduction.

However, the mass involvement of citizens in monitoring freshwater health is a relatively new field and subject to uncertainty. Here, we examine 1192 samples collected across 46 temperate ponds (<2 ha) and 29 temperate lakes (>2 ha) by 120 volunteers trained through the Fresh Water Watch citizen science programme to consider if the approach is able to (a) identify well established patterns in water quality and biological indicators (i.e., fish), and (b) provide a potentially useful basis for the identification of pollution sources in urban or peri-urban landscapes. Seasonal patterns observed agreed well with established principles of nutrient dynamics, algal bloom seasonality, and broad biological trends between ponds and lakes. Further, observational data collected by the volunteers suggested plausible links between the presence of residential discharge and water level fluctuation and significant increases in algal bloom observations between peri-urban and urban sites. We suggest that citizen science can have a role to play in complementing regulatory monitoring efforts and that local citizens should be empowered to become stewards of their local freshwater resources.					; Loiselle, Steven/ABA-3324-2020	Loiselle, Steven/0000-0001-7414-0389; Thornhill, Ian/0000-0003-3818-1380; 														2073-4441				JUL	2018	10	7							839	10.3390/w10070839	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10070839													WOS:000442579700022
J	Cabedo-Sanz, P; Belt, ST; Knies, J; Husum, K				Cabedo-Sanz, Patricia; Belt, Simon T.; Knies, Jochen; Husum, Katrine			Identification of contrasting seasonal sea ice conditions during the Younger Dryas	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A palaeo sea ice reconstruction for northern Norway for the interval ca 13.8-7.2 cal ka BP has been performed using a combined organic geochemical proxy-based study of a marine sediment core (JM99-1200) obtained from Andfjorden (69 degrees 15.95' N, 16 degrees 25.09' E) and the outcomes compared with a series of other palaeoclimate studies carried out previously. Within this study, particular emphasis has been placed on the identification of the sea ice conditions during the Younger Dryas and the application of different biomarker-based proxies to both identify and quantify seasonal sea ice conditions. Firstly, the appearance of the specific sea ice diatom proxy IP25 at ca 12.9 cal ka BP in the sedimentary record has provided an unambiguous but qualitative measure of seasonal sea ice and thus the onset of the Younger Dryas stadial. The near continuous occurrence of IP25 for the next ca 1400 yr demonstrates seasonal sea ice during this interval, although variable abundances suggest that the recurrent conditions in the early-mid Younger Diyas (ca 12.9-11.9 cal ka BP) changed significantly from stable to highly variable sea ice conditions at ca 11.9 cal ka BP and this instability in sea ice prevailed for the subsequent ca 400 yr, during which, an extremely short interval of permanent or near-permanent sea ice was observed at ca 11.75 cal ka BP. At ca 11.5 cal ka BP, IP25 disappeared from the record indicating ice-free conditions that signified the beginning of the Holocene. The IP25 concentrations were also combined with those of the open water phytoplankton biomarker brassicasterol to generate PBIP25 data from which more quantitative measurements of sea ice were determined. PBIP25 data were consistent with, consecutively, seasonal then infrequent sea ice cover for the early-mid and late Younger Dryas, while further comparisons of the PBIP25 data with the outcomes of previous correlations with modelled sea ice concentrations suggested that these intervals were characterised by ca 60-90% and ca 0-60% sea ice cover, respectively. Both qualitative and quantitative sea ice records were also consistent with sea surface temperature and other palaeoclimate estimates derived previously from various other proxy studies. The contrasting seasonal sea ice conditions during the Younger Dryas were further verified through a comparison of the concentrations of IP25 with those of another highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) alkene that is di-unsaturated and believed to also be produced by sea ice diatoms. The ratio of the HBI diene to IP25, termed DIP25, is believed to provide a useful indicator of stability or variability in sea ice conditions and complements the outcomes from the IP25 and PBIP25 index data. The identification of contrasting seasonal sea ice conditions during the Younger Dryas will likely contribute to the debate regarding the climatic impacts that took place during this intriguing interval.

While spatial-temporal information on water pollution in Europe is increasing, there are substantial knowledge gaps on seasonal pollution dynamics in tropical countries. Thus, we took Lake Victoria South Basin in western Kenya as a case study to identify spatial and seasonal hot spots of contamination, quantified toxic risks to different groups of organisms, and identified seasonal risk drivers. For this purpose, we analyzed grab water samples from five rivers with agricultural and wastewater treatment plants in their catchment in four different seasons. We used liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with a target list of 785 organic micropollutants. A total of 307 compounds were detected with concentrations ranging from 0.3 ng/L to 6.6 mu g/L. Using a Toxic Unit (TU) approach based on mixture toxicity to standard test organisms, crustaceans were identified as the most affected group followed by algae and fish. For crustaceans, chronic risk thresholds were exceeded in 96 % of all the samples, while 56 % of all samples are expected to be acutely toxic, with the highest risk in February during the dry season. High toxic unit values for algae and fish were recorded in July dry season and May wet season. Diazinon, imidacloprid, clothianidin and pirimiphos-methyl were the major drivers for crustacean toxicity while triclosan and different herbicide mixtures drive risks to algae in dry and wet seasons, respectively. A total of 18 chemicals were found to exceed acute and chronic environmental risk thresholds. With this study, strong spatial-temporal patterns of pollution, risks and risk drivers could be confirmed informing prioritization of monitoring and abatement to enhance water quality and reduce toxic risks.

Assessment of Water Quality in A Tropical Reservoir in Mexico: Seasonal, Spatial and Multivariable Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Agricultural activities are highly related to the reduction of the availability of water resources due to the consumption of freshwater for crop irrigation, the use of fertilizers and pesticides. In this study, the water quality of the Adolfo Lopez Mateos (ALM) reservoir was evaluated. This is one of the most important reservoirs in Mexico since the water stored is used mainly for crop irrigation in the most productive agricultural region. A comprehensive evaluation of water quality was carried out by analyzing the behavior of 23 parameters at four sampling points in the period of 2012-2019. The analysis of the spatial behavior of the water quality parameters was studied by spatial distribution graphs using the Inverse Distance Weighting interpolation. Pearson correlation was performed to better describe the behavior of all water quality parameters. This analysis revealed that many of these parameters were significantly correlated. The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was carried out and showed the importance of water quality parameters. Ten principal components were obtained, which explained almost 90% of the total variation of the data. Additionally, the comprehensive pollution index showed a slight water quality variation in the ALM reservoir. This study also demonstrated that the main source of contamination in this reservoir occurs near sampling point one. Finally, the results obtained indicated that a contamination risk in the waterbody and further severe ecosystem degradations may occur if appropriate management is not taken.

J	Zhu, SJ; Mao, JQ				Zhu, Shijie; Mao, Jingqiao			A Machine Learning Approach for Estimating the Trophic State of Urban Waters Based on Remote Sensing and Environmental Factors	REMOTE SENSING												To improve the accuracy of remotely sensed estimates of the trophic state index (TSI) of inland urban water bodies, key environmental factors (water temperature and wind field) were considered during the modelling process. Such environmental factors can be easily measured and display a strong correlation with TSI. Then, a backpropagation neural network (BP-NN) was applied to develop the TSI estimation model using remote sensing and environmental factors. The model was trained and validated using the TSI quantified by five water trophic indicators obtained for the period between 2018 and 2019, and then we selected the most appropriate combination of input variables according to the performance of the BP-NN. Our results demonstrate that the optimal performance can be obtained by combining the water temperature and single-band reflection values of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery as input variables (R-2 = 0.922, RMSE = 3.256, MAPE = 2.494%, and classification accuracy rate = 86.364%). Finally, the spatial and temporal distribution of the aquatic trophic state over four months with different trophic levels was mapped in Gongqingcheng City using the TSI estimation model. In general, the predictive maps based on our proposed model show significant seasonal changes and spatial characteristics in the water trophic state, indicating the possibility of performing cost-effective, RS-based TSI estimation studies on complex urban water bodies elsewhere.																				2072-4292				JUL	2021	13	13							2498	10.3390/rs13132498	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13132498													WOS:000671098200001

The volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentrations and wet deposition fluxes of Hg-T and MeHg in precipitation were 4.8 ng L-1 and 1.75 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), 0.031 ng L-1 and 0.01 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. VWM Hg-T concentration was approximately two times higher during the non-monsoon season than during the monsoon season, while 83% of the Hg-T wet deposition fluxes occurred during the monsoon season. The Hg-T and MeHg concentrations are comparable to the reported data for some of the most remote alpine and polar regions worldwide (e.g.. Churchill), but the wet deposition fluxes of Hg-T and MeHg were among the lowest in the world. Analysis of Hg speciation has presented that Hg-p and MeHg concentrations are high, making up 712% and 1.82% of the Hg-T on average (VWM), respectively. The high Hg-p%, as well as a significantly positive between Hg-T and Hg-p (R-2 = 0.91; n = 44; p < 0.001), confirmed that atmospheric deposition of Hg in the Tibetan Plateau was occurring in the form of Hg-p. A decreasing trend in Hg-T concentrations with increasing amount of precipitation (R-2 = 0.08; N = 101; p < 0.005) was found at Nam Co Station, indicative that scavenging of Hg-p from the atmosphere was an important mechanism contributing Hg to precipitation. The precipitation amount, rather than Hg-T concentration, was found to be the governing factor affecting Hg-T wet deposition flux. Moreover, a comparison between measured wet deposition flux of Hg at Nam Co Station and the estimates from environmental records indicated that both snowpits and lake sediments appear to be reliable archives for estimating historical Hg accumulation rates over the Tibetan Plateau.

Microbially driven nitrogen removal could alleviate eutrophication to some degree in freshwater ecosystems. However, the response of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) bacterial communities to cyanobacterial blooms remains poorly understood, especially in reservoir ecosystems. Here we compared the dynamics of anammox bacterial communities during and after a cyanobacterial bloom in a subtropical reservoir. Our data showed that a cyanobacterial bloom triggered a significant increase in bottom anammox bacterial abundance. During the bloom period, anammox bacterial abundance in bottom waters was 9-fold and 52-fold higher compared with non-bloom stratification and mixing periods, respectively. The community composition of anammox bacteria in surface waters changed substantially accompanied by the disappearance of the cyanobacterial bloom, and a shift of dominance from unidentified anammox genera to Ca. Brocadia was observed. Although Ca. Brocadia was always predominant in both middle and bottom waters, the non-bloom period had more unique taxa than the bloom period. Cyanobacterial bloom-related changes in environmental conditions (e.g. NH4-N and total organic carbon) and water stratification together influenced the distribution and dynamics of anammox bacteria. Altogether, our study lays the basis for a better understanding of the breakdown of cyanobacterial blooms in a stratified reservoir.					chen, huihuang/AAB-8350-2019; Xue, Yuanyuan/ADI-1424-2022; Huang, BQ/G-4588-2010; Yang, Jun/E-6680-2011; YANG, Jun/E-6680-2011; Liu, Lemian/AGP-9346-2022; Chen, Huihuang/AAB-8350-2019	Huang, Bangqin/0000-0003-2279-6241; YANG, Jun/0000-0002-7920-2777; Liu, Lemian/0000-0002-8977-6969; Chen, Huihuang/0000-0002-4401-9059													0168-6496	1574-6941				OCT	2017	93	10							fix118	10.1093/femsec/fix118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fix118								28961823					WOS:000416389000008

Most pelagic food web studies assume that all phytoplankton taxa have a similar delta C-13 value. We studied pelagic food web compartments (dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC], phytoplankton, bacteria, seston, cladoceran zooplankton) in 12 small (< 0.1 km(2)) lakes in southern Finland. These lakes were classified as oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, and dystrophic based on their concentrations of total phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon. Additionally, we studied phytoplankton photosynthetic carbon fractionation (epsilon(p)) in laboratory conditions. The photosynthetic fractionation in 28 phytoplankton cultures from nine different phytoplankton classes varied significantly at the class level, and fractionation correlated significantly with the DIC concentration of the growth media. In small boreal lakes, the delta C-13 values of different phytoplankton taxa, as directly measured or estimated from the delta C-13 values of biomarker fatty acids, varied greatly (-18 parts per thousand to - 44.5 parts per thousand). Phytoplankton delta C-13 values varied significantly by lake type and were most depleted in dystrophic lakes even though the delta C-13 values of the DIC was similar to mesotrophic lakes. Further within-taxa variation was found between lakes and between different depths within a lake. Vertical samples from dystrophic lakes also showed lower ep in the phytoplankton from meta-and hypolimnion, possibly as a result of reduced light intensity. Altogether, in nine of the 10 sampled lakes, the delta C-13 values of cladoceran zooplankton were between the minimum and the maximum phytoplankton delta C-13 value of each lake, and thus, phytoplankton alone could explain zooplankton delta C-13 values. We conclude that stable isotope mixing models should take into account carbon variation among different phytoplankton taxa.					; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020	Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863; Hiltunen, Minna/0000-0002-0003-3000; Vuorio, Kristiina/0000-0001-7974-0092; Peltomaa, Elina/0000-0002-2858-8358; 													2150-8925					AUG	2016	7	8							e01392	10.1002/ecs2.1392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1392													WOS:000387208900002

Use of Fish Telemetry in Rehabilitation Planning, Management, and Monitoring in Areas of Concern in the Laurentian Great Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Freshwater ecosystems provide many ecosystem services; however, they are often degraded as a result of human activity. To address ecosystem degradation in the Laurentian Great Lakes, Canada and the United States of America established the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA). In 1987, 43 highly polluted and impacted areas were identified under the GLWQA as having one or more of 14 Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) to the physical and chemical habitat for fish, wildlife and humans, and were designated as Areas of Concern (AOC). Subnational jurisdictions combined with local stakeholders, with support from federal governments, developed plans to remediate and restore these sites. Biotelemetry (the tracking of animals using electronic tags) provides information on the spatial ecology of fish in the wild relevant to habitat management and stock assessment. Here, seven case studies are presented where biotelemetry data were directly incorporated within the AOC Remedial Action Plan (RAP) process. Specific applications include determining seasonal fish-habitat associations to inform habitat restoration plans, identifying the distribution of pollutant-indicator species to identify exposure risk to contamination sources, informing the development of fish passage facilities to enable fish to access fragmented upstream habitats, and assessing fish use of created or restored habitats. With growing capacity for fish biotelemetry research in the Great Lakes, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of incorporating biotelemetry into AOC RAP processes to improve the science and practice of restoration and to facilitate the delisting of AOCs.

J	Wang, JL; Baskaran, M; Niedermiller, J				Wang, Jinlong; Baskaran, Mark; Niedermiller, John			Mobility of 137Cs in freshwater lakes: A mass balance and diffusion study of Lake St. Clair, Southeast Michigan, USA	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Cesium-137 is one of the most widely utilized anthropogenic radionuclides, both as a tracer and chronometer in the environment. Its application as an effective chronometer requires a thorough understanding of its geochemical behavior in aqueous systems. In this study, we collected and analyzed a suite of time-series water samples over a period of 8 months (April November 2015), for particulate and dissolved Cs-137 activities from a watershed in southeast Michigan, USA, using Cu2Fe (CN)(6)-coated cartridges developed to pre-concentrate dissolved Cs-137. We also conducted a series of laboratory experiments with the natural freshwater sediment samples and water with different chemical composition. There were seasonal variations of both particulate and dissolved Cs-137 activities in the watersheds of Lake St. Clair. The distribution coefficients of Cs-137 determined over a period of 8 months varied between 0.14 x 10(5) and 6.1 x 10(5) mL g(-1) (mean: 2.9 x 10(5) mL g(-1)). The annual input and export flux of total Cs-137 activity via rivers into and out of Lake St. Clair were calculated to be 3.6 x 10(10) Bq and 1.6 x 10(10) Bq, respectively. The amount of 137Cs derived by diffusion from interstitial pore water to the water column was estimated to be 0.30 x 10(10) Bq (8.3% of the total input flux) which is similar to the percentage of Cs-137 desorption (13%-20%) from sediment placed in oxic soft water system over a period of 30-106 days. For the same concentrations of NH4+, Mn2+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+ and Sr2+ in a distilled water, our lab work showed that the sediment-sorbed Cs-137 is displaced by ions in the order NH4+ > Mn2+ > K+ > Mg2+ approximate to Ca2+ > Na+ > Sr2+. In laboratory studies, Cs-137 sorbed onto sediment was found to be less mobile in oxic soft water (K-d: 2.0 x 10(3) mL g(-1)) and more mobile in anoxic soft water (K-d: 0.2 x 10(3) mL g(-1)). In a hard water system, however, there is no significant difference in K-d values for both oxic and anoxic conditions. The sequence of K-d values is: oxic soft water > oxic hard water > anoxic hard water > anoxic soft water. The desorption experiments with Cs-137-sorbed sediments also confirmed that Cs-137 is much more mobile in soft water than hard water. This mobility of Cs-137 under oxic hard water system makes sedimentation rate estimation by Cs-137 (based on the time the introduction of Cs-137) problematic in some soft water lakes, and estuarine and coastal waters.

Our objective was to determine the phenological dynamics of the above- and belowground parts of Eriophorum vaginatum in the Arctic and its response to warming. We established a common garden located at Toolik Lake Field Station; tussocks of E. vaginatum from three locations, Coldfoot, Toolik Lake and Sagwon, were transplanted into the common garden. Control and warming treatments for E. vaginatum were set up at the Toolik Lake during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. Digital cameras, a handheld sensor and minirhizotrons were used to simultaneously observe leaf greenness, normalized difference vegetation index and root length dynamics, respectively. Leaf and root growth rates of E. vaginatum were asynchronous such that the timing of maximal leaf growth (mid-July) was about 28 days earlier than that of root growth. Warming of air temperature by 1 degrees C delayed the timing of leaf senescence and thus prolonged the growing season, but the temperature increase had no significant effect on root phenology. The seasonal dynamics of leaf biomass were affected by air temperature, whereas root biomass was correlated with soil thaw depth. Therefore, we suggest that leaf and root components should be considered comprehensively when using carbon and nutrient cycle models, as above- and belowground productivity and functional traits may have a different response to climate warming.

The present study seeks to determine the degree to which landscape variables of Amazonian floodplain lakes influences fish assemblages in these environments. Fish species richness was estimated in 15 Amazonian floodplain lakes during the high and low-water phases and correlated with the areas of four inundated wetland classes: (i) open water, (ii) flooded herbaceous, (iii) flooded shrubs and (iv) flooded forest estimated in different radius circular areas around each sampling site. Data were analyzed using generalized linear models with fish species richness, total and guilds as the dependent variable and estimates of buffered landscape areas as explanatory variables. Our analysis identified the significance of landscape variables in determining the diversity of fish assemblages in Amazonian floodplain lakes. Spatial scale was also identified as a significant determinant of fish diversity as landscape effects were more evident at larger spatial scales. In particular, (1) total species richness was more sensitive to variations in the landscape areas than number of species within guilds and (2) the spatial extent of the wetland class of shrubs was consistently the more influential on fish species diversity.

Movement patterns and spatial segregation of two populations of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Movement ecology is an important component of life history and population dynamics, and consequently its understanding can inform successful fishery management decision-making. While lake trout populations in Lake Huron have shown signs of recovery from near extinction in recent years, knowledge of their movement behavior remains incomplete. We used acoustic telemetry to describe and compare movement patterns of two Lake Huron lake trout populations: Drummond Island and Thunder Bay. Both populations showed high spawning site fidelity, with no evidence of co-mingling during non-spawning season. Detections between spawning periods were mainly limited to receivers within 100 km of spawning locations, and suggested that the two populations likely remained segregated throughout the year. Drummond Island fish, which spawn inside the Drummond Island Refuge, primarily dispersed east into Canadian waters of Lake Huron, with 79-92% of fish being detected annually on receivers outside the refuge. In contrast, Thunder Bay fish tended to disperse south towards Saginaw Bay. Large proportions (i.e., > 80%) of both populations were available to fisheries outside the management zone containing their spawning location. Thunder Bay fish moved relatively quickly to overwinter habitat after spawning, and tended to repeat the same post-spawning movement behavior each year. The consistent, predictable movement of both populations across management zones highlights the importance of understanding population dynamics to effective management of Lake Huron lake trout.

Five-year evaluation of habitat remediation in Thunder Bay, Lake Huron: Comparison of constructed reef characteristics that attract spawning lake trout	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Degradation of aquatic habitats has motivated construction and research on the use of artificial reefs to enhance production of fish populations. However, reefs are often poorly planned, reef design characteristics are not evaluated, and reef assessments are short-term. We constructed 29 reefs in Thunder Bay, Lake Huron, in 2010 and 2011 to mitigate for degradation of a putative lake trout spawning reef. Reefs were designed to evaluate lake trout preferences for height, orientation, and size, and were compared with two degraded natural reefs and a high-quality natural reef (East Reef). Eggs and fry were sampled on each reef for five years post-construction, and movements of 40 tagged lake trout were tracked during three spawning seasons using acoustic telemetry. Numbers of adults and spawning on the constructed reefs were initially low, but increased significantly over the five years, while remaining consistent on East Reef. Adult density, egg deposition, and fry catch were not related to reef height or orientation of the constructed reefs, but were related to reef size and adjacency to East Reef. Adult lake trout visited and spawned on all except the smallest constructed reefs. Of the metrics used to evaluate the reefs, acoustic telemetry produced the most valuable and consistent data, including fine-scale examination of lake trout movements relative to individual reefs. Telemetry data, supplemented with diver observations, identified several previously unknown natural spawning sites, including the high-use portions of-East Reef. Reef construction has increased the capacity for fry production in Thunder Bay without apparently decreasing the use of the natural reef. Results of this project emphasize the importance of multi-year reef assessment, use of multiple assessment methods, and comparison of reef characteristics when developing artificial reef projects. Specific guidelines for construction of reefs focused on enhancing lake trout spawning are suggested. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Testing Hypotheses along an Elevational Gradient	PLOS ONE												The mosquito-borne disease avian malaria (Plasmodium spp.) has impacted both captive populations and wild individuals of native New Zealand bird species. However, whether or not it is a cause of concern to their wild populations is still unclear. In Hawaii, the disease has been a major factor in the population declines of some native forest bird species, often limiting their elevational distribution due to an inverse relationship between force of infection and elevation. While studies have investigated latitudinal patterns of infection in New Zealand, elevational patterns are unexplored. To address this, a survey was conducted in Nelson Lakes National Park, a site experiencing native bird declines in which disease has been suggested as playing a role, to investigate whether there is a similar inverse relationship in New Zealand. Results from blood samples (n = 436) collected over three seasons across a broad elevational range (650-1400 m) support there being such a relationship. In addition, an overall higher prevalence in non-native (14.1%) versus native birds (1.7%) may indicate differential impacts on these two groups, while particularly high prevalence in non-native Turdus spp. supports previous suggestions that they are key reservoir hosts for the disease. Overall, these findings add weight to the hypothesis that avian malaria is playing a role in ongoing declines of native New Zealand birds.					; Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008	Niebuhr, Chris/0000-0002-8892-3605; 													1932-6203					NOV 1	2016	11	11							e0165918	10.1371/journal.pone.0165918	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165918								27802326					WOS:000386714200068

Lake food webs can be supported by primary production from within the lake, organic matter imported from the catchment or some mixture of these two sources. Generalisations about food-web subsidies to lake ecosystems are often based on data from only a few ecosystems and therefore do not consider the potential variability of subsidies among diverse ecosystems in a landscape. 2. We measured the variation among lake ecosystems in terrestrial (allochthonous) utilisation by pelagic consumers and developed models to describe the variability. Stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and carbon were measured for Chaoborus spp. and crustacean zooplankton taxa in 40 lakes to quantify consumer allochthonous resource use (allochthony). 3. The median fraction of consumer allochthony estimated using a two-source Bayesian mixing model varied between 4 and 82% (mean among all lakes=36%) for Chaoborus sp. among lakes and between 1 and 76% in a more limited sample of crustacean zooplankton consumers. The degree of allochthonous resource use increased linearly with the availability of allochthonous resources. 4. Terrestrial support of Chaoborus was correlated (using best fitting relationships) with covariates for lake organic matter sources including dissolved inorganic carbon, total phosphorus, chlorophyll , colour and catchment area. However, the most parsimonious model was an inverse relationship between lake surface area and consumer allochthony, indicating that allochthonous subsidies are more important in smaller than larger systems. Given the preponderance of small waterbodies, allochthonous subsidies are important in a large number of lake ecosystems.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Background, Aim and Scope. There are two species of fresh water cetaceans surviving in the Yangtze River system in China: Baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) and Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis). As a result of the expansion of human activities on the river, their distribution ranges appear to be decreasing and in the case of the Baiji, are even being restricted to several sections. The Baiji is the world's most critically endangered cetacean species with a population estimated at only a few tens of individuals. The Yangtze finless porpoise is the world's only freshwater-adapted population of the species, and it has been estimated that only around 1,000 individuals remain in the river system. In order to prevent the extinction of Baiji and a sharp decline in the abundance of the porpoise, in situ conservation (i.e. in the river) and two ex situ conservation (i.e. in semi-natural reserves and in captivity) strategies were proposed and have been implemented since the early 1990s. In view of both the severely endangered status of the animals and the severely degraded conditions of their habitats, the feasibility and actual status of these two strategies are raised for discussion. Main Features. The threats faced by the cetaceans are mainly from the unfettered exploitation of the river's resources. In the past 20 years, five nature reserves have been established along the river. Imposing maximum prohibition of harmful and illegal fishing methods in the reserves might prolong the process of extinction of these cetaceans in the wild, but so far, the administrative measures taken in the reserves have not yet kept the abundance from sharply declining. As human use of the river and its resources is expected to intensify for many decades into the future, the ability of the river to continue to support these species is certainly undecided. Therefore, rescuing animals from the river and establishing viable breeding populations in semi-natural reserves, in which the environment is similar to the main stream of the river, and in captivity, has to be considered urgently as the short-term goal of ex situ strategies. Since the abundance of porpoises is higher than that of the Baiji, we have first established breeding populations of them in the semi-natural reserves and in captivity. But, considering the extremely low density of Baiji in the river, an immediate range-wide Yangtze Baiji survey is an urgent need for locating and capturing sufficient Baiji for successfully establishing a breeding population of them in semi-natural reserves. Results. Two semi-natural reserves (in Shishou, Hubei Province, and Tongling, Anhui Province) have been set up along the river in order to establish breeding populations of the Baiji and the porpoises. So far, several small groups of porpoises that were caught in the main stream of the river have successively been introduced into the semi-natural reserves. Under careful management, these animals in both of the semi-natural reserves not only survive, but can also reproduce naturally and successfully. At least one or three calves were born in each reserve each year. Additionally, a breeding group of porpoises is being established at the Baiji Dolphinarium at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan. There are presently four adults and one calf living in the Dolphinarium. The calf, born in July, 2005, is the first captive bred Yangtze Finless Porpoise in the world. In preparation for the range-wide Yangtze cetacean survey, a 9-day pilot expedition on the river near Wuhan was conducted in March, 2006, in order to develop methods for locating the Baiji. No Baiji were expected to be seen in such a short period but about 40 porpoise sightings were observed. Results of the pilot survey indicated that traditional visual and acoustical survey methods for cetaceans should be adapted to find the elusive Baiji in the river. Currently, the range-wide Yangtze cetacean survey is in preparation. The survey will cover over 1,700 km of the Yangtze River from Yichang to Shanghai, and is expected to provide detailed information on Baiji and porpoise numbers and distribution patterns in the river. Discussion. Although the short-term goal of ex situ conservation is to rescue cetaceans from the river and to establish viable breeding populations in semi-natural reserves and in captivity, the long-term goal of releasing the animals back into the river when the threats have decreased and the natural environment has been improved, should not be neglected. Moreover, the in situ conservation efforts in the natural reserves, and even in the entire Yangtze River system, including the lakes, should not be ignored or abandoned at any time. The activities contributing to the conservation of the Baiji and the porpoise in the wild have the incidental effect of benefiting the entire Yangtze ecosystem and other rare threatened species. The dynamics of the groups of porpoises in semi-natural reserves should be monitored continually, in order to guide the establishment of breeding groups of Baiji in these semi-natural reserves in the near future. Conclusions. Under the existing severely degraded conditions of the Yangtze system, the sharply fall populations of Baiji and porpoises will not be suspended in the foreseeable future. Therefore, ex situ conservation should be emphasized, and the severely threatened Baiji in the river should be removed and translocated to semi-natural reserves for establishing viable breeding populations. The successful program of capturing, translocating and maintaining finless porpoises in the Shishou semi-natural reserve has demonstrated its adequacy as an ex situ environment for cetaceans. Following the successful pilot survey in the river, the immediate range-wide Yangtze cetacean survey is proposed and is in preparation. The range-wide survey is expected to ensure that any remaining Baiji can be found reliably and captured successfully after the survey. Recommendations and Perspectives. During the range-wide survey, not only the Baiji but also the porpoise as well as their habitats should be investigated based on visual and acoustical methods that adapted to the river and the animals. Meanwhile, the current risk levels to the Baiji and porpoises should be evaluated at each area where Baiji or porpoises can be reliably sighted. Any capture efforts should be targeted on the most threatened areas, or where there is maximum risk of injury or death. The immediate track of the Baiji should be carried out once a Baiji is sighted during the range-wide survey in order to obtain the movement route of the animals, which is crucial information for the successful capture operation. Additionally, the need to establish new semi-natural reserves for the porpoises should be placed on the agenda of local and central governments in the near future.

Toward Long-Term Aquatic Science Products from Heritage Landsat Missions	REMOTE SENSING												This paper aims at generating a long-term consistent record of Landsat-derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) products, which are central for producing downstream aquatic science products (e.g., concentrations of total suspended solids). The products are derived from Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 observations leading to Landsat-8 era to enable retrospective analyses of inland and nearshore coastal waters. In doing so, the data processing was built into the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) followed by vicariously calibrating Landsat-7 and -5 data using reference in situ measurements and near-concurrent ocean color products, respectively. The derived R rs products are then validated using (a) matchups using the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data measured by in situ radiometers, i.e., AERONET-OC, and (b) ocean color products at select sites in North America. Following the vicarious calibration adjustments, it is found that the overall biases in R-rs products are significantly reduced. The root-mean-square errors (RMSE), however, indicate noticeable uncertainties due to random and systematic noise. Long-term (since 1984) seasonal R-rs composites over 12 coastal and inland systems are further evaluated to explore the utility of Landsat archive processed via SeaDAS. With all the qualitative and quantitative assessments, it is concluded that with careful algorithm developments, it is possible to discern natural variability in historic water quality conditions using heritage Landsat missions. This requires the changes in R-rs exceed maximum expected uncertainties, i.e., 0.0015 [1/sr], estimated from mean RMSEs associated with the matchups and intercomparison analyses. It is also anticipated that Landsat-5 products will be less susceptible to uncertainties in turbid waters with R-rs(660) > 0.004 [1/sr], which is equivalent of similar to 1.2% reflectance. Overall, end-users may utilize heritage R-rs products with "fitness-for-purpose" concept in mind, i.e., products could be valuable for one application but may not be viable for another. Further research should be dedicated to enhancing atmospheric correction to account for non-negligible near-infrared reflectance in CDOM-rich and extremely turbid waters.					; Sarkar, Sudipta/I-5545-2019; Franz, Bryan/D-6284-2012; Pahlevan, Nima/L-7746-2014	Sarkar, Sudipta/0000-0003-0551-6543; Balasubramanian, Sundarabalan/0000-0002-6952-1475; Pahlevan, Nima/0000-0002-5454-5212														2072-4292				SEP	2018	10	9							1337	10.3390/rs10091337	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10091337													WOS:000449993800017

Invasion risk posed by macroinvertebrates transported in ships' ballast tanks	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasions by non-indigenous macroinvertebrates often cause ecological and economic problems, and commercial ships have been implicated as a principal mechanism for their dispersal. We explored the presence and species diversity of adult macroinvertebrates transported by transoceanic and coastal vessels arriving to ports on the Atlantic coast of Canada. We sampled 67 ballast tanks from 62 ships operating along discrete geographic pathways and tested whether mid-ocean exchange or voyage length affects the probability for translocation of macroinvertebrates. Additionally, we assessed the relationship between macroinvertebrate presence and the amount of sediment in ballast tanks. We document the presence of highly invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas), mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii), common periwinkle (Littorina littorea), soft shell clam (Mya arenaria) and blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in ballast tanks of surveyed ships. Mid-ocean exchange did not affect macroinvertebrate occurrence, suggesting that current ballast water management regulations are ineffective for this taxonomic group. Viable individuals were recorded in vessels undertaking shorter voyages (average and maximum of 4.5 and 15 days, respectively) and presence was not related to the amount of sediment in tanks. While presence and densities of macroinvertebrates were low, invasion risk may nonetheless be significant during reproductive seasons owing to high fecundity of some taxa. The highest risk may be posed by decapods since gravid females may carry thousands to several million eggs per clutch, and after several weeks of brooding, two or more subsequent clutches may be fertilized by retained sperm from an earlier mating.					; macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020; Bailey, Sarah/E-8356-2010	Briski, Elizabeta/0000-0003-1896-3860; Bailey, Sarah/0000-0003-3635-919X													1387-3547	1573-1464				SEP	2012	14	9					1843	1850		10.1007/s10530-012-0194-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-012-0194-0													WOS:000307400500008

Yet, how increased nitrogen has affected denitrification, a key process for nitrogen removal, is poorly understood. We measured actual and potential (nitrate and carbon amended) denitrification rates in sediments of several lake types and habitats in the Pyrenees during the ice-free season. Actual denitrification rates ranged from 0 to 9 mu mol N2O m(-2) h(-1) (mean, 1.5 +/- 1.6 SD), whereas potential rates were about 10times higher. The highest actual rates occurred in warmer sediments with more nitrate available in the overlying water. Consequently, littoral habitats showed, on average, 3-fold higher rates than the deep zone. The highest denitrification potentials were found in more productive lakes located at relatively low altitude and small catchments, with warmer sediments, high relative abundance of denitrification nitrite reductase genes, and sulphate-rich waters. We conclude that increased nitrogen deposition has resulted in elevated denitrification rates, but not sufficiently to compensate for the atmospheric nitrogen loading in most of the highly oligotrophic lakes. However, there is potential for high rates, especially in the more productive lakes and landscape features largely govern this.					; Camarero, Lluís/J-9239-2012; Hallin, Sara/H-4648-2012; Palacin-Lizarbe, Carlos/JTS-5131-2023; Jones, Christopher/G-7687-2011; Catalan, Jordi/A-5420-2008; Camarero, Lluis/J-9239-2012	Jones, Christopher/0000-0002-2723-6019; Hallin, Sara/0000-0002-9069-9024; PALACIN-LIZARBE, Carlos/0000-0002-1572-6053; Catalan, Jordi/0000-0002-2934-4013; Camarero, Lluis/0000-0003-4271-8988													2045-2322					FEB 20	2020	10	1							3003	10.1038/s41598-020-59759-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59759-w								32080240					WOS:000534372400001

Some anticipated impacts may be similar across different aquatic ecosystems, while others may be system-specific. Here, we review the potential effects of climatic changes for different freshwater habitats within the state of Indiana, USA, a Midwestern state with diverse land and water features. Given this heterogeneity and that the state is among the southernmost states of the US Midwest, evaluation of freshwater habitats of Indiana provides a useful perspective on potential impacts of climate change. In our study, we first review expected or anticipated changes to physico-chemical and habitat conditions in wetlands, lotic systems, small glacial lakes and Lake Michigan. We then highlight anticipated responses of select aquatic biota to these changes. We describe how climatic changes may interact with other anthropogenic stressors affecting freshwater habitats and consider the potential for evolutionary adaptation of freshwater aquatic organisms to mediate any responses. Given anticipated changes, we suggest aquatic ecosystem managers take a precautionary approach broadly applicable in temperate regions to (a) conserve a diversity of aquatic habitats, (b) enhance species diversity and both inter- and intra-population genetic variation, and (c) limit stressors which may exacerbate the risk of decline for aquatic biota.

Assessing the efficacy of Landsat-8 OLI imagery derived models for remotely estimating chlorophyll-a concentration in the Upper Ganga River, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) serves as an indicator of productivity in surface water. Estimating chl-a concentration is pivotal for monitoring and subsequent conservation of surface water quality. Artificial neural network (ANN) based models were validated and tested for their efficacy against various regression models to determine the chl-a concentration in the Upper Ganga river. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance (SR) imagery for May and October along with in-situ data over a period of 2 years (2016-2017) was used to develop and validated models. Regression model performance was acceptable with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.57, 0.63, 0.66 and 0.68 for linear, exponential, logarithmic and power model, respectively. However, there was a significant improvement in the efficacy of chl-a determination using ANN model performance having a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.52 mu g l(-1) and R-2 = 0.97 in comparison to the best-performing regression model (power) with RMSE = 9.86 mu g l(-1) and R-2 = 0.68. ANN exhibited comparatively more precise spatial and seasonal variability with mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.26 mu g l(-1) as compared to the best regression model (power) MAE = 7.98 mu g l(-1) suggesting the applicability of ANN for large-scale spatial and temporal monitoring river stretches using Landsat-8 OLI SR images.					; prasad, satish/IQS-1547-2023	PRASAD, SATISH/0000-0003-0246-3300; Saluja, Ridhi/0000-0003-0696-2297; GARG, J K/0000-0002-9222-177X; 													0143-1161	1366-5901				APR 2	2020	41	7					2439	2456		10.1080/01431161.2019.1688888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.1688888		NOV 2019											WOS:000494898000001

During the 2010 rainy season, samples of water, sediment, fish, zooplankton, and mollusks were collected from three water reservoirs and analysed for total Hg (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), and total Se (TSe). Ratios of delta C-13 and delta N-15 were measured to determine food web structures and patterns of contaminant accumulation and transfer to fish. Food chain lengths (FCLs) were calculated using mean delta N-15 of all primary consumer taxa collected as the site-specific baseline. We report relatively low concentrations of THg and TSe in most fish. We also found in all studied reservoirs short food chain lengths, ranging from 3.3 to 3.7, with most fish relying on a mixture of pelagic and littoral sources for their diet. Mercury was biomagnified in fish food webs with an enrichment factor ranging from 2.9 to 6.5 for THg and from 2.9 to 6.6 for MeHg. However, there was no evidence of selenium biomagnification in these food webs. An inverse relationship was observed between adjusted delta N-15 and log-transformed Se: Hg ratios, indicating that Se has a lesser protective effect in top predators, which are also the most contaminated animals with respect to MeHg. Trophic position, carbon source, and fish total length were the factors best explaining Hg concentration in fish. In a broader comparison of our study sites with literature data for other African lakes, the THg biomagnification rate was positively correlated with FCL. We conclude that these reservoir systems from tropical Western Africa have low Hg biomagnification associated with short food chains. This finding may partly explain low concentrations of Hg commonly reported in fish from this area.					; Chételat, John/AAE-4711-2020; Amyot, Marc/A-7182-2008	Chetelat, John/0000-0002-9380-7203; Amyot, Marc/0000-0002-0340-3249													1932-6203					APR 13	2015	10	4							e0123048	10.1371/journal.pone.0123048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0123048								25875292					WOS:000352845100129

In the East-Central Europe, it is widely occurring in western part of Poland but only in single locations in the East due to some limiting factors. Therefore, broad-scale phytoplankton survey including 117 randomly selected lakes in Poland and Lithuania was conducted. The results showed that C. raciborskii occurred widely in western part of Poland but was absent from other regions and Lithuania except one lake. The regions in which C. raciborskii was present had higher annual mean air temperature, higher maximum air temperature of the warmest month and higher minimum temperature of the coldest month, demonstrating that average air temperature, and indirectly, the duration of growing season might be more important factor driving C. raciborskii distribution than measured in situ water temperature. In turn, the presence of C. raciborskii in single localities may be more related to physiological adaptations of separated ecotype. Collectively, these results provide novel evidence on the influence of temperature on C. raciborskii distribution in East-European regions but also indicate high ecological plasticity of this species.					; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/J-2427-2018; Soininen, Janne/A-4205-2008; Koreiviene, Judita/GNM-7260-2022; Woszczyk, Michał/AAK-2933-2021	Jasser, Iwona/0000-0003-0401-1463; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/0000-0001-7358-0673; Woszczyk, Michal/0000-0003-0695-4625; Soininen, Janne/0000-0002-8583-3137; Gagala-Borowska, Ilona/0000-0003-0123-7440; Kobos, Justyna/0000-0002-9360-2187; Koreiviene, Judita/0000-0002-8156-7548; Szczurowska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-3085-0156													0168-6496	1574-6941				APR	2017	93	4							fix035	10.1093/femsec/fix035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fix035								28334256					WOS:000405586200016

However, macrophyte overgrowth in shallow lakes may lead to deterioration and a consequent necessity for restoration treatments. We assumed that a major threat to the increased trophic level in the Jankovac flow-through system arises from the sediment, where the accumulation of deciduous leaf litter and decayed macrophyte fragments could generate anoxic conditions. The integrated Water Quality Model (WQM) and the Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Model (SAVM) were combined in the Jankovac Model (JanM) and applied during the vegetated season in 2008 and 2014, with the aim to offer a possible approach to the maintenance of good water quality. The impacts of flow velocity and epiphyton growth on submerged macrophyte coverage and biomass were simulated. Biocenotic analyses suggested that epiphyton growth was more extensive in 2014 in comparison to 2008. The results of JanM indicated that increased flow velocities enhanced macrophyte growth and dissolved oxygen concentrations concurrently with the decline of epiphyton biomass. Furthermore, results suggested that epiphyton growth rate of 0.4 d(-1) maintained macrophyte coverage and biomass at a satisfactory level of 70% reservoir coverage. Considering the proposed scenarios hydraulic treatment could be applied to regulate submerged macrophytes in shallow reservoirs, as an efficient and less invasive approach than sediment removal, especially in sensitive karst areas.

However, intra-annual DOC variability is often orders of magnitude larger than long-term trends. Unraveling the controls on intra-annual DOC dynamics holds the key to a better understanding of long-term changes and their ecological significance. We quantified and characterized intra-annual DOC variability and compared it with long-term DOC trends in 136 streams and rivers, varying in size and geographical characteristics, across a 1400km latitudinal gradient during 2000-2010. Discharge, temperature, and month of the year were the most significant predictors of intra-annual DOC variability in a majority of the running waters. Relationships between DOC, discharge, and temperature were, however, different along a mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient. Running waters with low MAT generally displayed positive DOC-discharge correlations whereas the relationships in sites with higher MAT were more variable. This reflected contrasting relationships between temperature and discharge with discharge positively correlated with temperature in cold areas, while it was negatively correlated with temperature in catchments with higher MAT. Sites where flow, temperature, and month were poorly related to intra-annual DOC dynamics were large catchments or sites with extensive upstream lake cover. DOC trends were generally much smaller than intra-annual DOC variability and did not show any north-south gradient. Our findings suggest that DOC in running waters could respond to a changing climate in ways not predictable, or even discernible, from extrapolation of recent interannual trends.

C.			Determining seasonal displacements of Earth's crust in South America using observations from space-borne geodetic sensors and surface-loading models	EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE												There are small pieces of evidence, suggesting that South America's hydrological cycle is changing, which impacts its water availability and, consequently, the Earth's surface due to its elastic response to the surface mass loading/unloading. Therefore, we analyzed 3 to 15years of vertical crustal displacements (VCDs) due to mass loadings using 292 Global Positioning System (GPS) stations in South America, which are essential for studies related to tectonic phenomena, for example. Thus, we investigated whether the intra-annual variabilities of the displacements could be reduced using modeled VCDs and inverted displacements from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) harmonic solutions (Release 06). The modeled VCDs come from the combination of nontidal atmospheric and ocean loadings with the hydrological loadings from the land-surface model (GLDAS) and reanalysis (MERRA). We found that the highest amplitudes of VCDs of the annual signals are concentrated mainly over the Amazon Rainforest and Brazilian Highlands. However, the results also show different behavior throughout other physiographic provinces of South America, which shows low water capabilities as sensed by GRACE and described by the GLDAS and MERRA models. Accordingly, when we disregard the stations over the Andes Mountains and Patagonia in the analysis, the highest reduction in the variability of GPS-observed VCDs is achieved while using GRACE (79% of the sites), MERRA (75% of the sites), and GLDAS (74% of the sites). For these stations, the amplitudes (and phases) of the annual signals depicted by the geodetic sensors generally agree, while those from GLDAS and MERRA explain only approximately 50% of the deformation. However, in the southwest region of South America (between the latitude bands of -40 degrees to -30 degrees), GPS annual signals, which reached up to 11mm, are much larger than those from GRACE and the models due to the existence of lakes that are not resolved in global analysis. These inconsistencies between GPS-observed VCDs and those derived from GRACE and the other models require further investigation, specifically for Chile.

Long-term trends in air freezing and thawing indices can therefore enhance our understanding of climate change. This study focuses on changes of the spatiotemporal patterns in air freezing and thawing indices over Mongolia from 1960 to 2020, using observations at 30 meteorological stations. Our results shows that the freezing index ranges from -945.5 to -4,793.6 degrees C day, while the thawing index ranges from 1,164.4 to 4,021.3 degrees C day over Mongolia, and their spatial patterns clearly link to the latitude and altitude. During the study period, the trend in the thawing index (14.4 degrees C-day per year) was larger than the trend in the freezing index (up to -10.1 degrees C-day per year), which results in the net increase of air temperature by 2.4 degrees C across Mongolia. Overall, the increase in the thawing index was larger in the low latitudes and altitudes (e.g., the Gobi-desert, steppes, the Great lake depression and major river valleys) than in high latitudes and altitudes (mountain regions), while it was the opposite for the freezing index. The highest values for both thawing index and freezing index (i.e. the least negative values) have occurred during the last 2 decades. As the trends in the freezing and thawing indices and mean annual air temperature confirm intensive climate warming, increased permafrost degradation and shallower seasonally frozen ground are expected throughout Mongolia.

While theory predicts that mixotrophy increases trophic transfer efficiency in aquatic food webs, deleterious effects of some mixotrophs on consumers have also been reported. Here, using a widespread mixotrophic algal genus Dinobryon, we aimed to quantify how colonial taxa contribute to secondary production in lakes. We, therefore, studied the dietary effects of Dinobryon divergens on Cladocera (Daphnia longispina) and Copepoda (Eudiaptomus gracilis), representing two main taxonomic and functional groups of zooplankton. In feeding experiments, we showed that Dinobryon was largely grazing resistant and even inhibited the uptake of the high-quality reference food in Daphnia. Eudiaptomus could to some extent compensate with selective feeding, but a negative long-term food quality effect was also evident. Besides, Eudiaptomus was more sensitive to the pure diet of Dinobryon than Daphnia. Low lipid content and high C:P elemental ratio further supported the low nutritional value of the mixotroph. In a stable isotope approach analysing a natural plankton community, we found further evidence that carbon of Dinobryon was not conveyed efficiently to zooplankton. Our results show that the increasing dominance of colonial mixotrophs can result in reduced dietary energy transfer to consumers at higher trophic levels. In a wider perspective, global climate change favours the dominance of some detrimental mixotrophic algae which may constrain pelagic trophic transfer efficiency in oligotrophic systems, similarly to cyanobacteria in eutrophic lakes.

Due to geomorphic alteration of river channels and land-cover change, degradation to floodplain lakes in the Ohio River basin is occurring at a rate that will escalate as climate change causes increased flood intensity and the seasonal redistribution of rainfall. A better understanding of the local drivers that affect oxbow lakes is needed for targeted floodplain restoration efforts designed to slow degradation. We examined the effects of land cover, topography, and hydrologic connectivity on water quality and fish diversity and abundance in nine floodplain lakes with potentially high remnant ecological function in the Wabash-White watershed (Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois). Data collection included water-quality parameters; stable water isotopes; total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll-a; and fish community diversity and abundance. Results indicate that hay/pasture land cover and decreased topographic relief in the local oxbow watersheds, along with reduced river hydrologic connectivity, were related to an increase in total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll-a. Greater biodiversity and abundance in fish assemblages were evident in oxbow lakes that were more disconnected from the main channel. The results of this study suggest that hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes with the contributing drainage area and the main channel influence nutrients and fish communities. Knowing the influencing factors can help ecosystem managers better protect these valuable floodplain lake ecosystems and prioritize restoration efforts amidst increasing stressors due to climate and land-use changes.					; Mazur, Martha Carlson/JDM-8467-2023; Pyron, Mark/D-4572-2011	McMillan, Sara/0000-0001-7197-7079; Hauswald, Cassandra/0000-0002-9265-0603; Pyron, Mark/0000-0003-0451-7827													1535-1459	1535-1467				JAN	2022	38	1					160	172		10.1002/rra.3888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3888		NOV 2021											WOS:000716662600001

Land-Lake Linkage and Remote Sensing Application in Water Quality Monitoring in Lake Okeechobee, Florida, USA	LAND												The state of water quality of lakes is highly related to watershed processes which will be responsible for the delivery of sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants to receiving water bodies. The spatiotemporal variability of water quality parameters along with the seasonal changes were studied for Lake Okeechobee, South Florida. The dynamics of selected four water quality parameters: total phosphate (TP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total suspended solid (TSS), and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) were analyzed using data from satellites and water quality monitoring stations. Statistical approaches were used to establish correlation between reflectance and observed water quality records. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data (2000 and 2007) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) in 2015 in dry and wet seasons were used in the analysis of water quality variability in Lake Okeechobee. Water quality parameters were collected from twenty-six (26) monitoring stations for model development and validation. In the regression model developed, individual bands, band ratios and various combination of bands were used to establish correlation, and hence generate the models. A stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) approach was employed and the results showed that for the dry season, higher coefficient of determination (R-2) were found (R-2 = 0.84 for chl-a and R-2 = 0.67 for TSS) between observed water quality data and the reflectance data from the remotely-sensed data. For the wet season, the R-2 values were moderate (R-2 = 0.48 for chl-a and R-2 = 0.60 for TSS). It was also found that strong correlation was found for TP and TKN with chl-a, TSS, and selected band ratios. Total phosphate and TKN were estimated using best-fit multiple linear regression models as a function of reflectance data from Landsat TM and OLI, and ground data. This analysis showed a high coefficient of determination in dry season (R-2 = 0.92 for TP and R-2 = 0.94 for TKN) and in wet season (R-2 = 0.89 for TP and R-2 = 0.93 for TKN). Based on the findings, the Multiple linear regression (MLR) model can be a useful tool for monitoring large lakes like Lake Okeechobee and also predict the spatiotemporal variability of both optically active (Chl-a and TSS) and inactive water (nutrients) quality parameters.					; Melesse, Assefa/F-9931-2013	Haji Gholizadeh, Mohammad/0000-0001-9685-5086; Melesse, Assefa/0000-0003-4724-9367; Moncada, Angelica/0000-0002-6473-6768														2073-445X				FEB	2021	10	2							147	10.3390/land10020147	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10020147													WOS:000622697100001
J	Wei, LF; Tadesse, AW; Wang, J				Wei, Liangfu; Tadesse, Ababo Workineh; Wang, Jun			Organohalogenated Contaminants (OHCs) in Surface Sediments and Water of East Dongting Lake and Hong Lake, China	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												East Dongting Lake and Hong Lake are two typical lakes in the middle watershed of the Yangtze River, China. The differences in the hydrological condition and human activities of the region may result in the differences in concentrations, distribution, and sources of contaminants. The levels, sources, distribution, and ecological risk of OHCs, including 15 OCPs, 7 PCBs, and 7 PBDEs in surface sediments and water from this region, were investigated. OCPs and PCBs were the predominant pollutants in water and sediments samples, respectively. Source analysis showed that HCHs, PBDEs, and PCBs were mainly from the historical input of commercial products, but there were recent discharges of DDT into the water. The spatial distribution of OHCs showed that higher levels of OHCs in sediments and water were found in the sampling sites far away from the estuary of Hong Lake, but such obvious distribution characteristic was not found in East Dongting Lake. TOC played a crucial role in the retention of OCPs in the sediments of Hong Lake, but significant correlation between TOC and OCPs for East Dongting Lake, TOC and PCBs or PBDEs for both lakes were not found. The possible adverse biological effects could be caused by OCPs residues in sediments of both lakes, and it was worse for Hong Lake. The noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risk assessment of HCHs and DDTs indicated the water quality of both lakes was safe for bathing and drinking. The potential ecotoxicological risks of PBDEs and PCBs of both lakes were rather low.

Field experiments were conducted on onion and maize crops grown from December 2015 to May 2016 in small irrigation schemes found in the Lake Tana floodplains of Ethiopia. Experimental fields were selected along a topographic transect to account for soil and groundwater variability. Irrigation volumes were measured using V-notches and irrigation depths (400-550 mm) were calculated, and daily groundwater levels were monitored manually from piezometers installed in the fields. The soil profiles were described at each field and physical properties (texture, FC, PWP, BD, and OM) were measured at each horizon which were used to derive model input parameters. Soil hydraulic properties (residual and saturated moisture content, saturated hydraulic conductivity, parameters related to: pore size distribution n, air entry alpha and pore connectivity 1) were derived using KNN pedotransfer functions for tropical soils and fitted using Retention Curve Program for Unsaturated Soils, RETC. The seasonal actual evapotranspiration estimated by Hydrus and water balance models ranged from 320 to 360 mm for onion and from 400 to 470 mm for maize. The seasonal deep percolation estimated from both models was 12-41% of applied irrigation and with this flood irrigation management; the deep percolation is very high. Implementing precise irrigation and water saving practices that minimize deep percolation and unproductive excessive consumptive use are required to achieve the growing food demand with the available water. When less detailed information is available, the water balance model can be an alternative to predict deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration.					; Beyene, Abebech/AAC-9334-2021; Tilahun, Seifu/ABE-2501-2020; Cornelis, Wim/A-7839-2013; Agumassie, Tena/AAL-3707-2021; De Pue, Jan/AAD-9198-2020; Nyssen, Jan/B-8280-2009; Verhoest, Niko/C-9726-2010	De Pue, Jan/0000-0001-9318-6753; Nyssen, Jan/0000-0002-2666-3860; Cornelis, Wim/0000-0002-6605-6723; Alamirew, Tena/0000-0001-7491-4401; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				APR 1	2018	202						42	56		10.1016/j.agwat.2018.01.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.01.022													WOS:000428833300005

Debris-covered glacier energy balance model for Imja-Lhotse Shar Glacier in the Everest region of Nepal	CRYOSPHERE												Debris thickness plays an important role in regulating ablation rates on debris-covered glaciers as well as controlling the likely size and location of supraglacial lakes. Despite its importance, lack of knowledge about debris properties and associated energy fluxes prevents the robust inclusion of the effects of a debris layer into most glacier surface energy balance models. This study combines fieldwork with a debris-covered glacier energy balance model to estimate debris temperatures and ablation rates on Imja-Lhotse Shar Glacier located in the Everest region of Nepal. The debris properties that significantly influence the energy balance model are the thermal conductivity, albedo, and surface roughness. Fieldwork was conducted to measure thermal conductivity and a method was developed using Structure from Motion to estimate surface roughness. Debris temperatures measured during the 2014 melt season were used to calibrate and validate a debris-covered glacier energy balance model by optimizing the albedo, thermal conductivity, and surface roughness at 10 debris-covered sites. Furthermore, three methods for estimating the latent heat flux were investigated. Model calibration and validation found the three methods had similar performance; however, comparison of modeled and measured ablation rates revealed that assuming the latent heat flux is zero may overestimate ablation. Results also suggest that where debris moisture is unknown, measurements of the relative humidity or precipitation may be used to estimate wet debris periods, i.e., when the latent heat flux is non-zero. The effect of temporal resolution on the model was also assessed and results showed that both 6 h data and daily average data slightly underestimate debris temperatures and ablation rates; thus these should only be used to estimate rough ablation rates when no other data are available.

The investigation of opportunities for the development of cycling tourism first of all relies on the new approach of attraction and product development around the destination, in which it is important to take into consideration the consumer preferences of the most important related group of tourists-active cycling tourists. The sustainable approach of tourism product development also provides an opportunity to decrease the spatial and temporal concentration of tourism, which is largely concentrated on the summertime season. The aim of this study is to explore aspects of the customers' demand for tourism development in terms of cycling tourism with the help of primary data collection, in order to provide adequate directions for sustainable tourism development in the destination. Revealing the demand side of active cycling tourism related to Lake Balaton, the authors used both qualitative (focus group discussions and structured interviews) and quantitative questionnaire survey (computer-assisted data collection) research methods. The latter online surveys were carried out in November and December, 2019, and resulted with an appraisable sample of 809 questionnaires. As for the method, descriptive statistics and relationship analyses were applied. More than five thousand (5050) possible relationships were examined between the closed answers of the questionnaire by Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (tau) and Cramer's V, depending on whether they could be measured on a nominal or ordinal scale. The results show that the content analysis of the primary research provides well determined directions for the sustainable tourism development of cycling tourism at Lake Balaton, so customer involvement seems to be a win-win situation both for the customers (tourists) and the decision makers.

J	Ren, J; Wang, XP; Wang, CF; Gong, P; Yao, TD				Ren, Jiao; Wang, Xiaoping; Wang, Chuanfei; Gong, Ping; Yao, Tandong			Atmospheric processes of organic pollutants over a remote lake on the central Tibetan Plateau: implications for regional cycling	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Atmospheric processes (air-surface exchange, and atmospheric deposition and degradation) are crucial for understanding the global cycling and fate of organic pollutants (OPs). However, such assessments over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) remain uncertain. More than 50% of Chinese lakes are located on the TP, which exerts a remarkable influence on the regional water, energy, and chemical cycling. In this study, air and water samples were simultaneously collected in Nam Co, a large lake on the TP, to test whether the lake is a secondary source or sink of OPs. Lower concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were observed in the atmosphere and lake water of Nam Co, while the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were relatively higher. Results of fugacity ratios and chiral signatures both suggest that the lake acted as the net sink of atmospheric hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), following their long-range transport driven by the Indian monsoon. Different behaviours were observed in the PAHs, which primarily originated from local biomass burning. Acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, and fluorene showed volatilization from the lake to the atmosphere, while other PAHs were deposited into the lake due to the integrated deposition process (wet/dry and air-water gas deposition) and limited atmospheric degradation. As the dominant PAH compound, phenanthrene exhibited a seasonal reversal of air-water gas exchange, which was likely related to the melting of the lake ice in May. The annual input of HCHs from the air to the entire lake area (2015 km(2) ) was estimated as 1.9 kg yr(-1), while input estimated for Sigma(15)PAHs can potentially reach up to 550 kg yr(-1). This study highlights the significance of PAH deposition on the regional carbon cycling in the oligotrophic lakes of the TP.					; Gong, Ping/I-4238-2017; Wang, Xiaoping/F-4707-2013	Wang, Xiaoping/0000-0001-7524-7540; Gong, Ping/0000-0002-8766-260X; 													1680-7316	1680-7324				JAN 31	2017	17	2					1401	1415		10.5194/acp-17-1401-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-1401-2017													WOS:000394610700001

Out of 3309 soil samples examined, 14.9% contained the eggs and the average density was 3.43 eggs/100 g of soil. The level of soil contamination was the highest in cities, lower in villages, and lowest in small towns. In urban areas eggs of T. cati were found more frequently than of T. canis, while in rural areas the opposite was true. Both, in urban and rural areas, the sites most heavily contaminated with Toxocara spp. eggs were household surroundings (backyards). Recreation areas (parks, playgrounds, lake beaches) were significantly less contaminated. In older parts of Poznan, in backyards, soil contamination with the eggs was generally high each month, being lowest in July and highest in December and the prevalence of T. cati eggs was much higher than of T. canis. The prevention policy introduced in the city thus far-paying great attention to dog faeces but not to cats was unsatisfactory. After 18 years of such policy, the number of Toxocara spp. eggs dropped significantly but it was not a linear phenomenon-the intensity of soil contamination fluctuated. To be more effective, preventive measures should be preceded with discrimination of T. canis and T. cati eggs recovered in the soil and for this purpose the new molecular techniques should be applied. A survey conducted in the population in 2010 showed that people's awareness on the significance of pets in the transmission of dangerous zoonoses to humans was unsatisfactory.

Among the natural disturbances in Europe, windstorms cause the highest economic loss. After such storms, damaged forest stands are commonly salvage logged to restore economic value. However, such interventions could affect species assemblages of various taxonomic groups, including breeding birds. Despite these potential effects, investigations of the impacts of post-storm logging are largely lacking. We thus investigated assemblages of breeding birds in 21 logged and 21 unlogged windstorm-disturbed forest plots and 18 undisturbed, control forest plots using fixed-radius point-stop counts three, five and seven years after a windstorm within the Bavarian Forest National Park as part of the European Long-Term Ecosystem Research Network. We recorded 2100 bird individuals of 55 bird species. Bird assemblages were predominantly altered by the consequences of the windstorm and affected only to a minor degree by subsequent logging of storm felled trees. Nevertheless, bird species richness was significantly reduced by post-storm logging within the first season. In general, the windstorm led to a shift in bird assemblage composition from typical forest species towards open- and shrub-land species. Assemblages of logged and unlogged disturbed plots consisted mainly of long-distance migrants and ground-foraging bird species, whereas assemblages of undisturbed control plots consisted of resident species that forage within vegetation. Both unlogged and logged storm-felled coniferous forest stands were inhabited by endangered or declining bird species, such as Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta) on logged plots and Eurasian Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) on unlogged plots. Indicator species analyses suggested that species of unlogged storm disturbed plots depended on storm-created legacies, such as pits and snags, for foraging and nesting. Hence, we recommend reducing post-storm logging of these legacies to support species restricted to unlogged disturbed forest. To increase the diversity of breeding birds on the landscape scale, diverse logged and unlogged post-disturbance stands should be provided, which could be gained by a partial benign neglect strategy of storm disturbed forest stands.

This study presents a high-resolution time series of stable oxygen isotopic record (delta O-18) in the lower Changjiang (Yangtze) River mainstream and aims to investigate the regional water cycle concerning natural climate changes and anthropogenic activities. Results The river water delta O-18 shows apparent seasonal variations, which is overall higher during the dry season and lower during the flood season. This basin-scale seasonal variation of delta O-18 in precipitation over the Changjiang catchment is calculated based on the long-term meteorological and hydrological data. The seasonal variation of delta O-18 in the lower Changjiang river water is largely constrained by monsoon-induced precipitation, but is more directly controlled by the mixing of waters from the upper reaches and the tributary lakes in the middle valley. Conclusions The relative contributions of waters from the upstream and tributary lakes to the lower Changjiang mainstream have been considerably altered by the construction of Three Gorges Dam via the regulation of river discharges. A comparison of river water isotopic records with water discharges from the lakes suggests that it takes about 2 weeks (similar to 17 days) for the Changjiang river water to circumvent the mid-lower reaches of the catchment before traveling to the sea. This study suggests that the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes can be harnessed as sensitive indicators for water cycling within a large catchment that is driven primarily by natural forcing though subject to substantial human impacts.					; Li, Chao/IUO-5358-2023; Qian, Peng/CAF-9749-2022; Yang, Shouye/D-4820-2013	Li, Chao/0000-0001-8571-6531; Lian, Ergang/0000-0001-8155-6462; Yang, Chengfan/0000-0003-2563-0060; Deng, Kai/0000-0002-9274-7894													2190-4707	2190-4715				MAY 29	2020	32	1							84	10.1186/s12302-020-00359-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-020-00359-w													WOS:000553636300001

Correlations between algae and water quality: factors driving eutrophication in Lake Taihu, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Rapid population increase and economic growth in eastern China has lead to the degradation of many water bodies in the region, such as Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China. Using data from recent investigations, the correlations between algae (measured as chlorophyll-a) and water quality indices in Lake Taihu were described by multivariate statistical analyses, and the key driving factors for the lake eutrophication were identified by principal component analysis. Results revealed strong spatiotemporal variation in the correlations between algae and water quality indices, suggesting that the limiting factor for the dominant algae growth depends on seasonality and location and it is necessary to reduce both nitrogen and phosphorus inputs for a long-term eutrophication control in this hyper-eutrophic system. Water temperature was another important controlling factor for algal growth in the lake. Using principal component analysis, nutrient contaminations from anthropogenic and natural inputs were identified as the key driving factor for the water quality problems of the lake. Moreover, five principal components were extracted and characterized with high spatial and seasonal variations in Lake Taihu. The key driving factors were believed to influence spatial variations including heavily polluted areas located in the northern and northwestern parts of the lake, where many manufacturing factories were built and wastewater from domestic and industrial plants was discharged. Based on this analysis, attention should be paid to effective land management, industrial wastewater treatment, and macrophytic vegetation restoration to reduce the pollutant loads and improve water quality. Principal component analysis was found to be a useful and effective method to reduce the number of analytical parameters without notably impairing the quality of information in this study.

The analysis indicates that the annual mean of daily minimum temperature (T-min) has increased significantly, while no significant trends were observed in the annual mean of daily maximum temperature (T-max), resulting in a significant decrease in the diurnal temperature range. Trends and percentages of stations with significant trends in T-min-related indices are generally stronger and higher than those in T-max-related indices; however, no significant trends can be found in T-max-related indices (TXMean, TX90p, TXx and TX10p) at both seasonal and annual time scale. Low correlations with Global-SST ENSO index are also detected in T-max-related indices. Significant positive relationships can be found in T-min-related indices (TNMean, TNx, TNn and TN90p), however, the most significant negative coefficient was also found in cold nights (TN10p) with the Global-SST ENSO index. Singular value decomposition (SVD) correlating extreme temperatures over the Poyang Lake Basin and the North Pacific SST indicates the East China Sea, Western Pacific and Bering Sea to be stronger linked with T-min than T-max with the first mode (SVD-1) explaining 90 and 94 % of annual T-max and T-min respectively.

One of them tracks the change in the pattern of seasonal fluctuations and the second captures the change in their magnitude. To assess whether changes in the seasonal pattern and magnitude are significant, a technique for testing hypotheses concerning the two components is developed. We examine changes in the seasonal concentration of tourist arrivals in six tourist destinations in the Veneto Region, one of the most tourism-oriented regions in Europe, from 2006 to 2016. The magnitude of seasonality significantly decreased in some destinations with a diversified tourism product, such as Euganean Spas and Lake Garda. The seasonal pattern remained substantially stable for all destinations except Venice, where a non-negligible shift in the seasonal pattern occurred.

Deglacierization of a Marginal Basin and Implications for Outburst Floods, Mendenhall Glacier, Alaska	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Suicide Basin is a partly glacierized marginal basin of Mendenhall Glacier, Alaska, that has released glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) annually since 2011. The floods cause inundation and erosion in the Mendenhall Valley, impacting homes and other infrastructure. Here, we utilize in-situ and remote sensing data to assess the recent evolution and current state of Suicide Basin. We focus on the 2018 and 2019 melt seasons, during which we collected most of our data, partly using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To provide longer-term context, we analyze DEMs collected since 2006 and model glacier surface mass balance over the 2006-2019 period. During the 2018 and 2019 outburst flood events, Suicide Basin released similar to 30 x 10(6) m(3) of water within approximately 4-5 days. Since lake drainage was partial in both years, these similar to 30 x 10(6) m(3) represent only a fraction (similar to 60%) of the basin's total storage capacity. In contrast to previous years, subglacial drainage was preceded by supraglacial outflow over the ice dam, which lasted similar to 1 day in 2018 and 6 days in 2019. Two large calving events occurred in 2018 and 2019, with submerged ice breaking off the main glacier during lake filling, thereby increasing the basin's storage capacity. In 2018, the floating ice in the basin was 36 m thick on average. In 2019, ice thickness was 29 m, suggesting rapid decay of the ice tongue despite increasing ice inflow from Mendenhall Glacier. The ice dam at the basin entrance thinned by more than 5 m a(-1) from 2018 to 2019, which is approximately double the rate of the reference period 2006-2018. While ice-dam thinning reduces water storage capacity in the basin, that capacity is increased by declining ice volume in the basin and longitudinal lake expansion, with the latter process challenging to predict. The potential for premature drainage onset (i.e., drainage before the lake's storage capacity is reached), intermittent drainage decelerations, and early drainage termination further complicates prediction of future GLOF events.

J	Mats, VD				Mats, V. D.			THE BAIKAL RIFT: PLIOCENE (MIOCENE) - QUATERNARY EPISODE OR PRODUCT OF EXTENDED DEVELOPMENT SINCE THE LATE CRETACEOUS UNDER VARIOUS TECTONIC FACTORS. A REVIEW	GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS												The article reviews three typical concepts concerning the age of the Baikal rift (BR) which development is still underway: 5 Ma (the BR development start in the Late Pliocene), 30 Ma (Miocene or Oligocene), and 60-70 Ma (the Late Cretaceous). Under the concept of the young BR age (Pliocene-Quaternary) [Artyushkov, 1993; Nikolaev et al., 1985; Buslov, 2012], according to E. V. Artyushkov, BR is not a rift, but a graben due to the fact that the pre-Pliocene structure of BR does not contain any elements that would be indicative of tensile stresses. However, field studies reported in [Lamakin, 1968; Ufimtsev, 1993; Zonenshain et al., 1995; Mats, 1993, 2012; Mats et al., 2001] have revealed that extension structures, such as tilted blocks and listric faults, are abundant in the Baikal basin (BB), and thus do not support E. V. Artyushkov's argumentation. The opinion that BR is young is shared by M. M. Buslov [2012]; he refers to studies of Central Asia and states that only the Pliocene-Quaternary structure of BB is a rift, while the oldest Cenozoic structures (Upper Cretaceous Miocene) are just fragments of the large Cenozoic Predbaikalsky submontane trough (PBT) which are not related to the rift. However, the coeval Cenozoic lithological compositions, thicknesses of sediment layers and types of tectonic structures in PBT and BB have nothing in common. Across the area separating PBT and BB, there are no sediments or structures to justify a concept that BR and PBT may be viewed as composing a single region with uniform structures and formations. The idea of the Pliocene-Quaternary age of BR should be rejected as it contradicts with the latest geological and geophysical data. Seismic profiling in BB has revealed the syn-rift sedimentary bed which thickness exceeds 7.5 km. Results of drilling through the 600-metre sedimentary sequence of Lake Baikal suggest the age of 8.4 Ma [Horiuchi et al., 2004], but M. M. Buslov believes that it took only about 5 Ma to form the entire syn-rift sequence of Lake Baikal. In [Bazarov, 1986; Rasskazov et al., 2014; Mashchuk, Akulov, 2012; Hutchinson et al., 1993; Zonenshain et al., 1995; Kaz'min et al., 1995], the BR age is determined as the Miocene (Oligocene-Miocene) according to the age of the Tankhoi suite (Miocene or Oligocene-Miocene) and the correlation between the lower seismostratigraphic complex (SSC-1) and the Tankhoi suite [Hutchinson et al., 1993; Zonenshain et al., 1995]. The Tankhoi suite lies directly on the crystalline basement of the rift and is believed to mark the start of the Baikal syn-rift profile. However, this concept does not take into account the main specific feature of the profile, i. e. a developing rift. As shown in Fig. 6, the most ancient elements in the syn-rift profile are inside the deep part of the rift. At the day surface, the basement is overlaid by the younger elements of the sedimentary wedge due to the 'expansion non-conformity effect' (as termed in [Khain, Mikhailov, 1985]). In our opinion, it is incorrect to correlate SSC-1 and the Tankhoi suires-the representative seismic profile (Fig. 5) shows that SSC-1 falls out of the profile before reaching the day surface and leans against the rising slope of the basement, while SSC-2 correlates with the Tankhoi suite. Besides, correlating SSC-1 with the Tankhoi suite is contradicting to the data of structural studies reported in [San'kov et al., 1997; Delvaux et al., 1997]. SSC-1 originated before the time when the Lake Baikal region was impacted by the Indo-Eurasian collision and formed under the influence of pure expansion when tensile stresses were oriented from NW to SE across the strike of the rift along the SE 145-150 degrees azimuth [Zonenshain et al., 1995]. By the time of the SSC-2 formation, the stress vector turned counterclockwise towards the NE-SW direction at an acute angle to the rift strike. The Baikal rift structure was changed as the single-sided basin was replaced by the SW-NE stretching dual-sided graben; it included SSC-2 and was bordered by listric faults [Zonenshain et al., 1995]. Results of the structural studies conducted on the Lake Baikal shores [San'kov et al., 1997; Delvaux et al., 1997; Parfeevets, San'kov, 2006] suggest that during the Tankhoi period, the rift developed in conditions of transpression and transtension under the influence of stresses oriented subparallel to the strike of the rift and related to the IndoEurasian collision. This means that SSC-2 (but not SSC-1) correlates with the Tankhoi suite, and the age of the Tankhoi suite is not indicative of the BR age, and the concept of the Miocene (Oligocene-Miocene) age of BR is thus discarded. The concept of the Late Cretaceous-Paleogenic age of BR [Logachev, 1974, 2003; Mats, 1987, 1993, 2012; Mats et al., 2001; Mats, Perepelova, 2011] is most fully supported by the available geological and geophysical data. This age is evi-denced by the Paleogenic (Eocene) palinspectra detected in core samples from deep wells drilled in the Selenga river delta, Southern Baikal basin [Faizulina, Kozlova, 1966]. Besides, the Paleocene-Eocene pre-Tankhoi sediments are discovered at the Khamar-Daban shore of the Southern Baikal basin (the Polovinka river valley) [Mats, 2013]. The sediments of the BB weathering crust [Mats, 2013] correlate with the paleontologically dated Paleogenic sediments of PBT [Pavlov et al., 1976; Popova, 1981]. The BR ancient age is also confirmed by studies reported in [Nikolaev, 1989; Galazii et al., 1999; Kontorovich et al., 2007; Jolivet et al., 2009]. Our review of the BR age concepts gives grounds to conclude that the Pliocene-Quaternary and Oligocene-Miocene (" Tankhoi") ages of BR should be discarded as not supported by the geological and geophysical data collected in the recent studies. Based on the comprehensive studies of the Baikal rift and taking into account an extension of the BR evolution by 60 to 70 Ma, we propose a new concept of the BR development and introduce a three-stage model (Fig. 7) (as a replacement of the well-known two-stage model [Logachev, 2003]) and an impactogenic model as a supplement to the passive and active rifting models [Mats, 2012; Mats, Perepelova, 2011]. In our model, the first stage of the BR development is the Late Cretaceous-Early Oligocene (70-30 Ma): in conditions of the general extension of the lithosphere, BR forms as a slot-type (the term proposed by E. E. Milanovsky) rift and develops, as shown by the passive rifting model, at the background of the original peneplain until the time when the Baikal region is impacted by stresses resulting from the Indo-Eurasian collision; the rift structure is a single-sided basin that comprises the seismically transparent seismostratigraphic complex (SSC-1); it is bordered at NW by the zone of listric faults. The second stage is the Late Oligocene-Early Pliocene (30-5 Ma): BR develops under the impact of stresses resulting from the Indo-Eurasian collision; the dual-sided graben is formed; it comprises SSC-2 that is stratified and deformed. The third stage is the Late Pliocene -Quarter (5 Ma till present): BR develops under the impact of stresses generated by local deep sources, as shown by the active rifting model [Logachev, Zorin, 1987; Zorin et al., 2003]; another single-sided graben is formed; it is bordered by listric faults from the NW and comprises SSC-3 that is stratified but not deformed.																			2078-502X						2015	6	4					467	489		10.5800/GT-2015-6-4-0190	http://dx.doi.org/10.5800/GT-2015-6-4-0190													WOS:000409842800003

These changes are significantly altering water availability in the region and pose critical risks to local populations that are highly dependent on these resources for livelihoods. We examine these issues through an interdisciplinary and linked evaluation of hydrological change and livelihood vulnerability in the Yanamarey watershed. Physical observations of the Yanamarey glacier show acceleration in frontal retreat at a rate of 8 m decade (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) since 1970, accompanied by total volume loss on the order of 0.022 km(3). Hydrological and hydrochemical analyses document a possible transformation of stream flow over the past decade as the seasonal storage capacity of the glacier has degraded. Recent stream discharge measurements from the proglacial lake below the glacier are more coincident with the highly variable seasonal precipitation than they were during the 1998-1999 hydrological year. Local household perceptions of glacier recession and seasonal hydrological variability agree with this trend, which is increasing human vulnerability in the watershed. Household case-study survey results demonstrate that shifting water resources, increasing weather extremes and climate-related threats to tourism are all new vectors of vulnerability for household livelihoods.

Onchocerca volvulus transmission in the Mbam valley of Cameroon following 16 years of annual community-directed treatment with ivermectin, and the description of a new cytotype of Simulium squamosum	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: The onchocerciasis focus surrounding the lower Mbam and Sanaga rivers, where Onchocerca volvulus is transmitted by Simulium damnosum s.l. (Diptera: Simuliidae), was historically the largest in the southern regions of Cameroon. Annual community- directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) has been taking place since 2000, but recent studies have shown that new infections are occurring in children. We aimed to investigate blackfly biting and O. volvulus transmission rates along the lower Mbam river 16 years after the formal onset of annual CDTI. Methods: Black flies were collected for three consecutive days each month between July 2016 and June 2017 at two riverside villages and two inland sites situated 4.9 km and 7.9 km from the riverside. Specimens collected at each site were dissected on one of the three collection days each month to estimate parity rates and O. volvulus infection rates, while the remaining samples were preserved for pool screening. Results: In total, 93,573 S. damnosum s.l. black flies were recorded biting humans and 9281 were dissected. Annual biting rates of up to 606,370 were estimated at the riverside, decreasing to 20,540 at 7.9 km, while, based on dissections, annual transmission potentials of up to 4488 were estimated at the riverside, decreasing to 102 and 0 at 4.9 km and 7.9 km, respectively. However, pool screening showed evidence of infection in black flies at the furthest distance from the river. Results of both methods demonstrated the percentage of infective flies to be relatively low (0.100.36%), but above the WHO threshold for interruption of transmission. In addition, a small number of larvae collected during the dry season revealed the presence of Simulium squamosum E. This is the first time S. squamosum E has been found east of Lake Volta in Ghana, but our material was chromosomally distinctive, and we call it S. squamosum E2. Conclusions: Relatively low O. volvulus infection rates appear to be offset by extremely high densities of biting black flies which are sustaining transmission along the banks of the lower Mbam river.					; Dujardin, Jean-Claude/AAO-1783-2021; Pfarr, Kenneth/X-9175-2018; NJAMNSHI, Prof Alfred K/IRZ-9409-2023; Mayanja-Kizza, Harriet/AAM-5372-2020	Colebunders, Robert/0000-0002-1919-1340; Hendy, Adam/0000-0001-8082-6352; NJAMNSHI, Alfred K./0000-0003-0052-1511; 													1756-3305					NOV 2	2021	14	1							563	10.1186/s13071-021-05072-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05072-y								34727965					WOS:000714116600001

Simulation of Urban Heat Island during a High-Heat Event Using WRF Urban Canopy Models: A Case Study for Metro Manila	ATMOSPHERE												This present study aims to determine the performance of using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, coupled with the urban canopy models (UCMs), in simulating the 2 m air temperature and 2 m relative humidity in Metro Manila. The simulation was performed during a high heat event on 22-29 April 2018, which coincided with the dry season in the Philippines. The four urban canopy model options that were used in this study include, the bulk (no urban), SLUCM, BEP, and BEM. The results of the simulations were compared with the hourly observations from three weather stations over Metro Manila from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Integrated Surface Dataset (ISD) and one agrometeorological station in Naic, Cavite. After model validation, the urban heat island (UHI) was then characterized to determine the spatial-temporal variations in the cities of Metro Manila. Statistical results show that the WRF simulation for 2 m air temperature agrees with measurements with an RMSE of <3.0 degrees C, mean bias error of <2.0 degrees C, and index of agreement of >0.80. WRF simulation for relative humidity still presents a challenge where simulation errors are higher than the acceptable range. The addition of UCMs does not necessarily improve the simulation for 2 m air temperature, while the use of BEP improved the 2 m relative humidity simulation. The results suggest the importance of using actual urban morphology values in WRF to accurately simulate near-surface variables. On the other hand, WRF simulation shows the presence of urban heat islands, notably in the northwest and central area of Metro Manila during daytime, extending throughout Metro Manila during nighttime. Lower air temperature was consistently observed in areas near Laguna Lake, while higher air temperature due to stagnant winds was observed in the northwest area of Metro Manila. High heat index was also observed throughout Metro Manila from daytime until nighttime, especially in areas near bodies of water like Manila Bay and Laguna Lake due to high humidity.

Correlation analysis, cluster analysis and principal component analysis were used to identified nitrogen and phosphorus pollution sources. The results showed that: (1) nitrogen and phosphorus in water and surface sediments in the study area were at different levels. (2) In the Pi river, the decomposition of animal and plant residues, the leachate from the accumulation of aquaculture wastewater and urban domestic sewage were the main sources of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, while in the Shiting river, the unreasonable application of pesticides and fertilizers, the degradation of animal and plant residues, agricultural wastewater from agricultural drainage channels, industrial production wastewater and the weathering of agricultural wastes had a great impact on the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. The results in this study provide reliable experimental data and a reference to local relevant departments for the implementation of effective control measures for the reduction of the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution load in the river basin.

Variable Physical Drivers of Near-Surface Turbulence in a Regulated River	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Inland waters, such as lakes, reservoirs and rivers, are important sources of climate forcing trace gases. A key parameter that regulates the gas exchange between water and the atmosphere is the gas transfer velocity, which itself is controlled by near-surface turbulence in the water. While in lakes and reservoirs, near-surface turbulence is mainly driven by atmospheric forcing, in shallow rivers and streams it is generated by bottom friction of gravity-forced flow. Large rivers represent a transition between these two cases. Near-surface turbulence has rarely been measured in rivers and the drivers of turbulence have not been quantified. We analyzed continuous measurements of flow velocity and quantified turbulence as the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy over the ice-free season in a large regulated river in Northern Finland. Measured dissipation rates agreed with predictions from bulk parameters, including mean flow velocity, wind speed, surface heat flux, and with a one-dimensional numerical turbulence model. Values ranged from similar to 10-10m2s-3 to 10-5m2s-3. Atmospheric forcing or gravity was the dominant driver of near-surface turbulence for similar fraction of the time. Large variability in near-surface dissipation rate occurred at diel time scales, when the flow velocity was strongly affected by downstream dam operation. By combining scaling relations for boundary-layer turbulence at the river bed and at the air-water interface, we derived a simple model for estimating the relative contributions of wind speed and bottom friction of river flow as a function of depth.					; Lorke, Andreas/B-9195-2008; Mammarella, Ivan/E-7782-2016; Aurela, Mika/L-4724-2014; Uotila, Petteri/A-1703-2012; Stepanenko, Victor/N-8467-2013; Vesala, Timo/C-3795-2017	Vaha, Aki/0000-0001-9850-9830; Guseva, Sofya/0000-0002-1072-5027; Lorke, Andreas/0000-0001-5533-1817; Mammarella, Ivan/0000-0002-8516-3356; Wallin, Marcus/0000-0002-3082-8728; Uotila, Petteri/0000-0002-2939-7561; Lotsari, Eliisa/0000-0002-0120-8722; Stepanenko, Victor/0000-0003-3033-6712; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				NOV	2021	57	11							e2020WR027939	10.1029/2020WR027939	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR027939													WOS:000723106900008

Despite its importance, no IOPs retrieval model was specifically developed for inland water bodies, although significant efforts were made on oceanic inversion models. In addition, for inland waters, an IOPs-based model is often preferred for estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, an application of IOPs, over empirical and some semi-empirical algorithms. Then developing a model for estimating both IOPs and Chl-a is of significance for understanding the bio-optical properties and occurrence of algal blooms in eutrophic reservoirs, lakes and estuaries. In this paper, an IOPs Inversion Model of Inland Waters (IIMIW) for deriving natural water IOPs and estimating Chl-a is proposed and validated. The results indicate that this model can be used to accurately retrieve absorption coefficients at 443 nm and 665 nm with R-2 = 0.8347 and R-2 = 0.7550 respectively for Indiana study sites, and to estimate Chl-a from the derived absorption coefficients at high accuracies (R-2 = 0.9292 and a mean relative error 21.65%) with samples collected from eight different study sites in the world and in different seasons. The model was also applied on Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Application (AISA) images to map IOPs and Chl-a. Through validation by in situ measured Chl-a, results directly show that IIMIW can predict Chl-a with good accuracy even using the AISA bands, to as well indirectly prove that non-water absorption coefficients are retrieved accurately, at least within red and near-infrared region. Further biogeochemical information can be derived from these maps as well. These promising mapping results reveal possible remote routine surveillance of bio-optical states of inland waters.

Impacts of land-use change on hydrologic responses in the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Human activities have historically affected hydrology in the upper Midwestern United States, specifically through the conversion of forests and prairie grasslands to agricultural uses. The hydrologic impacts of land-use change due to settlement on the water balance of three Great Lakes states: Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan were analyzed using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) large-scale hydrology model, and changes in the spatial distribution of vegetation types were studied. Point model simulations demonstrated that the VIC model simulated changes in average annual and monthly evapotranspiration (ET) and total runoff response were in the same direction and had similar magnitudes to values from other published land-use change studies. At regional scales, simulated changes resulting from land-use modifications varied spatially and seasonally, but were strongly correlated to the type of vegetation conversion and the geographic location of the land-use type centroid. Deforestation was most dramatic in the central part of the study domain where five million hectares of deciduous forest have been converted to wooded grasslands and row crop agriculture, which resulted in a 5-15% decrease in ET and a 10-30% increase in total runoff. Northern areas, where land-use change was primarily from majority evergreen to majority deciduous forest, experienced decreases of 5-10% in ET and increases of 20-40% in total runoff. The southern and western parts of the study domain were dominated by a conversion from prairie grasslands to row agriculture crop, resulting in a 10-15% increase in ET and a 20-30% decrease in total runoff.

Risk assessment of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in recreational waters: A comparative study of monitoring methods	HARMFUL ALGAE												Toxic cyanobacterial blooms impose a health risk to recreational users, and monitoring of cyanobacteria and associated toxins is required to assess this risk. Traditionally, monitoring for risk assessment is based on cyanobacterial biomass, which assumes that all cyanobacteria potentially produce toxins. While these methods may be cost effective, relatively fast, and more widely accessible, they often lead to an overestimation of the health risk induced by cyanotoxins. Monitoring methods that more directly target toxins, or toxin producing genes, may provide a better risk assessment, yet these methods may be more costly, usually take longer, or are not widely accessible. In this study, we compared six monitoring methods (fluorometry, microscopy, qPCR of 16S and mcyE, ELISA assays, and LC-MS/MS), of which the last three focussed on the most abundant cyanotoxin microcystins, across 11 lakes in the Netherlands during the bathing water season (May-October) of 2019. Results of all monitoring methods significantly correlated with LC-MS/MS obtained microcystin levels (the assumed 'golden standard'), with stronger correlations for methods targeting microcystins (ELISA) and microcystin genes (mcyE). The estimated risk levels differed substantially between methods, with 78 % and 56 % of alert level exceedances in the total number of collected samples for fluorometry and microscopy-based methods, respectively, while this was only 16 % and 6 % when the risk assessment was based on ELISA and LC-MS/MS obtained toxin concentrations, respectively. Integrating our results with earlier findings confirmed a strong association between microcystin concentration and the biovolume of potential microcystin-producing genera. Moreover, using an extended database consisting of 4265 observations from 461 locations across the Netherlands in the bathing water seasons of 2015 - 2019, we showed a strong association between fluorescence and the biovolume of potentially toxin-producing genera. Our results indicate that a two-tiered approach may be an effective risk assessment strategy, with first a biomass-based method (fluorometry, biovolume) until the first alert level is exceeded, after which the risk level can be confirmed or adjusted based on follow-up toxin or toxin gene analyses.					; Van de Waal, Dedmer/B-8002-2012; Visser, Petra/NJT-4667-2025; Faassen, Elisabeth/P-5411-2015	Visser, Petra/0000-0003-3294-1908; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				SEP	2024	138								102683	10.1016/j.hal.2024.102683	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2024.102683		JUL 2024						39244242					WOS:001267921400001

The mean concentrations of Sigma SCCPs and Sigma MCCPs were 262 and 97.1 ng g(-1) dw (dry weight) in sediment and 17,055 and 2573 ng g(-1) dw in SPM, respectively, and higher SCCP levels did not clearly reflect a shift to more MCCPs in this section of the Yellow River. The predominant homologue groups were C-10-CP and C-11-CP for SCCPs and C-14-CP for MCCPs. The CPs possibly mainly derived from the use of CP commercial mixtures, mainly included CP-42 and CP-52. The spatial distributions and principal component analysis indicated that industrial inputs, dams, and topography played important roles in influencing the environmental behavior of CPs in both sediment and SPM. In addition, decreasing fluxes of CPs were observed in SPM from Tongguan to Aishan stations, particularly in reservoirs, which implies that CPs may have accumulated in the Henan section of the Yellow River.

Like in other vineyards all around the world, the typicity of wines and the phenology of vines have changed, particularly since the 1970s. Trends in the growing season average temperature and in Huglin's heliothermal index show that the climate in the Neuchatel vineyards changed from very cool or cool to temperate during the last decades. Trends in the cool night index and in the prior to harvest cool night index both indicate that in the near future this wine region will frequently experience temperate instead of cool nights during the weeks leading up to harvest. Our results highlight the need for adaptation strategies, such as an upward elevational shift for Pinot Noir, as climatic conditions will become too warm at its current location in the next decades. They also show that conditions in this region are already favorable for more thermophilic varieties such as Merlot. In the context of global warming, this kind of analysis should be conducted throughout winegrowing regions in order to develop efficient adaptation strategies at the microclimatic scale.

In the current study, we combined short-and long-term investigations to elucidate the role of sediments in the P budget in a chain of eutrophic lake basins. We quantified the internal loading of P in three basins of Lake Peipsi (Estonia/Russia) for two periods characterized by different external P loadings using radiometrically dated sediment cores (long-termstudies). The relationships between different water quality variables and the internal P loading, and the external P loading were studied. Our short-term studies aimed at elucidating the possible mechanisms behind variations in internal P loading included examination of the surficial sediments, i.e., seasonal measurements of redox potential, sediment pore water P concentrations and diffusive fluxes. Our results provided evidence for a potentially high importance of internal P loading in regulating water quality. The sediment core analyses revealed an increase in the internal P loading during the period of lower external P loading coinciding with the general deterioration in the lake water quality (i.e, higher concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus, total phosphorus and biomass of cyanobacteria). Increase in wave action between the two studied periods appeared to cause more frequent sediment resuspension, and thus be the most likely reason for the variations in internal P loading. Our short-term measurements indicated that resuspension events can be followed by a considerable increase in the diffusive fluxes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Caffeine was the dominant compound among all selected PPCPs in the aqueous phase (23.8-344.7 ng/L). Sediment release. contributed minimally to caffeine levels found in the aqueous phase of Qingshan Lake. Concentrations of selected PPCPs in dry season water samples were generally higher than those in the water samples obtained during the wet or median water seasons. The risks of residual caffeine in water on aqueous organisms was minimal (risk quotient values below 0.01). Sulfamethoxazole and triclocarban posed the highest environmental risks despite their low concentrations (below 25 ng/L in water and 10 mu g/kg in sediment) in Qingshan Lake basin. The risks produced by selected PPCPs in sediments were generally higher than in the aqueous phase. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Angler-Caught Piscivore Diets Reflect Fish Community Changes in Lake Huron	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Examination of angler-caught piscivore stomachs revealed that Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and Walleyes Sander vitreus altered their diets in response to unprecedented declines in Lake Huron's main-basin prey fish community. Diets varied by predator species, season, and location but were nearly always dominated numerically by some combination of Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax, Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides, Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus, or terrestrial insects. Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (steelhead), Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, and Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar had varied diets that reflected higher contributions of insects. Compared with an earlier (1983-1986) examination of angler-caught predator fishes from Lake Huron, the contemporary results showed an increase in consumption of nontraditional prey (including conspecifics), use of smaller prey, and an increase in insects in the diet, suggesting that piscivores were faced with chronic prey limitation during this study. The management of all piscivores in Lake Huron will likely require consideration of the pervasive effects of changes in food webs, especially if prey fish remain at low levels.

Saiful; Muhammad, Said			Water quality assessment of Sehriban stream (Kastamonu, TurkIye) from a multi-statistical perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												In this paper, water quality of Sehriban Stream, a rare freshwater ecosystem far from human impact and located in the western part of Turkiye's Karadeniz Region, was studied over a long period of time (a hydrological year). Multivariate statistical approaches such as Pearson Correlation Index (PCI), Factor Analysis (FA), Cluster Analysis (CA) and self-organising maps (SOM) were used to evaluate the water quality and physico-chemical datasets. Samples were taken monthly during February 2019 - January 2020 from 12 stations and a total of 21 physicochemical parameters were investigated. The spatiotemporal averages of some organic pollution parameters investigated in the basin were determined as follows: 344 mu S/cm for EC, 0.80 mg/L for COD, 0.42 mg/L for BOD, 0.02 mg/L for PO42-, 34.4 mg/L for SO42-, 0.00009 mg/L for NO2, 1.36 mg/L for NO3 and 0.0002 mg/L for NH4-. According to the findings of this study, despite a modest decline in water quality from upstream to downstream, Sehriban Stream was revealed to have first-class water quality features in general and all parameters detected in all seasons at all the investigated stations were below the limit values reported by WHO. The SOM analysis detected three spatial patterns, e.g. pH-salinity-K+-PO42--Mg2+-NO2; DO-Ca2+-NH4- and TDS-EC-Cl--SO42--COD-BOD-Na+ in water. As a result of PCI, significant positive and negative correlations were recorded among the investigated parameters. Results of FA showed that 2 factors elucidated 85% of total variances, which are named 'Agricultural Factor' and 'Natural Factor'. As a result of CA, 3 significant clusters were identified, which are named 'Lower Polluted Zone', 'Moderate Polluted Zone' and 'Higher Polluted Zone'. Overall, this work showed that multi-statistical approaches can be used to assess the water quality in a rare, unpolluted habitat over time and space.					; Tokatlı, Cem/AAN-3814-2021; Islam, Md/ABB-2487-2021; Islam, Abu Reza Md.

Pesticide occurrence and persistence entering recreational lakes in watersheds of varying land uses	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Currently little is known of newer pesticide classes and their occurrence and persistence in recreational lakes. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (1) assess average pesticide concentrations and loadings entering recreational lakes in three mixed land use watersheds throughout the growing season, (2) evaluate pesticide persistence longitudinally within the lakes, and (3) perform an ecotoxicity assessment. Six sampling campaigns were conducted at three lakes from April through October 2018 to measure the occurrence and persistence during pre, middle, and post growing season. Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were placed in streams near lake inlets and monthly samples were collected for analysis of twelve pesticides. Additional monthly grab water samples were taken at each POCIS location and at the midpoint and outlet of each lake. All pesticide samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and individual pesticide loading rates were determined. Occurrence and persistence of specific pesticides were significantly different between lakes in varying watershed land uses. Specifically, the recreational lake receiving predominately urban runoff had the highest load of pesticides, likely in the form of biocides, entering the waterbody. Concentrations of imidacloprid exceeded acute and chronic invertebrate levels for 11% and 61% of the sampling periods, respectively, with the recreational lake receiving predominately urban runoff having the most occurrences. Findings from this study are critical for preventing and mitigating potential effects of pesticides, specifically applied as biocides in urban landscapes, from entering and persisting in recreational lakes.

Consequently, intense withdrawals for public supply can affect the health of lake ecosystems and increase trees' vulnerability to predicted drought intensification effects. This study aimed to evaluate, through a dendroecological analysis of riparian trees, the strength of the climatic and hydrological signals retained in the tree-ring widths and to detect a critical water-level threshold affecting tree resilience and growth recovery. Our study area is located within the Regional Natural Park of Bracciano-Martignano in central Italy. In recent years, the lake water-level drop observed at Bracciano after intensive water withdrawals raised concerns about the ecological impacts on the ecosystem's vulnerability. The main distinctive pattern in the climate-growth relations was the influence of previous years precipitation and drought conditions up to five years at Bracciano. At Martignano, where lake water withdrawals are absent, long-term climatic signals disappeared after two years. The intensive human water use at Bracciano Lake most likely induced trees to be more dependent on groundwater raising or soil water content stored from the previous rainy periods especially on an annual scale. On the other hand, tree-ring growth was strongly correlated with short-term water-level fluctuations (monthly - seasonal). Tree-rings of riparian species appear to be a useful tool to detect critical water levels after the intensive water withdrawals and the increase in dry conditions occurred in the past few decades. Yearly values ranging from -108 to -139 cm may be considered as potential thresholds affecting riparian species. This finding may support lake water withdrawal regulation for riparian ecosystem protection and conservation under future drought intensification.

It is justifiable to carry out studies in this system due to its connection with another larger ecosystem called the Terminos Lagoon. The objective of this investigation was to analyze the concentration of Pb and Cd in sediments of the fluvial-lagoon-deltaic system of the Palizada River and to determine, with this, the contamination index of these metals. Cd showed the highest concentration in sampling sites and climatic seasons with respect to Pb, with a maximum value of 53.9 +/- 5.0, while the Pb concentration was 10.4 +/- 0.2 mu g.g(-1). The same tendency was present with pollution and geoaccumulation indexes; here, the Cd index stands out. The enrichment of heavy metals was identified through the accumulation of Cd and Pb; such a process was evaluated through the geoacumulation index (Igeo). The results of this indicated that the contamination of these elements is mainly of anthropogenic origin. This element represents an ecological toxic risk due to the chronic presence of heavy metals in a priority area for the conservation of aquatic and terrestrial biota such as the Palizada system, owing to its high toxicity even at low concentrations. Thus, it is important to evaluate its sublethal effects in the organisms that inhabit this system, which requires the implementation of integral monitoring.

A study of salt water intrusion in the Kallada river, south west coast of Kerala, India	WATER SUPPLY												Munroe Island in Kollam District of Kerala is a typical backwater village situated at the confluence of the Ashtamudi backwater and the Kallada river system. It is an amalgamation of eight small islands with a total area of 13.4 sq. km. Salinity intrusion has been a serious threat in the downstream areas of Kallada river for more than one and half decades, affecting the groundwater quality of Munroe Island. The present study focuses on the seasonal variation in physico-chemical characteristics of the underground water system of Munroe island and Kallada river with special reference to saline water intrusion. Physico-chemical analysis of ground water revealed that samples were unsuitable for drinking due to higher content of Na, Ca, and K. Microbiological analysis of island groundwater showed the presence of coliform and E-coli bacteria above the permissible limit. Results indicated a significant correlation between salinity and major anions viz., Cl- and SO42 and cations viz., Mg, Na, Ca, and K of both river surface and island groundwater. In the present study it is clearly evident the occurrence of salt water intrusion in Kallada river from Ashtamudy lake and the its severity become higher during premonsoon season. The results also indicated that the salinity increase in kallada river has a negative impact on island ground water quality. The paper also suggest suitable management strategies for overcoming the salt water intrusion thereby upgrading island sustainability.

J	Smith, J				Smith, Julia			Teachers' perspectives on communication and parent engagement in early childhood education programs for migrant farmworker children	JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH												As early childhood education programs in the United States increasingly serve a growing number of children from linguistically and culturally diverse families, understanding teacher practices to better serve these families continues to be an important focus for the profession. In programs that serve migrant farmworker families, little is known about teachers' communication practices and ways in which teachers promote parent engagement with migrant farmworker families. This article explores the practices of teachers relevant to family communication and engagement in Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs, a branch of Head Start program for farmworker families, mostly of Mexican origin. This study used qualitative methods of in-depth interviews and a focus group to bring forth the perspectives and lived experience of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking teachers working with farmworker families in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Key findings illustrate the role of shared language and culture, mediated language barriers, the reliability of interpreters and written communication, and authentic ways of creating home-school connections with the migrant farmworker community.																			1476-718X	1741-2927				JUN	2020	18	2					115	129	1476718X19898712	10.1177/1476718X19898712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1476718X19898712		JAN 2020											WOS:000510345700001

However, there are conflicting reports regarding their occurrence in surface waters. In this study, we evaluated the impact of amending lake water samples with trichloroacetic acid (0.1 M TCA) on the detection of BMAA isomers, compared with pre-existing protocols. A sensitive instrumental method was enlisted for the survey, with limits of detection in the range of 5-10 ng L-1. Higher detection rates and significantly greater levels (paired Wilcoxon's signed-rank tests, p < 0.001) of BMAA isomers were observed in TCA-amended samples (method B) compared to samples without TCA (method A). The overall range of B/A ratios was 0.67-8.25 for AEG (up to +725%) and 0.69-15.5 for DAB (up to +1450%), with absolute concentration increases in TCA-amended samples of up to +15,000 ng L-1 for AEG and +650 ng L-1 for DAB. We also documented the trends in the occurrence of BMAA isomers for a large breadth of field-collected lakes from Brazil, Canada, France, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Data gathered during this overarching campaign (overall, n = 390 within 45 lake sampling sites) indicated frequent detections of AEG and DAB isomers, with detection rates of 30% and 43% and maximum levels of 19,000 ng L-1 and 1100 ng L-1, respectively. In contrast, BAMA was found in less than 8% of the water samples, and BMAA was not found in any sample. These results support the analyses of free-living cyanobacteria, wherein BMAA was often reported at concentrations of 2-4 orders of magnitude lower than AEG and DAB. Seasonal measurements conducted at two bloom-impacted lakes indicated limited correlations of BMAA isomers with total microcystins or chlorophyll-a, which deserves further investigation.					; Giani, Alessandra/H-9764-2012; Tromas, Nicolas/MGB-4006-2025; Simon, Dana/R-4716-2019; Lowe, Chris/D-1852-2010; Sauve, Sebastien/K-5671-2012; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012; Vinçon-Leite, Brigitte/Y-1396-2019	Vincon Leite, Brigitte/0000-0002-0190-0209; Giani, Alessandra/0000-0002-2524-8534; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Tromas, Nicolas/0000-0003-4332-8463; Simon, Dana/0000-0003-3725-2482; Venkiteswaran, Jason J./0000-0002-6574-7071; Husk, Barry/0000-0002-5993-1024														2072-6651				APR	2022	14	4							251	10.3390/toxins14040251	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins14040251								35448860					WOS:000786148600001

Seventy surface water samples were examined through an analysis of 41 physiochemical indices in the dry and wet seasons in April and July 2019, respectively, while a part of water site samples collected in July 2020 was taken for isotope detections. To identify the water quality, single-factor pollution index (SI), Nemerow pollution index (NPI), and water quality comprehensive pollution index (CPI) were calculated based on 13 pollutants using GB 3838-2002 class III water standard values. Results pointed to typical pollutants of TN, TP, and F with ranges of l.d.-44.8 (2.00 +/- 3.69) mg/L, l.d.-250 (2.07 +/- 15.35) mg/L, and l.d.-11 (1.48 +/- 7.34) mg/L respectively with high spatial variability. The concentrations of heavy metals present in the water samples followed the sequence: Zn > Ni > Cu > As > Pb > Cd > Hg, and most of the samples showed low values relative to the standard permissible limits. In three methods, the water quality evaluation results of SI method were obviously worse than NPI and CPI methods. The NPI and CPI values had ranges of 0.116-887.40 (8.12 +/- 74.89) and 0.03-111.54 (1.17 +/- 9.40), respectively; consequently, the water quality was considered generally well, with more than 65% of sites classified as "cleanness" or "sub-cleanness." Most of the values of delta N-15 and delta O-18 had ranges of 6.62-20.05 parts per thousand and - 6.53-4.70 parts per thousand, which suggested the livestock manure resources were the possible sources of nitrogen that entered the surface water causing more pollution in the wet season. Part of sites with serious water pollution had very high concentrations of P, F, or heavy metals and might be closely correlated with the point source pollution of phosphate chemical industry or iron ore mining and smelting. The results of this study can provide the basic data for efficient water management and human health protection for local government.

Microcystin Prevalence throughout Lentic Waterbodies in Coastal Southern California	TOXINS												Toxin producing cyanobacterial blooms have increased globally in recent decades in both frequency and intensity. Despite the recognition of this growing risk, the extent and magnitude of cyanobacterial blooms and cyanotoxin prevalence is poorly characterized in the heavily populated region of southern California. Recent assessments of lentic waterbodies (depressional wetlands, lakes, reservoirs and coastal lagoons) determined the prevalence of microcystins and, in some cases, additional cyanotoxins. Microcystins were present in all waterbody types surveyed although toxin concentrations were generally low across most habitats, as only a small number of sites exceeded California's recreational health thresholds for acute toxicity. Results from passive samplers (Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT)) indicated microcystins were prevalent throughout lentic waterbodies and that traditional discrete samples underestimated the presence of microcystins. Multiple cyanotoxins were detected simultaneously in some systems, indicating multiple stressors, the risk of which is uncertain since health thresholds are based on exposures to single toxins. Anatoxin-a was detected for the first time from lakes in southern California. The persistence of detectable microcystins across years and seasons indicates a low-level, chronic risk through both direct and indirect exposure. The influence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms is a more complex stressor than presently recognized and should be included in water quality monitoring programs.

Floodplain lakes (FPLs) are essential parts of complex floodplain ecosystems' biological and hydro-chemical processes. Clear seasonal cycles, determined by the regime of the parent river and closely linked to climatic conditions, are observed in these lakes. Both the quantity and the quality of water are determined by the functional phases of a floodplain lake; limnophase, when the lake is isolated from the river, and potamophase (inundation), when the floodplain lake is overflowed by the river waters. These phases highly modify lake bathymetry, water balance, chemistry, and biology. Human pressure, mostly dam construction and land use changes, alter the frequency, duration, and intensity of natural cycles of inundation. The majority of large rivers in the Northern Hemisphere have been impacted by human activity. Floodplain lakes are also affected by continuous climate change, due to the alterations of the hydrological regimes. Cyanobacterial blooms in floodplain lakes are often characterized by high qualitative and quantitative annual and long-term variability. The main forces driving cyanobacterial blooms can be found in the flooding dynamics and intensity influencing hydraulic residence time and the concentration of biogenic compounds in lake water. Cyanotoxin production and seasonal dynamics in floodplain lakes have been rarely studied, particularly in connection with the hydrological regime. Moreover, the effects of cyanobacterial blooms and their toxicity to organisms inhabiting floodplain lakes, connected rivers, and floodplains are poorly understood. Therefore, knowledge of the processes controlling floodplain lakes' ecological conditions is crucial to implementing water management and restoration practices, protecting those fragile and precious ecosystems from degradation and possible extension.

Despite their relevance in the environment for the removal of MCs, this bacterial community has been scarcely studied. The influence of physicochemical factors and the seasonal dynamics of toxic cyanobacteria on the relative abundance and seasonal dynamics of the MC-degrading bacterial community with mlr genes (mlr(+)) were investigated during a two-year study at a water reservoir in central Spain. The capacity of the total bacterial community on the degradation of MCs during the whole period of study was also evaluated. The results showed that the relative abundance of mlr(+) bacteria started to increase after the increase in the relative abundance of toxic cyanobacteria and MC concentrations in the water, indicating a related seasonal dynamic and an important interaction between the two communities. The correspondence of several peaks of mlr(+) bacteria with decreases in the relative abundance of toxic cyanobacteria and vice versa may also suggest a possible antagonistic relationship that deserves an in-depth study. The lack of a significant relationship between the physicochemical factors and the temporal shifts of both MC producers and degraders also supports the notion that the interaction of the two communities is an important driver of their seasonal dynamics in nature. Regarding the capacity of the total bacterial community for the degradation of MCs, this capacity was only observed during the toxic cyanobacterial bloom episodes, highlighting the importance of the pre-exposure to MCs in the reservoir for triggering the MC biodegradation process.

A multiyear estimate of methane fluxes in Alaska from CARVE atmospheric observations	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Methane (CH4) fluxes from Alaska and other arctic regions may be sensitive to thawing permafrost and future climate change, but estimates of both current and future fluxes from the region are uncertain. This study estimates CH4 fluxes across Alaska for 2012-2014 using aircraft observations from the Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) and a geostatistical inverse model (GIM). We find that a simple flux model based on a daily soil temperature map and a static map of wetland extent reproduces the atmospheric CH4 observations at the statewide, multiyear scale more effectively than global-scale process-based models. This result points to a simple and effective way of representing CH4 fluxes across Alaska. It further suggests that process-based models can improve their representation of key processes and that more complex processes included in these models cannot be evaluated given the information content of available atmospheric CH4 observations. In addition, we find that CH4 emissions from the North Slope of Alaska account for 24% of the total statewide flux of 1.74 +/- 0.26 Tg CH4 (for May-October). Global-scale process models only attribute an average of 3% of the total flux to this region. This mismatch occurs for two reasons: process models likely underestimate wetland extent in regions without visible surface water, and these models prematurely shut down CH4 fluxes at soil temperatures near 0 degrees C. Lastly, we find that the seasonality of CH4 fluxes varied during 2012-2014 but that total emissions did not differ significantly among years, despite substantial differences in soil temperature and precipitation.

Market size oysters were analyzed for biochemical composition (dry matter, ash, protein, lipid content and fatty acid profile) and VOCs from samples harvested in January and February. Significant differences in fatty acids and in VOC content were observed between the oyster species. The European flat oyster was found to have a higher level of unsaturated fatty acids in comparison with Pacific cupped oysters. The main VOC in the European flat oyster was found to be 3-cyclohexene-1-ethanol while 1,5-octadien-3-ol was the main VOC in the Pacific cupped oyster. Principle component analysis (PCA) not only showed separation between oyster species, but also between oysters originating from different cultivation areas as well as oysters harvested at different time intervals.

J	van Poorten, BT; Brydle, S				van Poorten, Brett T.; Brydle, Scott			Estimating fishing effort from remote traffic counters: Opportunities and challenges	FISHERIES RESEARCH												This paper introduces traffic counters paired with infrequent observations of total fishing effort and relative fishing and non-fishing traffic to estimate daily and seasonal fishing effort. Fishing effort is an important metric in recreational fisheries, used as an index of fishing attractiveness and fishing mortality. There are several options for monitoring fishing effort, but for high-precision effort on a particular fishery, creel surveys and time-lapse cameras have been the only options. However, time-lapse cameras have high costs associated with reviewing images and technology failure requires imputing missing observations. To translate this index of counts of boats or shore anglers derived from time-lapse images into absolute fishing effort, this method requires independent measures of total fishing effort as well as observations of fishing and non-fishing traffic. We use remote traffic counters coupled with periodic on-site creel surveys to estimate daily and seasonal fishing effort. Fishing effort is estimated using a state-space Bayesian hierarchical model, which incorporates all of these data to provide a measure of daily or seasonal fishing effort. We further show that for our case study, fishing effort estimates require a high number of independent observations of effort and proportional distribution of fishing and non-fishing traffic. Comparing effort estimates from traffic counters with estimates derived from just a stratified random creel survey shows traffic counters provide more precise estimates of effort, though an absolute comparison is not possible with the data available. Our mixed-use lake necessitates a high number of independent observations of traffic and angling to produce reliable fishing effort estimates; we recommend traffic counters for lakes where most traffic is devoted to angling. We conclude traffic counters are a useful tool for estimating fishing effort, but should be used concurrently with other methods such as creel surveys or motion-detecting cameras that can estimate fishing and non-fishing traffic.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				AUG	2018	204						231	238		10.1016/j.fishres.2018.02.024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.02.024													WOS:000432768000025
J	Wang, XS; Zhou, YY				Wang, Xu-Sheng; Zhou, Yanyi			Investigating the mysteries of groundwater in the Badain Jaran Desert, China	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) in China is a desert with impressive sand dunes and a groundwater situation that has attracted numerous researchers. This paper gives an overview of the mysteries of groundwater in the BJD that are exhibited as five key problems identified in previous studies. These problems relate to the origin of the groundwater, the hydrological connection between the BJD and the Heihe River Basin (HRB), the infiltration recharge, the lake-groundwater interactions, and the features of stable isotope analyses. The existing controversial analyses and hypotheses have caused debate and have hindered effective water resources management in the region. In recent years, these problems have been partly addressed by additional surveys. It has been revealed that the Quaternary sandy sediments and Neogene-Cretaceous sandstones form a thick aquifer system in the BJD. Groundwater flow at the regional scale is dominated by a significant difference in water levels between the surrounding mountains and lowlands at the western and northern edges. Discharge of groundwater from the BJD to the downstream HRB occurs according to the regional flow. Seasonal fluctuations of the water level in lakes are less than 0.5 m due to the quasi-steady groundwater discharge. The magnitude of infiltration recharge is still highly uncertain because significant limitations existed in previous studies. The evaporation effect may be the key to interpreting the anomalous negative deuterium-excess in the BJD groundwater. Further investigations are expected to reveal the hydrogeological conditions in more detail.																			1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2018	26	5			SI		1639	1655		10.1007/s10040-018-1750-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-018-1750-1													WOS:000439318900024

Extreme flow variability and the 'boom and bust' ecology of fish in arid-zone floodplain rivers: a case history with implications for environmental flows, conservation and management	ECOHYDROLOGY												Floodplain rivers in arid and semi-arid regions may be the most threatened of all river systems because water resource developments typically dampen their most distinctive characteristics-extreme flow variability and 'boom and bust' ecological dynamics. This article shows how one of the world's most variable arid-zone river systems-Cooper Creek in Australia's Lake Eyre Basin-functions and how it supports its unique fish assemblage and productive fisheries. The ecological roles of drought refugia, channel flows and flooding are reviewed in relation to fish persistence and losses, life history strategies, movement potential, food web processes and production levels. Comparisons are drawn with other floodplain rivers and fisheries to draw out common understandings and universal principles for conservation and management of arid-zone rivers and their fish resources. Ecological implications of hydrologic alterations and land-based activities are presented to highlight the importance of maintaining the hydrologic, geomorphic, sedimentary and biogeochemical processes of arid-zone river systems. Preservation or restoration of natural flow intermittency, sequential flood pulses, complex habitat mosaics, connectivity and identification of the environmental flow requirements for highly valued species and processes are key scientific principles for the management of arid-zone floodplain rivers.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has an important role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, among the different HGT mechanisms, the capacity of environmental bacteria to acquire naked exogenous DNA by natural competence is still poorly investigated. This study aimed to characterize the ability of the environmentalEscherichia colistrain ED1, isolated from the crustaceanDaphniasp., to acquire exogenous DNA by natural competence. Transformation experiments were carried out varying different parameters, i.e., cell growth phase, amount of exogenous DNA and exposition to artificial lake water (ALW) and treated wastewater to mimic environmental-like conditions that may be encountered in the agri-food system. Results were compared with those showed by the laboratoryE. colistrain DH5 alpha. Our experimental data, supported by genomic sequencing, showed that, when exposed to pure water, ED1 strain was able to acquire exogenous DNA with frequencies (10(-8)-10(-9)) statistically higher than the ones observed for DH5 alpha strain (10(-10)). Interestingly, higher values were retrieved for ED1 than DH5 alpha strains exposed to ALW (10(-7)vs. 10(-9), respectively) or treated wastewater (10(-8)vs. 10(-10), respectively). We tested, therefore, ED1 strain ability to colonize the rhizosphere of lettuce, a model plant representative of raw-consumed vegetables of high economic importance in the ready-to-eat food industry. Results showed that ED1 strain was able to efficiently colonize lettuce rhizosphere, revealing a stable colonization for 14 days-long period. In conclusion, ED1 strain ability to acquire exogenous DNA in environmental-like conditions by natural competence, combined with its ability to efficiently and stably colonize plant rhizosphere, poses the attention to food and human safety showing a possible route of diffusion of antibiotic resistance in the agri-food system, sustaining the "One Health" warnings related to the antibiotic spread.

Identifying the degrading factors of the water environment and predicting the trend of eutrophication are key to restore the habitat. Through trophic level index (TLI), water quality index (WQI), modified Nemerow pollution index (NPI), and the Random Forest (RF) model, water samples collected from various estuaries of Taihu Lake from 2017 to 2019 were evaluated. To predict the water quality development, four scenarios were set viz. S1: add or remove an ecological buffer, S2: increase or reduce the external nutrients, S3: open or close the dam/gate, and S4: increase or decrease the internal release. In Wuli Lake, the nutrient concentrations in the river regions were higher than in the lake regions, while a contrary trend was observed in Gonghu Bay. The estuarine water quality in the dry season (WQI = 40.91, NPI = 1.73) was merely worse than that in the wet season (WQI = 47.27, NPI = 1.67). On the other hand, the eutrophic status in the wet season (TLIWet = 57.93) was worse than that in the dry season (TLIDry = 57.23). The estuarine water quality of Taihu Lake has improved from 2017 to 2019 but still belongs to medium level. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that dam construction, land use types, unstable hydrodynamic conditions, and trumpet-shaped estuary were the main factors that aggravated the water quality degradation. The RF model has strong forecasting capabilities for estuarine water quality. When the estuaries are close to residential and industrial districts, controlling the surface runoff and improving sewage treatment efficiency are the most effective measures to improve the water quality. In the estuaries, the sediments are usually disturbed by the wind-waves. Conclusively, reducing sediment disturbance and internal contamination accumulation via biological and engineering measures is the key to estuarine restoration.

On the variability of the Priestley-Taylor coefficient over water bodies	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Deviations in the Priestley-Taylor (PT) coefficient alpha(PT) from its accepted 1.26 value are analyzed over large lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands where stomatal or soil controls are minimal or absent. The data sets feature wide variations in water body sizes and climatic conditions. Neither surface temperature nor sensible heat flux variations alone, which proved successful in characterizing alpha(PT) variations over some crops, explain measured deviations in alpha(PT) over water. It is shown that the relative transport efficiency of turbulent heat and water vapor is key to explaining variations in alpha(PT) over water surfaces, thereby offering a new perspective over the concept of minimal advection or entrainment introduced by PT. Methods that allow the determination of alpha(PT) based on low-frequency sampling (i.e., 0.1 Hz) are then developed and tested, which are usable with standard meteorological sensors that filter some but not all turbulent fluctuations. Using approximations to the Gram determinant inequality, the relative transport efficiency is derived as a function of the correlation coefficient between temperature and water vapor concentration fluctuations (R-Tq). The proposed approach reasonably explains the measured deviations from the conventional alpha(PT) = 1.26 value even when R-Tq is determined from air temperature and water vapor concentration time series that are Gaussian-filtered and subsampled to a cutoff frequency of 0.1 Hz. Because over water bodies, R-Tq deviations from unity are often associated with advection and/or entrainment, linkages between alpha(PT) and R-Tq offer both a diagnostic approach to assess their significance and a prognostic approach to correct the 1.26 value when using routine meteorological measurements of temperature and humidity.					; Cohen, Shabtai/ABC-4120-2020; Bou-Zeid, Elie/A-9796-2008; Katul, Gabriel/A-7210-2008; Li, Dan/G-5794-2015; Parlange, Marc/A-3403-2015	Cohen, Shabtai/0000-0002-3644-467X; Bou-Zeid, Elie/0000-0002-6137-8109; Katul, Gabriel/0000-0001-9768-3693; Li, Dan/0000-0001-5978-5381; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				JAN	2016	52	1					150	163		10.1002/2015WR017504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015WR017504													WOS:000373117800010

This field plot study investigated effects of rainfall regimes and P applications on P loss by surface runoff from rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping systems in Lake Taihu region, China. The study was conducted on two types of paddy soils (Hydromorphic at Anzhen site, Wuxi City, and Degleyed at Xinzhuang site, Changshu City, Jiangsu Province) with different P status, and it covered 3 years with low, high and normal rainfall regimes. Four rates of mineral P fertilizer, i.e., no P (control), 30 kg P ha(-1) for rice and 20 kg P ha(-1) for wheat (P30+20), 75 plus 40 (P75+40), and 150 plus 80 (P150+80), were applied as treatments. Runoff water from individual plots and runoff events was recorded and analyzed for total P and dissolved reactive P concentrations. Losses of total P and dissolved reactive P significantly increased with rainfall depth and P rates (P<0.0001). Annual total P losses ranged from 0.36-0.92 kg ha(-1) in control to 1.13-4.67 kg ha(-1) in P150+80 at Anzhen, and correspondingly from 0.36-0.48 kg ha(-1) to 1.26-1.88 kg ha(-1) at Xinzhuang, with 16-49% of total P as dissolved reactive P. In particular, large amounts of P were lost during heavy rainfall events that occurred shortly after P applications at Anzhen. On average of all P treatments, rice growing season constituted 37-86% of annual total P loss at Anzhen and 28-44% of that at Xinzhuang. In both crop seasons, P concentrations peaked in the first runoff events and decreased with time. During rice growing season, runoff P concentrations positively correlated (P<0.0001) with P concentrations in field ponding water that was intentionally enclosed by construction of field bund. The relative high P loss during wheat growing season at Xinzhuang was due to high soil P status. In conclusion, P should be applied at rates balancing crop removal (20-30 kg P ha(-1) in this study) and at time excluding heavy rains. Moreover, irrigation and drainage water should be appropriately managed to reduce runoff P losses from rice-wheat cropping systems.					张, 泽宇/GLR-6359-2022; Liu, Jian/NWH-2584-2025; Liu, Hongbin/U-1853-2019; Liu, Jian/P-4050-2014; Luo, Chunyan/JUF-6625-2023	Liu, Jian/0000-0003-4199-1296; 													2095-3119						2016	15	3					667	677		10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61087-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61087-5													WOS:000372479100020

Social Environment Has a Primary Influence on the Microbial and Odor Profiles of a Chemically Signaling Songbird	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Chemical signaling is an underappreciated means of communication among birds, as may be the potential contributions of symbiotic microbes to animal chemical communication in general. The dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) produces and detects volatile compounds that may be important in reproductive behavior. These compounds are found in preen oil secreted by the uropygial gland, and this gland supports diverse bacterial communities including genera known to produce some of these volatile compounds. We investigated the relative contributions of shared environments and genetic relatedness in shaping juncos' symbiotic bacterial communities, and investigated whether these bacterial communities underlie juncos" chemical signaling behavior. We sampled parents and nestlings at 9 junco nests during one breeding season at Mountain Lake Biological Station in Virginia, USA. From each individual, we collected swabs of the uropygial gland and the cloaca, preen oil, and a small blood sample for paternity testing. We characterized junco bacterial communities through 16S rRNA gene surveys and preen oil volatile compounds via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Nest membership and age class had the strongest influence on the structure of bacterial and volatile profiles. We compared father-offspring similarity based on paternity, and nestling similarity in nests containing full siblings and half siblings, and found that relatedness did not noticeably affect bacterial or volatile profiles. While we cannot rule out an influence of genetic relatedness on these profiles, it is clear that shared environments are more influential in shaping bacterial and volatile profiles among juncos. We did not find significant covariation between individual bacterial and volatile profiles. Possible explanations for this result include: (1) bacteria do not underlie volatile production; (2) ample redundancy in volatile production among bacterial types obscures covariation; or (3) the relationship is confounded by the fact that, unlike glands exclusively dedicated to chemical communication, uropygial glands have multiple functions, and symbiotic bacteria are hypothesized to contribute to each of these. Therefore, different bacteria may contribute to different phenotypes of the avian holobiont. Future work will include cultivation, metabolomic, genomic, and behavioral assay approaches to tease these scenarios apart.

Titan's lakes predominantly contain liquid methane, ethane, and nitrogen, with methane evaporation driving its hydrological cycle. Molecular interactions between these three species lead to nonideal behavior that causes Titan's lakes to behave differently than Earth's lakes. Here, we numerically investigate how methane evaporation and nonideal interactions affect the physical properties, structure, dynamics, and evolution of shallow lakes on Titan. We find that, under certain temperature regimes, methane-rich mixtures are denser than relatively ethane-rich mixtures. This allows methane evaporation to stratify Titan's lakes into ethane-rich upper layers and methane-rich lower layers, separated by a strong compositional gradient. At temperatures above 86 K, lakes remain well mixed and unstratified. Between 84 and 86 K, lakes can stratify episodically. Below 84 K, lakes permanently stratify and develop very methane-depleted epilimnia. Despite small seasonal and diurnal deviations (<5 K) from typical surface temperatures, Titan's rain-filled ephemeral lakes and "phantom lakes" may nevertheless experience significantly larger temperature fluctuations, resulting in polymictic or even meromictic stratification, which may trigger ethane ice precipitation.

Nutritionally valuable algae for zooplankton are rich in essential biomolecules such as amino acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), sterols, and phosphorus. We performed laboratory experiments and showed a stronger positive relationship between zooplankton (Daphnia) cumulative offspring number and availability of high-quality algae (Cryptophytes: Rhodomonas/Cryptomonas; and Chrysophytes: Mallomonas) than with intermediate-quality (Chlorophytes: Acutodesmus) or poor-quality (Dinoflagellates: Peridinium) algae. The higher cumulative offspring number of Daphnia was a result of higher amounts of total omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, proteins, sterols, and amino acids in the algal diets. The experiments also showed that even a small addition of high-quality algae (Rhodomonas) to intermediate-quality (Acutodesmus) or low-quality (bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, or terrestrial organic matter) diets can enhance the Daphnia cumulative offspring production. Our carbon mass balance calculation for a eutrophic clearwater lake and an oligotrophic polyhumic lake showed that the abundance of high-quality phytoplankton (cryptophytes, chrysophytes, diatoms) among total particulate organic carbon was minor (8.7% [SD 2.4%] and 6.5% [7.0%]). We modeled Daphnia diets (i.e., resource assimilation) using a fatty acid mixing model. Our analyses showed that Daphnia were able to locate high-quality algae (cryptophytes, chrysophytes, and diatoms) more effectively during cyanobacteria blooms in a eutrophic lake (55% [SD 12%]) than in a polyhumic lake (25% [10%]). Nevertheless, our results show that intense eutrophication and browning diminish assimilation of high quality algae, limiting Daphnia biomass production.					; Aalto, Sanni/AAY-5338-2021; Kuoppamaki, Kirsi/E-8699-2015; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020	Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337; Aalto, Sanni L/0000-0002-6724-2632; Galloway, Aaron/0000-0001-7826-299X; Peltomaa, Elina/0000-0002-2858-8358; Kuoppamaki, Kirsi/0000-0002-6703-4024; 													2044-2041	2044-205X				JUL 3	2019	9	3					374	394		10.1080/20442041.2019.1574177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2019.1574177													WOS:000490984200011
J	Purdie, H				Purdie, Heather			Glacier Retreat and Tourism: Insights from New Zealand	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Glacier tourism, a multimillion-dollar industry in New Zealand, is potentially under threat by ongoing glacial retreat. Surface morphology changes associated with retreat and thinning result in increasingly difficult access for guided walks on the Franz Josef Glacier, but simultaneously, an enlarging proglacial lake is increasing tourism opportunities at Tasman Glacier. Steepening ice slopes, increased debris cover, and an increase in the rockfall hazard are just some of the challenges glacier tourism operators face as glaciers around the world retreat. To date in New Zealand, glacier tourism has kept pace with ongoing glaciological change, often by increasing mechanized access. Focusing scientific research on short-term process studies-for example, determining thinning rates and assessing hazards-will help tour operators and policy-makers make decisions about future glacier utilization and accessibility.

Russell; Sousa-Figueiredo, Jose C.; Rollinson, David			Praziquantel treatment of school children from single and mixed infection foci of intestinal and urogenital schistosomiasis along the Senegal River Basin: monitoring treatment success and re-infection patterns	ACTA TROPICA												Following major water development schemes in the 1980s, schistosomiasis has become a serious parasitic disease of children living in the Senegal River Basin. Both urogenital (Schistosoma haematobium) and intestinal (Schistosoma mansoni) schistosomiasis can be highly prevalent in school-aged children, with many individuals infected with both parasites. In order to investigate the transmission and reinfection dynamics of both parasite species, single and mixed infection foci at three villages (Nder and Temeye; S. mansoni and S. haematobium foci and Guia; S. haematobium focus) were studied. In each focus infected children were identified and selected for a 12-month study involving two treatments with praziquantel (40 mg/kg) three weeks apart at the beginning of the study and again 6 months into the study. Urine and stool samples were examined for schistosome eggs before and at 6 weeks and 6 months after chemotherapy. Prevalence and intensity of infection were recorded for each child at each time point. Before treatment, in all three villages, the prevalence and intensity of infection was extremely high for both S. mansoni (79-100%) and S. haematobium (81-97%). With the first round of chemotherapy sufficient cure rates (CRs) of both species were achieved in all villages (38-96%) with high egg reduction rates (ERRs) (97-99%). The data show that high and rapid re-infection rates occur, especially for S. mansoni, within a six-month period following treatment. Re-infection must be highly linked to ecological and seasonal factors. The persistence of S. mansoni in Nder could raise concern as levels of infection intensity remain high (geometric mean intensity at baseline 653 epg changed to 705 epg at 12 months) after four rounds of chemotherapy. This phenomenon could be explained by extremely rapid re-infection dynamics or a sub-optimal efficacy of praziquantel against S. mansoni in this village. High intensities in mixed infections may influence disease epidemiology and control warranting further studies. The disease situation in the SRB must be monitored closely and new treatment regimes should be designed and implemented to control schistosomiasis in the school-age population. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using a 16-year time-series dataset, we tested the hypothesis that seasonal variation would explain most of the gamma diversity of these plankton communities. We also investigated the environmental and temporal factors responsible for the variations in composition and species turnover. The scale related to dry and rainy seasons explained a considerable percentage of the gamma diversity and variation partitioning, showed that compositional changes occurred mainly over broader temporal scales. Environmental factors varying among seasons and ENSO events explained changes in composition, although some communities did not respond to the environment. Our results suggest that niche and stochastic processes operating at temporal scales correlated with ENSO climate events contributed to changes in species composition. Hence, climate anomalies might be important to maintain diversity in areas with reduced or loss of the natural variations in environmental conditions. Our results also suggest that, although communities show similar patterns of variation in composition, they might respond in a different degree to environmental and temporal factors. Thus, while niche-associated (environment) and stochastic (time) processes drove the phytoplankton, stochastic processes were more important for zooplankton, whereas neither were important for ciliates.					; Velho, Luiz Felipe/I-9130-2016; pineda, Alfonso/ABD-5294-2021; Rodrigues, Luzia/B-7856-2017; Velho, Luiz Felipe Machado/I-9130-2016; Bonecker, Claudia/D-5946-2013; Dias, Juliana/B-3184-2013; Segovia, Bianca/M-9119-2016; Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide/B-7856-2017	Trevizan Segovia da Silva, Bianca/0000-0002-7667-6344; Velho, Luiz Felipe Machado/0000-0001-8111-4955; Bonecker, Claudia/0000-0003-4338-9012; Pineda, Alfonso/0000-0001-6902-9993; Dias, Juliana/0000-0003-2881-3751; Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide/0000-0002-0593-0931; Pelaez, Oscar/0000-0002-7584-0376													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2019	81	3							49	10.1007/s00027-019-0646-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-019-0646-z													WOS:000466112900001

The concept of aerial rivers is proposed as a framework: it is an analogy between the main pathways of moisture flow in the atmosphere and surface rivers. Opposite to surface rivers, aerial rivers gain (lose) water through evaporation (precipitation). The magnitude of the vertically integrated moisture transport is discharge, and precipitable water is like the mass of the liquid column-multiplied by an equivalent speed it gives discharge. Trade wind flow into Amazonia, and the north/northwesterly flow to the subtropics, east of the Andes, are aerial rivers. Aerial lakes are the sections of a moisture pathway where the flow slows down and broadens, because of diffluence, and becomes deeper, with higher precipitable water. This is the case over Amazonia, downstream of the trade wind confluence. In the dry season, moisture from the aerial lake is transported northeastward, but weaker flow over southern Amazonia heads southward toward the subtropics. Southern Amazonia appears as a source of moisture to this flow. Aerial river discharge to the subtropics is comparable to that of the Amazon River. The variations of the amount of moisture coming from Amazonia have an important effect over the variability of discharge. Correlations between the flow from Amazonia and subtropical rainfall are not strong. However, some months within the set of dry seasons observed showed a strong increase (decrease) occurring together with an important increase (decrease) in subtropical rainfall.

During the dry season, significant non-point source loads of total phosphorus originated from residences unconnected to sewers were identified along the channel, resulting in an increasing flow rate of untreated sewage towards the reservoir. During the rainy season, as a consequence of dilution, phosphorus concentrations decreased by about 5-fold. The results also revealed that the reservoir was acting similarly to a waste stabilization pond, with phosphorus removal efficiency of about 33%. Assuming one-dimensional flow for the channel and complete mixing for the reservoir, it was possible to adjust phosphorus decay coefficients of k(c) = 2.2 day(-1) and k(r) = 22.8 year(-1) respectively, which were higher than their corresponding values available in the literature. This was attributed mainly to the relatively high temperatures and shallow water depths. The results also revealed an inverse dependence of k(c) and k(r) on water and wind velocity, with potential thresholds of respectively 0.3 and 5.0 m/s for resuspension of bed sediments and internal phosphorus loading.

Spatial and Temporal Variation in Paralytic Shellfish Toxin Production by Benthic Microseira (Lyngbya) wollei in a Freshwater New York Lake	TOXINS												Butterfield Lake is a mesotrophic lake in New York State where residents and pets have experienced unexplained health issues. Microseira wollei (basionym Lyngbya wollei) was found at two of 15 sites in Butterfield Lake and analyzed for microcystins, anatoxins, cylindrospermopsins, and paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs). Only PSTs and trace levels of anatoxin-a were detected in these samples. This is the first published report of PSTs within a New York State lake. To evaluate the environmental and temporal drivers leading to the observed toxicity, PST content at the two sites was examined in detail. There were distinct differences in the total PST content, filament nutrient, filament chlorophyll, and relationship to environmental drivers between the sites, as well as distinct differences in the total PST content measured using different analytical techniques. A multivariate model containing site, temperature, and filament chlorophyll explained 85% of the variation in PSTs observed over the growing season. This work emphasizes the importance of proper site selection and choice of analytical technique in the development of monitoring programs to protect lake users from the occurrence of benthic cyanobacteria toxins.					; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008	Wei, Bofan/0009-0002-8746-1266; Boyer, Gregory/0000-0003-4490-5461; Smith, Zacharias/0000-0002-6347-9325; Martin, Robbie/0000-0001-5284-7156; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077														2072-6651				JAN	2019	11	1							44	10.3390/toxins11010044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins11010044								30650549					WOS:000459733500043
J	Grochowska, J				Grochowska, Jolanta			Assessment of Water Buffer Capacity of Two Morphometrically Different, Degraded, Urban Lakes	WATER												The research was conducted in Karczemne Lake (area, 40.4 ha; maximum (max.) depth, 3.2 m) and Klasztorne Mae Lake (area, 13.7 ha; max. depth, 20.0 m) located in the Kashubian Lake District (Northern Poland). From the beginning of the 1950s, these reservoirs have received municipal and storm wastewater. The long-term process of lake contamination has shaped the specific buffer capacity conditions and influenced the circulation of carbonate and bicarbonate in the water of these ecosystems. Extremely high concentrations of nutrients (Karczemne Lake: max. total phosphorous (TP) level, 7.5 mg P L-1; max. total nitrogen (TN) level, 5.6 mg N L-1; Klasztorne Mae Lake: max. TP level, 20.6 mg P L-1; max. TN level, 43.3 mg N L-1) have caused very intensive primary production processes (Karczemne Lake: max. chlorophyll-a level, 193.40 mu g m(-3); max.

In the polymictic Karczemne Lake, the pH value of all water columns exceeded 10.0 (max. pH, 10.41), and in the meromictic Klasztorne Mae Lake, the pH of the surface water layers oscillated around 9.5. In the polymictic Karczemne Lake, despite intensive photosynthesis, the calcium content and alkalinity were similar throughout the whole water column due to constant circulation. In the meromictic Klasztorne Mae Lake, during the growing season, a decrease in calcium concentration and alkalinity of the surface water layers and an increase in calcium concentration at the bottom were noted.

Understanding the microbial community assembly processes and niche characteristics in freshwater ecosystems, which are poorly understood, is crucial for evaluating microbial ecological roles. The Yunnan Plateau lakes in China represent a freshwater ecosystem that is experiencing eutrophication due to anthropogenic activities. Here, variation in the assembly and niche characteristics of both prokaryotic and microeukaryotic communities was explored in Yunnan Plateau lakes across two seasons (dry season and rainy season) to determine the impacts of rainfall and environmental conditions on the microbial community and niche. The results showed that the environmental heterogeneity of the lakes decreased in the rainy season compared to the dry season. The microbial (bacterial and microeukaryotic) alpha-diversity significantly decreased during the rainy season. Deterministic processes were found to dominate microbial community assembly in both seasons. beta-Diversity decomposition analysis revealed that microbial community compositional dissimilarities were dominated by species replacement processes. The co-occurrence networks indicated reduced species complexity for microbes and a destabilized network for prokaryotes prior to rainfall, while the opposite was found for microeukaryotes following rainfall. Microbial niche breadth decreased significantly in the rainy season. In addition, lower prokaryotic niche overlap, but greater microeukaryotic niche overlap, was observed after rainfall. Rainfall and environmental conditions significantly affected the microbial community assembly and niche characteristics. It can be concluded that rainfall and external pollutant input during the seasonal transition alter the lake environment, thereby regulating the microbial community and niche in these lakes. Our findings offer new insight into microbiota assembly and niche patterns in plateau lakes, further deepening the understanding of freshwater ecosystem functioning.

This study evaluated the effects of a macrophyte (Elodea nuttallii) and immobilized nitrogen cycling bacteria (INCB) on ANAMMOX and denitrification in an inflow river in the Taihu Lake region in China. The results demonstrated that the potential ANAMMOX and denitrification rates varied among the four treatments, with the highest mean rates (0.413 +/- 0.029 mu mol N-2 cm(-3) h(-1) and 0.656 +/- 0.038 mu mol N-2 cm(-3) h(-1)) occurring in the treatments with Elodea nuttallii and INCB added. The abundances of ANAMMOX and denitrification bacteria in the sediments with Elodea nuttallii and INCB added were also the highest among the four different treatment groups. In addition, the primary ANAMMOX bacterial genus (C. Kuenenia) and the main denitrification bacterial genera (Achromobacter sp. and Thauera) detected in the sediments benefited from the addition of Elodea nuttallii and INCB. Our results confirmed that the Elodea nuttallii-INCB assemblage could significantly increase the benthic N removal by enhancing the ANAMMOX and denitrification processes. Moreover, the total N2O emission was highest in the sediment with Elodea nuttallii and INCB added, which may be a potential environmental risk to the atmosphere. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the other threats, climate change has received limited consideration and reducing its risks requires appropriate adaptation strategies. This study used quantitative and qualitative methods to generate knowledge on fishers' perceptions of climate change, changes in climate variables and their impacts on livelihoods, adaptation strategies, constraints to adaptation and required interventions to promote adaptation strategies that would enable fishers to build resilience to sustain their livelihoods. We found that fishers were aware of changes in climate conditions manifested by unpredictable seasons, floods and droughts. Fishing remained the main livelihood activity. However, the dominance of fishes had changed from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) to the African catfish (Clarias gariepinus Burchell). Floods and droughts were associated with damage to gears, boats, landing sites and changes in fish catches and sizes, income from fishing and fish consumption. The fishers adapted by increasing time on fishing grounds and changing target species and fishing gear among other things. Some innovative fishers diversified to high-value crops and livestock. This increased their income beyond what was solely earned from fishing which provided an incentive for some of them to quit fishing. Livelihood diversification was enhanced by use of communications technology, membership of social groups, increasing fishing days and fishing experience. Adaptation was, however, constrained by limited credit, awareness and access to land, which require interventions such as improving access to credit, irrigation facilities, appropriate planting materials and awareness raising. We identified adaptation strategies, which if promoted and their constraints addressed, could increase resilience of fishers to the influence of climate change and sustain their livelihoods.

Oxygen isotope records of Holocene climate variability in the Pacific Northwest	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Oxygen isotope (delta O-18) measurements of authigenic carbonate from Cleland Lake (southeastern British Columbia), Paradise Lake (central British Columbia), and Lime Lake (eastern Washington) provide a similar to 9000 year Holocene record of precipitation-evaporation balance variations in the Pacific Northwest. Both Cleland Lake and Paradise Lake are small, surficially closed-basin systems with no active inflows or outflows. Lime Lake is surficially open with a seasonally active overflow. Water isotope values from Cleland and Paradise plot along the local evaporation line, indicating that precipitation-evaporation balance is a strong influence on lake hydrology. In contrast, Lime Lake water isotope values plot on the local meteoric water line, signifying minimal influence by evaporation. To infer past hydrologic balance variations at a high temporal resolution, we sampled the Cleland, Paradise, and Lime Lake sediment cores at 1-60 mm intervals (inverted iota 3-33 years per sample on average) and measured the isotopic composition of fine-grained (<63 mu m) authigenic CaCO3 in each sample. Negative 8180 values, which indicate wetter conditions in closed-basin lakes, occur in Cleland Lake sediment from 7600 to 2200 years before present (yr BP), and are followed by more positive delta O-18 values, which suggest drier conditions, after 2200 yr BP. Highly negative delta O-18 values in the Cleland lake record centered on similar to 2400 yr BP suggest that lake levels were high (and that the lake may have been overflowing) at this time as a result of a substantially wetter climate. Similarly, Paradise Lake sediment 8180 values are relatively low from 7600 to 4000 yr BP and increase from similar to 4000 to 3000 yr BP and from similar to 2000 yr BP to present, indicating that climate became drier from the middle through the late Holocene. The delta O-18 record from Lime Lake, which principally reflects changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation, exhibits less variability than the closed-basin lake records and follows a generally increasing trend from the mid-Holocene to present. These results are consistent with several proximal reconstructions of changes in lake-level, precipitation amount, and precipitation isotopic composition and may also reflect the establishment of modern El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability in the late Holocene, as inferred from proxy evidence of synoptic ocean-atmosphere changes in the Pacific basin. Results from mid-Holocene (6000 yr BP) climate model simulations conducted as part of the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (PMIP3) indicate that in much of western North America, the cold season (October March) was wetter and the warm season (April September) was considerably drier relative to the late Holocene, leading to an overall drier climate in western North America with enhanced hydroclimatic seasonality. This is consistent with inferences from the Cleland and Paradise delta O-18 records, which lake modeling experiments indicate are strongly influenced by cold season precipitation-evaporation balance. This also explains apparent inconsistencies between the lake delta O-18 records and other proxies of hydroclimatic change from the greater Pacific Northwest region that are less sensitive to cold season climate and thus indicate relatively drier conditions during the mid-Holocene. The abrupt negative excursion at similar to 2400 yr BP in the Cleland Lake delta O-18 data, as well as the marked shift to more positive values after this time, demonstrate that gradual changes in ocean-atmosphere dynamics can produce abrupt, non-linear hydroclimate responses in the interior regions of western North America.

Two humic-like (C1 and C2) and protein-like (C3 and C4) components were identified using PARAFAC. The average fluorescence intensity of the four components differed under seasonal variation from June and August 2013 to February and April 2014. Components 1 and 2 exhibited a strong linear correlation (R-2 = 0.628). Significantly positive linear relationships between CDOM absorption coefficients a (254) (R-2 = 0.72, 0.46, p < 0.01), a (280) (R-2 = 0.77, 0.47, p < 0.01), a (350) (R-2 = 0.76, 0.78, p < 0.01) and F-max for two humic-like components (C1 and C2) were exhibited, respectively. A significant relationship (R-2 = 0.930) was found between salinity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). However, almost no obvious correlation was found between salinity and EEM-PARAFAC-extracted components except for C3 (R-2 = 0.469). Results from this investigation demonstrate that the EEM-PARAFAC technique can be used to evaluate the seasonal dynamics of CDOM fluorescent components for inland waters in the semiarid regions of Northeast China, and to quantify CDOM components for other waters with similar environmental conditions.

In this study, we investigated the seasonal changes of C, N and P concentrations, accumulation, partitioning, and C:N:P stoichiometric ratios in different plant tissues (root, stem-leaf, and panicle) of late-season rice under two irrigation regimes (continuous flooding, CF; alternate wetting and drying, AWD) and four N managements (control, N0; conventional urea at 240 kg N ha(-1), UREA; controlled-release bulk blending fertilizer at 240 kg N ha(-1), BBF; polymer-coated urea at 240 kg N ha 21, PCU). We found that water and N treatments had remarkable effects on the measured parameters in different plant tissues after transplanting, but the water and N interactions had insignificant effects. Tissue C:N, N:P and C:P ratios ranged from 14.6 to 52.1, 3.1 to 7.8, and 76.9 to 254.3 over the rice growing seasons, respectively. The root and stem-leaf C:N:P and panicle C:N ratios showed overall uptrends with a peak at harvest whereas the panicle N:P and C:P ratios decreased from filling to harvest. The AWD treatment did not affect the concentrations and accumulation of tissue C and N, but greatly decreased those of P, resulting in enhanced N:P and C:P ratios. N fertilization significantly increased tissue N concentration, slightly enhanced tissue P concentration, but did not affect tissue C concentration, leading to a significant increase in tissue N:P ratio but a decrease in C:N and C:P ratios. Our results suggested that the growth of rice in the Taihu Lake region was co-limited by N and P. These findings broadened our understanding of the responses of plant C:N:P stoichiometry to simultaneous water and N managements in subtropical high-yielding rice systems.					ye, yushi/HJI-4098-2023; Li, Liang/H-6189-2017														1932-6203					JUL 3	2014	9	7							e101776	10.1371/journal.pone.0101776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101776								24992006					WOS:000341253400115

The pollen assemblage dominated by local herb and shrub pollen can reflect mountain shrub steppe vegetation. Herb pollen behave differently from tree and shrub pollen, including their responses to temperature, humidity, and wind speed, the distribution in wind direction and the optimum climate range. Herb pollen are mainly influenced by temperature and humidity, but wind direction and wind speed are more important to tree and shrub pollen. The flowering phenology can be reflected by annual and seasonal pollen variations, which are influenced by temperature and precipitation. Arboreal pollen (AP) represent long-distance transported types during the westerly period and nonarboreal pollen (NAP) locally dominate in the monsoon season; thus, the AP/NAP ratio could be an indicator of atmospheric circulation, vegetation and climate change in the semiarid Tibetan Plateau (TP). Airborne pollen, as a record of biological and climatic events, provides insights into vegetation response to climate change and has significance for interpreting fossil pollen records on the TP.					; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022	Uhl, Dieter/0000-0002-9938-5339; PAUDAYAL, Khum N./0000-0002-5252-1153; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748													2169-897X	2169-8996				DEC 27	2020	125	24							e2020JD033405	10.1029/2020JD033405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JD033405													WOS:000603630400006

Review of a species in peril: what we do not know about lake sturgeon may kill them	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Lake sturgeon are arguably the largest and most unique freshwater fish in North America. Unfortunately their uniqueness includes many characteristics that make them especially vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts including overfishing, habitat fragmentation, and degradation. For approximately 100 years lake sturgeon populations across North America have either been in decline and (or) have experienced a sluggish recovery. While this is partly due to lake sturgeon life history, most researchers agree that habitat fragmentation and degradation are currently the highest risk to the species. Though most lake sturgeon populations are depressed, there are a few exceptions that offer a glimpse into what a stable population or recovery may look like. The following review highlights such instances as well as what is known and more importantly what is not known about this unique species. Specifically, we highlight the need for improved and organized sharing of raw data given the fact that many researchers do not have access to the plethora of information available to others (e. g., otoliths for aging). We examine the varying life history and diet choices of this plastic species offering hypotheses for differences in migration routes and distances as well the differing recovery rates found across their range. We highlight myths about the species providing evidence that they may not be as long lived and fecund as previously thought. We examine the lake sturgeon's current legal status across North America including the efforts of nonprofit groups that have had success in increasing population numbers. Most importantly, we highlight logistical problems faced by researchers and data gaps in the literature that must be filled to increase the odds of a successful recovery. Alongside the data gaps, the recovery of this species is fraught with political and industrial road blocks that are as varied as its current recovery. Subsequently, as is the case with many species, its survival will come down to solid scientific knowledge and the value placed on it by society.					; Kreitals, Natasha/L-8843-2013; Phillips, Iain/L-3116-2019	Phillips, Iain/0000-0003-0955-3771; 													1208-6053	1181-8700				MAR	2015	23	1					30	43		10.1139/er-2014-0037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/er-2014-0037													WOS:000350678700004

The spatio-temporal variations of physicochemical parameters have been assessed, and it was found that parameters such as pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, iron, fluoride and coliform concentrations in the water exceeded the permissible limits prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) during both pre-monsoon (PM) and post-monsoon (PoM) seasons. The water hardness lies within the soft category, except for a few samples found to be moderately hard. WQI values of lake water ranged between 38.19 and 155.47 during PM and 39.48 and 432.26 during PoM. Based on the WQI classification during PM, 8.6% of the samples were in the unsuitable category, 14.3% very poor, 45.7% poor and 31.4% in the good category. During PoM, 22.9% of the samples were in the unsuitable category, 25.7% very poor, 31.4% poor and 20% in the good category. The irrigation water quality was evaluated using indices such as sodium percentage, sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, permeability index and Kelly's ratio, and the results indicated that the lake water could be used safely for agricultural purposes. The trophic state evaluation revealed an oligotrophic condition of the lake waters during PM (TSI 37.9) and a mesotrophic condition during PoM (TSI 46.9).					; Gyanendra, Yumnam/B-8867-2019; YUMNAM, GYANENDRA/B-8867-2019; Laishram, Ranu/JDM-5106-2023	Laishram, Ranu/0000-0001-8521-6211; Gyanendra, Yumnam/0000-0002-4992-1789; Alam, Wazir/0000-0002-6043-7795; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2022	194	9							659	10.1007/s10661-022-10336-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10336-w								35943636					WOS:000838114200002

Spectral data and derived indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have been used for hydrological monitoring of large wetlands. However, comparable studies for small wetlands (< 25 km(2)) are lacking. Our aims are to examine whether MODIS-derived indices at 500-m spatial resolution can perform this task for small wetlands, and to compare the performance of various indices. First we evaluated if water levels are a good indicator for wetland inundation extent. A high correlation between water level and Landsat-derived inundation extent was found (R (2) = 0.957). Secondly, we compared 10 years of water level fluctuations with seven spectral indices at a 16-day interval. The Tasseled Cap brightness index (TCBI) had the highest correlation with water level for the complete time series including dry and wet years. Thirdly, we analyzed how these indices behave for areas with different inundation characteristics. Again TCBI showed a consistently accurate performance, which was independent of inundation frequency. We therefore conclude that TCBI is the best-suited index for monitoring of hydrological variability in small seasonally-flooded wetlands such as the Fuente de Piedra lake in southern Spain. We recommend testing this index further for other seasonally-flooded wetlands in semi-arid areas.

Battle in the Amazon: Arapaima versus Piranha	ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS												The scales of the Arapaimas, a large freshwater fish (up to 200?kg), are a superb example of a natural material that has evolved to provide protection against predators. The Arapaimas lives primarily in Amazon basin lakes that become infested with piranhas as the dry season advances and is covered with scales having up to 10?cm length. They have a collagen interior with a highly mineralized external layer. The collagen fibers form a cross-lamellar arrangement which produces a laminate composite. The internal collagenous layer provides the flexibility to the scales, which can undergo significant elastic deformation prior to failure, providing considerable toughness. The mineralized exterior provides the required protection against predation. The flexibility of the biomineral is enabled by two factors: (i) a corrugated configuration in which the tensile strains are minimized; (ii) a graded composition. We propose herein that the structure of the scales, a composite consisting of a mineralized external layer with surface corrugations and an internal flexible collagenous foundation, can serve as inspiration for the design of flexible composites having a hard ceramic surface. The piranha (Serrasalminae) is one of the principal predators in seasonal lakes, in which fish get trapped. Its teeth form triangular arrays creating a guillotine action that is highly effective in slicing through muscle. The bite force is calculated for a piranha with a mass of 1?kg from estimated maximum force values applied by three muscle groups connecting the jaw to the mandible: it is 20?N. Mechanical tests on the scales and teeth demonstrate that the cutting and puncturing ability of the piranha teeth cannot penetrate the Arapaimas scales.

Submerged macrophytes usually play a key role in shallow lakes and can maintain a stable clear state. It is extremely important to study the effects of climate warming and eutrophication on the growth of submerged macrophytes in shallow lakes. However, the responses of submerged macrophytes to climate warming and eutrophication are still controversial. Additionally, the understanding of the main pathways impacting submerged macrophytes remains to be clarified. In addition, the influence of seasonality on the growth responses of submerged macrophytes to climate warming and eutrophication requires further elucidation. In this study, we conducted a series of mesocosm experiments with four replicates across four seasons to study the effects of rising temperature and nutrient enrichment on the biomass of two submerged macrophytes, Potamogeton crispus and Elodea canadensis. Our results demonstrated the seasonality and species specificity of plant biomass under the influence of climate warming and eutrophication, as well as the main explanatory factors in each season. Consistent with the seasonal results, the overall results showed that E. canadensis biomass was directly increased by rising temperature rather than by nutrient enrichment. Conversely, the overall results showed that P. crispus biomass was indirectly reduced by phosphorus enrichment via the strengthening of competition among primary producers. Distinct physiological and morphological traits may induce species-specific responses of submerged macrophytes to climate warming and eutrophication, indicating that further research should take interspecies differences into account.

Reduction of iron (III) and humic substances plays a major role in anaerobic respiration in an Arctic peat soil	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Arctic peat soils contain vast reserves of organic C and are largely anaerobic. However, anaerobic respiration, particularly the role of Fe(III) and humic substances as electron acceptors, is not well understood in such ecosystems. We investigated these processes in a drained thaw lake basin on the Arctic coastal plain near Barrow, Alaska. We measured concentrations of soluble Fe and other potential electron acceptors, described the microbial community, and performed experiments in the laboratory and field to measure net rates of Fe(III) reduction and the relationship of this process to C cycling. In most areas within the basin, aerobic conditions existed only in the upper few centimeters of soil, though oxygen penetrated deeper in raised areas, such as rims of ice wedge polygons. Concentrations of nitrate and sulfate in soil pore water were low or negligible. Soil pore water contained surprisingly high concentrations of Fe(II) and Fe(III), in the range of hundreds of mu M, suggesting the presence of organic chelators. The solid phase contained substantial amounts of iron minerals, with a progressively reduced oxidation state throughout the growing season. The most abundant 16S rRNA sequence in our gene survey was closely related to the Fe(III)-reducing bacterium, Rhodoferax ferrireducens, and other sequences closely related to Fe-transforming bacteria were found. Field and laboratory incubations with soluble Fe(III) and the quinonic compound, AQDS (a common humic analog), stimulated respiration and verified that Fe(III) reduction occurs in these soils. We conclude that reduction of Fe(III) and humic substances are major metabolic pathways in this ecosystem.

A Semi-Automated, Multi-Source Data Fusion Update of a Wetland Inventory for East-Central Minnesota, USA	WETLANDS												Comprehensive wetland inventories are an essential tool for wetland management, but developing and maintaining an inventory is expensive and technically challenging. Funding for these efforts has also been problematic. Here we describe a large-area application of a semi-automated process used to update a wetland inventory for east-central Minnesota. The original inventory for this area was the product of a labor-intensive, manual photo-interpretation process. The present application incorporated high resolution, multi-spectral imagery from multiple seasons; high resolution elevation data derived from lidar; satellite radar imagery; and other GIS data. Map production combined image segmentation and random forest classification along with aerial photo-interpretation. More than 1000 validation data points were acquired using both independent photo-interpretation as well as field reconnaissance. Overall accuracy for wetland identification was 90 % compared to field data and 93 % compared to photo-interpretation data. Overall accuracy for wetland type was 72 and 78 % compared to field and photo-interpretation data, respectively. By automating the most time consuming part of the image interpretations, initial delineation of boundaries and identification of broad wetland classes, we were able to allow the image interpreters to focus their efforts on the more difficult components, such as the assignment of detailed wetland classes and modifiers.

J	Piccolroaz, S; Toffolon, M				Piccolroaz, Sebastiano; Toffolon, Marco			The fate of Lake Baikal: how climate change may alter deep ventilation in the largest lake on Earth	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Lake Baikal is the oldest, deepest, and most voluminous freshwater lake on Earth. Despite its enormous depth, episodically (almost twice a year) large amounts of surface, cold, and oxygenated water sink until the bottom of the lake due to thermobaric instability, with consequent effects on the ecology of the whole lake. A minimal one-dimensional model is used to investigate how changes in the main external forcing (i.e., wind and lake surface temperature) may affect this deep ventilation mechanism. The effect of climate change is evaluated considering the IPCC RCP8.5 and some idealized scenarios and is quantified by (i) estimating the mean annual downwelling volume and temperature and (ii) analyzing vertical temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles. The results suggest that the strongest impact is produced by alterations of wind forcing, while deep ventilation is resistant to rising lake surface temperature. In fact, the seasons when deep ventilation can occur can be shifted in time by lake warming, but not dramatically modified in their duration. Overall, the results show that Lake Baikal is sensible to climate change, to an extent that the ecosystem and water quality of this unique lacustrine system may undergo profound disturbances.

Highest concentrations of cVMSs in the range of 63-7400 ng/L (mean/median: 1840/1310 ng/L) were found in wastewater samples. A significant difference existed in the concentrations of cVMSs between influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. The sum concentrations of four cVMSs in lake water, tap water, and bottled water samples were in the ranges of 67.0-1100 ng/L (mean/median: 350/282 ng/L), 19.8-350 ng/L (12.6/12.3 ng/L), and 2.31-28.1 ng/L (10.3/8.23 ng/L), respectively. Among the four cVMSs, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) was found at the highest concentrations in all water samples analyzed. The mean exposure doses of cVMSs calculated for adults and children through the consumption of drinking were 0.409 and 0.412 ng/kg-bw/day, respectively. Human exposure to cVMSs calculated through drinking water consumption was significantly lower than that reported for inhalation.					; Kannan, Kurunthachalam/ACA-0037-2022; Nguyen, Trung/GXG-4868-2022	Tran, Tri Manh/0000-0001-8125-8342; Nguyen, Quang Trung/0000-0003-3835-0703; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				SEP 15	2021	285								117260	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117260		MAY 2021						33964558					WOS:000685348500001

We focused on the southern sector of the lake, the location of the shallowest littorals and the most developed macrophyte communities, mainly dominated by Vallisneria spiralis and Najas marina. The method made use of both in-situ measurements and satellite data (22 Sentinel 2 A-B images) that were atmospherically corrected with 6SV code and processed with the BOMBER (Bio-Optical Model-Based tool for Estimating water quality and bottom properties from Remote sensing images). This modeling system was used to estimate the different substrate coverage (bare sediment, dense stands of macrophytes with high albedo, and sparse stand of macrophytes with low albedo). The presented results substantiate the existence of striking inter- and intra-annual variations in the spatial-cover patterns of SAV. Intense uprooting phenomena were also detected, mainly affecting V. spiralis, a species generally considered a highly plastic pioneer taxon. In this context, remote sensing emerges as a very reliable tool for mapping SAV with satisfactory accuracy by offering new perspectives for expanding our comprehension of lacustrine macrophyte dynamics and overcoming some limitations associated with traditional field surveys.					; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; Bolpagni, Rossano/Q-7053-2018; Valerio, Giulia/G-6328-2011; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Pilotti, Marco/A-4083-2010	Ghirardi, Nicola/0000-0002-5006-9853; Giardino, Claudia/0000-0002-3937-4988; PILOTTI, MARCO/0000-0001-9349-0851; Bolpagni, Rossano/0000-0001-9283-2821; Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; 													2073-4441					MAR 18	2019	11	3							563	10.3390/w11030563	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11030563													WOS:000464533600006

However, East African rainfall climatology is influenced by numerous drivers operating at multiple scales, and local patterns of variability are not adequately understood. Here, we show evidence of substantial variability of local rainfall patterns between 1981 and 2021 at the national and county level in Kenya, East Africa. Results show anomalous patterns of both wetting and drying in both the long and short rainy seasons, with evidence of increased frequency of extreme wet and dry events through time. Observations also indicate that seasonal and intraseasonal variability increased significantly after 2013, coincident with diminished coherence between ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) and rainfall. Increasing frequency and magnitude of rainfall variability suggests increasing need for local-level climate change adaptation strategies.					; Greatrex, Helen/LQJ-5858-2024	Smithwick, Erica/0000-0003-3497-2011; 													2045-2322					JUN 5	2024	14	1							12915	10.1038/s41598-024-63786-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-63786-2								38839907					WOS:001244399200042

Developing Data-Driven Models (DDMs) to apply to hydrological modeling is a very complex issue because of the stochastic nature of the observed data, like seasonality, periodicities, anomalies, and lack of data. As streamflow is one of the most important components in the hydrological cycle, modeling and estimating streamflow is a crucial aspect. In this study, two models, namely, Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine (OPELM) and Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) methods were used to model the deterministic parts of monthly streamflow equations, while Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) was used in modeling the stochastic parts of monthly streamflow equations. The state of art and innovation of this study is the integration of these models in order to create new hybrid models, ARCH-OPELM and ARCH-CHAID, and increasing the accuracy of models. The study draws on the monthly streamflow data of two different river stations, located in north-western Iran, including Dizaj and Tapik, which are on Nazluchai and Baranduzchai, gathered over 31 years from 1986 to 2016. To ascertain the conclusive accuracy, five evaluation metrics including Correlation Coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the ratio of RMSE to the Standard Deviation (RSD), scatter plots, time-series plots, and Taylor diagrams were used. Standalone CHAID models have better results than OPELM methods considering sole models. In the case of hybrid models, ARCH-CHAID models in the validation stage performed better than ARCH-OPELM for Dizaj station (R = 0.96, RMSE = 1.289 m(3)/s, NSE = 0.92, MAE = 0.719 m(3)/s and RSD = 0.301) and for Tapik station (R = 0.94, RMSE = 2.662 m(3)/s, NSE = 0.86, MAE = 1.467 m(3)/s and RSD = 0.419). The results remarkably reveal that ARCH-CHAID models in both stations outperformed all other models. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the new hybrid "ARCH-DDM" models outperformed standalone models in predicting monthly streamflow.

Hyperspectral remote sensing monitoring of cyanobacteria blooms in a large South American reservoir: high- and medium-spatial resolution satellite algorithm simulation	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												We used hyperspectral remote sensing with the aim of establishing a monitoring program for cyanobacteria in a South American reservoir. We sampled at a wide temporal (2012-16; 10 seasons) and spatial (30 km) gradient, and retrieved 111 field hyperspectral signatures, chlorophyll-a, cyanobacteria densities and total suspended solids. The hyperspectral signatures for cyanobacteria-dominated situations (n = 75) were used to select the most suitable spectral bands in seven high- and medium-spatial resolution satellites (Sentinel 2, Landsat 5, 7 and 8, SPOT-4/5 and -6/7, WorldView 2), and for the development of chlorophyll and cyanobacteria cell abundance algorithms (lambda(550) - lambda(650) + lambda(800)) divided by (lambda(550) + lambda(650) + lambda(800)). The best-performing chlorophyll algorithm was Sentinel 2 ((lambda(560) - lambda(660) + lambda(703)) divided by (lambda(560) + lambda(660) + lambda(703)); R-2 = 0.80), followed by WorldView 2 ((lambda(550) - lambda(660) + lambda(720)) divided by (lambda(550) + lambda(660) + lambda(720)); R-2 = 0.78), Landsat and the SPOT series ((lambda(550) - lambda(650) + lambda(800)) divided by (lambda(550) + lambda(650) + lambda(800)); R-2 = 0.67-0.74). When these models were run for cyanobacteria abundance, the coefficient of determination remained similar, but the root mean square error increased. This could affect the estimate of cyanobacteria cell abundance by similar to 20%, yet it still enable assessment of the alert level categories for risk assessment. The results of this study highlight the importance of the red and near-infrared region for identifying cyanobacteria in hypereutrophic waters, demonstrating coherence with field cyanobacteria abundance and enabling assessment of bloom distribution in this ecosystem.					; Fernandez, Vicente/GZL-2945-2022	Bordet, Facundo/0000-0003-3650-8642; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2020	71	5			SI		593	605		10.1071/MF18429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF18429													WOS:000539021200004

In this article, the long-term changes in lake ice phenology of the second-largest lake at Tibetan Plateau (i.e., the Nam Co) in response to climate change are investigated based on mathematical modeling. The model has been testified capable of reproducing daily surface temperature of the lake in both frozen and unfrozen seasons. The lake ice phenology determined according to the simulated lake surface temperature is found consistent with that derived from satellite observations. For the Nam Co during the period 1978-2017, the freezing date has been delayed (reached up to 0.57 days/year), whereas the thawing date became earlier (-0.23 days/year). The trend of lake ice phenology is significantly correlated to the annual minimal lake surface and air temperature. Modeling experiment suggests that lake ice phenology of the Nam Co is very sensitive to a warmer climate. Under warmer future, much later freezing date and earlier thawing date are expected; hence the ice-covering duration would be significantly shortened.					; Zheng, Hongxing/E-6297-2017; Zhang, Tianqi/AAF-5183-2019; Zhang, Bing/JOZ-7091-2023	Guo, linan/0000-0002-3270-004X; 													1939-1404	2151-1535					2020	13						3856	3861		10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3006270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3006270													WOS:000549301900005

We investigated the carbon budgets in 2 polyculture systems (PM: swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus with kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus; and PMR: crab, shrimp and shortnecked clam Ruditapes philippinarum) during the farming season (125 d in total). The main carbon input occurred via water (PM: 55.06%; PMR: 62.50%), followed by that via feed. PM absorbed 21.55 g C m(-2) across the air-water interface, accounting for 13.27% of the total input. The carbon output via water was the main output in both PM (89.17 %) and PMR (46.43%). PMR emitted 53.00 g C m(-2) into the atmosphere during the farming season, accounting for 32.53% of the total output. The carbon output by harvested animals in PMR accounted for 19.48% of the total output, which was much higher than that in PM (5.71 %). Carbon accumulation in the sediment was significantly higher in PM than in PMR (p < 0.05), but the value of both represented a small portion of the total output. Clam farming in the polyculture system profoundly altered the carbon budgets by changing the CO2 flux direction, reducing carbon accumulation in water and sediments and increasing the carbon output by harvested animals. In terms of the global warming potential, which was calculated from the results of CO2 and CH4 fluxes across the air-water interface, PM had the potential for mitigating the greenhouse effect on the 20 yr horizon, whereas PMR exacerbated global warming. Our results suggest that PM acted as a net carbon sink in the global carbon cycle, while PMR acted as a carbon source.

Experiencing rapid hydroclimatic changes in the Arctic, Svalbard serves as an ideal study location due to its exposure to oceanic and atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic region. Here we use climate data from paleoproxies, observations, and a climate model to demonstrate that wet and warm extremes in Svalbard over the last two millennia are linked to the presence of atmospheric blocking regimes over Scandinavia and the Ural mountain region. Rainfall episodes lead to the deposition of coarse sediment particles and high levels of calcium in Linn & eacute;vatnet, a lake in southwest Svalbard, with the coarsest sediments consistently deposited during atmospheric blocking events. A unique annually resolved sediment record from Linn & eacute;vatnet confirms that this linkage has been persistent over the past 2000 years. Our record also shows that a millennial-scale decline in Svalbard precipitation ended around the middle of the 19th century, followed by several unprecedented extreme events in recent years. As warming continues and sea ice recedes, future Svalbard floods will become more intense during episodes of Scandinavian and Ural blocking. The study links heavy past rainfall events in Svalbard to Scandinavian blocking. Lake sediment data spanning the last 2 millennia warns of worse floods with continued warming, especially intense during atmospheric blocking conditions.					; Karmalkar, Ambarish/GQH-0889-2022; Wang, Feng/AAA-9614-2022; Bradley, Raymond/P-9358-2015	Karmalkar, Ambarish/0000-0002-2940-0417; Retelle, Michael/0000-0002-5341-0711; Wang, Feng/0000-0002-9562-4849; Bradley, Raymond/0000-0002-4032-9519														2041-1723				JUN 3	2024	15	1							4432	10.1038/s41467-024-48603-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48603-8								38830858					WOS:001238270100023

Located in the northern Apennines within the Emilia-Romagna re-gion, the Ridracoli artificial lake is one of Italy's most important reservoirs that provides drinking water for about one million people. This work characterized the reservoir sediments by ICP-MS after aqua regia digestion (ARD), compar-ing the limits by law to assess environmental compliance and XRF data from the same sample-set taken as total con-centrations. The Degree of Extraction (DE) from pseudo-total concentrations of ARD analysis allows assessing elements mobility and the associated environmental risk. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the obtained data helped to investigate inter-element relationships better; for example, we observed carbonate-sourced sediments, many trace elements (e.g., Ni, Zn) linked to FeMn oxyhydroxides, the importance of the grain size in elements distri-bution, and the central role of the organic matter in element partitioning. In addition, a Sequential Extraction Proce-dure (SEP) was applied to the sediment samples to understand the partitioning of many analytes, including Potentially Harmful Elements (PHE) such as Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The results indicated that the most easily mobilized forms were predominant in the area near the dam, in correspondence to sediments affected by the formation of a seasonal anoxic layer.					dinelli, enrico/G-6532-2012; Toller, Simone/AAY-6156-2021; Funari, Valerio/E-4027-2016	dinelli, enrico/0000-0002-3870-544X; Toller, Simone/0000-0001-5156-1869; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 20	2022	826								154167	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154167		MAR 2022						35231522					WOS:000793194400007

Semi-automated classification of colonial Microcystis by FlowCAM imaging flow cytometry in mesocosm experiment reveals high heterogeneity during seasonal bloom	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												A machine learning approach was employed to detect and quantify Microcystis colonial morphospecies using FlowCAM-based imaging flow cytometry. The system was trained and tested using samples from a long-term mesocosm experiment (LMWE, Central Jutland, Denmark). The statistical validation of the classification approaches was performed using Hellinger distances, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and Kullback-Leibler divergence. The semi-automatic classification based on well-balanced training sets from Microcystis seasonal bloom provided a high level of intergeneric accuracy (96-100%) but relatively low intrageneric accuracy (67-78%). Our results provide a proof-of-concept of how machine learning approaches can be applied to analyze the colonial microalgae. This approach allowed to evaluate Microcystis seasonal bloom in individual mesocosms with high level of temporal and spatial resolution. The observation that some Microcystis morphotypes completely disappeared and re-appeared along the mesocosm experiment timeline supports the hypothesis of the main transition pathways of colonial Microcystis morphoforms. We demonstrated that significant changes in the training sets with colonial images required for accurate classification of Microcystis spp. from time points differed by only two weeks due to Microcystis high phenotypic heterogeneity during the bloom. We conclude that automatic methods not only allow a performance level of human taxonomist, and thus be a valuable time-saving tool in the routine-like identification of colonial phytoplankton taxa, but also can be applied to increase temporal and spatial resolution of the study.

However, there needs to be more knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in drinking water systems from water sources to household tap water. Herein, laser direct infrared spectroscopy is used to investigate the occurrence of microplastics in a typical drinking water plant with different water sources. Microplastic information is further used to understand microplastic fates during drinking water supply, including microplastic abundance, size, shape, and polymer type. Overall, the microplastic abundance in treated water ranges from 12.00 to 25.33 particles/L, higher than those in raw water (RW; 2.33-17.33 particles/L) and household water (HW; 8.00-19.67 particles/L), which shows that microplastics are not removed from RW. The main polymers in these microplastics are polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and polypropylene. At the same time, the main microplastic shapes are fragments and fibers. Small-sized microplastics of 20-100 mu m account for up to 76.74% and 79.30% of microplastics during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Additionally, more microplastics are detected in RW from rivers than those from reservoirs and lakes, and the microplastic abundance in the wet season is higher than that in the dry season. As expected, the potential ecological risk of microplastics in all waters is the I level, which is the lowest level. Most importantly, the annual microplastic intake of an adult via drinking water is 5063-18,301 microplastics, less than that reported in previous studies. These results provide valuable data on the fates of microplastics in drinking water supply systems from water sources to HW and promote authorities to update the treatment technologies for drinking water in the future to remove microplastics efficiently.					; An, Lihui/AGD-8625-2022	An, Lihui/0000-0003-3269-9752; 														2073-4441				JUN	2024	16	11							1567	10.3390/w16111567	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16111567													WOS:001245666700001

Fish presented uni or bilateral exophthalmia, ocular hemorrhages and melanosis. Necropsy showed severe hemorrhage in swim bladder, brain, liver and muscle, splenomegaly, and gut congestion. Histology revealed retrobulbar hemorrhage with macrophage infiltration, multifocal necrosis in several tissues, meningitis, splenitis, epicarditis, and congestion. After microbiological culture in blood agar, flat and circular colonies with smooth edges and a zone of a-hemolysis were observed. The presence of Weissella ceti was confirmed through biochemical and molecular analysis (16S rRNA gene sequence analysis), without differences between Peruvian isolates. Worldwide, W. ceti isolates from rainbow trout were similar using 16S rRNA gene sequence, however, showed discrepancies between those isolates from different hosts. Finally, Koch's postulate was confirmed with experimental infections using rainbow trouts (similar to 9 cm) infected intraperitoneally (0.1 mL of 10(4) CFU). After 21 days, clinical signs and lesions similar to the recorded in natural outbreaks were observed, cumulative mortality rate was 90% and bacteria was successfully recovered from both moribund and survivor fish. This is the first report and description of weissellosis caused by Weissella ceti isolated from rainbow trout cultured in Lake Titicaca, Peru and it is the first report of the primary isolation of this bacterium on TSA and TYES media instead of TSAB medium.					; Yunis Aguinaga, Jefferson/M-9808-2016; FERNANDEZ ESPINEL, CARLA IVONNE/JZT-0140-2024; Aguinaga, Jefferson/M-9808-2016; Sotil, Giovanna/AGH-1010-2022	Medina-Morillo, Marco/0000-0001-7335-2902; Yunis Aguinaga, Jefferson/0000-0002-1959-4350; Flores Dominick, Violeta de Jesus/0000-0002-3141-1393; FERNANDEZ ESPINEL, CARLA IVONNE/0000-0001-8909-4485; Sotil, Giovanna/0000-0002-1583-8821; 													0044-8486	1873-5622				DEC 15	2020	529								735608	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735608													WOS:000566467100011

There is a lack of information regarding the occurrence and environmental fate of PPCPs in large agricultural irrigation areas in China. In this study, we conducted a compre-hensive survey on 30 PPCPs in water from Hetao Irrigation District, one of the three largest irrigation areas in China. The Sigma PPCP-concentrations ranged 82.13-1409.24 ng/L in August and 40.53-887.20 ng/L in November, with caffeine (CAF), norfloxacin (NOR), erythromycin (ERY), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and ofloxacin (OFL) being the predominant compositions. Spatially, the average Sigma PPCP concentrations increased from irrigation to drainage water, and then de-creased in Wuliangsuhai Lake. Less PPCP mass loading (55.05 kg/y) migrated from Wuliangsuhai Lake to Yellow River than that from the Yellow River to Hetao Irrigation District (425.88 kg/y), indicating that Wuliangsuhai Lake plays an important role in improving water quality. An ecological risk assessment showed that it is worthwhile to con-sider the presence of CAF, ERY, NOR, and OFL in natural surface water and to control their potential risks.

Increasing levels of eutrophication and the abundance of cyanobacteria are expected to occur due to climate change, especially in the southern Mediterranean. Consequently, an in-depth study of the occurrence of harmful cyanobacteria is important to develop appropriate management strategies for water resources at a local scale. Monthly samples were collected at one station in each reservoir over an 18-month period. The Analysis of similarity indicated that cyanobacterial abundance and species composition differed significantly among the reservoirs. The Redundancy analysis highlighted their relationship to trophic, hydrological and seasonal patterns. Spearman's analysis indicated that there were significant correlations among the most important species (Planktothrix agardhii-rubescens group, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Dolichospermum planctonicum), nutrients and microcystins. We highlighted that the species composition during periods of maximum microcystin concentrations differed from those typically reported for other Mediterranean sites. We found new potential microcystin producers (Aphanizomenon klebahnii, Dolichospermum macrosporum and Dolichospermum viguieri), which emphasised the high diversity of cyanobacteria in the Mediterranean area and the need for detailed research at the local scale.					; Luglie, Antonella/M-4321-2015; Lugliè, Antonella/M-4321-2015	Kastovsky, Jan/0000-0003-4523-3468; Luglie, Antonella/0000-0001-6382-4208; 													2045-2322					DEC 9	2015	5								17964	10.1038/srep17964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep17964								26648532					WOS:000366030400001

The influence of factors including congeners, concentrations, sampling points, seasons, years, and potential sources was considered and the environmental risk for various hydrobionts was established. Priority PAEs in Baikal waters are represented by dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalates (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). Statistically valuable average concentrations and ranges for DMP, DEP, DnBP, and DEHP were 0.02 (0.01-0.02), 0.07 (0.06-0.09), 0.55 (0.47-0.66), and 0.30 (0.26-0.34) mu g/L, respectively. The main factors determining PAE concentrations were the year and season of sampling, whereas sampling points were not among the factors influencing PAE levels. The distribution of PAEs in the water body was characterized by (i) an even distribution of minor hydrophilic DMP and DEP congeners in the whole water body, (ii) a maximum concentration of hydrophobic DnBP and DEHP congeners in the upper and near-bottom layers of the water column, and (iii) a low concentration of hydrophobic congeners in the near-shore area. The main PAE source was found to be the atmospheric transfer of polluted air masses, while the supply of PAEs from coastal sources to the pelagic zone was low. The contribution of biogenic sources to the background level of PAEs in the surface waters of Lake Baikal was established. The ecological risk of the background concentration level of PAEs for Lake Baikal biota was estimated. It was found that (i) DMP and DEP congeners do not represent a risk, or represent a very low risk, (ii) the concentration levels of dominant DnBP and DEHP congeners represent a low risk for crustaceans and fishes but (iii) a rather high risk for algae at a DEHP concentration of 0.30 mu g/L.

Do intracoelomic telemetry transmitters alter the post-release behaviour of migratory fish?	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Electronic tags have become a common tool in fish research, enhancing our understanding of how fish interact with their environment and move among different habitats, for estimating mortality and recording internal physiological states. An often-untested assumption of electronic tagging studies is that tagged fish are representative of untagged conspecifics and thus show normal' behaviour (e.g. movement rates, swimming activity, feeding). Here, we use a unique data set for potamadromous walleye (Sander vitreus) in Lake Huron and Lake Erie tributaries to assess whether the lack of appropriate controls in electronic tagging could seriously affect behavioural data. We used fish tagged in previous years and compared their migratory behaviour during the spawning season to fish tagged in a current year at the same location. The objective of the study was to determine whether intracoelomic acoustic tag implantation altered downstream movement of walleye after spawning. Fish tagged in a given season travelled slower downstream from two river spawning sites than fish tagged in previous years. Fish tagged one or two years earlier showed no differences between each other in downstream travel time, in contrast to fish tagged in a given year. Our results support notions that standard collection and intracoelomic tagging procedures can alter short-term behaviour (i.e. days, weeks, months), and as such, researchers should use caution when interpreting data collected over such time periods. Further, whenever possible, researchers should also explicitly evaluate post-tagging effects on behaviour as part of their experimental objectives.

J	Liu, Y; Yue, H				Liu, Ying; Yue, Hui			Estimating the fluctuation of Lake Hulun, China, during 1975-2015 from satellite altimetry data	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Lake level, area, and volume changes can describe the fluctuation of water bodies. In this study, ICESat/Hydroweb and Landsat data recorded with irregularly time intervals from 1975 to 2015 were used to examine changes in lake level and area which were combined to indirectly estimate water volume variations of Lake Hulun. The time series of lake level, area, and volume variations of Lake Hulun exhibited a fluctuating trend from 1975 to 1984 and the mean value were about 542.57 m, 2065.76 km(2), and -0.045 km(3), respectively and an increasing trends showed during 1984-2000. Lake Hulun revealed the fastest decrease in lake level (-0.42 m/a), volume (-0.83 km(3)/a) from 2000 to 2009, and the fastest shrinking in surface area (-33.88 km(2)/a) during 2000-2012. There was a seasonal variation of water level and lake volume variations during 20092012 and the mean value were 539.98 m and -5.72 km(3), respectively. From 2012 to 2015, a faster increasing trends were shown in water level, area, and volume variations with a rate of 0.73 m/a (the amount of change was 2.92 m), 81.95 km(3)/a (the amount of change was 327.8 km(2)), and 0.42 km(3)/a (the amount of change was1.67 km(3)), respectively. The lake level and area showed strong correlations for Lake Hulun (R-2 = 0.93). The water volume changes were in very good agreement for lake level changes (R-2 > 0.99) and surface area variations (R-2 = 0.92). Combining with lake level and area changes, the sum of lake volume variation of Lake Hulun was obtained and it showed a positive water budgets of 0.24 km(3) during past 40 years. River and groundwater discharge, the pan evaporation, the net pan evaporation, and the water diversion project were reasons for the lake level, area, and volume variations in Lake Hulun. This study demonstrates that remote sensing data can be used as a source of information for monitoring comprehensively the fluctuation of large water bodies.

However, due to the eutrophication of urban waterbodies and global warming, uncontrollable growth of cyanobacteria usually leads to the seasonal outbreak of cyanobacteria) blooms. Cyanophages, a group of viruses that specifically infect and lyse cyanobacteria, are considered as potential environment-friendly agents to control the harmful blooms. Compared to the marine counterparts, only a few freshwater cyanophages have been isolated and genome sequenced to date, largely limiting their characterizations and applications. Results: Here, we isolated five freshwater cyanophages varying in tail morphology, termed Pam1-Pam5, all of which infect the cyanobacterium Pseudanabaena mucicola Chao 1806 that was isolated from the bloom-suffering Lake Chaohu in Anhui, China. The whole-genome sequencing showed that cyanophages Pam1 similar to Pam5 all contain a dsDNA genome, varying in size from 36 to 142 Kb. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that Pam1 similar to Pam5 possess different DNA packaging mechanisms and are evolutionarily distinct from each other. Notably, Pam1 and Pam5 have lysogenyassociated gene clusters, whereas Pam2 possesses 9 punctuated DNA segments identical to the CRISPR spacers in the host genome. Metagenomic data-based calculation of the relative abundance of Pam1 similar to Pam5 at the Nanfei estuary towards the Lake Chaohu revealed that the short-tailed Pam1 and Pam5 account for the majority of the five cyanophages. Moreover, comparative analyses of the reference genomes of Pam1 similar to Pam5 and previously reported cyanophages enabled us to identify three circular and seven linear contigs of virtual freshwater cyanophages from the metagenomic data of the Lake Chaohu. Conclusions: We propose a high-throughput strategy to systematically identify cyanophages based on the currently available metagenomic data and the very limited reference genomes of experimentally isolated cyanophages. This strategy could be applied to mine the complete or partial genomes of unculturable bacteriophages and viruses. Transformation of the synthesized whole genomes of these virtual phages/viruses to proper hosts will enable the rescue of bona fide viral particles and eventually enrich the library of microorganisms that exist on Earth.

A knowledge of the epiphytic bacterial community structure could help us to understand these roles. In this study, the abundance, diversity, and functions of the epiphytic bacterial community of Myriophyllum spicatum collected from Baiyangdian Lake in June, August, and October 2019 were studied using quantitative PCR (qPCR), high-throughput sequencing, and the prediction of functions. An analysis using qPCR showed that the epiphytic bacteria were the most abundant in October and the least abundant in August. High-throughput sequencing revealed that Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Aeromonas were the dominant phylum, class, and genus in all the samples. The common analyses of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), NMDS, and LDA showed that the epiphytic bacterial communities were clustered together based on the seasons. The results of a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) showed that the key water quality index that affected the changes of epiphytic bacterial community of M. spicatum was the total phosphorus (TP). The changes in abundance of Gammaproteobacteria negatively correlated with the TP. Predictive results from FAPROTAX showed that the predominant biogeochemical cycle functions of the epiphytic bacterial community were chemoheterotrophy, nitrate reduction, and fermentation. These results suggest that the epiphytic bacterial community of M. spicatum from Baiyangdian Lake varies substantially with the seasons and environmental conditions.

In eastern Siberia, fire activity has been increasing in recent years, challenging the livelihoods of local communities. Intensifying fire regimes also increase disturbance pressure on the boreal forests, which currently protect the permafrost beneath from accelerated degradation. However, long-term relationships between changes in fire regime and forest structure remain largely unknown. We assess past fire-vegetation feedbacks using sedimentary proxy records from Lake Satagay, Central Yakutia, Siberia, covering the past c. 10,800 years. Results from macroscopic and microscopic charcoal analyses indicate high amounts of burnt biomass during the Early Holocene, and that the present-day, low-severity surface fire regime has been in place since c. 4,500 years before present. A pollen-based quantitative reconstruction of vegetation cover and a terrestrial plant record based on sedimentary ancient DNA metabarcoding suggest a pronounced shift in forest structure toward the Late Holocene. Whereas the Early Holocene was characterized by postglacial open larch-birch woodlands, forest structure changed toward the modern, mixed larch-dominated closed-canopy forest during the Mid-Holocene. We propose a potential relationship between open woodlands and high amounts of burnt biomass, as well as a mediating effect of dense larch forest on the climate-driven intensification of fire regimes. Considering the anticipated increase in forest disturbances (droughts, insect invasions, and wildfires), higher tree mortality may force the modern state of the forest to shift toward an open woodland state comparable to the Early Holocene. Such a shift in forest structure may result in a positive feedback on currently intensifying wildfires. These new long-term data improve our understanding of millennial-scale fire regime changes and their relationships to changes of vegetation in Central Yakutia, where the local population is already being confronted with intensifying wildfire seasons.

Methane (CH4) production and oxidation also contribute CO2 to freshwaters, yet this remains largely unquantified. Flood pulse lakes and rivers in the tropics are hypothesized to receive large inputs of dissolved CO2 and CH4 from floodplains characterized by hypoxia and reducing conditions. We measured stable C isotopes of CO2 and CH4, aerobic respiration, and CH4 production and oxidation during two flood stages in Tonle Sap Lake (Cambodia) to determine whether dissolved CO2 in this tropical flood pulse ecosystem has a methanogenic origin. Mean CO2 supersaturation of 11,000 +/- 9,000 mu atm could not be explained by aerobic respiration alone. C-13 depletion of dissolved CO2 relative to other sources of organic and inorganic C, together with corresponding C-13 enrichment of CH4, suggested extensive CH4 oxidation. A stable isotope-mixing model shows that the oxidation of C-13 depleted CH4 to CO2 contributes between 47 and 67% of dissolved CO2 in Tonle Sap Lake. C-13 depletion of dissolved CO2 was correlated to independently measured rates of CH4 production and oxidation within the water column and underlying lake sediments. However, mass balance indicates that most of this CH4 production and oxidation occurs elsewhere, within inundated soils and other floodplain habitats. Seasonal inundation of floodplains is a common feature of tropical freshwaters, where high reported CO2 supersaturation and atmospheric emissions may be explained in part by coupled CH4 production and oxidation.

J	Kornijów, R				Kornijow, Ryszard			Ecosystem of the Polish part of the Vistula Lagoon from the perspective of alternative stable states concept, with implications for management issues	OCEANOLOGIA												The alternative stable states concept finds broad application in reference to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. For some reason, attempts to implement the concept to explain processes observed in estuaries and Baltic lagoons are very rare. Based on information included in publications issued over the last 60 years, three co-existing states were designated within the strongly elongated basin the Vistula Lagoon, namely: phytoplankton-dominated (Middle Basin), macrophyte-dominated (Elblag Bay), and transition state balancing between the two former ones (West Basin). Regions of the lagoon representing such states are similar in terms of nutrient concentrations, but they considerably differ in terms of: exposure to wind and wave action, salinity, anthropogenic impact, and multi-level top-down regulations. The paper discusses the role of such drivers, responsible for both the maintenance of a given state, and the past transition into the present alternative state. Moreover, it presents chances for the improvement of the situation, as well as threats which can undermine them. (C) 2018 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Indeed, dedicated numerical procedures are generally time-consuming, instabilities can occur at the wet/dry front, rapid transition of wet/dry interface and mass conservation are not always ensured. We present the extension of an existing wetting-drying algorithm in two space dimensions and its application to a real case. The wetting-drying algorithm is implemented in Second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model (), a discontinuous Galerkin finite element model solving the shallow water equations in a fully implicit way. This algorithm consists in applying a threshold value of fluid depth for a thin layer and a blending parameter in order to guarantee positive values of the water depth, while preserving local mass conservation and the well balanced property at wet/dry interfaces. The technique is first validated against standard analytical test cases (Balzano 1, Balzano 3 and Thacker test cases) and is subsquently applied in a realistic domain, the Tonle Sap Lake in the Mekong River Basin, where the water level can vary by about 10 m between the dry and the wet season.					; Soares-Frazao, Sandra/A-3219-2011; gratiot, nicolas/G-8071-2016; Deleersnijder, Eric/AAE-7020-2020	Le, Hoang Anh/0000-0002-8431-3236; Ortleb, Sigrun/0000-0003-1341-853X; gratiot, nicolas/0000-0002-9053-1694; Soares-Frazao, Sandra/0000-0001-5088-0278; 													1567-7419	1573-1510				AUG	2020	20	4					923	951		10.1007/s10652-019-09732-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10652-019-09732-7													WOS:000552357900012

We conducted three sampling series in Lake Edward in October-November 2016, March-April 2017 and January 2018, in distinct seasonal conditions and in several sites varying by depth and proximity to river outlets, including the Kazinga Channel, which connects the hypertrophic Lake George to Lake Edward. The phytoplankton was examined using microscopy and marker pigment analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and subsequent CHEMTAX processing for estimating abundance of phytoplankton groups. Chlorophyll a concentration in the pelagic and littoral open lake sites barely exceeded 10 mu g L-1 whereas, in contrast, in the semi-enclosed Bay of Katwe influenced by the Kazinga Channel chlorophyll a was up to 100 mu g L-1. Despite substantial seasonal variations of limnological conditions such as photic and mixed layer depths, cyanoprokaryotes/cyanobacteria represented on average 60% of the phytoplankton biomass, followed by diatoms, which contributed similar to 25% of chlorophyll a, and by green algae, chrysophytes and cryptophytes. 248 taxa were identified with clear prevalence of cyanobacteria (104 taxa), from the morphological groups of coccal and filamentous species (non-heterocytous and heterocytous). The high proportion of heterocytous cyanobacteria, along with a relatively high particulate organic carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio, suggest N limitation as well as light limitation, most pronounced in the pelagic sites. During the rainy season, the most abundant diatoms in the plankton were needle-like Nitzschia. Comparison with previous studies found differences in water transparency, total phosphorus, and phytoplankton composition. (C) 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Zhao, B; Su, LJ				Zhao, Bo; Su, Lijun			Complex spatial and size distributions of landslides in the Yarlung Tsangpo River (YTR) basin	JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING												The Yarlung Tsangpo River (YTR), located in the Himalayan orogenic belt, is renowned for its deep gorges and complex tectonic features, as well as its reputation as a landslide-prone region. However, less is known about the distribution of landslides across the entire river basin. To address this gap in knowledge, this study first established a comprehensive landslide inventory across the entire basin using remote sensing mapping and multiple field investigations. Then, a systematic analysis of the spatial and size distributions was conducted. The results indicated that the YTR basin features at least 2390 landslides with areas exceeding 104 m2, spanning a total area and volume of 1087.6 km2 and 48.4 km3, respectively. These landslides can be classified into eight types, and rockslides are the most common (53.1%). Their distributions are highly asymmetric, with the following notable patterns: (1) the Tsangpo suture zone (53.4%) contains a greater number of landslides than other tectonic units; (2) the landslide size is influenced by the relief and elevation conditions, with positive relationships observed between the local relief and landslide area, as well as between the elevation range and landslide area; and (3) the landslide distribution is not significantly correlated with rainfall, and seasonally frozen ground is associated with a greater concentration of landslides. Alternating slate and shale groups in the Tsangpo suture zone may be the factors responding to landslide concentration. A total of 20.6% of landslideblocked rivers were observed, with some forming river knickpoints. Due to the limited data, spatial and size analyses are perhaps immature, and further systematic analysis remains necessary. (c) 2025 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A projected 1-3.5 degrees C rise in average global temperatures by 2100 could exacerbate the epidemics by modifying disease transmission thresholds. Future malaria scenarios for the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) are quantified for projected climate scenarios spanning 2006-2100. Methods Regression relationships are established between historical (1995-2010) clinical malaria and anaemia cases and rainfall and temperature for four East African malaria hotspots. The vector autoregressive moving average processes model, VARMAX (p,q,s), is then used to forecast malaria and anaemia responses to rainfall and temperatures projected with an ensemble of eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) for climate change scenarios defined by three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5). Results Maximum temperatures in the long rainy (March-May) and dry (June-September) seasons will likely increase by over 2.0 degrees C by 2070, relative to 1971-2000, under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. Minimum temperatures (June-September) will likely increase by over 1.5-3.0 degrees C under RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. The short rains (OND) will likely increase more than the long rains (MAM) by the 2050s and 2070s under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. Historical malaria cases are positively and linearly related to the 3-6-month running means of monthly rainfall and maximum temperature. Marked variation characterizes the patterns projected for each of the three scenarios across the eight General Circulation Models, reaffirming the importance of using an ensemble of models for projections. Conclusions The short rains (OND), wet season (MAM) temperatures and clinical malaria cases will likely increase in the Lake Victoria Basin. Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, including malaria control interventions could reduce the projected epidemics and cases. Interventions should reduce emerging risks, human vulnerability and environmental suitability for malaria transmission.

Heavy metals dissolved in the overlying water of lakes are notably more toxic than those found in lake sediment. Given this, we sought to better understand the characteristics of particular major ion and dissolved heavy metal in Dongting Lake-the second largest freshwater lake in China. Overlying water samples were collected from Dongting Lake to investigate the major ion geochemistry and to examine the relationship between the major ions and dissolved heavy metals. Chemical analysis of the overlying water showed that the average cation concentration was the highest for Ca2+, followed by Mg2+, Na+, and K+. Similarly, the highest anion concentration was SO42-, followed by Cl-, NO3-, and HCO3-. Total dissolved solids in the overlying water of Dongting Lake ranged from 66.19 to 159.20 mg/L, with an average value of 93.13 mg/L. The predominant hydrochemical type was Ca-SO4. The mean concentrations of dissolved heavy metal in both surface and deep waters decreased in the following order: Zn > Cr > Ni > Cu > Pb > Cd. Importantly, all of the selected heavy metals tested in the overlying water were lower than the corresponding toxicity reference values. Co-occurrence network analyses were performed and compared the correlations between all measured major ions and heavy metals. Results of the subsequent principal component analyses revealed that heavy metal levels in the aquatic environment primarily originated from natural processes and were enhanced by anthropogenic activities.

Spatiotemporal Variability in Water Sources Controls Chemical and Physical Properties of a Semi-arid Urban River System	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												We conducted synoptic surveys over three seasons in one year to evaluate the variability in water sources and geochemistry of an urban river with complex water infrastructure in the state of Utah. Using stable isotopes of river water (delta O-18 and delta H-2) within a Bayesian mixing model framework and a separate hydrologic mass balance approach, we quantified both the proportional inputs and magnitude of discharge associated with "natural" (lake, groundwater, and tributary inputs) and "engineered" (effluent and canal inflows) sources. The relative importance of these major contributors to streamflow varied both spatially and seasonally. Spatiotemporal patterns of dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, calcium, chloride, nitrate, and orthophosphate indicated seasonal shifts in dominant sources of river water played an important role in determining water quality. We show although urban rivers are clearly influenced by novel water sources created by water infrastructure, they continue to reflect the imprint of "natural" water sources, including diffuse groundwater. Resource managers thus may need to account for the quantity of both surface waters and also historically overlooked groundwater inputs to address water quality concerns in urban rivers.					; Jameel, Yusuf/AAA-5382-2020; Gabor, Rachel/LBI-3128-2024	Gabor, Rachel/0000-0002-7706-2897; jameel, yusuf/0000-0001-8564-4611; Brooks, Paul/0000-0001-9201-1062; Follstad Shah, Jennifer/0000-0001-8287-5035; Weintraub-Leff, Samantha/0000-0003-4789-5086; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2019	55	3					591	607		10.1111/1752-1688.12734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12734													WOS:000470033600007

In this study, surface water, groundwater and wetland water were collected for the measurement of environmental isotopes to reveal the seasonal variability of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes (delta O-18, delta D), sources of water, and groundwater inflow fluxes. Results showed that surface water and groundwater are of meteoric origin. The isotopes in samples of wetland water were well mixed vertically in seasons of both high-flow (September) and low-flow (April); however, marked seasonal and spatial variations were observed. During the high-flow season, the isotopic composition in surface wetland water varied from -97.13 to -41.73aEuro degrees for delta D and from -13.17 to -4.70aEuro degrees for delta O-18. The composition of stable isotopes in the eastern region of this wetland was lower than in the western region. These may have been influenced by uneven evaporation caused by the distribution of aquatic vegetation. During the low-flow season, delta D and delta O-18 in the more open water with dead aquatic vegetation ranged from -37.11 to -11.77aEuro degrees, and from -4.25 to -0.08aEuro degrees, respectively. This may result from high evaporation rates in this season with the lowest atmospheric humidity. Groundwater fluxes were calculated by mass transfer and isotope mass balance approaches, suggesting that the water sources of the Caohai Wetland were mainly from groundwater in the high-flow season, while the groundwater has a smaller contribution to wetland water during the low-flow season.

Seasonal and interannual hydrological variability	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												We analyzed seasonal and interannual variability in hydrological fluxes and inundation dynamics of a large floodplain unit (2440 km(2)) along the lower Amazon River over a period of 15 years (1995-2010). Floodplain inundation was simulated using LISFLOOD-FP, which combines one-dimensional river routing with two-dimensional overland flow, and a local hydrological model. Dominant sources of inflow varied seasonally among direct rain and local runoff (November), Amazon River (December to August) and seepage (September and October). Shifts in timing of dominance among the water balance components occurred conform variations in annual peak stage. The period of dominance of river inflow over total floodplain influxes began about 1 month earlier and ended 1 month later in the 2009 high flood year compared to the 1998 low flood year. On average, river to floodplain discharge represented 0.75% of the Amazon River discharge at bidos and 82% of the annual hydrological influxes to the floodplain. We observed an up to ninefold variation in river-floodplain annual discharge. Relatively small increments in main stem peak discharge cause disproportionately large changes in the flow routed through the floodplain. Despite the higher frequency of years with lower minimum stages, the intensification of the hydrological cycle of the Amazon Basin is causing substantially greater amounts of riverine water to flow across floodplain environments.

In this study, four subtropical reservoirs and their related reaches, draining on karstic area in southwest of China, were investigated to understand their CO2 emission, with monthly sampling strategy from July 2007 to June 2008. pCO(2) values in the surface water of these reservoirs ranged from 38 to 3300 mu atm, indicating that reservoir surface could be not only source but also sink to atmosphere CO2 in different seasons. In Hongfeng reservoir, the flux of CO2 from surface water varied from -9 to 70 mmol m(-2) d(-2) with an average of 15 mmol m(-2) d(-2), and in Baihua reservoir, it had a range from -8 to 77 mmol m(-2) d(-2) with an average of 24 mmol m(-2) d(-2). Hongyan reservoir had similar average flux of CO2 to Baihua reservoir. Xiuwen had the highest average flux of CO2 with a value of 47 mmol m(-2) d(-2) among the studied reservoirs. Downstream the dams discharged by hydropower generation from these reservoirs generally had quite high flux of CO2, with an average of 489 +/- 297 mmol m(-2) d(-2), which is close to those from tropical rivers. This means that water releasing from these reservoirs would be an important way for CO2 emission into atmosphere. The results showed that dam construction has significant impacts on the river water chemistry, with abrupt changes in pCO(2), DO, T, pH and Slc in surface water and their outlets.

J	Korver, MC; Lehner, B; Cardille, JA; Carrea, L				Korver, Maartje C.; Lehner, Bernhard; Cardille, Jeffrey A.; Carrea, Laura			Surface water temperature observations and ice phenology estimations for 1.4 million lakes globally	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Water temperature and ice cover are critical characteristics of the ecological, biogeochemical, and physical functioning of a lake. Site-specific observations of temperature and ice, however, are not available for most lakes in the world. Yet this information is crucial to understanding the global role of lakes in the functioning of the bio- and hydrosphere. Here, we present the LakeTEMP dataset, referring to the similar to 1.4 million lakes globally of the HydroLAKES database with a surface area exceeding 0.1 km(2), and consisting of two subsets: (1) an observational dataset that contains lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs), derived from Landsat 8 thermal radiance observations between 2013 and 2021 extracted at the lake center points; and (2) a dataset with monthly and yearly LSWT summary statistics and predictions of average yearly ice cover durations, interpolated from the observational dataset using seasonal trendlines. All observations underwent extensive quality control and filtering, based on outlier detection, overlapping imagery removal, and the removal of observations taken from dry lake beds. Validation of the LSWT observations was carried out with in-situ data and yielded an R-2, RMSE and median of differences of 0.93, 1.71 degrees C and 0.42 degrees C, respectively. The global average yearly LSWT is 6.3 degrees C, assuming 0 degrees C during times of presumed ice cover, and 12.4 degrees C when only considering periods of open water. About 8% of all lakes never freeze, similar to 6% have short or sporadic freezing periods, and similar to 86% freeze every year, corresponding to an estimated proportion of global lake surface area of 23%, 20%, and 57%, respectively. The warmest lakes in the world (average temperatures of up to 36 degrees C) are all artificial lakes used in the power plant, mining, salt extraction, and aquaculture industries. LakeTEMP fills a crucial spatial data gap in large-scale limnological research, especially for the incorporation of small lakes and understudied geographies of remote regions. Moreover, easy linkage to other large-scale datasets that use the unique lake identifiers from HydroLAKES, most notably the LakeATLAS database (56 hydro-environmental variables for each lake including anthropogenic influences), allows to explore characteristics that may be correlated to or affected by LSWT and ice cover. The data are in an analysis-ready format and openly available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23844660.

This study proposes a classification of aquatic and wetland vegetation plant functional types (PFTs) using time series remotely sensed data applicable to wetland ecosystems with large annual water level changes like Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake-wetland of China. We first developed the aquatic and wetland PFT classification scheme which included perennial C-4 grasses, perennial C-3 reed, C-3 (sedges and taller forbs), short C-3 forbs, floating aquatic macrophytes, and submerged aquatic macrophytes. Using this scheme, time series normalized difference vegetation index (time series NDVI) images and time series vegetation-water index (time series VWI) images extracted from 32-m spatial resolution Beijing-1 microsatellite data were applied to perform two PFT classifications with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. We found that the time series NDVI-based SVM classification method mapped aquatic and wetland PFT distribution with an overall accuracy of 81.3%. However, when the information on water level fluctuation was combined with time series NDVI into a new time series index (referred to as time series VWI), the overall accuracy increased to 90.4%. Results suggest that time series VWI has a stronger capability in distinguishing wetland PFTs with different submersion times and flood tolerances than time series NDVI, and thus may be considered as a key input dataset for future PFt classifications in seasonally dynamic wetlands.

The present work is focused on the discrimination between biotic and abiotic processes driving carbonate precipitation in this lake, using hydrochemical, mineralogical and isotopic data. Hydrochemical analyses demonstrate that the lake is nearly 10-fold supersaturated with regard to aragonite and seasonally reaches hydromagnesite supersaturation. Microscopic observations depict organosedimentary laminated structures consisting of microbial communities and aragonitic precipitates, which are rather disseminated in pores than directly linked to microorganisms. Oxygen isotopic data indicate that authigenic carbonate crystallisation from evaporating water is the dominant precipitation process, further suggested by the absence of textural evidence of diagenetic processes. Conversely, the observed delta C-13 values reflect an influence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on carbon fractionation during the precipitation process, due to the selective sequestration of C-12 in the biomass. The above considerations suggest that at lake Specchio di Venere the carbonate precipitation is mainly of inorganic nature, but a minor role played by biologically influenced processes in microbial mats is not excluded.

The existence of multiple toxins in freshwater can result in an increased risk of their bioaccumulation in humans from their ingestion through contaminated drinking water or recreational activities. This study, the first of its kind, was conducted to determine the occurrence of thirteen cyanotoxins namely; microcystins (-LA, -LF, -LR, -LY, -LW, -RR, -YR, -WR, dm MC-RR and dm MC-LR), anatoxin-a, nodularin and cylindrospermopsin in the freshwaters of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. A total of 23 sites were selected for water sampling. Samples were randomly collected from lakeshores (n = 54), wells (n = 66) and piped water (n = 18) in two phases, February (dry season) and December (rainy season) 2018. Samples (n = 138) were analysed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Cylindrospermopsin was the most abundant cyanotoxin detected in the lakeshores, with eight of the nine collection sites (89%) reporting cylindrospermopsin in phase I, compared to three out of nine (33%) in phase II. Microcystin congeners -RR, -LR and -YR were detected in phase I, with microcystins -RR and -LR detected in phase II. MC concentrations ranged from 0.003 to 0.007 mu g/L for MC-RR, 0.01-0.013 mu g/L for MC-LR and 0.004 to 0.01 mu g/L for cylindrospermopsin, with nodularin reported once at a concentration of 0.01 mu g/L. No cyanotoxins were detected in wells or in treated pipe water samples. The existence of multiple toxins in different collection sites may lead to synergistic effects and increase the toxicological risk to humans. This is the first study to report the presence of cylindrospermopsin and nodularin in the freshwaters of Lake Victoria.					; Mpolya, Emmanuel/IQU-7282-2023; Gong, Yun/L-7094-2016; Gong, Yunyun/L-7094-2016; Kimanya, Martin/AAX-3199-2020	Mchau, Geofrey/0000-0002-4640-0486; Mpolya, Emmanuel/0000-0002-6210-9445; Gong, Yunyun/0000-0003-4927-5526; 													2451-9766	2451-9685				JUN	2021	13	2					185	194		10.1007/s12403-020-00372-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12403-020-00372-7		JUL 2020											WOS:000552584800001

The results show that the thaw settlement exhibits a contraction effect in the horizontal direction because of uneven thaw settlement. Slope displacement of creep occurs only in the top 50 cm of the soil. The gravimetric water content, soil porosity, and soil temperature are higher near the thaw slump in thaw seasons compared with the undisturbed soil; however, the shear strength is lower. Melting ground ice releases thaw water that converges along the slope and forms an overland flow at the front part of the gentle slope area and a ponding depression at the slope bottom. The analyses of slope stability using the infinite slope model shows that the headwall of the slope is inevitably unstable and slides under saturated conditions, whereas the gentle slope area and slope bottom with slight creep displacement are relatively stable. The small retrogressive thaw slump is in an early development stage. With increasing degree of thaw settlement and rate of erosion, the headwall will become steeper and a thermokarst lake will form at the slope bottom.																			0169-555X	1872-695X				SEP 15	2017	293		A				1	10		10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.04.045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.04.045													WOS:000412257100001

Thinning increases climatic resilience of red pine	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Forest management techniques such as intermediate stand-tending practices (e. g., thinning) can promote climatic resiliency in forest stands by moderating tree competition. Residual trees gain increased access to environmental resources (i.e., soil moisture, light), which in turn has the potential to buffer trees from stressful climatic conditions. The influences of climate (temperature and precipitation) and forest management (thinning method and intensity) on the productivity of red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) in Michigan were examined to assess whether repeated thinning treatments were able to increase climatic resiliency (i.e., maintaining productivity and reduced sensitivity to climatic stress). The cumulative productivity of each thinning treatment was determined, and it was found that thinning from below to a residual basal area of 14 m(2).ha(-1) produced the largest average tree size but also the second lowest overall biomass per acre. On the other hand, the uncut control and the thinning from above to a residual basal area of 28 m(2).ha(-1) produced the smallest average tree size but also the greatest overall biomass per acre. Dendrochronological methods were used to quantify sensitivity of annual radial growth to monthly and seasonal climatic factors for each thinning treatment type. Climatic sensitivity was influenced by thinning method (i.e., thinning from below decreased sensitivity to climatic stress more than thinning from above) and by thinning intensity (i.e., more intense thinning led to a lower climatic sensitivity). Overall, thinning from below to a residual basal area of 21 m(2).ha(-1) represented a potentially beneficial compromise to maximize tree size, biomass per acre, and reduced sensitivity to climatic stress, and, thus, the highest level of climatic resilience.					; Bradford, John/E-5545-2011	Palik, Brian/0000-0003-0300-9644; Bradford, John/0000-0001-9257-6303													0045-5067	1208-6037				SEP	2013	43	9					878	889		10.1139/cjfr-2013-0088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-0088													WOS:000324240200012

One valuable feature of these environments is that they constitute areas of high biodiversity. Ecologists are, therefore, under great pressure to improve their understanding of the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on the biodiversity of saline lakes. In this study, a total of 257 samples from 32 soda pans in Central Europe between 2006 and 2015 were examined. The effects of environmental variables and of geographical and limnoecological factors on functional diversity were analyzed. Furthermore, the explanatory power of the trait-based approach was assessed, and the applicability of the indices for biomonitoring purposes was determined. It was found that low habitat heterogeneity and harsh environments lead to the selection of a small number of suitable traits, and consequently, to a naturally low level of functional diversity. Anthropogenic activities enhance diversity at functional level due to the shift toward freshwater characteristics. On the regional scale, the effects of the region and status (natural, degraded, reconstructed) on diatom functional diversity were significant and more pronounced than that of the environmental and other limnoecological factors. The degree of variance found in functional diversity ascribed to environmental variables is five times greater in the case of the application of a trait-based approach, than when a taxonomic one is employed in the literature. Each of the tested functional diversity indices was sensitive to the most important environmental variables. Furthermore, these were type-specific and proved to be more complex indicators than taxonomic metrics. It is possible to suggest four functional diversity indices (FGR, FRic, FDis, and FDiv) which emphasize their independence from substrate and seasonal variations for ecological status assessment and conservation planning.

J	Wild, TB; Loucks, DP; Annandale, GW; Kaini, P				Wild, Thomas B.; Loucks, Daniel P.; Annandale, George W.; Kaini, Prakash			Maintaining Sediment Flows through Hydropower Dams in the Mekong River Basin	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												The planning, design, and construction of hydropower dams are occurring at a rapid pace in the Mekong/Lancang River Basin in Southeast Asia. For years the river and its tributaries transported an average of 160 million metric tons of sediment per year to the South China Sea. Reservoirs are expected to trap significant fractions of this sediment, rendering much of it unavailable to transport nutrients and maintain the river's geomorphic structure and ecological habitats. This paper introduces and applies a method for identifying and evaluating alternative dam siting, design, and operating (SDO) policy options that could help maintain more natural sediment regimes and for evaluating the effect of these sediment-management strategies on hydropower production. This paper focuses on the planned Lower Sesan 2 (LSS2) Dam in Cambodia. This dam would prevent a significant source of sediment from reaching critical Mekong ecosystems, such as Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. The concept of replacing LSS2 as planned with several smaller alternative dams with SDO modifications to enable reservoir sediment flushing is evaluated. These modifications could increase sediment discharge from this site by as much as three to four times compared to current plans but reduce short-term annual energy production by a third or more. Results demonstrate that most of the loss in energy production associated with SDO modifications (at least 94% in the cases considered) results from reduced reservoir size as opposed to modified reservoir operations. It is also found that, from an operational standpoint, sediment flushing is likely best conducted during the transition period between the dry and wet seasons.

Bacterial communities in soil mimic patterns of vegetative succession and ecosystem climax but are resilient to change between seasons	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Organism succession during ecosystem development has been researched for aboveground plant communities, however, the associated patterns of change in below-ground microbial communities are less described. In 2008, a study was initiated along a developmental sand-dune soil chronosequence bordering northern Lake Michigan near Wilderness Park (WP). It was hypothesized that soil bacterial communities would follow a pattern of change that is associated with soil, plant, and ecosystem development. This study included 5 replicate sites along 9 soils (n = 45) ranging in age from 105 to 4010 years since deposition. Soil bacterial community composition and diversity were studied using bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Bray-Curtis ordination indicated that bacterial community assembly changed along the developmental soil and plant gradient. The changes were not affected by seasonal differences, despite likely differences in plant root C (e.g. exudates), temperature, and water availability in soil. Soil base cations (Ca, Mg) and pH declined, showing log-linear correlations with soil age (r similar to 0.83, 0.84 and 0.81; P < 0.01). Bacterial diversity (Simpson's 1/D) declined rapidly during the initial stages of soil development ( similar to 105-450 y) and thereafter (>450 y) did not change. Turnover of plant taxa was also more rapid early during ecosystem development and correlated with bacterial community structural change (P < 0.000001; r = 0.56). It is hypothesized that plants help to drive pedogenic change during early (<450 y) soil development (e.g. pH decline, cation leaching) which drive selection of soil bacterial communities. In mature soils (similar to 450-4000 y), resilient and stable soil bacterial community structures developed, mimicking steady-state climax communities that were observed during latter stages of primary plant succession. These relationships point to possible feedbacks between plant and bacterial communities during ecosystem development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The levels of Sigma 12PBDEs and Sigma(6)NBFRs in urban sites were significantly higher than those in rural sites and background sites. The higher detection rate and concentrations of high molecular weight PBDEs and NBFRs in Phase II indicated the changing of the commercial pattern of BFRs after the phase out of PBDEs in China. Temperature was the major factor affecting the seasonal variations of molecular weight BFRs in atmosphere. A significant correlation between BFRs concentration and gross domestic product (GDP) was observed, with the GDP parameter explained 59.4% and 72.7% of the total variability for Octa-BDEs and low molecular weight NBFRs, respectively. Our findings indicated an evolving commercial usage of BFRs from SAMP-I to SAMP-II, i.e. shifting from lower molecular weight to higher molecular weight congeners in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Having techniques to access deep subglacial environments reliably paves the way for subglacial lake exploration beneath the thick central West Antarctic Ice Sheet. An ideal candidate lake, overlain by similar to 2650 m of ice, identified by Centro de Estudios Cientificos (CECs), Chile, has led to collaboration with British Antarctic Survey to access Subglacial Lake CECs (SLCECs). To conform with the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research code of conduct, which provides a guide to responsible scientific exploration and stewardship of these pristine systems, any access drilling must minimise all aspects of contamination and disturbance of the subglacial environment. To meet these challenges, along with thicker ice and 2000 m elevation, pumping and water treatment systems developed for the Subglacial Lake Ellsworth project, together with new diesel generators, additional water heating and longer drill hose, are currently being integrated with the BEAMISH hot water drill. A dedicated test season near SLCECs will commission the new clean hot water drill, with testing and validation of all clean operating procedures. A subsequent season will then access SLCECs cleanly.					; Makinson, Keith/A-2495-2013; Smith, Angela/AAV-5948-2021	Goodger, David/0000-0003-3188-6812; Anker, Paul/0000-0002-4359-4342; SMITH, ANDREW/0000-0001-8577-482X; Makinson, Keith/0000-0002-5791-1767; Rix, Julius/0000-0002-8048-9445; Silva, Alejandro/0000-0003-0553-2893; Uribe Parada, Jose Andres/0000-0002-5281-2719; Garces Pezo, Jonathan Alejandro/0000-0002-1319-9253													0260-3055	1727-5644				SEP	2021	62	85-86					250	262		10.1017/aog.2020.88	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/aog.2020.88													WOS:000756851600007

Abiotic factors examined in lab include manipulating temperature (17-31 degrees C), conductivity (0.226-1.225 mS/cm) and turbulence. Planktothrix-specific chytrids are present throughout the bloom period and are occasionally at high enough densities to exert parasitic pressure on their hosts. Temperatures above 27.1 degrees C in lab can inhibit chytrid infection, indicating the presence of a possible upper thermal refuge for the host. Data suggest that chytrids can survive conductivity spikes in lab at levels three-fold above Sandusky Bay waters if given sufficient time (7-12 days), whereas increased turbulence in lab severely inhibits chytrid infections, perhaps due to disruption of chemical signaling. Overall, these data provide insights into the environmental conditions that inhibit chytrid infections during Planktothrix-dominated blooms in temperate waters.					; McKindles, Katelyn/AAJ-8748-2021; McKay, Robert/P-3759-2017; Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010	Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896; McKay, Robert/0000-0003-2723-5371; Manes, Makayla/0009-0003-8405-1090; McKindles, Katelyn/0000-0002-6352-0375													0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP-OCT	2021	43	5					658	672		10.1093/plankt/fbab058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbab058		AUG 2021						34588922					WOS:000705381700004

Here, we investigated intra-annual variation in the landing and growth patterns of three mollusc species, i.e., Corbicula moreletiana, Pila virescens and Pila ampullacea, using one-year daily data on landing catches and values, recorded in Kampong Chhnang province of Tonle Sap (TS) Lake. Overall, 8330 tonnes with a first sale landing value of US$ 1.4 million for the three species were reported. Also, we found that C. moreletiana was abundant during the dry season with high temperature and less precipitation. By contrast, the two Pila species were abundant from the early rainy to early dry seasons when precipitation and water levels increase. The length-weight relationship analysis indicated that a faster growth in weight of Pila species occurred in the rainy season, and a general negative allometric growth was observed for the three species. This implies that their populations were intensively fished. Our preliminary results suggest that molluscs in the TS Lake (i) are important resources in support of people's livelihoods, (ii) respond differently to intra-annual variation in temperature, precipitation and hydrology and (iii) are being intensively exploited with significant reduction in growth rate. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further comprehensive research describing status of mollusc stocks and their ecology to support long-term management and conservation of this important aquatic fauna. Our study contributes to establishing the first important baseline data and information on key mollusc species for the TS.

J	Spafford, L; Risk, D				Spafford, Lynsay; Risk, David			Spatiotemporal Variability in Lake-Atmosphere Net CO2 Exchange in the Littoral Zone of an Oligotrophic Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lakes may function as either sinks or sources of CO2. Their response to climate change is uncertain, as we lack continuous data of lake CO2 efflux and its drivers. This is especially true in the littoral zone of lakes, which can be very dynamic from the continuous injection and remobilization of terrestrial nutrients. This study used high-frequency measurements of CO2 exchange during the ice-free season by prototype low-power floating forced diffusion autochambers. We quantified the net surface flux of CO2 across a transect of the littoral zone of a small deep oligotrophic lake in eastern Nova Scotia, Canada, and examined potential drivers. The littoral zone was a net source for CO2, on average emitting 0.171 +/- 0.023 mu mol CO2 . m(-2) . s(-1), but we did observe significant temporal variation across diel and seasonal periods, as well as with distance from shore. While no pelagic environmental driver appeared to explain this variability in CO2 exchange, our study suggests that factors that vary on a fine spatial scale within the littoral zone may effectively regulate CO2 exchange. If environmental drivers of pelagic CO2 exchange are unrelated to CO2 exchange in the littoral zone, this may have large implications for current mechanistic understandings of lake carbon dynamics and for upscalings of fluxes. This work shows the spatial and temporal variability of littoral CO2 efflux, as well as the utility of low-power forced diffusion automated chambers for observing lake-atmosphere net CO2 exchange. Plain Language Summary Lakes influence global climate change by exchanging gases with the atmosphere. We lack detailed data sets of such exchanges, especially in the shallow littoral zone of lakes. We employed a novel technique to measure the release of carbon dioxide from the surface waters of the littoral zone of a clearwater lake in Nova Scotia, Canada. We discovered that the littoral zone had a net release of CO2, which varied over time on daily to seasonal scales, as well as over space with distance from the shore. We were unable to find a relationship between the factors known to promote gas exchange in the deeper part of lakes and gas exchange in the shallow littoral zone. Our findings suggest that current mechanistic understandings of lake carbon dynamics may need to be adapted to better reflect dynamics within the shallow littoral zone. Our work also demonstrates the utility of our cost-effective novel technique in observing the exchange of CO2 between the lake and atmosphere.

During recent decades, climate change and re-oligotrophication have been affecting many lakes. Most long-term research focuses on large North American and northern European lakes, but climate forcing south of the Alps seems to be different. Furthermore, lake restoration frequently involves smaller lakes (<10 km(2)) that are often overlooked in long-term limnological studies despite their importance for local stakeholders. We investigated the effects of climate change and re-oligotrophication on the thermal structure of Lake Caldonazzo (Italy - southern Alps; area = 5.6 km(2); maximum depth = 49 m) for the years 1973-2014. The lake received untreated wastewaters from its catchment until the mid-1970s, leading to algal blooms, severe hypolimnetic anoxia and fish kills. Afterwards, local government initiated sewage removal that was completed in 1989. 2. We used transparency, phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations as trophic indicators, air temperature and global circulation indices as climatic indicators and epilimnion depth and temperature, hypolimnion temperature, thermocline depth and Schmidt stability as indicators of thermal structure. For these time series, we determined trend patterns and timing of change points. 3. Epilimnetic temperatures showed an upward shift in 1985. Here, we present an alternative explanation for this observed change that generally has been attributed to global circulation indices. Epilimnetic depth continually increased until 1989, but less markedly afterwards. We suggest that until restoration continued, the increasingly deeper epilimnion absorbed the incoming heat of climate change without increasing epilimnetic temperature. After sewage removal, however, the epilimnion did not deepen enough to prevent an upward shift in epilimnetic temperature. We linked the deepening of the epilimnion to increased water transparency. 4. Hypolimnetic temperatures showed a downward shift in 1998. Hypolimnetic cooling has been seldom observed and was in our case related to specific interactions between re-oligotrophication, climate and lake depth. Penetration of incident solar radiation was insufficient to heat the hypolimnion (>50% of lake volume), while deeper mixing released accumulated heat from the previous season and earlier stratification trapped colder water in the hypolimnion. We suggest that these combined effects resulted in a decrease in hypolimnetic temperature. 5. Our study indicated that re-oligotrophication mitigated the effects of climate change, but when re-oligotrophication was no longer progressing, the effects of climate on thermal structure were perceivable. These changes were site specific and not tied to atmospheric circulation indices. Epilimnetic warming in particular will have repercussions on plankton dynamics. Management of non-point sources of nutrients will become increasingly important to limit the eutrophication-like effects of climate change, especially in the case of a warming epilimnion.

However, owing to the interference of water spectrum signals, it is difficult to extract the emerging aquatic vegetation information from remote sensing images, especially to distinguish between EAV and FAV. This study first proposed an enhanced aquatic vegetation index based on the difference in two short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands to extract the aquatic vegetation above the water surface, and then, the EAV and FAV were further distinguished coupled with the phenological characteristics, subsequently, a case study of Taihu Lake for accurately extracting seasonal and annual distributions. The results demonstrate that the proposed aquatic vegetation index is highly sensitive to EAV and FAV, and can further distinguish EAV from them coupled with phenological difference. Additionally, the dramatic changes in EAV and FAV in time and space indicated that human purse seine culture has had a great influence on the succession of aquatic vegetation, which may lead to the deterioration of the water ecology environment. Using the SWIR bands coupled with phenological difference is a promising method for recognizing aquatic vegetation above the water surface owing that it can weaken and eliminate the impact of algal bloom at the same time.					; Lyu, Heng/F-3335-2017; Bi, Shun/MSY-5753-2025	Wang, Huaijing/0000-0001-5415-1208; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2022	136								108607	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108607	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108607		FEB 2022											WOS:000761453800001

However, little is known about the distribution of SMFs in river-lake systems. In this study, the occurrence and risks of six SMFs measured in sediments from Lake Chaohu (eastern China) and the rivers flowing into it were investigated. The total sedimentary SMF concentrations ranged from 2.43 to 15.5 ng/g in Lake Chaohu (median = 5.17 ng/g), and 2.34-104 ng/g in the rivers (median = 10.6 ng/g). Overall, moderate levels of SMFs were found in comparison with previous results from other areas. Galaxolide and tonalide dominated in the rivers whereas cashmeran was dominant in Lake Chaohu. A source assessment indicated that the discharge from industries contributed importantly to the pollution of SMFs in the studied waters, in addition to the inputs from domestic sewage. Our estimates suggested that the current sedimentary SMF concentrations were likely to pose extremely low ecological risk to aquatic organisms. However, more studies are needed to focus on the spatial and temporal trends in distribution as well as the ecotoxicological implications of SMFs in the Lake Chaohu area because there is a general lack of relevant information.

Results from cell-based bioassays suggested the occurrence of estrogenic, anti-estrogenic, anti-androgenic, and anti-glucocorticogenic activities, while no androgenic and glucocorticogenic activities were observed in the collected samples. Using an UPLC-MS/MS system, 29 endocrine disrupting compounds including seven estrogens, seven androgens, six progestogens, and five adrenocortical hormones and four industrial pollutants were simultaneously detected. 17, 20 and 12 chemicals were detected at least in one of the water samples, cyanobloom samples and sediment samples, respectively. Since both agonistic and antagonistic endocrine-disruptive activities were detected in the present study, commonly used receptor-based in vitro bioassays resulted in net effects, suggesting that the hormone receptor agonistic potentials might be underestimated with this practice. The EDCs detected in cyanobloom samples also highlight the necessity to consider the phytoplankton matrix for understanding the mass fluxes of endocrine disruptors in eutrophic freshwaters and to consider it in monitoring strategies.

Atmospheric dry and wet deposition of total phosphorus to the Great Lakes	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Quantifying atmospheric loadings of total phosphorus (TP) to freshwater environments is essential to improve understanding of its fate and transport, and to mitigate the effects of excessive levels in freshwater ecosystems. To date, atmospheric deposition of TP in the U.S. is poorly characterized due to the lack of long-term deposition observations. Here, we integrate several historical datasets to develop an estimate of dry and wet deposition to the Great Lakes region. For dry deposition, we use TP concentrations in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples from fourteen land-based IMPROVE sites (2013-2020) upwind of the Great Lakes to provide new fine particle phosphorus dry deposition estimates. For wet deposition, we use TP concentrations in wet-only precipitation samples collected at eleven land-based sites (2001-2009) in the Great Lakes region. For both wet and dry deposition, a seasonal cycle is evident with higher concentrations in warmer and wetter months when compared to colder months. Additionally, there is an increasing gradient from north to south in wet deposition, likely driven by both higher precipitation and increased emissions near southern sites. Despite different sampling time periods, these updated observations can provide further constraints on the TP loadings to each of the five Great Lakes. We estimate annual deposition of TP to Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario at 526, 702, 495, 212, and 185 MTA per year, which is lower than prior estimates for Lakes Superior, Erie and Ontario, comparable for Lake Huron, and about two times greater for Lake Michigan. When considering only the contribution of fine particulate PM to the dry deposition, wet deposition dominated over dry at all lakes except for Lake Huron. However, prior global estimates suggest greater contributions from larger particles (PM10 and PM100), yet observations to validate these estimates over the Great Lakes are not available. Our findings indicate that dry deposition of a range of particle sizes are needed to constrain the total atmospheric deposition of TP over the Great Lakes.					; Xi, Chuanwu/C-7432-2011; Landis, Matthew/P-5149-2014; Steiner, Allison/AAC-7029-2020; Dvonch, Joseph/K-3632-2013; Mahowald, Natalie/D-8388-2013	Xi, Chuanwu/0000-0002-7554-1915; Landis, Matthew/0000-0002-8742-496X; Oriol, Lunia/0000-0002-3794-1563; Mahowald, Natalie/0000-0002-2873-997X													1352-2310	1873-2844				NOV 15	2023	313								120049	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.120049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.120049		SEP 2023						37840812					WOS:001077713900001

Differences in ebullitive methane release from small, shallow ponds present challenges for scaling	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Small, shallow waterbodies are potentially important sites of greenhouse gas release to the atmosphere. The role of ebullition may be enhanced here relative to larger and deeper systems, due to their shallow water, but these features remain relatively infrequently studied in comparison to larger systems. Herein, we quantify ebullitive release of methane (CH4) in small shallow ponds in three regions of North America and investigate the role of potential drivers. Shallow ponds exhibited open-water season ebullitive CH4 release rates as high as 40 mmol m(-2) d(-1), higher than previously reported for similar systems. Ebullitive release of CH4 varied by four orders of magnitude across our 15 study sites, with differences in flux rates both within and between regions. What is less clear are the drivers responsible for these differences. There were few relationships between open water- season ebullitive flux and physicochemical characteristics, including organic matter, temperature, and sulphate. Temperature was only weakly related to ebullitive CH4 release across the study when considering all observation intervals. Only four individual sites exhibited significant relationships between temperature and ebullitive CH4 release. Other sites were unresponsive to temperature, and region-specific factors may play a role. There is some evidence that where surface water sulphate concentrations are high, CH4 production and release may be suppressed. Missouri sites (n = 5) had characteristically low ebullitive CH(4 )release; here bioturbation could be important. While this work greatly expands the number of open-water season ebullition rates for small and shallow ponds, more research is needed to disentangle the role of different drivers. Further investigation of the potential thresholding behaviour of sulphate as a control on ebullitive CH4 release in lentic systems is one such opportunity. What is clear, however, is that efforts to scale emissions (e.g., as a function of temperature) must be undertaken with caution. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that floodplain contribution to fish diet would be maximal during the early growing period following the seasonal flood and at sites located closest to the floodplain. Carbon stable isotope ratios (delta C-13) of invertebrates and 35 fish species were analyzed at the beginning and at the end of two growing seasons, at increasing distances from the floodplain. Floodplain contribution, in the form of exported aquatic invertebrates, was estimated at the fish community (littoral versus main river), species and individual fish level, using a stable isotopic mixing model and a linear mixed model selection. As hypothesized, fish captured in the early part of the growing season near the floodplain benefitted from the largest floodplain contribution, which decreased during the late growing season. In addition, floodplain contribution differed among fish species, being higher in small or immature littoral species (northern pike, yellow perch, blackchin and golden shiners) than for larger taxa inhabiting the main river channel (shorthead redhorse, white sucker and channel catfish). Our study revealed that floodplain production during the early growing season represents a key food resource to a large portion of the riverine food web, thus highlighting the essential role of the floodplain in human-altered temperate rivers.

Influence of Environmental Drivers and Potential Interactions on the Distribution of Microbial Communities From Three Permanently Stratified Antarctic Lakes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The McMurdo Dry Valley (MDV) lakes represent unique habitats in the microbial world. Perennial ice covers protect liquid water columns from either significant allochthonous inputs or seasonal mixing, resulting in centuries of stable biogeochemistry. Extreme environmental conditions including low seasonal photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), near freezing temperatures, and oligotrophy have precluded higher trophic levels from the food webs. Despite these limitations, diverse microbial life flourishes in the stratified water columns, including Archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists, and viruses. While a few recent studies have applied next generation sequencing, a thorough understanding of the MDV lake microbial diversity and community structure is currently lacking. Here we used Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes combined with a microscopic survey of key eukaryotes to compare the community structure and potential interactions among the bacterial and eukaryal communities within the water columns of Lakes Bonney (east and west lobes, ELB, and WLB, respectively) and Fryxell (FRX). Communities were distinct between the upper, oxic layers and the dark, anoxic waters, particularly among the bacterial communities residing in WLB and FRX. Both eukaryal and bacterial community structure was influenced by different biogeochemical parameters in the oxic and anoxic zones. Bacteria formed complex interaction networks which were lake-specific. Several eukaryotes exhibit potential interactions with bacteria in ELB and WLB, while interactions between these groups in the more productive FRX were relatively rare.																			1664-302X					MAY 15	2019	10								1067	10.3389/fmicb.2019.01067	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01067								31156585					WOS:000467958000001

Mn/Ca intra- and inter-test variability in the benthic foraminifer Ammonia tepida	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The adaptation of some benthic foraminiferal species to low-oxygen conditions provides the prospect of using the chemical composition of their tests as proxies for bottom water oxygenation. Manganese may be particularly suitable as such a geochemical proxy because this redox element is soluble in reduced form (Mn2+) and hence can be incorporated into benthic foraminiferal tests under low-oxygen conditions. Therefore, intra-and inter-test differences in foraminiferal Mn/Ca ratios may hold important information about short-term variability in pore water Mn2+ concentrations and sediment redox conditions. Here, we studied Mn/Ca intra-and inter-test variability in living individuals of the shallow infaunal foraminifer Ammonia tepida sampled in Lake Grevelingen (the Netherlands) in three different months of 2012. The deeper parts of this lake are characterized by seasonal hypoxia/anoxia with associated shifts in microbial activity and sediment geochemistry, leading to seasonal Mn2+ accumulation in the pore water. Earlier laboratory experiments with similar seawater Mn2+ concentrations as encountered in the pore waters of Lake Grevelingen suggest that intra-test variability due to ontogenetic trends (i.e. size-related effects) and/or other vital effects occurring during calcification in A. tepida (11-25% relative SD, RSD) is responsible for part of the observed variability in Mn/Ca. Our present results show that the seasonally highly dynamic environmental conditions in the study area lead to a strongly increased Mn/Ca intra-and inter-test variability (average of 45% RSD). Within single specimens, both increasing and decreasing trends in Mn/Ca ratios with size are observed. Our results suggest that the variability in successive single-chamber Mn/Ca ratios reflects the temporal variability in pore water Mn2+. Additionally, active or passive migration of the foraminifera in the surface sediment may explain part of the observed Mn/Ca variability.

Long-term dynamics of dissolved organic carbon: Implications for drinking water supply	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Surface waters are the main source of drinking water in many regions. Increasing organic carbon concentrations are a cause for concern in Nordic countries since both dissolved and particulate organic carbon can transport contaminants and adversely affect drinking water treatment processes. We present a long-term study of dynamics of total (particulate and dissolved) organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in the River Fyris. This river supplies drinking water to approximately 200000 people in Uppsala, Sweden. The River Fyris is a main tributary to Lake Malaren, which supplies drinking water to approximately 2 million people in the greater Stockholm area. Utilities responsible for drinking water supply in both Uppsala and Stockholm have expressed concerns about possible increases in TOC. We evaluate organic carbon dynamics within the Fyris catchment by calculating areal mass exports using observed TOC concentrations and modeled flows and by modeling dissolved organic carbon (as a proxy for TOC) using the dynamic, process based INCA-C model. Exports of TOC from the catchment ranged from 0.8 to 5.8 g m(-2) year(-1) in the period 1995-2010. The variation in annual exports was related to climatic variability which influenced seasonality and amount of runoff. Exports and discharge uncoupled at the end of 2008. A dramatic increase in TOC concentrations was observed in 2009, which gradually declined in 2010-2011. INCA-C successfully reproduced the intra- and inter-annual variation in concentrations during 1996-2008 and 2010-2011 but failed to capture the anomalous increase in 2009. We evaluated a number of hypotheses to explain the anomaly in 2009 TOC values, ultimately none proved satisfactory. We draw two main conclusions: there is at least one unknown or unmeasured process controlling or influencing surface water TOC and INCA-C can be used as part of the decision-making process for current and future use of rivers for drinking water supply.

Seasonal and interannual effects of hypoxia on fish habitat quality in central Lake Erie	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Hypoxia occurs seasonally in many stratified coastal marine and freshwater ecosystems when bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations are depleted below 2-3 mg O-2 L-1. 2. We evaluated the effects of hypoxia on fish habitat quality in the central basin of Lake Erie from 1987 to 2005, using bioenergetic growth rate potential (GRP) as a proxy for habitat quality. We compared the effect of hypoxia on habitat quality of (i) rainbow smelt, Osmerus mordax mordax Mitchill (young-of-year, YOY, and adult), a cold-water planktivore, (ii) emerald shiner, Notropis atherinoides Rafinesque (adult), a warm-water planktivore, (iii) yellow perch, Perca flavescens Mitchill (YOY and adult), a cool-water benthopelagic omnivore and (iv) round goby Neogobius melanostomus Pallas (adult) a eurythermal benthivore. Annual thermal and DO profiles were generated from 1D thermal and DO hydrodynamics models developed for Lake Erie's central basin. 3. Hypoxia occurred annually, typically from mid-July to mid-October, which spatially and temporally overlaps with otherwise high benthic habitat quality. Hypoxia reduced the habitat quality across fish species and life stages, but the magnitude of the reduction varied both among and within species because of the differences in tolerance to low DO levels and warm-water temperatures. 4. Across years, trends in habitat quality mirrored trends in phosphorus concentration and water column oxygen demand in central Lake Erie. The per cent reduction in habitat quality owing to hypoxia was greatest for adult rainbow smelt and round goby (mean: -35%), followed by adult emerald shiner (mean: -12%), YOY rainbow smelt (mean: -10%) and YOY and adult yellow perch (mean: -8.5%). 5. Our results highlight the importance of differential spatiotemporally interactive effects of DO and temperature on relative fish habitat quality and quantity. These effects have the potential to influence the performance of individual fish species as well as population dynamics, trophic interactions and fish community structure.

J	Sakizadeh, M; Milewski, A; Sattari, MT				Sakizadeh, Mohamad; Milewski, Adam; Sattari, Mohammad Taghi			Analysis of Long-Term Trend of Stream Flow and Interaction Effect of Land Use and Land Cover on Water Yield by SWAT Model and Statistical Learning in Part of Urmia Lake Basin, Northwest of Iran	WATER												The water yield produced at the outlet of a sub-basin is the combination of multiple interacting land uses. In the majority of previous research, while accounting for the effect of land use and land cover (LULC) on water yield, the hydrologic components of a watershed have been attributed to the dominant land use class within that sub-basin. We adopted an approach to investigate the interaction effect of LULC on water yield (WYLD) using the Johnson-Neyman (JN) method. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was employed in the Urmia Lake Basin (ULB) to estimate the WYLD following successful calibration and validation of the model by stream flow. It was found that in each sub-basin, the effect of the soil class on the WYLD was statistically significant only when the area of rangeland was less than 717 ha and when the area of agricultural lands was less than 633 ha. On the other hand, the trend of stream flow was assessed over 70 years at two stations in the Urmia Lake Basin (ULB) using the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST). The year 1991 turned out to be the most likely change point in both stations. A significant decrease in Urmia Lake's water level started in 1995, which indicated that part of this shrinkage was most likely caused by water inflow reduction over a 4-year time delay. Besides identifying the most probable seasonal and trend change points, this method has the additional capability to analyze the uncertainty of estimated points, which was lacking in earlier methods.

The results show that runoff is the main factor affecting the isotopic composition in natural-state rivers, while in rivers affected by human activities, the isotopic composition varies greatly due to the influence of impermeable surface and municipal pipe networks on water evaporation and mixing. The warm-and-humid moisture source and "heat island" effect lead to high slope and intercept of local meteoric water line (LMWL), and the characteristics of surface water line (SWL) are closely related to land types. Isotope changes along the flow path indicate significant evaporation effect in wet season, while the operation of municipal pipe networks partially conceals the evaporation effect in dry season. The intensity of river evaporation is positively correlated with the urbanization level along the river. Isotope mixing model shows that precipitation and river water are the recharge sources of groundwater in rain and dry seasons, respectively, and the mixing ratios between Jiangan River and Fuhe River shows significant seasonal variation. The combination of isotopic analysis and pollutant data reveals that the seasonal water contribution is the main factor influencing the water quality. Risks for water safety and environmental health in Chengdu and cities along lower Minjiang River were assessed.

The low freshwater inflow, evaporation, and closure of the lake mouth were the main factors for the hypersaline conditions in Pulicat Lake. The average depth and salinity were 1.8 +/- 0.12 m (0.8 to 2.8 m) and 35.3 +/- 1.68 (12.5 to 61), respectively. A total of 29 ciliate taxa belonging to 18 genera and five classes were identified. Strombidium conicum (24%) was the dominant species followed by Euplotes sp. (10.7%) and Stenosomella sp. (7.02%). Spirotrichea (84%) was the dominant class followed by Oligohymenophorea (9.6%) and Heterotrichea (5.8%). Fabrea salina, a typical species in hypersaline systems, was abundant at locations where the salinity was more than 35. Multivariate analysis using the Bray-Curtis similarity, followed by SIMPROF (Similarity Percentage Analysis), on ciliate abundance data revealed three ciliate assemblages characterizing south, central, and north of the lake at 40% similarity (SIMPROF, cophenetic correlation = 0.622, P = 5%). Both ciliate abundance and chlorophyll-a were positively correlated with salinity. Species richness and evenness were higher in the south sector when compared with those in the other two sectors. Biotic-environmental interaction through canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) inferred that the combined effects of salinity, chlorophyll-a, and nutrient levels are the key factors responsible for the distribution of the ciliate species, suggesting that ciliates can be considered to be potential bioindicators of water quality.

J	Wang, ZH; Luo, ZX; Yan, CZ; Xing, BS				Wang, Zhenhong; Luo, Zhuanxi; Yan, Changzhou; Xing, Baoshan			Impacts of environmental factors on arsenate biotransformation and release in Microcystis aeruginosa using the Taguchi experimental design approach	WATER RESEARCH												Very limited information is available on how and to what extent environmental factors influence arsenic (As) biotransformation and release in freshwater algae. These factors include concentrations of arsenate (As(V)), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N), phosphate (P), and ambient pH. This study conducted a series of experiments using Taguchi methods to determine optimum conditions for As biotransformation. We assessed principal effective factors of As(V), N, P, and pH and determined that As biotransformation and release actuate at 10.0 mu MAs(V) in dead alga cells, the As efflux ratio and organic As efflux content actuate at 1.0 mg/L P, algal growth and intracellular arsenite (As(III)) content actuate at 10.0 mg/L N, and the total sum of As(III) efflux from dead alga cells actuates at a pH level of 10. Moreover, N is the critical component for As(V) biotransformation in M. aeruginosa, specifically for As(III) transformation, because N can accelerate algal growth, subsequently improving As(III) accumulation and its efflux, which results in an As(V) to As(III) reduction. Furthermore, low P concentrations in combination with high N concentrations promote As accumulation. Following As(V), P was the primary impacting factor for As accumulation. In addition, small amounts of As accumulation under low concentrations of As and high P were securely stored in living algal cells and were easily released after cell death. Results from this study will help to assess practical applications and the overall control of key environmental factors, particularly those associated with algal bioremediation in As polluted water.

J	Singh, J; Singh, O				Singh, Jagdeep; Singh, Omvir			Assessing rainfall erosivity and erosivity density over a western Himalayan catchment, India	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												The present study aims to assess rainfall erosivity and erosivty density both in space and time over the Suketi River catchment of western Himalayan region in India during 1971-2015. The data used comprises of daily rainfall measurements at three rain gauge stations, which are sparsely distributed over the catchment. Rainfall erosivity was assessed by employing Wischmeier and Smith algorithms, whereas erosivity density was estimated by applying Kinnell's algorithm. The spatial distribution of both algorithms was analyzed through Kriging method based on geographical information system. The obtained results indicate remarkable year-to-year, seasonal and monthly variations in average annual rainfall erosivity and erosivity density. Apart from this, individual cases of high and very high rainfall erosivity and erosivity density were noticed. The long-term average annual rainfall erosivity and erosivity density revealed a general decreasing trend. This decreasing trend in rainfall erosivity was found to be statistically significant at 0.05 significance level, whereas it was found to be non-significant for erosivity density. The highest values of both indices were observed in the month of July followed by August and June particularly in northern parts. These results indicate that July month followed by August and June are the most susceptible months for soil erosion over the Suketi River catchment with lower reaches (northern) being the most vulnerable one. Finally, results of this study will be valuable for farmers, agronomists and regional planners in chalking out best management practices for reducing water erosion in vulnerable areas of the catchment.					; SINGH, OMVIR/AAT-4963-2020	SINGH, OMVIR/0000-0003-3594-4215; 													2347-4327	0973-774X				MAR 16	2020	129	1							97	10.1007/s12040-020-1362-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-020-1362-8													WOS:000521245100003

Here we present a description of the sediment (micro)facies, which in combination with a new approach to varve interpolation allows construction of a revised varve based chronology that extends the previous 2012 varve based chronology by similar to 10 ka, back to similar to 50 ka BP. Challenges in varve counting and interpolation, which were previously discussed in detail only for the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition, are described here back to similar to 50 ka BP. Furthermore, the relative merits of varve counting by XRF scanning and by thin-section microscopy are discussed. Facies analysis reveals four fades zones, their transitions driven by both local and climatic controls. The lamination quality of the sediment is highly variable and varve interpolation reveals that in the analysed time interval, on average, only 50% of the annual cycles are represented by seasonal layers. In the remaining years seasonal layers are indistinguishable, i.e. either did not form or were not preserved. For varve interpolation an advanced version of the Varve Interpolation Program was used, which enabled the construction of the longest, purely varve dated chronology published, despite long intervals of poor lamination quality. The calculated interpolation uncertainty is +8.9% and -4.6%, which is well within expectations considering the high degree of interpolation and the length of the record. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Niu, QR; Xia, M				Niu, Qianru; Xia, Meng			The role of wave-current interaction in Lake Erie's seasonal and episodic dynamics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Although the significance of surface gravity waves has been consistently emphasized in previous limnetic studies, the roles of wave-current interactions in lake dynamics are not sufficiently understood due to the lack of high-resolution wave information. With a two-way coupled hydrodynamic and wave model system, this study investigated how the Lake Erie dynamics are impacted by the wave-induced surface and radiation stresses on the seasonal-mean and episodic scales. The results showed that the surface radiation stress was the same as or an order of magnitude larger than the wave-induced surface stress in the nearshore area (<5 km offshore), while the latter prevailed in the offshore areas. By enhancing air-lake momentum and heat transfers, the wave-enhanced surface stress improved the model's skill in simulating hydrodynamics in the Central and Eastern Basins, and it was of greater importance (at least an order of magnitude larger) in modifying surges, offshore currents, and thermal structures compared to those of the radiation stress. Nevertheless, the radiation stress played key roles in wave-induced nearshore currents, especially in the shallow Western Basin. Their significances reached O (0.01-0.1 m/s) on the seasonal and episodic scales, respectively, and could have similar importance in other shallow water environments.

Using oxygen stable isotopes to quantify ecosystem metabolism in northern lakes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												In remote regions of the world, whole lake metabolic estimates are scarce, largely because long incubations, intensive sampling and deployment of monitoring equipment are impractical. The oxygen isotope (delta O-18) mass balance approach represents a simple and efficient alternative to measure whole-lake gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) from a single point sample, yet this option has not been extensively explored in habitats such as remote northern lakes. Here, we explored the applicability of the method using a sensitivity analysis on simulated data, showing that in large, heterotrophic (i.e., R > GPP) lakes, model outputs are sensitive to input terms for isotopic fractionation and air-water gas exchange. Despite these sensitivities, field applications of the delta O-18 method generated promising results that were generally consistent with parallel, free-water diel DO metabolic modelling, but greater than in vitro incubation measurements. The isotopic approach captured both wide-ranging metabolic conditions in in situ experimental mesocosms, and the seasonal trends in GPP and R in a shallow, dystrophic lake. In a clearer, deeper heterotrophic lake, the isotope approach integrated a fraction of metalimnetic metabolism missed by diel DO metabolic estimates. Overall, metalimnetic contributions to surface delta O-18-DO dynamics had the greatest impact on model outputs, but with accurate information on air-water gas exchange, mixing depth, and the vertical DO and light regime of a given system, these effects can be accounted for and the isotopic approach can yield well constrained, spatio-temporally integrated rates of GPP and R. The approach is clearly suitable for use in oligo- and mesotrophic lakes, especially in remote regions where sampling is logistically difficult.					; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	Vachon, Dominic/0000-0003-1157-5240; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159													0168-2563	1573-515X				MAY	2017	133	3					347	364		10.1007/s10533-017-0338-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-017-0338-5													WOS:000402394200009

Where previously only climatologies of the slope and curvature parameters were available, i.e., one value for every day of year, slope and curvature are now calculated for every day. This enables the retrieval of time series of vegetation optical depth (tau(alpha)) from backscatter observations. This study demonstrates the ability to detect interannual variability in vegetation dynamics using tau(alpha) derived from backscatter provided by the advanced scatterometer on-board Metop-A. tau(alpha) time series over Australia for the period 2007-2014 are compared to leaf area index (LAI) from SPOT-VEGETATION by calculating the rank correlation coefficient (r(s)) for original time series and anomalies. High values for r(s) are found over bare soil and sparse vegetation in central Australia with median r(s) values of 0.78 and 0.58, respectively. Forests and ephemeral lakes and rivers impact the retrieval of tau(alpha), and the negative values for r(s) are found in these areas. Looking at the annual averages of tau(alpha), LAI, and surface soil moisture, significantly high values are found for the anomalously wet years 2010 and 2011. Patterns in the increased tau(alpha) correspond to regions with increased soil moisture and LAI. Values for tau(alpha) and LAI are anomalous especially in sparsely vegetated regions, where the flush of grasses increases tau(alpha) and LAI. Regions with enough precipitation and higher woody vegetation component show a smaller increase in 2010 and 2011. This study demonstrates the skill of tau(alpha), and subsequently of scatterometers, to monitor the vegetation dynamics thanks to the multiincidence angle observation capability.					; Marschallinger, Berhard/AAP-8088-2020; Wagner, Wolfgang/AAC-5507-2019; Vreugdenhil, Mariette/HKF-1160-2023; Dorigo, Wouter/C-7794-2014	Vreugdenhil, Mariette/0000-0003-4913-0255; Wagner, Wolfgang/0000-0001-7704-6857; Bauer-Marschallinger, Bernhard/0000-0001-7356-7516; Dorigo, Wouter/0000-0001-8054-7572													1939-1404	2151-1535				MAY	2017	10	5	2				2240	2248		10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2618838	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2618838													WOS:000406418700014

As well as the reactivity groups of S-S-H, S-OH, and Fe-OH, defects also have the possibilities to influence the adsorption of organic contaminants. However, the role of these active sites in antibiotic adsorption on pyrite has not been deeply studied. Besides, pH, N, P, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluctuate greatly in lake at different seasons, which may change the surface characteristics of pyrite. Hence, the adsorption of TYL on natural pyrite considered solution chemistry and DOM in lake water was explored in this study. The fitting results of the kinetic and isotherm models showed that the adsorption included physical and chemical interactions. The neutral initial solution pH was conductive to TYL adsorption owing to the combined result of electrostatic and cover of Fe-oxyhydroxide. NO3- and NH4+ had no effect on TYL adsorption, whereas H2PO4- promoted adsorption by forming flocculent Fe(H2PO4)(3) precipitates. The dissolved oxygen increased adsorption. This is due to the co-promotion of the pyrite oxidation by oxygen and sulfur defects. The Fe(II)-DOM complex caused by pyrite surface oxidation reduced the concentration of TYL in solution by gathering. Except for the surface charge, reactivity groups on pyrite significantly influenced the adsorption of TYL. The bond fracture of S-S resulted in sulfur defects that contributed to pyrite oxidation. As a result, Fe(III)/Fe(II) on the surface of pyrite or in solution produced a complex Fe(III)/Fe(II) with anions and DOM. In addition, Fe(III)-S on sulfur defects interacted with the O-H of TYL through hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, the Fe-O-C bond is formed by the interaction of C-OH on TYL and Fe(III) (hydr)oxides on the surface of pyrite. The study provides a deep insight into the effect of pyrite surface active sites on amphoteric antibiotic adsorption. It helps to understand antibiotic migration and interactions with widespread pyrite in the real environment.

Over a period of 14 months at six points in 2014-2015, we conducted monthly monitoring of the virological water quality of a Japanese lake. The lake receives effluent from three surrounding wastewater treatment plants and retains water for about two weeks. These features allowed us to investigate the occurrence and fate of viruses in the lake environment. Human enteric viruses such as noroviruses and their indicators (pepper mild mottle virus and F-specific RNA bacteriophage [FRNAPH] genogroups) were quantified by PCR-based assays. Additionally, FRNAPH genogroups were quantified by infectivity-based assays to estimate the degree of virus inactivation. Pepper mild mottle virus, genogroup II (GII) norovirus, and GI-FRNAPH were identified in relatively high frequencies (positive in >40% out of 64 samples), with concentrations ranging from 1.3 x 10(1) to 2.9 x 10(4) copies/L. Human enteric viruses and some indicators were not detected and less prevalent, respectively, after April 2015. Principal component analysis revealed that the virological water quality changed gradually over time, but its differences between the sampling points were not apparent. FRNAPH genogroups were inactivated during the warm season (averaged water temperature of >20 degrees C) compared to the cool season (averaged water temperature of <20 degrees C), which may have been due to the more severe environmental stresses such as sunlight and water temperature. This suggests that the infection risk associated with the use of the lake water may have been overestimated by the gene quantification assay during the warm season. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

BDE-47 and 99 were the dominant polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners at both sites. Atmospheric PBDE concentrations in Nam Co were generally lower than those at Alert. While significant seasonal variations were observed for PBDEs at Alert, the FR concentrations at Nam Co showed no significant seasonality, even though air masses originated from distinctly different regions during different seasons. This suggests that FRs in Tibet do not have regional sources, but are reflective of truly global background contamination. Three new FRs, namely 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), 2-ethyl-1-hexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (EHTeBB) and bis(2-ethyl-1-hexyl)tetrabromophthalate (TBPH) were detected at relatively high concentrations at both sites. This is the first report of these FRs in the remote global atmosphere and suggests significant potential for long-range atmospheric transport. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One approach to mitigate this problem is to use constructed treatment wetlands. Our objectives were to determine long-term phosphorus (P) removal by a large-scale constructed treatment wetland (the marsh flow-way at Lake Apopka, Florida, USA) that treats lake water and to quantify the monetary costs for performance. The marsh flow-way treated substantial amounts of lake water (30 m yr(-1), which is about 30% of the lake's volume on an annual basis). Associated with this, P was removed at an average rate of 0.85 g m(-2) yr(-1) (2.6 metric tons yr(-1)). The marsh flow-way removed mostly particulate P, while it released dissolved P fractions (mostly during the first few years of operation; thereafter, release was negligible). The long-term first-order removal rate constant (k) for P averaged 27 m yr(-1). Phosphorus removal performance varied seasonally, with greater removal during cool periods (September-May) and poor removal during warm periods (June-August). Incurred annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs averaged $455,000 (2012$), which was equivalent to $ 1,648 ha yr(-1) or $ 177 per kilogram of P removed. We also calculated costs for a 25-year project life cycle, and compared the incurred and the 25-year costs to other systems that illustrated the marsh flow-way was cost competitive. Both P removal and costs were useful metrics in helping us determine operational and management changes. This resulted in a seasonal management strategy that contributed to increased P removal and a reduction in O&M, thereby increasing cost effectiveness. In addition to costs, treatment wetlands provide benefits that include a range of ecosystem services. We challenge ourselves and other treatment wetland managers to adopt both a cost and benefit approach to assessing system performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Significant inter-annual and seasonal variations in flood inundations were observed from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series imagery between 2000 and 2012 in the Dongting Lake. Results demonstrated that temporal changes in inundation extents derived from MODIS data were accordant with variations in annual and monthly precipitation and runoff data. Spatial and temporal dynamics of some related parameters of flood regime were analyzed as well, which included flood inundation probability, duration and start/end date of the annual largest flood. Large areas with high flood inundation probability were identified in 2000 and 2002, but relatively small regions with great flood inundation probability occurred in 2001, 2006, and 2011. Long flood durations were observed in 2000, 2002, 2008, 2010, and 2012, whereas short flood durations occurred in 2001, 2006, and 2011. Correlation analysis techniques were applied to explore spatial-temporal relationships between parameters associated with flood regime and wetland landscape patterns from 2000 to 2012. In addition, this paper presented comprehensive discussions on development of related parameters of flood regime and their influences on wetland landscape pattern after impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir, changes in wetland landscape patterns after the flood period, and the role of flooding in wetland evolution and vegetation succession. These results can provide scientific guidance and baseline data for wetland management and long-term monitoring of wetland ecological environment in the Dongting Lake.

Capturing the spatial variability of algal bloom development in a shallow temperate lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Algal blooms can have profound effects on the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems and have the potential to interrupt valuable ecosystem services. Despite the potential ecological and economic consequences of algal blooms, the spatial dynamics of bloom development in spatially complex ecosystems such as shallow lakes remain poorly characterised. Our goal was to evaluate the magnitude and drivers of spatial variability of algal biomass, dissolved oxygen, and pH over the course of a season, in a shallow lake in order to better understand the spatial dynamics of algal blooms in these ecosystems. We sampled 98 locations in a small eutrophic lake on a 65-m grid for several parameters (chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature), weekly over 122 days. This was done to estimate the dynamics of variability and spatial autocorrelation during the course of multiple bloom events. We also compared the spatial measurements to a high frequency sensor deployed at a fixed station and estimated the optimal spatial sampling resolution by performing a rarefaction analysis. Spatial heterogeneity of algal pigments was high, particularly during bloom events, and this pattern and the overall severity of the bloom were not well captured with the fixed station monitoring. The pattern of algal pigments and other limnologically important variables (dissolved oxygen and pH) was related to the direction of prevailing winds 24 hr prior to sampling, the shallow northern basin where the main surface inlet is located, and heavy precipitation. Additionally, a dense bed of floating-leaf macrophytes contributed to local patchiness in all variables. Finally, from the rarefaction analysis we found that minimal information about the mean state of the ecosystem was gained after c. 30 locations had been sampled. This study revealed how spatially heterogeneous shallow lakes are over the course of a single season, and that the magnitude of variability was highest during biologically intensive periods such as algal blooms. As such, continued research is needed across a range of trophic conditions to better understand the structure of horizontal variability in lakes. Overall, these data demonstrate the need for spatially explicit monitoring to better understand the dynamics and drivers of algal blooms in shallow lakes and to better manage ecosystem services.					; Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020	Ortiz, David/0000-0003-4605-3530; Wilkinson, Grace/0000-0003-4051-2249; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2021	66	11					2064	2075		10.1111/fwb.13814	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13814		AUG 2021											WOS:000684933700001

Impact of flow conditions on coliform dynamics in an urban lake in the Brazilian semiarid	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												The seasonal and interannual variations of total coliforms (TC) and Escherichia coli (EC) were investigated in an urban tropical lake. Precipitation and flow rate were the controlling parameters influencing coliform dynamics. Correlations were obtained to describe the lake inlet conditions of flow rate, TC and EC. While TC increased with flow rate, EC slightly decreased. This unexpected behaviour for EC was attributed to the counterbalancing impact of coliform loading and surface runoff dilution. Correlations were computed to obtain first-order decay rates of TC and EC as functions of the Reynolds number, assuming the plug-flow model. A general mechanistic-empirical model was proposed to simulate coliform dynamics. The results indicated that seasonal coliform variations are more pronounced than interannual variations. Considering both the plug-flow and complete-mix models, it was shown that eliminating dry weather load reduces TC and EC but still leads to exceedances of the mandatory standards during the rainy season.

Irrigation application efficiency (AE) at nine experimental fields showed a wide range, from 20 to 80%, but was mostly between 40 and 60%. Irrigation water-use efficiency (IWUE) varied from 1.9 to 7.2 kg m(-3) for onion and 0.9 to 1.2 kg m(-3) for maize. The lined and earthen canal conveyance losses in Bebeks were 0.037 and 0.047 l s(-1) m(-1), whereas in Shina they were 0.033 and 0.044 l s(-1) m(-1), respectively. The overall consumed ratio (OCR) of water was 0.58 for Bebeks and varied from 0.73 to 1.2 in Shina. Both schemes are performing below the standard based on technical performance indicators. Irrigation water user associations (WUAs) were not implemented, but irrigation committees (ICs), composed of local political leaders, are managing both schemes. Canal and reservoir sedimentation from erosion of upstream catchment areas during the rainy season was the major problem.

The Lake Fonjak depositional sequence displays eight lithofacies made up of: light greenish grey clayey mud; black clayey mud mostly composed of volcanic ash; light grey silty clayey mud; dark grey sandy layer with coarse rounded fragments of volcanic rocks; light grey silty mud; dark grey silty mud; light grey silty mud; dark grey silty mud with few rootlets, and an herbaceous peat. In this depositional sequence, organic matter contents range from 9% to 59%. A correlation between the age-depth model and lithofacies of this depositional sequence suggests Late Pleistocene sediments at the base and Late Holocene sediments at the top. These Holocene sediments exhibit in XRD data various minerals assemblages with relative contents varying from 15% to 42% for quartz; 19%-37% for kaolinite; 12%-37% for micas; 5%-18% for serpentine; 1%-9% for feldspars; 5%-7% for gibbsite and 11% for olivine. As far as detrital minerals are concerned, they are: quartz, orthoclase, siderite, vivianite, hornblende, plagioclase and opaque minerals. Major element abundances in decreasing order in these sediments are as follow: silicium, aluminium, iron and titanium. The highest content of SiO2, Fe2O3, MnO, CaO, Na2O and K2O are recorded within either the volcanic ash layer or its overlapped lithofacies; whereas, P2O5, MgO, TiO2 and Al2O3 exhibit their highest values at the top of the sequence. Trace elements vary little in these sediments, except for Co which rises abruptly within the volcanic ash layer. However, Ni, Co, Cr and Cu are twice to three times enriched with respect to average shale composition; whereas V and U are depleted. REE show complex behavior, alternatively increasing and decreasing, except for Ce; and Eu with positive anomaly. The geochemical classification of these sediments ranges them within Fe-shales with few litharenite. They were deposited under dysoxic to suboxic conditions, except around 4200 cal yr BP and around 2500 cal yr BP where these conditions were anoxic. The Lake Fonjak sediments derive from highly weathered mafic rocks probably andesite as suggested by PIA: 95.32-99.10%, CIA: 86.46-97.45%, CIW: 95.70-99.12% and La/Sc vs. Co/Th diagram. This sedimentation took place within three paleoclimate phases: 13,339-4400 cal yr BP; 4400-2400 cal yr BP; and 2400 cal yr BP to present. This paleoclimate was pre-dominantly humid and marked either by the slowdown of rainfall and an intensification of the dry season, or by the reinforcement of rainfalls.																			1464-343X	1879-1956				FEB	2019	150						23	36		10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.09.024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.09.024													WOS:000460195100003
J	Kumar, P; Meena, NK; Mahajan, AK				Kumar, Pawan; Meena, Narendra Kumar; Mahajan, Ambrish Kumar			Major ion chemistry, catchment weathering and water quality of Renuka Lake, north-west Himalaya, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The water samples collected from Renuka Lake during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were analyzed to know water quality related to major ion chemistry and other essential parameters. The water is found to be slightly alkaline having pH value 7.22-8.66. Both Ca2+ and Mg2+ are observed as the dominant cations, whereas SO42- and HCO3- are dominant anions during all seasons. The Piper plot has shown Ca2+-HCO3- type of water during pre- to post-monsoon seasons. Alkaline earth metals (Ca2+ and Mg2+) are noticed to exceed over alkali metals (Na+ and K+), and weak acid (HCO3-) surpass over strong acid (SO42-) in all seasons. The carbonate weathering of surrounding rocks is found to be the dominant source of major ions for the lake during pre- to post-monsoon. The WQI values 176.45-184.91 from monsoon to pre-monsoon have revealed that the water of Renuka Lake is unsuitable for drinking. The higher value of WQI is mainly due to increased concentration of F-, which is produced fromthefluorapatite, cryolite and mica etc., and anthropogenic activities. Its concentration more than standard permissible limit may be veryharmful for human being and aquatic species. However, based on sodium per cent (11.88-15.62%), sodium adsorption ratio (0.48-0.61) and residual sodium carbonate (<2.5meq/L), the water quality is determined fit for irrigation. The lake has indicated seasonal variations of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+ and HCO3-, etc., which may be due to changing temperature, monsoon rain and human activities. Thus, stringent mitigation measures are required to reduce increased concentration of various physiochemical parameters and preservation of the Renuka Lake.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2019	78	10							319	10.1007/s12665-019-8315-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8315-z													WOS:000468096000009

The strength of stratification substantially influences the transport of water parcels from the surface to the bottom of a lake. In recent years, the stratification in Lake Biwa-the largest freshwater lake in Japan-has been stronger. However, it is difficult to reproduce the stratification well in the simulations. In the present study, we built a hydrodynamic model for the purpose of analyzing the structure of the stratification in detail. Using the model, we evaluated the reproducibility of the seasonal and annual changes of vertical water distribution and flow field in Lake Biwa from 2007 to 2011. The hydrodynamic model results show that the vertical water distribution approximately agrees with the field observations based on the statistical analysis. The seasonal change of thermal stratification is reasonably reproduced by the hydrodynamic model simulations. In the simulation, there are mainly two circulation flows at the surface layer of the lake. The first flows anticlockwise and the second flows clockwise in the northern part of Lake Biwa. In order to compensate for the surface water flow, the water under the thermocline sometimes flows in the opposite direction under each circulation flow.					; Koue, Jinichi/HHM-4256-2022	KONDO, AKIRA/0000-0001-8621-2378; MATSUO, Tomohito/0000-0002-9379-4385; Koue, Jinichi/0000-0003-2542-614X; Shimadera, Hikari/0000-0002-2233-8446													2073-4441					JAN	2018	10	1							47	10.3390/w10010047	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10010047													WOS:000424397400045

However, seasonal variation in concentrations, partitioning and bioavailability of dissolved and particulate phosphorus along the length of the Yellow River are poorly constrained. Here, we measure dissolved and suspended particulate phosphorus at 72 stations from the source to the estuary of the Yellow River during the rainy season in 2020 and dry season in 2021. Mean concentrations of total phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus and dissolved reactive phosphorus were higher in the rainy season than the dry season. Analysis with sequential fractionation indicated that generally phosphorus associated with calcium carbonate dominated the suspended particulate pool. However, phosphorus content and the relative contribution of iron-bound phosphorus in suspended particles increased during the dry season, suggesting seasonal variations in bioavailability. Reactivity of the phosphorus pools decreased from source to estuary, suggesting low export potential of bioavailable phosphorus to the Bohai Sea. The composition and reactivity of dissolved and suspended particulate phosphorus pools varies both along the length of the Yellow River and between the rainy and dry seasons, according to 31P-NMR analysis of water and suspended particulate samples from 72 stations along the Yellow River.																				2662-4435				AUG 21	2023	4	1							294	10.1038/s43247-023-00957-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00957-5													WOS:001052132100001

There, pastoral practises began during the Late Neolithic (2300 BC), but alpine dairy farming was directly evidenced so far only since the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age (1300-500 BC). The vegetation development, timberline shifts at 2280 m a.s.l. and environmental conditions of the subalpine Urschai Valley (Canton of Grisons, Switzerland) were reconstructed for the small (8 m(2)) Plan da Mattun fen based on palynological and geochemical analyses for the last six millennia. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses are among the first ones performed on a European peatland in such altitudes. A high Rb/Sr ratio in the fen peat sediments revealed an increase in catchment erosion during the time when the forests of the Upper Urschai Valley were steadily diminished probably by fire and livestock impact (2300-1700 BC). These landscape openings were paralleled by increasing micro-charcoal influx values, suggesting that prehistoric people actively set fire on purpose. Simultaneously, palynological evidence for pastoralism was revealed, such as pollen from typical herbs indicating livestock trampling, and abundant spores from coprophilous fungi. Since then, vertical transhumance and pastoral activities remained responsible for the open subalpine landscape above 2000 m a.s.l., most probably also in the context of milk and dairy production since 1300 BC, which is characteristic for the European Alps until today.					; Haas, Jean/I-8835-2018; Hajdas, Irka/C-6696-2011	Lambers, Karsten/0000-0001-6432-0925; Dietre, Benjamin/0000-0002-9959-3613; Reitmaier, Thomas/0000-0003-3810-5839; Hajdas, Irka/0000-0003-2373-2725													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2020	30	3					355	368	0959683619887419	10.1177/0959683619887419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683619887419		NOV 2019											WOS:000498320000001

Seasonal bacterial community dynamics in a full-scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal plant	WATER RESEARCH												Activated sludge is one of the most abundant and effective wastewater treatment process used to treat wastewater, and has been used in developed countries for nearly a century. In all that time, several hundreds of studies have explored the bacterial communities responsible for treatment, but most studies were based on a handful of samples and did not consider temporal dynamics. In this study, we used the DNA fingerprinting technique called automated ribosomal intergenic spacer region analysis (ARISA) to study bacterial community dynamics over a two-year period in two different treatment trains. We also used quantitative PCR to measure the variation of five phylogenetically-defined clades within the Accumulibacter lineage, which is a model polyphosphate accumulating organism. The total bacterial community exhibited seasonal patterns of change reminiscent of those observed in lakes and oceans. Surprisingly, all five Accumulibacter clades were present throughout the study, and the total Accumulibacter community was relatively stable. However, the abundance of each clade did fluctuate through time. Clade IIA dynamics correlated positively with temperature (rho = 0.65, p < 0.05) while Cade IA dynamics correlated negatively with temperature (rho = 0.35, p < 0.05). This relationship with temperature hints at the mechanisms that may be driving the seasonal patterns in overall bacterial community dynamics and provides further evidence for ecological differentiation among clades within the Accumulibacter lineage. This work provides a valuable baseline for activated sludge bacterial community variation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigated the changes in the taxonomic and functional composition of fish assemblages in the lateral connection channel between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake, China, during the dry and wet seasons and which factors drive the changes. The results indicated more lake-residence species and fewer river-lake species in the channel during the wet season than the dry season, leading to significant seasonal differences in taxonomic compositions and trait patterns. Water temperature, water level and fish migration influenced fish assemblage structures in the channel. Water-level fluctuations that limited food sources and suitable habitats promoted the migration of riverine and lake-residence fish during both seasons. Water temperature and level also significantly influenced species-specific migration. Water temperature influenced the spawning migration of river-lake fish during the wet season. Based on these results, we found temporal species-specific migration dynamics in fish assemblages in the lateral channel that were related to species' life-history traits. Therefore, we inferred that the temporal-spatial interaction of the fish community in the river-floodplain system is essentially derived from the evolutionary adaption to the monsoon climate. This process is well studied and predictable, and can be beneficial for managing the river-floodplain systems. The invasion risk of the exotic species, including fish and macroinvertebrates, should be assessed before implementing LHC restoration.

A recent study showed that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network is an effective method to identify various surface water types from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery. We use this method to produce a surface water map of China for 2015 (SWMC-2015) at a 30 m pixel size. The accuracy of SWMC-2015 was assessed with a set of random water and not water validation points. The strengths and limitations of SWMC-2015 include: the SWMC-2015 clearly shows the major lake clusters and river networks with high mapping accuracy and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficients of SWMC-2015 are 90% and 0.78, respectively. The accuracy of SWMC-2015 can be improved from perspective of training samples representation, verification sample seasonal fluctuation and mixed pixel.

Eugene			Effects of Mississippi River water on phytoplankton growth and composition in the upper Barataria estuary, Louisiana	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Diversion of river waters to adjacent estuaries may occur during wetland restoration, navigation channel development, or storms. We proposed that diversions of nitrogen- and phosphorus-enriched waters from the river to estuarine waters would result in increased phytoplankton biomass and shifts to noxious or harmful algal blooms. We tested this hypothesis by conducting four seasonal microcosm experiments in which Mississippi River water was mixed at different volume ratios with ambient estuarine waters of three lakes in the upper Barataria Basin, Louisiana, USA. These lakes included two brackish lakes that were in the path of diverted Mississippi River water, and a freshwater lake that was not. The results from the 3- to 8-day experiments yielded a predictable increase in phytoplankton biomass related to nutrient additions from Mississippi River water. The subsequent decreases in the dissolved nitrate + nitrite, soluble reactive phosphorus, and silicate concentrations explained 76 to 86% of the increase in chlorophyll a concentrations in the microcosms. Our experiments showed that cyanobacteria can successfully compete with diatoms for N and P resources even under non-limiting Si conditions and that toxic cyanobacteria densities can increase to bloom levels with increased Mississippi River water inputs to ambient waters in the microcosms. Diversions of Mississippi River into adjacent estuarine waters should be considered in relation to expected and, possibly, unexpected changes in phytoplankton communities to the receiving waters and coastal ecosystems.

No observed toxic effect concentrations were used to estimate the risks. The possible sources of the metals in each season, and the dominant source(s) at each site, were assessed using principal components analysis. The metal concentrations in the area studied were found, using t-tests, to vary both seasonally and spatially (P = 0.05). The potential risks in different seasons decreased in the order: early rainy season > dry season > late rainy season, and Cd was the dominant contributor to the total risks associated with heavy metal pollution in the two rivers. The high population and industrial site densities in the Taihu basin have had negative influences on the two rivers. The river that is used as a source of drinking water (the Taipu River) had a low average level of risks caused by the metals. Metals accumulated in environmental media were the main possible sources in the dry season, and emissions from mechanical manufacturing enterprises were the main possible sources in the rainy season. The river in the industrial area (the Wusong River) had a moderate level of risk caused by the metals, and the main sources were industrial emissions. The seasonal and spatial distributions of the heavy metals mean that risk prevention and mitigation measures should be targeted taking these variations into account.

J	van der Kamp, G; Hayashi, M				van der Kamp, Garth; Hayashi, Masaki			Groundwater-wetland ecosystem interaction in the semiarid glaciated plains of North America	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The prairie wetlands of northern USA and Canada exist in numerous topographical depressions within the glaciated landscape. The wetlands are disconnected from each other most of the time with respect to surface-water drainage. The wetland water balance is controlled by snowmelt runoff and snowdrift from the surrounding uplands, precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater exchange, and occasional "fill-spill" connections to other wetlands. Salinity of water and the seasonal variability of water level in these wetlands have a strong influence on the ecosystem. Clay-rich glacial tills, covering much of the region, have very low (0.001-0.01m/yr) hydraulic conductivity, except for the top several meters where the factures and macropores increase conductivity up to 1,000m/yr. Transpiration in the wetland margin induces infiltration and lateral flow of shallow groundwater from wetland ponds through the high-conductivity zone, which strongly affects the water balance of wetlands. In contrast, groundwater flow in the deeper low-conductivity till has minor effects on water balance, but has a strong influence on salinity because the flow direction determines if the salts accumulate in wetlands ( upward flow) or are leached out ( downward flow) under wetlands. Understanding of the roles of shallow and deep groundwater systems will improve the hydrological conceptual framework for the management of wetland ecosystems.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Bhojtal, a large man-made lake bordering the city of Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh state, central India), is important for the city's water supply, connoted the lifeline of the city. Despite the dry though not arid and markedly seasonal climate, soil impermeability hampers infiltration into the complex geology underlying the Bhojtal catchment. Rural communities in the catchment are nonetheless high dependent on underlying aquifers. This paper develops baseline understanding of trends in the ecology, water quality and uses of Bhojtal, discussing their implications for the long-term wellbeing of the Bhopal city region. It highlights increasing dependency on water diverted from out-of-catchment sources, and also abstraction across the Bhojtal catchment in excess of replenishment that is depressing groundwater and contributing to reported declining lake level and water quality. Despite some nature-based management initiatives, evidence suggests little progress in haltering on-going groundwater depression and declines in lake water level and quality. Significant declines in ecosystem services produced by Bhojtal are likely without intervention, a major concern given the high dependency of people in the Bhopal region on Bhojtal for their water supply and socio-economic and cultural wellbeing. Over-reliance on appropriation of water from increasingly remote sources is currently compensating for lack of attention to measures protecting or regenerating local resources that may provide greater resilience and regional self-sufficiency. Improved knowledge of catchment hydrogeology on a highly localised scale could improve the targeting and efficiency of water harvesting and other management interventions in the Bhojtal catchment, and their appropriate hybridisation with engineered solutions, protecting the catchment from unintended impacts of water extraction or increasing its carrying capacity, and also providing resilience to rising population and climate change. Ecosystem service assessment provides useful insights into the breadth of benefits of improved management of Bhojtal and its catchment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the roles of spatial processes are often given insufficient attention in bioassessment practices, which may bias the assessments of ecological status based on biotic metrics. Here, we quantified the relative importance and the seasonal stability of spatial processes, natural conditions and human-induced factors in structuring variation in different bioassessment metrics based on macroinvertebrate communities. Our study systems were two extensively sampled large and shallow lakes with strong nutrient gradients related to human disturbance. The roles of different drivers were examined for three kinds of indicators: general diversity, trait-based and taxonomic distinctness metrics, and their performance in characterizing human disturbance was evaluated. Overall, human-induced and spatial factors were all important in explaining variation in the three types of bioassessment metrics. Contrary to our expectations, however, we found that the importance of spatial processes on bioassessment metrics can be comparable to the effects of local environmental conditions at the within-lake scale. Furthermore, the results showed substantial seasonal variability in the relative roles of different drivers, which might be linked to life-cycle seasonality of macroinvertebrates. As expected, trait-based metrics generally were best associated with human-induced variables in both lakes, whereas general diversity and taxonomic distinctness metrics performed poorly. The low effectiveness of taxonomic distinctness metrics might due to low species richness associated with high nutrient levels. To conclude, our results suggest that bioassessment cannot exclusively rely on the idea of environmental filtering even if we focus on fine spatial scales. We hence strongly urge that spatial processes, natural drivers and temporal variability should be better considered in combination in the development and application of bioassessment approaches. In addition, taxonomic distinctness measures should be used with caution, especially for the ecosystems and organism groups typically characterized by low species richness.

In particular, the reduced water velocity caused by dams is more favorable for zooplankton development; therefore, dammed rivers are expected to support extremely diverse and abundant zooplankton communities and notably different spatiotemporal distribution patterns. So far, however, only very few molecular studies support these assumptions. Using high-throughput sequencing, a high number of 350 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 97% cutoff) were retrieved from 30 samples collected in the Xiangxi River, the nearest large tributary upstream of the Three Gorges Dam. Zooplankton did not show significant spatial distribution in the channel. Instead, the community structures varied significantly over sampling dates, corroborating the seasonal patterns found in lakes and ponds in the subtropical zone. As expected, the community compositions were deterministically governed by environmental filtering processes (phylogenetic clustering), in which water velocity appeared to be much less important than other investigated environmental factors. Moreover, most of the detected phylotypes (OTUs) had a relatively high (>90%) sequence similarity to previously deposited sequences, suggesting a mediocre degree of genetic novelty within the zooplankton communities in the Xiangxi River.

BMAA poses a great threat to the food quality and food safety of aquatic products. In this paper, high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used to detect the contents of BMAA in the edible portions of six representative freshwater aquaculture products (Corbicula fluminea, Anodonta arcaeformis, Macrobrachium nipponense, Eriocheir sinensis, Ctenopharyngodon (della, and Mylopharyngodon piceus) from Taihu Lake Basin in China. Noncarcinogenic health risks were assessed with reference to the model recommended by the International Environmental Modelling and Software Society and based on the biomagnification characteristics of BMAA in the various aquaculture products investigated by the stable nitrogen isotope technique. The average BMAA concentrations in the edible portions of the six freshwater culture products were from 2.05 +/- 1.40 to 4.21 +/- 1.26 mu g g(-1) dry weight (DW), and the difference was significant (p < 0.05), such a difference increased with the increase in the trophic level in the aquaculture products. Although a biomagnification indication was observed, the trophic magnification factor (TMF) was only 1.20 which exhibited a relatively low biomagnification efficiency. The annual health risk values of BMAA in all the measured aquatic products were within the maximum tolerable range (<1 x 10(-6) a(-1)), and the health risk increased with the increase in the trophic level. The risk values of BMAA in the six freshwater aquaculture products for children was slightly higher than the negligible level (<1 x 10(-7) a(-1)), thus there might have potential health risks for children's longterm consumption. Considering China's national conditions, the guidance values of BMAA based on the quality and safety of freshwater aquaculture products were proposed to be 7.2 mu g g(-1) DW for adults and 1.8 mu g g(-1)DW for children.

Theoretical studies have quantified the control of groundwater discharge on the depth of the hyporheic zone; however, observations of temporal groundwater controls are limited. In this study, we develop the concept of groundwater-dominated differential hyporheic zone expansion to explain the temporal control of groundwater discharge on the hyporheic zone in a third-order stream reach flowing through glacially derived terrain typical of the Great Lakes region. We define groundwater-dominated differential expansion of the hyporheic zone as: differing rates and magnitudes of hyporheic zone expansion in response to seasonal vs. storm-related water table fluctuation. Specific conductance and vertical hydraulic gradient measurements were used to map changes in the hyporheic zone during seasonal water table decline and storm events. Planar and riffle beds were monitored in order to distinguish the cause of increasing hyporheic zone depth. Planar bed seasonal expansion of the hyporheic zone was of a greater magnitude and longer in duration (weeks to months) than storm event expansion (hours to days). In contrast, the hyporheic zone beneath the riffle bed exhibited minimal expansion in response to seasonal groundwater decline compared to storm related expansion. Results indicated that fluctuation in the riparian water table controlled seasonal expansion of the hyporheic zone along the planar bed. This groundwater induced hyporheic zone expansion could increase the potential for biogeochemical cycling and natural attenuation.					; Lowry, Chris/AGR-7988-2022	Lowry, Christopher/0000-0003-0512-964X; 													0017-467X	1745-6584				MAR-APR	2016	54	2					274	285		10.1111/gwat.12352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gwat.12352								26096382					WOS:000373211200015

Seasonal dynamics in taxonomy and function within bacterial and viral metagenomic assemblages recovered from a freshwater agricultural pond	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOME												Background Ponds are important freshwater habitats that support both human and environmental activities. However, relative to their larger counterparts (e.g. rivers, lakes), ponds are understudied, especially with regard to their microbial communities. Our study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by using culture-independent, high-throughput sequencing to assess the dynamics, taxonomy, and functionality of bacterial and viral communities in a freshwater agricultural pond. Results Water samples (n = 14) were collected from a Mid-Atlantic agricultural pond between June 2017 and May 2018 and filtered sequentially through 1 and 0.2 mu m filter membranes. Total DNA was then extracted from each filter, pooled, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene and shotgun sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Additionally, on eight occasions water filtrates were processed for viral metagenomes (viromes) using chemical concentration and then shotgun sequenced. A ubiquitous freshwater phylum, Proteobacteria was abundant at all sampling dates throughout the year. However, environmental characteristics appeared to drive the structure of the community. For instance, the abundance of Cyanobacteria (e.g. Nostoc) increased with rising water temperatures, while a storm event appeared to trigger an increase in overall bacterial diversity, as well as the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. This event was also associated with an increase in the number of antibiotic resistance genes. The viral fractions were dominated by dsDNA of the order Caudovirales, namely Siphoviridae and Myovirdae. Conclusions Overall, this study provides one of the largest datasets on pond water microbial ecology to date, revealing seasonal trends in the microbial taxonomic composition and functional potential.

J	Morrissey, A; Scholz, CA				Morrissey, Amy; Scholz, Christopher A.			Paleohydrology of Lake Turkana and its influence on the Nile River system	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The detailed paleohydrological record of Lake Turkana, the largest lake in the eastern branch of the East African Rift, is necessary for determining the connectivity between adjacent watersheds in tropical Africa. The migration of both the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the Congo Air Boundary (CAB) constrains rainfall amount and duration for most of East Africa. Lake Turkana, in northern Kenya, is the world's largest desert lake and experiences two ITCZ-associated rainy seasons annually, with cumulative rainfall of -200 mm/yr. Evidence from new continuous, high-fidelity sediment core records and high-resolution CHIRP seismic reflection data suggests that Lake Turkana received enough rainfall during the African Humid Period (AHP) to fill the lake to its sill (100 m above current lake level) and spilled over into the White Nile River system. An atmospheric configuration with an eastward-shifted CAB over the Turkana region and the northern Kenya Rift is invoked as an additional source of rainfall for the catchment. This configuration began abruptly at similar to 11 ka and lasted until -5 ka when Lake Turkana became a closed basin and was cut off from the White Nile. Prior to the AHP, Lake Turkana experienced at least two desiccation events following the Last Glacial Maximum at 18.5 and 17 ka when the lake was at least 100 m lower than modem, as evidenced by basin-wide, high amplitude reflections and C-14-dated shallow water facies in sediment cores. Lake level fluctuations generally follow trends in mean solar insolation, however the onset of lake level extremes are much more abrupt than rates of insolation change. lake Turkana's location in relation to atmospheric convergence and dynamic rainfall patterns makes its susceptible to extreme climate change over relatively short timescales.

Modelling the transfer of supraglacial meltwater to the bed of Leverett Glacier, Southwest Greenland	CRYOSPHERE												Meltwater delivered to the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet is a driver of variable ice-motion through changes in effective pressure and enhanced basal lubrication. Ice surface velocities have been shown to respond rapidly both to meltwater production at the surface and to drainage of supraglacial lakes, suggesting efficient transfer of meltwater from the supraglacial to subglacial hydrological systems. Although considerable effort is currently being directed towards improved modelling of the controlling surface and basal processes, modelling the temporal and spatial evolution of the transfer of melt to the bed has received less attention. Here we present the results of spatially distributed modelling for prediction of moulins and lake drainages on the Leverett Glacier in Southwest Greenland. The model is run for the 2009 and 2010 ablation seasons, and for future increased melt scenarios. The temporal pattern of modelled lake drainages are qualitatively comparable with those documented from analyses of repeat satellite imagery. The modelled timings and locations of delivery of meltwater to the bed also match well with observed temporal and spatial patterns of ice surface speed-ups. This is particularly true for the lower catchment (< 1000 m a.s.l.) where both the model and observations indicate that the development of moulins is the main mechanism for the transfer of surface meltwater to the bed. At higher elevations (e.g. 1250-1500 m a.s.l.) the development and drainage of supraglacial lakes becomes increasingly important. At these higher elevations, the delay between modelled melt generation and subsequent delivery of melt to the bed matches the observed delay between the peak air temperatures and subsequent velocity speed-ups, while the instantaneous transfer of melt to the bed in a control simulation does not. Although both moulins and lake drainages are predicted to increase in number for future warmer climate scenarios, the lake drainages play an increasingly important role in both expanding the area over which melt accesses the bed and in enabling a greater proportion of surface melt to reach the bed.					; Clason, Caroline/HZH-6336-2023; Schwanghart, Wolfgang/U-2681-2019; Palmer, Steven/D-5170-2013	Mair, Douglas/0000-0001-7009-5461; Schwanghart, Wolfgang/0000-0001-6907-6474; Clason, Caroline/0000-0001-8236-2555; Palmer, Steven/0000-0003-3977-8509; Sole, Andrew/0000-0001-5290-8967; 													1994-0416	1994-0424					2015	9	1					123	138		10.5194/tc-9-123-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-123-2015													WOS:000350555400011

In contrast, Lake Rogoznica, on the eastern Adriatic coast, has been observed to undergo a period of water column anoxia after water layer mixing and establishment of holomictic conditions. Although Lake Rogoznica's chemistry and hydrography have been studied extensively, it is unclear how the microbial communities typically inhabiting the oxic epilimnion and a sulfidic hypolimnion respond to such a drastic shift in redox conditions. We investigated the impact of anoxic holomixis on microbial diversity and microbially mediated sulfur cycling in Lake Rogoznica with an array of culture-independent microbiological methods. Our data suggest a tight coupling between the lake's chemistry and occurring microorganisms. During stratification, anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria were dominant at the chemocline and in the hypolimnion. After an anoxic mixing event, the anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria entirely disappeared, and the homogeneous, anoxic water column was dominated by a bloom of gammaproteobacterial sulfur oxidizers related to the GSO/SUP05 clade. This study is the first report of a community shift from phototrophic to chemotrophic sulfide oxidizers as a response to anoxic holomictic conditions in a seasonally stratified seawater lake.					; Berg, Jasmine/ABD-4858-2020; Amann, Rudolf/C-6534-2014; Pjevac, Petra/AAW-8737-2020; Orlic, Sandi/AAE-6082-2019; ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013	Berg, Jasmine/0000-0003-3461-4759; Amann, Rudolf/0000-0002-0846-7372; Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193; Pjevac, Petra/0000-0001-7344-302X; Orlic, Sandi/0000-0002-6339-4145; Korlevic, Marino/0000-0001-5680-3556; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				JAN	2015	81	1					298	308		10.1128/AEM.02435-14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02435-14								25344237					WOS:000347376200034

MC-RR was the most dominant variant (94.70 and 84.73 % for intracellular (cellular MCs) and extracellular (dissolved MCs) MCs, respectively) in Poyang Lake, followed by MC-LR (4.65 and 13.17 %, respectively), MC-YR (0.8 and 2.63 %, respectively), and MC-LA (0.02 and 0.00 %), while MC-LW and MC-LF were not detected. Total MCs concentrations (intracellular +extracellular MCs) ranged between 0.0036 and 7.97 mu g/L, with an average of 0.79 mu g/L, and only two sampling stations with the total MCs concentrations exceeded the drinking water guideline level of 1 mu g/L for MC-LR proposed by World Health Organization. The overall spatial pattern of intracellular and extracellular MCs in Poyang Lake demonstrates decreasing trends from east to west, and the south part higher than the north part. Intracellular MCs content was negatively correlated with total nitrogen (r = -0.34, p < 0.01) and NO3 (r = -0.35, p < 0.01), while no significant correlation was found between intracellular MCs concentration and total phosphorus, NH4, and NO2 (p > 0.05), suggesting that NO3 might be a regulating factor for MCs production in Poyang Lake. In addition, intracellular MCs concentrations were positively correlated with wind speed, Microcystis and Cyanobacteria biomass (r = 0.34-0.51, p < 0.05), indicating that wind speed plays an important role in the spatial distributions of MCs, and NO3, toxic cyanobacteria (mainly Microcystis), and wind speed seem to be the important forcing factors driving MCs spatial distributions in Poyang Lake.					陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023														0963-9292	1573-3017				JAN	2015	24	1					19	28		10.1007/s10646-014-1349-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-014-1349-9								25216744					WOS:000347693100002
J	Kikuchi, K; Wang, B				Kikuchi, Kazuyoshi; Wang, Bin			Diurnal precipitation regimes in the global tropics	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Diurnal variations of the global tropical precipitation are documented by using two complementary Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) datasets (3B42 and 3G68) for 1998 -2006 in an attempt to provide a unified view of the diurnal cycle and a metric for evaluating numerical model performance. The 3B42 data have better spatial coverage; the 3G68 data offer more accurate diurnal phase information. The first and second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes represent the diurnal cycle and account for 89% of the total variance in 3B42. The third and fourth EOF modes, which account for 10% of the total variance, represent the semidiurnal cycle. Both datasets yield consistent spatial structures and temporal evolution, but they have different advantages: the patterns derived from 3B42 exhibit less noise, while 3G68 yields an arguably more accurate diurnal phase. The diurnal phase derived from 3G68 systematically leads 3B42 by about 3 h. Three tropical diurnal cycle regimes (oceanic, continental, and coastal) are identified according to the amplitude, peak time, and phase propagation characteristics of the diurnal precipitation. The oceanic regime is characterized by moderate amplitude and an early morning peak [ 0600 -0900 Local Solar Time (LST)], found primarily in the oceanic convergence zones in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. In contrast, the continental regime features a large amplitude and an afternoon peak (1500 -1800 LST), which is particularly pronounced in South America and equatorial Africa near Lake Victoria. Both the oceanic and continental regimes show little spatial phase propagation. The coastal regime, however, shows not only large amplitude but also prominent phase propagation. Two subregimes can also be recognized, often concurring along the same land -sea boundary. The seaside coastal regime is characterized by offshore phase propagation, with peaks occurring from late evening to noon of the next day (2100 -1200 LST), whereas the landside coastal regime has landward phase propagation with peaks occurring from noon to evening (1200 2100 LST). The coastal regime is prominent along the land -sea boundaries of the Maritime Continent, the Indian subcontinent, northern Australia, the west coast of America extending from Mexico to Ecuador, the west coast of equatorial Africa, and Northeast Brazil. Note that the amplitude of the diurnal cycle is dependent on season, but the diurnal phase characteristics are not. The underlying mechanism suggested by this analysis, especially over the coastal areas, is also discussed.

J	Casey, MM; Post, DM				Casey, Michelle M.; Post, David M.			The problem of isotopic baseline: Reconstructing the diet and trophic position of fossil animals	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Stable isotope methods are powerful, frequently used tools which allow diet and trophic position reconstruction of organisms and the tracking of energy sources through ecosystems. The majority of ecosystems have multiple food sources which have distinct carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures despite occupying a single trophic level. This difference in the starting isotopic composition of primary producers sets up an isotopic baseline that needs to be accounted for when calculating diet or trophic position using stable isotopic methods. This is particularly important when comparing animals from different regions or different times. Failure to do so can cause erroneous estimations of diet or trophic level, especially for organisms with mixed diets. The isotopic baseline is known to vary seasonally and in concert with a host of physical and chemical variables such as mean annual rainfall, soil maturity, and soil pH in terrestrial settings and lake size, depth, and distance from shore in aquatic settings. In the fossil record, the presence of shallowing upward suites of rock, or parasequences, will have a considerable impact on the isotopic baseline as basin size, depth and distance from shore change simultaneously with stratigraphic depth. For this reason, each stratigraphic level is likely to need an independent estimation of baseline even within a single outcrop. Very little is known about the scope of millennial or decadal variation in isotopic baseline. Without multi-year data on the nature of isotopic baseline variation, the impacts of time averaging on our ability to resolve trophic relationships in the fossil record will remain unclear. The use of a time averaged baseline will increase the amount of error surrounding diet and trophic position reconstructions. Where signal to noise ratios are low, due to low end member disparity (e.g., aquatic systems), or where the observed isotopic shift is small (<= 1 parts per thousand) the error introduced by time averaging may severely inhibit the scope of one's interpretations and limit the types of questions one can reliably answer. In situations with strong signal strength, resulting from high amounts of end member disparity (e.g., terrestrial settings), this additional error maybe surmountable. Baseline variation that is adequately characterized can be dealt with by applying multiple end-member mixing models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Environmental Surveillance of Vibrio cholerae O1/O139 in the Five African Great Lakes and Other Major Surface Water Sources in Uganda	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Cholera is a major public health problem in the African Great Lakes basin. Two hypotheses might explain this observation, namely the lakes are reservoirs of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 bacteria, or cholera outbreaks are a result of repeated pathogen introduction from the neighboring communities/countries but the lakes facilitate the introductions. A prospective study was conducted in Uganda between February 2015 and January 2016 in which 28 selected surface water sources were tested for the presence of V. cholerae species using cholera rapid test and multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Of 322 water samples tested, 35 (10.8%) were positive for V. cholerae non O1/non O139 and two samples tested positive for non-toxigenic atypical V. cholerae O139. None of the samples tested had toxigenic V. cholerae O1 or O139 that are responsible for cholera epidemics. The Lake Albert region registered the highest number of positive tests for V. cholerae non O1/non O139 at 47% (9/19). The peak period for V. cholerae non O1/non O139 positive tests was in March-July 2015 which coincided with the first rainy season in Uganda. This study showed that the surface water sources, including the African Great Lakes in Uganda, are less likely to be reservoirs for the observed V. cholerae O1 or O139 epidemics, though they are natural habitats for V. cholerae non O1/non O139 and atypical non-toxigenic V. cholerae O139. Further studies by WGS tests of non-toxigenic atypical V. cholerae O139 and physicochemical tests of surface water sources that supports V. cholerae should be done to provide more information. Since V. cholerae non O1/non O139 may cause other human infections, their continued surveillance is needed to understand their potential pathogenicity.

A new improved comprehensive water quality identification index (ICWQII(G)) model based on game theory was established to combine subjective weight and objective weight. Based on ICWQII(G), an improved comprehensive water quality identification index (ICWQII(P)) model with phased period combination weights was established to determine determined the weight proportion of phased periods was established. In this study, CWQII, ICWQII(G), and ICWQII(P) were used to evaluate the water quality of seventeen sites in Taihu Lake in 2020. The models selected nine water quality parameters and six water quality indicators. The assessment results of water quality classification were between "slightly polluted" and "moderately polluted". The pollution level on the east bank was lower than that on the west bank and north bank. Furthermore, it was also affected by seasonal change, water quality was worse in January and February but better in October and November. The mean value of I-wq calculated by CWQII, ICWQII(G), and ICWQII(P) were 2.405, 2.833, and 3.000, respectively. The compared results showed that the ICWQII(G) method can more representative identify the location of polluted water than CWQII. Moreover, the ICWQII(P) method calculation results not only retained the representative polluted water samples in the ICWQII(G) method but can also identify more pollution sites and worse polluted water bodies. Both ICWQII(G) and ICWQII(P) had high reliability and accuracy in assessment results, and ICWQII(P) was more accurate under sufficient data conditions. This study can offer a scientific basis for local water resource management in Taihu Lake, while simultaneously proposing a science-based and valid methodology for the assessment of other similar water bodies.

To estimate global chemical weathering fluxes and CO2 balance, it is important to identify the characteristics and driving factors of chemical weathering and CO2 consumption on the Tibetan Plateau, especially in glaciated catchments. The analysis of the hydro-geochemical data indicated that silicate weathering in this area was inhibited by low temperatures, while carbonate weathering was promoted by the abundant clastic rocks with fresh surfaces produced by glacial action. Carbonate weathering dominated the riverine solute generation (with a contribution of 58%, 51%, and 43% at the QiangYong Glacier (QYG), the WengGuo Hydrological Station (WGHS), and the lake estuary (LE), respectively). The oxidation of pyrite contributed to 35%, 42%, and 30% of the riverine solutes, while silicate weathering contributed to 5%, 6%, and 26% of the riverine solutes at the QYG, WGHS, and LE, respectively. The alluvial deposit of easily weathering fine silicate minerals, the higher air temperature, plant density, and soil thickness at the downstream LE in comparison to upstream and midstream may lead to longer contact time between pore water and mineral materials, thus enhancing the silicate weathering. Because of the involvement of sulfuric acid produced by the oxidation of pyrite, carbonate weathering in the upstream and midstream did not consume atmospheric CO2, resulting in the high rate of carbonate weathering (73.9 and 75.6 t km(-2) yr(-1), respectively, in maximum) and potential net release of CO2 (with an upper constraint of 35.6 and 35.2 t km(-2) yr(-1), respectively) at the QYG and WGHS. The above results indicate the potential of the glaciated area of the Tibetan Plateau with pyrite deposits being a substantial natural carbon source, which deserves further investigation.

Expansion of existing patches-both rate and mode of spread into a matrix of varying conditions-is important for predicting potential invader impacts. In this study, we used fine-scale genetic assessments and remote sensing to describe both the rate and mode of expansion for 20 Phragmites australis patches in flooded and unflooded wetland units on the Great Salt Lake, UT. We found that the majority of Phragmites patch expansion occurred via clonal spread but we also documented instances of (potentially episodic) seedling recruitment. The mode of patch expansion, inferred from patch edge genet richness, was unrelated to flooding in the wetland unit in the preceding growing season. The rate of Phragmites patch expansion varied from 0.09 to 0.35 year(-1) and was unrelated to the mode of spread. In six patches monitored across two years, monoclonal patches stayed monoclonal, whereas patches with higher genet richness had a marked increase in diversity in the second year. The findings of the present study suggest how this partially clonal species can exploit the benefits of both sexual (i.e., genetic recombination, widespread dispersal, colonization of new areas) and asexual reproduction (i.e., stability of established clones suited to local environmental conditions) to become one of the most successful wetland plant invaders. To control this species, both forms of reproduction need to be fully addressed through targeted management actions.					; Mock, Karen/C-1418-2011; Zaman, Bushra/O-8537-2015; Kettenring, Karin/A-5829-2011	Kettenring, Karin/0000-0001-7080-0407; 													1387-3547	1573-1464				SEP	2016	18	9			SI		2475	2495		10.1007/s10530-016-1125-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1125-2													WOS:000382136500007
J	Thottathil, SD; Prairie, YT				Thottathil, Shoji D.; Prairie, Yves T.			Coupling of stable carbon isotopic signature of methane and ebullitive fluxes in northern temperate lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Stable isotopic analysis is a popular method to understand the mechanisms sustaining methane (CH4) emissions in various aquatic environments. Yet, the general lack of concurrent measurements of isotopes and fluxes impedes our ability to establish a connection between the variation in the rates of CH4 emission and isotopic signature. Here, we examine the magnitude of CH4 ebullition (bubbling) and stable carbon isotopic signature (delta C-13-CH4) of bubble CH4 in four northern temperate lakes and evaluate the in-lake processes shaping their variability. The ebullitive CH4 flux and bubble delta C-13-CH4 varied from 0.01 to 37.0 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and between -71.0 parts per thousand and -50.9 parts per thousand, respectively. The high emission lakes in general and high fluxing shallow zones within each lake consistently showed enriched delta C-13-CH4 signature. Subsequently, in addition to the temperature dependence (1.4 +/- 0.1 eV), the rates of ebullition strongly correlated with the variability of delta C-13-CH4 across our study lakes. Our results suggest that higher ebullitive emissions are sustained by acetoclastic methanogenesis, likely fueled by fresh organic matter inputs. Further, the annual whole-lake estimate of bubble isotopic flux alone showed depleted delta C-13-CH4 values (-64.6 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand to -60.1 +/- 3.2 parts per thousand), yet the signature of the total CH4 emission (ebullition + diffusion) was relatively enriched (-60.7 parts per thousand to -52.6 parts per thousand) due to high methanotrophic activity in the water column. We show that delta C-13-CH4 signature of bubbles can be linked to the magnitude of ebullition itself, yet we suggest there is a need to account for different emission pathways and their isotopic signature to allocate CH4 source signature to northern lakes.

J	Deutsch, ES; Alameddine, I; El-Fadel, M				Deutsch, Eliza S.; Alameddine, Ibrahim; El-Fadel, Mutasem			Monitoring water quality in a hypereutrophic reservoir using Landsat ETM plus and OLI sensors: how transferable are the water quality algorithms?	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The launch of the Landsat 8 in February 2013 extended the life of the Landsat program to over 40 years, increasing the value of using Landsat to monitor long-term changes in the water quality of small lakes and reservoirs, particularly in poorly monitored freshwater systems. Landsat-based water quality hindcasting often incorporate several Landsat sensors in an effort to increase the temporal range of observations; yet the transferability of water quality algorithms across sensors remains poorly examined. In this study, several empirical algorithms were developed to quantify chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter (TSM), and Secchi disk depth (SDD) from surface reflectance measured by Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI sensors. Sensor-specific multiple linear regression models were developed by correlating in situ water quality measurements collected from a semi-arid eutrophic reservoir with band ratios from Landsat ETM+ and OLI sensors, along with ancillary data (water temperature and seasonality) representing ecological patterns in algae growth. Overall, ETM+-based models outperformed (adjusted R-2 chlorophyll-a = 0.70, TSM = 0.81, SDD = 0.81) their OLI counterparts (adjusted R-2 chlorophyll-a = 0.50, TSM = 0.58, SDD = 0.63). Inter-sensor differences were most apparent for algorithms utilizing the Blue spectral band. The inclusion of water temperature and seasonality improved the power of TSM and SDD models.					; Alameddine, Ibrahim/D-9365-2013	Alameddine, Ibrahim/0000-0002-8974-1985; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2018	190	3							141	10.1007/s10661-018-6506-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6506-9								29450661					WOS:000426607700035

We hypothesized that variability of environmental forces along the country will promote or facilitate temporal and spatial mosaic in cyanobacterial dominance. The most striking outcomes are related to the dominance of Cylindrospermopsis, Dolichospermum, and Microcystis. Although they share important adaptive strategies (e.g., aerotopes, large size and toxins production), our findings suggest that they have different environmental preferences. Dolichospermum and Microcystis dominated mainly in warm-rainy periods whereas Cylindrospermopsis was more common during dry periods and in mixed systems, or formed perennial dominance. Maximum phosphorus concentrations were observed in reservoirs dominated by Cylindrospermopsis. Although the main genera reached high biomass levels individually, different abilities to form dominance and co-dominance were observed. The number of co-dominance of Chroococales and Nostocales was almost the same as the individual occurrence of the main genera from these groups. This dataset reveals patterns of dominance of these cyanobacteria and also indicates that physiological features will cause differences in the mechanisms of interactions between species. The understanding of these processes and their relationship to environmental conditions will promote better understanding of cyanobacterial dominance and increase our ability to predict and manage these events.

Restoration of shallow lakes by nutrient control and biomanipulation-the successful strategy varies with lake size and climate	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Symposium on the Eutrophication Process and Control in Large Shallow Lakes	APR 22-26, 2005	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA					Major efforts have been made world-wide to improve the ecological quality of shallow lakes by reducing external nutrient loading. These have often resulted in lower in-lake total phosphorus (TP) and decreased chlorophyll a levels in surface water, reduced phytoplankton biomass and higher Secchi depth. Internal loading delays recovery, but in north temperate lakes a new equilibrium with respect to TP often is reached after < 10-15 years. In comparison, the response time to reduced nitrogen (N) loading is typically < 5 years. Also increased top-down control may be important. Fish biomass often declines, and the percentage of piscivores, the zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio, the contribution of Daphnia to zooplankton biomass and the cladoceran size all tend to increase. This holds for both small and relatively large lakes, for example, the largest lake in Denmark (40 km(-2)), shallow Lake Arreso, has responded relatively rapidly to a ca. 76% loading reduction arising from nutrient reduction and top-down control. Some lakes, however, have proven resistant to loading reductions. To accelerate recovery several physico-chemical and biological restoration methods have been developed for north temperate lakes and used with varying degrees of success. Biological measures, such as selective removal of planktivorous fish, stocking of piscivorous fish and implantation or protection of submerged plants, often are cheap versus traditional physico-chemical methods and are therefore attractive. However, their long-term effectiveness is uncertain. It is argued that additional measures beyond loading reduction are less cost-efficient and often not needed in very large lakes. Although fewer data are available on tropical lakes these seem to respond to external loading reductions, an example being Lake Paranoa, Brazil (38 km(-2)). However, differences in biological interactions between cold temperate versus warm temperate-subtropical-tropical lakes make transfer of existing biological restoration methods to warm lakes difficult. Warm lakes often have prolonged growth seasons with a higher risk of long-lasting algal blooms and dense floating plant communities, smaller fish, higher aggregation of fish in vegetation (leading to loss of zooplankton refuge), more annual fish cohorts, more omnivorous feeding by fish and less specialist piscivory. The trophic structures of warm lakes vary markedly, depending on precipitation, continental or coastal regions locations, lake age and temperature. Unfortunately, little is known about trophic dynamics and the role of fish in warm lakes. Since many warm lakes suffer from eutrophication, new insights are needed into trophic interactions and potential lake restoration methods, especially since eutrophication is expected to increase in the future owing to economic development and global warming.

Effective monitoring of lake surface area (LSA) dynamics is critical for sustainable management of water re-sources, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. The interannual and intraannual variations of lakes and their impact factors in the middle of the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China (M-FPENC) were analyzed. The results showed that a total of 1192 lakes have appeared during the last 20 years, with a total area of approxi-mately 1145.6 km(2), with most of them having seasonal and ephemeral water. The LSA in the M-FPENC decreased rapidly during 2000-2019. The annual maximum LSA and number of lakes greater than 1 km(2) decreased by 30.04% and 33.00%, respectively. At the intraannual scale, the LSA continued to shrink from April to July, with the lowest value observed in the middle of July, and then gradually recovered. It was found that interannual variations in the lake area mainly depended on the interannual fluctuation in precipitation. The shrinkage of lakes was mainly attributed to the significant increase of land surface evapotranspiration.

Here, leveraging a 20 year time series from Lake Mendota, WI, USA, we characterized 1.3 million viral genomes across time, seasonality and environmental factors. Double-stranded DNA phages from the class Caudoviricetes dominated the community. We identified 574 auxiliary metabolic gene families representing over 140,000 auxiliary metabolic genes, including important genes such as psbA (photosynthesis), pmoC (methane oxidation) and katG (hydrogen peroxide decomposition), which were consistently present and active across decades and seasons. Positive associations and niche differentiation between virus-host pairs, including keystone Cyanobacteria, methanotrophs and Nanopelagicales, emerged during seasonal changes. Inorganic carbon and ammonium influenced viral abundances, underscoring viral roles in both 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' interactions. Evolutionary processes favoured fitness genes, reduced genomic heterogeneity and dominant sub-populations. This study transforms understanding of viral ecology and evolution in Earth's microbiomes.					; Anantharaman, Karthik/AGM-5680-2022; Tran, Patricia/AAH-3679-2019; Zhou, Zhichao/AAK-4969-2020; McMahon, Katherine/JXY-0145-2024; Zhou, Zhichao/AAD-1000-2020; Baker, Brett/P-1783-2014	Rohwer, Robin/0000-0002-2664-6489; Zhou, Zhichao/0000-0002-9120-6762; Martin, Cody/0000-0001-7610-9537; Tran, Patricia/0000-0003-3948-3938; Baker, Brett/0000-0002-5971-1021; Anantharaman, Karthik/0000-0002-9584-2491													2058-5276					JAN	2025	10	1								10.1038/s41564-024-01876-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01876-7		JAN 2025						39753667					WOS:001388942500001

This paper presents a study on performance of a lake-water source heat pump unit, the calculation models of inlet water temperature on lake water side was obtained. Our results have shown that the hourly temperature of inlet water on lake water side and outlet water on user side would change a little within a day, and there was a linear relationship between daily average lake-water temperature and daily average air dry-bulb temperature. The measured daily average outlet water temperature on user side during a whole cooling/heating season changed in a little margin. Then a simplified model for coefficient of performance (COP) calculation of unit was proposed, the feasibility was validated through data analysis. A simplified method has therefore been developed to calculate and predict energy consumption of surface water source heat pump (SWHP) unit and will therefore enable energy efficient operation of water source heat pump for HVAC (heating, ventilating and air-conditioning) applications in buildings.

J	Zhao, XS; Ding, J; You, H				Zhao, Xuesong; Ding, Jing; You, Hong			Spatial distribution and temporal trends of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water and sediment from Songhua River, China	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												The spatial and temporal distributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the Songhua River, Harbin, China, were investigated. Seventy-seven samples, 42 water and 35 sediment samples, were collected in April and October of 2007 and January of 2008. The concentrations of total PAHs in water ranged from 163.54 to 2,746.25 ng/L with the average value of 934.62 ng/L, which were predominated by 2- and 3-ring PAHs. The concentrations of total 16 PAHs in sediment ranged from 68.25 to 654.15 ng/g dw with the average value of 234.15 ng/g dw, which were predominated by 4-, 5- and 6-ring PAHs. Statistical analysis of the PAH concentrations shown that the highest concentrations of the total PAHs were found during rainy season (October of 2007) and the lowest during snowy season (January of 2008). Ratios of specific PAH compounds, including fluoranthene/(fluoranthene + pyrene) (Flu/(Flu + Pyr)) and phenanthrene/(phenanthrene + anthracene) (An/(Ant + PhA)), were calculated to evaluate the possible sources of PAH contaminations. These ratios reflected pyrolytic inputs of PAHs in Songhua River water and a mixed pattern of pyrolytic and petrogenic inputs of PAHs in the Songhua River sediments. Ecotoxicological risk levels calculated for PAHs suggested that there were individual PAHs, which can less frequently cause biological impairment in some samples, but no samples had constituents that may frequently cause biological impairment. Total toxic benzo[a]pyrene equivalent of I cPAHs pound varied from 10.03 to 29.7 ng/g dw and from 0.36 to 1.92 ng/g dw for total toxic tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalent. The level of PAHs indicated a low toxicological risk to this area.					ding, jing/AAR-5009-2021; Zhao, Xuesong/B-2762-2012; YOU, Hong/G-6189-2012	YOU, Hong/0000-0001-9454-1681; Ding, Jing/0000-0002-3246-9802													0269-4042	1573-2983				FEB	2014	36	1					131	143		10.1007/s10653-013-9524-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-013-9524-0								23609889					WOS:000329320300010

Sinninghe			Tracing soil organic carbon in the lower Amazon River and its tributaries using GDGT distributions and bulk organic matter properties	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												In order to trace the transport of soil organic carbon (OC) in the lower Amazon basin, we investigated the distributions of crenarchaeol and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) by analyzing riverbed sediments and river suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected in the Solimoes-Amazon River mainstem and its tributaries. The Branched and Isoprenoid Tetraether (BIT) index, a proxy for river-transported soil OC into the ocean, was determined from the distributions of these GDGTs. The GDGT-derived parameters were compared with other bulk geochemical data (i.e. C:N ratio and stable carbon isotopic composition). The GDGT-derived and bulk geochemical data indicate that riverine SPM and riverbed sediments in the lower Amazon River and its tributaries are a mixture of C-3 plant-derived soil OC and aquatic-derived OC. The branched GDGTs in the SPM and riverbed sediments did not predominantly originate from the high Andes soils (>2500 m in altitude) as was suggested previously. However, further constraint on the soil source area of branched GDGTs was hampered due to the deficiency of soil data from the lower montane forest areas in the Andes. Our study also revealed seasonal and interannual variation in GDGT composition as well as soil OC discharge, which was closely related to the hydrological cycle. By way of a simple binary mixing model using the flux-weighted BIT values at Obidos, the last gauging station in the Amazon River, we estimated that 70-80% of the POC pool in the river was derived of soil OC. However, care should be taken to use the BIT index since it showed a non-conservative behaviour along the river continuum due to the aquatic production of crenarchaeol. Further investigation using a continuous sampling strategy following the full hydrological cycle is required to fully understand how soil-derived GDGT signals are transformed in large tropical river systems through their transport pathway to the ocean.

The relationships between landscape metrics and annual and seasonal NO3-N and PO4-P fluxes are developed for 43 watersheds distributed island-wide in Taiwan during 2015-2016. The results show that the watersheds with higher concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P mainly distributed on western Taiwan whereas watersheds with lower concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P scattered across mountain regions and eastern Taiwan. Multiple stepwise regression models are used to realize the effects of landscape pattern on NO3-N and PO4-P exports at watershed level and riparian buffers of various width (100 m, 200 m, 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, and 2000 m). Our findings show that the average annual exports of NO3-N and PO4-P across various watersheds are 3.8-50.8 and 0.04-7.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, much higher than reported values worldwide. The class-level metrics IJI (interspersion and juxtaposition) of agricultural land and LPI (largest patch index) of buildup area obtained from 200 m buffer explain 85% of variation of NO3-N flux, and ED (edge of density) of buildup area and LPI of water body or percentage of water body at 200 m buffer combined contribute 90% of variation in PO4-P exports. The highly mixed development of urban and agriculture distributed along with the limited extent of riparian buffers within watersheds in Taiwan make the watershed susceptible to loss of a large quantity of nutrients and sediments into streams. Management practices such as diminishing fragmented agriculture and buildup area are recommended as they should help to reduce water pollution, and better designs of developed area and water body can further improve water quality.

The Genus Cladophora Kutzing (Ulvophyceae) as a Globally Distributed Ecological Engineer	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The green algal genus Cladophora forms conspicuous nearshore populations in marine and freshwaters worldwide, commonly dominating peri-phyton communities. As the result of human activities, including the nutrient pollution of nearshore waters, Cladophora-dominated periphyton can form nuisance blooms. On the other hand, Cladophora has ecological functions that are beneficial, but less well appreciated. For example, Cladophora has previously been characterized as an ecological engineer because its complex structure fosters functional and taxonomic diversity of benthic microfauna. Here, we review classic and recent literature concerning taxonomy, cell biology, morphology, reproductive biology, and ecology of the genus Cladophora, to examine how this alga functions to modify habitats and influence littoral biogeochemistry. We review the evidence that Cladophora supports large, diverse populations of microalgal and bacterial epiphytes that influence the cycling of carbon and other key elements, and that the high production of cellulose and hydrocarbons by Cladophora-dominated periphyton has the potential for diverse technological applications, including wastewater remediation coupled to renewable biofuel production. We postulate that well-known aspects of Cladophora morphology, hydrodynamically stable and perennial holdfasts, distinctively branched architecture, unusually large cell and sporangial size and robust cell wall construction, are major factors contributing to the multiple roles of this organism as an ecological engineer.

J	Peng, CC; Xie, ZJ; Jin, X				Peng, Changchun; Xie, Zhijun; Jin, Xing			Using Ensemble Learning for Remote Sensing Inversion of Water Quality Parameters in Poyang Lake	SUSTAINABILITY												Inland bodies of water, such as lakes, play a crucial role in sustaining life and supporting ecosystems. However, with the rapid development of socio-economics, water resources are facing serious pollution problems, such as the eutrophication of water bodies and degradation of wetlands. Therefore, the monitoring, management, and protection of inland water resources are particularly important. In past research, empirical models and machine learning models have been widely used for the water quality assessment of inland lakes. Due to the complexity of the optical properties of inland lake water bodies, the performance of these models is often limited. To overcome the limitations of these models, this study uses in situ water quality data from 2017 to 2018 and multispectral (MS) remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 to construct experimental samples of Poyang Lake. Based on these experimental samples, we constructed a spatio-temporal ensemble model (STE) to evaluate four common water quality parameters: chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The model adopts an ensemble learning strategy, improving the model's performance by merging multiple advanced machine learning algorithms. We introduced several indices related to water quality parameters as auxiliary variables, such as NDCI and Enhanced Three, and used band data and these auxiliary variables as predictive variables, thereby greatly enhancing the predictive potential of the model.The results show that the inversion accuracy of these four inversion models is high (R2 of 0.94, 0.88, 0.92, and 0.93; RMSE of 1.15, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.02; MAE of 0.81, 0.01, 0.09, and 0.10), indicating that the STE model has good evaluation accuracy. Meanwhile, we used the STE model to reveal the spatio-temporal distribution of Chl-a, TP, TN, and COD from 2017 to 2018, and analyzed their seasonal and spatial variation rules. The results of this study not only provide an effective and practical method for monitoring and managing water quality parameters in inland lakes, but also provide water security for socio-economic and ecological environmental safety.

Assessment of water quality using multivariate techniques in River Sosiani, Kenya	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Multivariate techniques can infer intrinsic characteristics of complex data by generating correlation, similarity, dissimilarity, and covariance vector matrix to ascertain their relationships. The study evaluated the effect of anthropogenic activities by analyzing selected physicochemical water quality parameters (WQP) as indicators of pollution in River Sosiani, located in western Kenya, at six stations from August 2012 to February 2013 (Aug-Oct = wet season, Nov-Feb = Dry season). Temperature, pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), conductivity, and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) were measured in situ while Total Phosphorus (TP), Total Organic Nitrogen (TON), and Biologial Oxygen Demand (BOD) were measured in vitro using standard methods. Except for DO and pH, the other variables were increasing in concentration downstream. Cluster analysis grouped stations with municipal discharge, to be the most distant linked to other stations in both seasons. Multidimensional scaling had four categories of stations with similar WQP: before, after, and wet and dry seasons. Principal component analysis with (60.5 and 26.1% for components 1 and 2) evaluated TON and TP as key pollutants in both seasons. Factor analysis with varifactor two at 35.3 and 27.1% variance in wet and dry seasons, respectively, had strong absolute factor loading of BOD (wet 0.878, dry 0.915) and TP (wet 0.839, dry 0.709) inferring sites with organic pollution also had nutrient pollution. Assessment of pollution with the selected WQP identified two major effects: nutrient and organic. Additional variables may identify other pollutants along the river. Multiple pollution effects, changing environment, and intrinsic characteristics of aquatic ecosystems generate complex data which are better assessed with multivariate techniques.					; Obiero, Kevin/I-1531-2019; Alfred, Achieng'/M-6591-2016; Masese, Frank/C-1265-2010	Ani Sabwa, Josiah/0000-0003-2301-3018; Obiero, Dr Kevin/0000-0002-3441-3976; Alfred, Achieng'/0000-0001-5926-4914; Masese (Ph.D), Frank/0000-0002-5912-5049; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2017	189	6							280	10.1007/s10661-017-5992-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-5992-5								28534306					WOS:000403083300037

Reliable simulation of monthly lake water levels is still an ongoing demand for multiple environmental and hydro-informatics engineering applications. The current research aims to utilize newly developed hybrid data-intelligence models based on the ensemble adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) coupled with metaheuristics algorithms for lake water-level simulation by considering the effect of seasonality on Titicaca Lake water-level fluctuations. The classical ANFIS model was trained using three metaheuristics nature-inspired optimization algorithms, including the genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA), particle swarm optimizer (ANFIS-PSO), and whale optimization algorithm (ANFIS-WOA). For determining the best set of the input variables, an evolutionary approach based on several lag months has been utilized prior to the lake water-level simulation process using the hybrid models. The proposed hybrid models were investigated for accurately simulating the monthly water levels at Titicaca Lake. The ANFIS-WOA model exhibited the best prediction performance for lake water-level pattern measurement in this study. For the best scenario (the inputs were Xt-1, Xt-2, Xt-3, Xt-4, Xt-12) the ANFIS-WOA model attained root mean square error (RMSE approximate to 0.08 m), mean absolute error (MAE approximate to 0.06 m), and coefficient of determination (R-2 approximate to 0.96). Also, the results showed that long-term seasonal memory for this lake is suitable input for lake water- level models so that the long-term dynamic memory of 1-year time series for lake water-level data is the best input for estimating the water level of Titicaca Lake.

This study investigated the water movement in the SPAC in Poyang Lake wetland, which is a protected area with an important ecological function within the Yangtze River basin, under different water-level conditions by analyzing the responses of river, groundwater, soil and plants to precipitation using stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. The results show that the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions (delta O-18 and delta D) of soil water decrease with increasing depth due to the near surface evaporation. During the dry season the water-level in Poyang Lake is low, when it rains the influencing depth of precipitation and evaporation on soil water isotopic signatures was 20 cm below the ground surface. The rain water infiltrates into the soil, recharges groundwater and flows to the river. When the water-level in Poyang Lake is low, the Xiu River is recharged by the groundwater, which recharges the soil water by capillary rise. During the flood season, the water-level is high and the water in Poyang Lake reaches or covers the meadows, recharges the groundwater and soil water. In the meantime, the water in Poyang Lake can be recharged by rain water when it rains. During the dry season when it doesn't rain, plants mainly use groundwater, but soil water is preferred and plants don't use rainwater directly when it rains. When the lake water-level is extremely low, the plants in Poyang Lake wetland may suffer from water stress, which is harmful for plant growth.

However, knowledge of the long-term exposure of underwater ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in aquatic ecosystem is still very limited. We carried out extensive UVR measurements in different seasons in five lakes at different altitudes, collected long-term Secchi disk depth (SDD) data, developed the models between UVR diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) and SDD, and further assessed the long-term underwater UVR exposure. Observation results from five lakes including 259 samples showed large spatial variabilities of K-d(313) (UVB) from 0.83 to 5.91 m(-1) and K-d(340) (UVA) from 0.51 to 4.67 m(-1). Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficients were significantly correlated with K-d(313) and K-d(340). Thus, the effects of climate change and human activity on CDOM abundance, source and composition may significantly alter UVR attenuation in aquatic environments. The long-term underwater UVR exposure, which was estimated from significant positive correlations between 1/SDD and Kd(313) and Kd(340), and incident UVR, significantly decreased in Lake Fuxianhu, Lake Erhai, and Lake Qiandaohu. The regime shift from clear water state to turbid state in Lake Erhai around 2001-2003 dramatically decreased underwater UVR exposure. In conclusion, increasing UVR attenuation played a more important role in determining underwater UVR exposure than decreasing incident UVR with the relative contributions of 89.9% and 87.7% in Lake Fuxianhu, 98.0% and 97.7% in Lake Erhai, 94.4% and 92.5% in Lake Qiandaohu for UVB and UVA exposure, respectively. This is the first study to elucidate the long-term trend of underwater UVR exposure considering both increasing UVR attenuation and decreasing incident UVR. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Recent Trends in Survival and Mortality of Wolves in Minnesota, United States	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Survival is a key determinant of population growth and persistence; computation and understanding of this metric is key to successful population management, especially for recovering populations of large carnivores such as wolves. Using a Bayesian frailty analytical approach, we evaluated information from 150 radio-tagged wolves over a 16-year time period to determine temporal trends and age- and sex-specific survival rates of wolves in Minnesota, United States. Based on our analyses, overall annual survival of wolves during the study was 0.67, with no clear evidence for age- or sex-specific differences in the population. Our model demonstrated statistical support for a temporal trend in annual survival; the highest survival was predicted at the beginning of the time series (0.87), with lowest survival (0.55) during 2018. We did not observe evidence that survival was markedly reduced during years when a regulated hunting and trapping season was implemented for wolves (years 2012-2014). However, cause-specific mortality analysis indicated that most mortality was human-caused. While the estimate for increasing human-caused mortality over time was positive, the evidence was not statistically significant. Anthropogenic causes resulted in similar to 66% of known mortalities, including legal and illegal killing, and vehicular collisions. Trends in wolf survival in Minnesota may reflect an expanding distribution; wolf range has spread to areas with more human development during the study, presumably leading to increased hazard and reduced survival. Our results provide foundational information for evaluating and guiding future policy decisions pertaining to the Great Lakes wolf population.

This uncertainty is exacerbated by the ubiquitous presence of legacy sediments in valley-bottoms of the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Using a sediment fingerprinting model, we quantified suspended sediment and sediment-bound nutrient sources for a 114 km(2) agricultural, Piedmont watershed. Sediment sources included agricultural, developed, and forested soils as well as streambanks legacy sediments. Suspended sediment and sediment-bound nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations were determined for 10 storms over the study period of August 1, 2017 to July 31, 2018. Streambanks contributed 50% of the annual suspended sediment yield of 1,348 kg/ha followed by agricultural (49%) and forested (1%) soils. Streambanks amounted to 26% and 32% of the suspended sediment-bound N and P exports, respectively, whereas the corresponding loads from agricultural sources were 73 and 67%, respectively. Bank contributions varied with storm magnitude and seasonality, with the highest exports associated with the largest peak flows. These results highlight that streambank sediments constitute a significant fraction of suspended sediment-bound nutrient exports and must be considered in watershed models, regulatory assessments, and management practices.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2020	56	5					820	841		10.1111/1752-1688.12855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12855		JUN 2020											WOS:000538890200001

Total DNAs were extracted from the water samples, 16S rRNA gene was amplified and the bacterial community analyzed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing obtaining 3486 OTUs, from a total read of 715,842 sequences. Basing on the analysis of bacterial compositions, richness, diversity, bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance, water sample comparisons and existence of specific bacterial taxa within three fish ponds in a 4 months period, the study conclusively observed that the dominant phylum in all water samples were similar, and they included; Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes and Chlorobi, distributed in different proportions in the different months and ponds. The seasonal changes had a more pronounced effect on the bacterioplankton community than the stocking densities; however some differences between the ponds were more likely caused by feed coefficient than by stocking densities. At the same time, most bacterial communities were affected by the nutrient input except phylum Cyanobacteria that was also affected by the feed control of tilapia.					song, chao/HTO-8527-2023														0959-3993	1573-0972				JAN	2016	32	1							10	10.1007/s11274-015-1962-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-1962-7								26712625					WOS:000368363300006

The northern part of the lake, Meiliang Bay, is known to be at high risk of dense and sustained Microcystis blooms and toxins. This study aimed to investigate and record the annual and seasonal dynamics of toxic genotype, Microcystis morphospecies succession and microcystin variation. It also aimed to find out the underlying driving factors influencing the dynamic changes. Microcystin (MC) and the Microcystis genotype were quantified using HPLC and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Our study, over three consecutive years, showed that the pattern of morphospecies succession was seasonally distinct and annually consistent. During the same period in 2012, 2013 and 2014, the average MC were, on dry weight basis, 733 mu g.g(-1), 844 mu g.g(-1), 870 mu g.g(-1), respectively. The proportion of toxic Microcystis accounted for 41%, 44% and 52%, respectively. Cell bound microcystin was found to correlate with the percentage of toxic Microcystis. Based on historical and current data, we conclude that annual bloom toxicity was relatively stable or possibly increased over the last decade.																				2072-6651				JAN	2016	8	1							23	10.3390/toxins8010023	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins8010023								26784229					WOS:000374332700023

A modeling approach to assess the greenhouse gas risk in Koteshwar hydropower reservoir, India	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												Climate changes are likely to be significantly affected by reservoirs/lakes due to emission of greenhouse gas (GHG), change in the magnitude and seasonality of river runoffs and severe extreme events. In this study, a coupled GHG Risk Assessment Tool (GRAT) and Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) are used to predict the GHG risk of Koteshwar reservoirs located in Uttarakhand, India. Before running the GRAT model, SWAT model was used to simulate the runoffs (one of the major input of GRAT). The model was calibrated (2004-09) and validated (2010-13) at Uttarkashi station using monthly discharge data. The model performance was checked by R-2, NSE, RSR, and p-value as 0.785, 0.60, 0.63, and 0.04, respectively, during calibration and 0.790, 0.66, 0.57, and 0.06 during validation and shows satisfactory model performance on monthly time step. Further, GRAT model is also applied and the results show that Koteshwar reservoir is found to be under high risk of CO2 (CO2 > 645mg m(-2) d(-1)) and medium risk of CH4 (CH4 < 45mg m(-2) d(-1)) till 2023. Subsequently, the GHG risk is minimized after passage of time over 100years. These models may be used by the policy-makers to know the potential of GHG and its vulnerability to the reservoirs after the impoundment.					kumar, Amit/M-3541-2015; Kumar, Amit/M-3541-2015	kumar, Amit/0000-0002-6073-0860; 													1080-7039	1549-7860					2016	22	8					1651	1664		10.1080/10807039.2016.1209077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2016.1209077													WOS:000386111500005

Enhanced bacterial decomposition with increasing addition of autochthonous to allochthonous carbon without any effect on bacterial community composition	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations - mainly of terrestrial origin - are increasing worldwide in inland waters. Heterotrophic bacteria are the main consumers of DOC and thus determine DOC temporal dynamics and availability for higher trophic levels. Our aim was to study bacterial carbon (C) turnover with respect to DOC quantity and chemical quality using both allochthonous and autochthonous DOC sources. We incubated a natural bacterial community with allochthonous C (C-13-labeled beech leachate) and increased concentrations and pulses (intermittent occurrence of organic matter input) of autochthonous C (phytoplankton lysate). We then determined bacterial C consumption, activities, and community composition together with the C flow through bacteria using stable C isotopes. The chemical analysis of single sources revealed differences in aromaticity and low-and high-molecular-weight substance fractions (LMWS and HMWS, respectively) between allochthonous and autochthonous C sources. Both DOC sources (allochthonous and autochthonous DOC) were metabolized at a high bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) around 50%. In treatments with mixed sources, rising concentrations of added autochthonous DOC resulted in a further, significant increase in bacterial DOC consumption of up to 68% when nutrients were not limiting. This rise was accompanied by a decrease in the humic substance (HS) fraction and an increase in bacterial biomass. Changes in DOC concentration and consumption in mixed treatments did not affect bacterial community composition (BCC), but BCC differed in single vs. mixed incubations. Our study highlights that DOC quantity affects bacterial C consumption but not BCC in nutrient-rich aquatic systems. BCC shifted when a mixture of allochthonous and autochthonous C was provided simultaneously to the bacterial community. Our results indicate that chemical quality rather than source of DOC per se (allochthonous vs. autochthonous) determines bacterial DOC turnover.					; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017	Premke, Katrin/0000-0001-6216-5386; Kayler, Zachary/0000-0003-0090-7537; Grossart, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-9141-0325; Attermeyer, Katrin/0000-0002-6503-9497; Hornick, Thomas/0000-0003-0280-9260; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2014	11	6					1479	1489		10.5194/bg-11-1479-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-1479-2014													WOS:000334100900003

Seasonal patterns of Schistosoma mansoni infection within Biomphalaria snails at the Ugandan shorelines of Lake Albert and Lake Victoria	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES												Intestinal schistosomiasis is hyperendemic in many sub-Saharan African countries. In Uganda, it is endemic at both Lake Albert (LA) and Lake Victoria (LV) and caused by S. mansoni that uses Biomphalaria snails as obligatory intermediate snail hosts. To shed light on local patterns of infection, we utilised two PCR-based methods to detect S. mansoni within Biomphalaria spp. as collected at the Ugandan shorelines of Lake Albert and Lake Victoria from 2009-2010. Overall, at our Lake Albert sites, the mean infection prevalence was 12.5% (15 of 120 snails), while at our Lake Victoria sites the prevalence was 5% (3 of 60 snails). At our Lake Albert sites, the highest infection prevalence of 13.3% (8 of 60 snails) was at Walukuba, while at our Lake Victoria sites, the highest infection prevalence of 10% (2 of 20 snails) was at Lwanika. Three species of Biomphalaria, B. pfeifferi, B. stanleyi and B. sudanica, were identified at our Lake Albert collection sites, while only a single species, B. choanomphala, was identified at our Lake Victoria collection sites. Biomphalaria stanleyi (2 of 20 snails; 15%) had the highest infection prevalence, followed by B. sudanica (5 of 60 snails; 13.3%), B. pfeifferi (4 of 40 snails; 10%) and B. choanomphala (3 of 60 snails; 5%). Of the Biomphalaria species identified, B. choanomphala had the highest haplotype (gene) diversity score, followed by B. stanleyi, B. sudanica and B. pfeifferi. Sites with a higher mean prevalence of S. mansoni infection had higher intra-species haplotype diversity scores than sites with a lower mean prevalence. The wet seasons (LA: 13.3%; LV: 8.7%) had a consistently higher mean infection prevalence of S. mansoni than the dry seasons (LA: 9.5%; LV: 5%) for all species and all sites tested at both Lake Albert (n = 480) and Lake Victoria (n = 320), though the difference was not statistically significant. Author summaryHuman schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the intravascular trematode genus Schistosoma. The disease is contracted through contact with contaminated freshwater sources infested with snails, which serve as the intermediate host for the parasite's larval form. Schistosoma mansoni causes the intestinal form of the disease and utilises Biomphalaria as its intermediate snail host. To better understand the prevalence of S. mansoni infection, molecular detection methods can be used to monitor the levels and patterns of infection within Biomphalaria populations. In this study, the authors examined the prevalence of S. mansoni infection within Biomphalaria snails collected from six sites along the Ugandan shorelines of Lake Albert and Lake Victoria from 2009 to 2010. The study revealed that infection was more prevalent at Lake Albert compared to Lake Victoria. Different species of Biomphalaria snails were found at each lake, with some species having a higher infection prevalence than others. The study also investigated the impact of seasonality on infection prevalence, with the wet seasons having an overall higher prevalence of infection compared to the dry seasons, although the difference was not statistically significant. This research enhances our understanding of S. mansoni infection patterns among African Biomphalaria snails.

Biomass burning in Siberia and Kazakhstan as an important source for haze over the Alaskan Arctic in April 2008	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												During the ARCPAC (Aerosol, Radiation, and Cloud Processes affecting Arctic Climate) airborne field experiment in April 2008 in northern Alaska, about 50 plumes were encountered with the NOAA WP-3 aircraft between the surface and 6.5 km. Onboard measurements and the transport model FLEXPART showed that most of the plumes were emitted by forest fires in southern Siberia-Lake Baikal area and by agricultural burning in Kazakhstan-southern Russia. Unexpectedly, these biomass burning plumes were the dominant aerosol and gas-phase features encountered in this area during April. The influence on the plumes from sources other than burning was small. The chemical characteristics of plumes from the two source regions were different, with higher enhancements relative to CO for most gas and aerosol species from the agricultural fires.

Do deer and shrubs override canopy gap size effects on growth and survival of yellow birch, northern red oak, eastern white pine, and eastern hemlock seedlings?	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Innovative forestry practices that use natural disturbance and stand developmental processes as models to increase forest complexity are now being considered as a way to conserve biodiversity while managing for a range of objectives. We evaluated the influence of harvest-created gap size (6, 10,20,30, and 46 m diameter gaps and uncut references) over 12 growing seasons on planted tree seedling growth and survival for four tree species that tend to experience poor recruitment in both managed and unmanaged northern hardwood forests in eastern North America. We expected, based on silvics, that the three mid-tolerant species (yellow birch [Betula alleghaniensis], red oak [Quercus rubra], and white pine [Pin us strobus]) would perform best in intermediate-sized gaps, and the one shade tolerant species ( hemlock [Tsuga canadensis]) would perform best in small gaps. However, all four of the species grew taller with increasing gap size, while survival was highest in intermediate gap sizes. Although gap size had statistically significant effects on growth and survival, the magnitude of the effects were modest. With the exception of a small portion of white pine individuals (35% of survivors were >150 cm tall), trees were short (<1 m) and few survived (<30%) 12 years after planting. Evidence from deer exclosures and individual gaps with high shrub (Rubus idaeus) densities suggest that browsing and shrub competition resulted in poor tree growth and survival, and may have constrained the magnitude of many potential tree seedling responses to gap size. Our study highlights the management challenges of using gap size as a tool to influence future forest composition in forests with overly abundant deer and pervasive shrub layers and underscores the importance of silvicultural prescriptions that include measures for reducing these impacts.

The African Cichlid Fish Astatotilapia burtoni Uses Acoustic Communication for Reproduction: Sound Production, Hearing, and Behavioral Significance	PLOS ONE												Sexual reproduction in all animals depends on effective communication between signalers and receivers. Many fish species, especially the African cichlids, are well known for their bright coloration and the importance of visual signaling during courtship and mate choice, but little is known about what role acoustic communication plays during mating and how it contributes to sexual selection in this phenotypically diverse group of vertebrates. Here we examined acoustic communication during reproduction in the social cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni. We characterized the sounds and associated behaviors produced by dominant males during courtship, tested for differences in hearing ability associated with female reproductive state and male social status, and then tested the hypothesis that female mate preference is influenced by male sound production. We show that dominant males produce intentional courtship sounds in close proximity to females, and that sounds are spectrally similar to their hearing abilities. Females were 2-5-fold more sensitive to low frequency sounds in the spectral range of male courtship sounds when they were sexually-receptive compared to during the mouthbrooding parental phase. Hearing thresholds were also negatively correlated with circulating sex-steroid levels in females but positively correlated in males, suggesting a potential role for steroids in reproductive-state auditory plasticity. Behavioral experiments showed that receptive females preferred to affiliate with males that were associated with playback of courtship sounds compared to noise controls, indicating that acoustic information is likely important for female mate choice. These data show for the first time in a Tanganyikan cichlid that acoustic communication is important during reproduction as part of a multimodal signaling repertoire, and that perception of auditory information changes depending on the animal's internal physiological state. Our results highlight the importance of examining non-visual sensory modalities as potential substrates for sexual selection contributing to the incredible phenotypic diversity of African cichlid fishes.																			1932-6203					MAY 18	2012	7	5							e37612	10.1371/journal.pone.0037612	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0037612								22624055					WOS:000305343500144
J	Feng, L; Hu, CM; Li, JS				Feng, Lian; Hu, Chuanmin; Li, Junsheng			Can MODIS Land Reflectance Products be Used for Estuarine and Inland Waters?	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Although designed for land surfaces, MODIS Aqua surface reflectance data products (MYD09, termed as R_Land in this work) have also been used for water applications. Yet to date their uncertainties and general suitability in such applications have rarely been documented. In this study, R_Land products of two regions (Chesapeake Bay and Taihu Lake) between July 2002 and December 2015 are evaluated against in situ measurements and against reflectance products derived by the MODIS Ocean Team using atmospheric correction schemes specifically designed for water applications, namely the default atmospheric correction method based on the near-infrared (NIR) bands (denoted as R_NIR, data products available from NASA) and alternative atmospheric correction method based on the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands (denoted as R_SWIR, data products not available from NASA but require customized processing by the user), respectively. Results suggest high accuracy in R_Land(645) and R_Land(645/555) for both Chesapeake Bay and Taihu Lake in terms of daily spatial distributions, seasonality, and long-term trends. A sensitivity test also shows improved data quality in R_Land(645/555) when data are binned by 7 x 7 pixels in space and 32 days in time. Improved data quality can also be obtained for R_Land(645) when data are only binned in time to minimize the patchiness noise in R_Land daily images. Given the fact that most users do not have the capacity to process low-level data to obtain R_SWIR and the standard NASA R_NIR products often lack coverage over inland waters because they are optimized for global oceans instead of inland waters, this study provides a general guide on the applicability of the widely available R_Land products in inland and estuarine water applications in the absence of customized R_NIR or R_SWIR data products for local regions.

J	Li, XD; Xie, Q; Kuang, Y; Wu, DY				Li, Xiaodi; Xie, Qiang; Kuang, Yue; Wu, Deyi			Coupled influence of pH and dissolved organic carbon on the immobilization of phosphorus by lanthanum-modified zeolite	CHEMOSPHERE												Wind-driven waves and currents in shallow lakes frequently trigger the resuspension of sediments in the photic layer, which is characterized with a high pH and high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. The mechanism of phosphorus-inactivating agents (PIAs) immobilizing phosphorus under the coupled influence of pH and DOC is not clarified, and the applicability of PIAs in eutrophic shallow lakes is thus still doubtful. We found that, under the coupled influence of pH and DOC, the uptake of phosphate by LMZ was affected mainly by pH at low DOC concentrations and by DOC at high DOC concentrations. A high pH (9.3) and high DOC concentration (24.7 mg/L) greatly increased the release of phosphorus from sediment to water. However, the addition of LMZ substantially reduced the P concentrations in water, mainly via capture of dissolved inorganic phosphorus. The results of the reversibility of the adsorption of phosphates and DOC showed that phosphate had much higher affinity than DOC towards LMZ. The phosphate once adsorbed on LMZ was resistant to release when exposed to conditions of either a high pH (9.5), high DOC concentration (250 mg/L) or both; i.e., only <5% of the adsorbed phosphate is releasable. Therefore, we proposed that, to avoid the coupled influence of pH and DOC in the photic layer of eutrophic shallow lakes, LMZ could be applied in multiple low doses in the season when the growth of algae is minimal (a low pH and low DOC concentration).

Estimation of grain size variability with micro X-ray fluorescence in laminated lacustrine sediments, Cape Bounty, Canadian High Arctic	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Finely laminated sediment cores from two Arctic lakes were investigated using the Itrax (TM) Core Scanner that provides micro X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) measurements with a spatial resolution of 100 mu m. We compared these chemical measurements with standard geochemical methods using, at the macroscopic scale, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and, at the microscopic scale, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). We also investigated the relationship between the chemical profiles and the grain size of sediments at macro-scale using laser particle-size analysis, and at microscopic scale, using thin section image analysis techniques. Results show a link between grain size and the relative abundance of several elements. Silicon and zirconium are associated with very coarse silt and sand deposits, K and Fe with clay-rich layers, and Ti with silty facies. Four sedimentary facies are characterised based on sedimentary structure and texture, and interpreted in terms of known seasonal hydroclimatic processes. We show that is possible to identify these sedimentary facies using mu-XRF element abundance or ratio variations. The K/Ti ratio is the best marker of the upper varve boundary, and it might be used for varve identification and counting of Cape Bounty sediments in future. More generally, this study demonstrates new applications for paleohydrological reconstructions from laminated sediments.

Human-induced ecological cascades: Extinction, restoration, and rewilding in the Galapagos highlands	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Oceanic islands support unique biotas but often lack ecological redundancy, so that the removal of a species can have a large effect on the ecosystem. The larger islands of the Galapagos Archipelago once had one or two species of giant tortoise that were the dominant herbivore. Using paleoecological techniques, we investigate the ecological cascade on highland ecosystems that resulted from whalers removing many thousands of tortoises from the lowlands. We hypothesize that the seasonal migration of a now-extinct tortoise species to the highlands was curtailed by decreased intraspecific competition. We find the trajectory of plant community dynamics changed within a decade of the first whaling vessels visiting the islands. Novel communities established, with a previously uncommon shrub, Miconia, replacing other shrubs of the genera Alternanthera and Acalypha. It was, however, the introduction of cattle and horses that caused the local extirpation of plant species, with the most extreme impacts being evident after c. 1930. This modified ecology is considered the natural state of the islands and has shaped subsequent conservation policy and practice. Restoration of El Junco Crater should emphasize exclusion of livestock, rewilding with tortoises, and expanding the ongoing plantings of Miconia to also include Acalypha and Alternanthera.

Changes in land cover, rainfall and stream flow in Upper Gilgel Abbay catchment, Blue Nile basin-Ethiopia	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In this study we evaluated changes in land cover and rainfall in the Upper Gilgel Abbay catchment in the Upper Blue Nile basin and how changes affected stream flow in terms of annual flow, high flows and low flows. Land cover change assessment was through classification analysis of remote sensing based land cover data while assessments on rainfall and stream flow data are by statistical analysis. Results of the supervised land cover classification analysis indicated that 50.9% and 16.7% of the catchment area was covered by forest in 1973 and 2001, respectively. This significant decrease in forest cover is mainly due to expansion of agricultural land. By use of a change detection procedure, three periods were identified for which changes in rainfall and stream flow were analyzed. Rainfall was analyzed at monthly base by use of the Mann-Kendall test statistic and results indicated a statistically significant, decreasing trend for most months of the year. However, for the wet season months of June, July and August rainfall has increased. In the period 1973-2005, the annual flow of the catchment decreased by 12.1%. Low flow and high flow at daily base were analyzed by a low flow and a high flow index that is based on a 95% and 5% exceedance probability. Results of the low flow index indicated decreases of 18.1% and 66.6% for the periods 1982-2000 and 2001-2005 respectively. Results of high flows indicated an increase of 7.6% and 46.6% for the same periods. In this study it is concluded that over the period 1973-2005 stream flow has changed in the Gilgel Abbay catchment by changes in land cover and changes in rainfall.

Microbial Contributions to Phosphorus Cycling in Eutrophic Lakes and Wastewater	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MICROBIOLOGY, VOL 67	Annual Review of Microbiology											Phosphorus is a key element controlling the productivity of freshwater ecosystems, and microbes drive most of its relevant biogeochemistry. Eutrophic lakes are generally dominated by cyanobacteria that compete fiercely with algae and heterotrophs for the element. In wastewater treatment, engineers select for specialized bacteria capable of sequestering phosphorus from the water, to protect surface waters from further loading. The intracellular storage molecule polyphosphate plays an important role in both systems, allowing key taxa to control phosphorus availability. The importance of dissolved organic phosphorus in eutrophic lakes and mineralization mechanisms is still underappreciated and understudied. The need for functional redundancy through biological diversity in wastewater treatment plants is also clear. In both systems, a holistic ecosystems biology approach is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling phosphorus metabolism and the ecological interactions and factors controlling ecosystem-level process rates.					; McMahon, Katherine/JXY-0145-2024	McMahon, Katherine D./0000-0002-7038-026X; Read, Emily/0000-0002-9617-9433; 													0066-4227	1545-3251	978-0-8243-1167-4				2013	67						199	219		10.1146/annurev-micro-092412-155713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-micro-092412-155713								23799816					WOS:000326686400011

As an attempt to understand the development of those wetlands, samples from a diatom ooze and indurated diatomites found in the coastal plain of the state of Rio Grande do Sul were analyzed. The fragmented state of the frustules found in the samples allowed identification of most diatoms only to the genus level, nevertheless the assemblages are represented by 16 genera reported today in freshwater bodies in the studied region. The identified taxa include the planktonic Aulacoseira and Cyclotella and several benthic genera, mostly Eunotia, Pinnularia and Rhopalodia. The diatomites consist mostly of corroded irregular-shaped silica grains from frustules dissolved by alkaline water, but five diatom genera were identified. These diatomites accumulated in ephemeral ponds developed on loess sediments in dry environments and seasonal climate between the latest Pleistocene and Middle Holocene. The diatom ooze and associated organic-rich silty sediments accumulated in shallow lakes with abundant catchment vegetation and considerable dissolved organic carbon, and contain fragmented but slightly dissolved frustules as a result of hydrodynamics and low pH, and also megascleres of Porifera, cysts of Chrysophyceae, and abundant phytoliths of Poaceae. The sediment underlying the diatom ooze was dated as of 4.6-4.4 cal C-14 ka BP and contains a diatom assemblage dominated by benthic epiphytic and acidophilous forms such as Eunotia, Pinnularia, and Gomphonema. The ooze and sediment overlying it contain an assemblage dominated by the planktonic Aulacoseira and Cyclotella, indicating >= 1 m-deep water column subject to moderate wind-driven hydrodynamics and variable water table. This succession shows that the development of the modern wetlands during the Middle Holocene, accompanied by the expansion of vegetation, resulted from a combination of high sea-level and increased rainfall and productivity driven by the wetter and warmer climate of the Holocene Hypsithermal, although the dense accumulation of frustules in the diatom ooze suggests a drier episode around similar to 4 ka BP. The results show that diatom assemblges preserved as diatomites can be used to understand the origins and response of the southern Brazilian wetlands to environmental changes, which may help address the extent of anthropogenic influence and response to future climate change, thereby contributing for the conservation and management of the coastal ecosystems.

This research aims to investigate the water quality of Kizilirmak River, that remain within the provincial boundaries of Sivas, using geo-statistical and multivariable statistical methods, and to provide the water quality map of Kizilirmak River. In this regard, surface water samples from 28 surface water quality monitoring stations were analysed for wet and dry seasons. The hydro-chemical properties of surface water quality were determined, and the water quality index was evaluated for each station. Spherical, exponential and Gaussian models were determined as the best semi-variogram models according to the minimum root mean square error values and the cross-validation method. The final water surface quality map of Kizilirmak River was obtained by weighted superposition of the spatial distribution maps of the surface water quality parameters which were obtained by the geo-statistical method. The correlations between the surface water quality parameters were determined using multivariable statistical analysis methods such as correlation analysis and factor analysis (principal component analysis). The surface water quality in the study area was categorized as excellent, good, poor and very poor. The water quality of Kizilirmak River's portion near Sivas city centre and in the South of the province did not meet the standards for drinking water purposes. This research provides the surface water quality map of the study area by use of GIS-based statistical methods.																			1387-585X	1573-2975				JUN	2020	22	5					4735	4769		10.1007/s10668-019-00472-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-019-00472-8													WOS:000528625000042

In this study, a Distell fatmeter was used to measure lipid levels in the muscle in lean, humper, redfin, and siscowet lake charr collected seasonally during 2013 and 2014 on the north, east, and west sides of Isle Royale, Lake Superior from two depth strata: <80 and >= 80 m. Diet compositions and dietary similarity of lake charr were also measured. Differences in lipid level were analyzed by ANCOVA with length and age as covariates and ecotype, depth, sex, and season as factors. Lipid levels were found to be higher in lake charr inhabiting waters >= 80 m. In waters <80 m, mean lipid level was highest in large siscowets (>= 703 mm; 41.2%) and lowest in old redfins (>= age 32; 11.8%). At depths >= 80 m, mean lipid levels were highest in large siscowets (64.4%) and lowest in young redfins (14.7%). In both depth strata, leans and humpers had intermediate lipid levels. Diet compositions were similar among ecotypes and did not explain the differences in lipid levels. Siscowets have the greatest depth range and vertical movement patterns among lake charr ecotypes in Lake Superior which is likely facilitated by high levels of intramuscular lipid. Lipid levels in leans and siscowets are heritable traits, but heritability of lipid levels in other ecotypes remains unknown.

The evolution of eye size in response to increased fish predation in Daphnia	EVOLUTION												Variation in eye size is ubiquitous across taxa. Increased eye size is correlated with improved vision and increased fitness via shifts in behavior. Tests of the drivers of eye size evolution have focused on macroevolutionary studies evaluating the importance of light availability. Predator-induced mortality has recently been identified as a potential driver of eye size variation. Here, we tested the influence of increased predation by the fish predator, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) on eye size evolution in waterfleas (Daphnia ambigua) from lakes in Connecticut. We quantified the relative eye size of Daphnia from lakes with and without alewife using wild-caught and third-generation laboratory reared specimens. This includes comparisons between lakes where alewife are present seasonally (anadromous) or permanently (landlocked). Wild-caught specimens did not differ in eye size across all lakes. However, third-generation lab reared Daphnia from lakes with alewife, irrespective of the form of alewife predation, exhibited significantly larger eyes than Daphnia from lakes without alewife. This genetically based increase in eye size may enhance the ability of Daphnia to detect predators. Alternatively, such shifts in eye size may be an indirect response to Daphnia aggregating at the bottom of lakes. To test these mechanisms, we collected Daphnia as a function of depth and found that eye size differed in Daphnia found at the surface versus the bottom of the water column between anadromous alewife and no alewife lakes. However, we found no evidence of Daphnia aggregating at the bottom of lakes. Such results indicate that the evolution of a larger eye may be explained by a connection between eyes and enhanced survival. We discuss the cause of the lack of concordance in eye size variation between our phenotypic and genetic specimens and the ultimate drivers of eye size.

Model experiments run with the Pothole Complex Hydrologic Model using downscaled climate data (variables relating to precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration at 1/8 degrees spatial resolution under four general circulation climate models and two gas emissions scenarios) were used to forecast the abundances of six focal wetland-dependent bird species in the Missouri Coteau portion of the PPR, providing ensemble scenarios at a spatial scale relevant to resource management. Although the projected number of May ponds (waterbodies present during bird breeding season) fluctuated through time with some decadal periodicity (and with the number present in a given year reflecting abundance over the previous three years), the ensemble model average indicated an increase in the average number of waterbodies present by the turn of the next century. Overall, the model experiments conservatively projected an 11.75% increase in the number of waterbodies present by 2090-2099 compared to a baseline period from 1967 to 2005 in the PPR. Wetland-dependent bird occurrence and abundance were significantly associated with temporal patterns and decadal periodicity in waterbody dynamics. Because of the strong associations between wetland-dependent bird occurrence and abundance and the number of prairie potholes, projected waterbody increases are forecasted to result in an 11.97% overall increase in occurrence and 8.63% increase in abundance of the six focal species by the end of the 21st century; these results contrast with forecasted drought-associated declines in waterbodies and birds in the PPR. This integrated hydrological-climatological approach offers a means of assessing how wetland-dependent bird populations may respond to changes in wetland habitat availability due to a changing dimate. Our results provide information that can help managers decide how to mitigate the effects of climate shifts on the distribution of wetland habitat and biota.

Janardhana; Madhav, Sughosh; Ahamad, Arif			Spatial and temporal dynamics of dissolved nutrients and factors affecting water quality of Chilika lagoon	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Water quality of Chilika lagoon was assessed for pre- and post-monsoon seasons. A marked spatial and temporal variability in the water quality was observed in this study. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals the influence of salinity, anthropogenic factors, as well as vegetation on the water quality. The higher concentration of nitrate (NO3-) and phosphate (PO43-) in certain pockets of the lagoon water was due to the prevalence of agricultural, municipal, and domestic waste. A positive correlation between PO43- and DSi indicates their terrigenous input from freshwater influx. Cyclone Phailin had profound impact on several water quality parameters. pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are governed largely by the presence of macrophytes. The impact of severe cyclone Phailin can be assessed from the very low salinity values persisting in the lagoon even 2.5months after the cyclone hit Odisha coast. Some toxic heavy metals like Copper (Cu), Lead (Pb), Nickel (Ni), Cobalt (Co), Manganese (Mn), and Iron (Fe) exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards at many locations in both the seasons. Non-conservative behavior of nutrients indicates well mixed nature of lagoon which is also indicative of good primary productivity. Northern sector (NS) of the lagoon is susceptible to eutrophication being riverine influenced region. Southern sector has more stable ion chemistry as a result of least freshwater discharge, constant supply of saline water, and lesser water renewal.

Measurements of windblown dust characteristics and ocean fertilization potential: The ephemeral river valleys of Namibia	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Delivery of nutrients to the ocean by mineral aerosol deposition involves complex biogeochemical interactions that include atmospheric processing, dissolution and biotic uptake of available nutrients in the surface waters. Research into the fertilization potential of aeolian dust is currently constrained by a lack of understanding of the nutrient composition and bioavailability in dust source areas. Further, research into hot-spots of dust emission has largely focused on paleo-lacustrine sources and pans, to the detriment of other potential sources such as ephemeral river valleys in desert regions. Here, we investigate the sediment characteristics and nutrient content of windblown and surface sediments of a largely overlooked southern African dust source, Namibia's ephemeral river valleys. We deployed monitoring equipment in three river valleys to capture deflated sediments and monitor airborne dust concentration and meteorological conditions throughout an annual dust season. Our results show that windblown dust within the river valleys is easily transportable offshore from Namibia over the Benguela Upwelling System, an intensely productive region of the South Atlantic Ocean. We demonstrate that the windblown dust contains iron, phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients, each of which may positively impact primary production rates when deposited in the complex upwelling system. The river valley dust has a significantly higher content of nutrients than either of southern Africa's major dry lake bed dust sources, Etosha and Makgadikgadi Pans. This aeolian work builds on previous source sediment findings proposing the ephemeral river valleys of Namibia as regionally important sources of dust with enhanced ocean fertilisation potential.

Whereas in the marine realm such extinction event is well-constrained, in terrestrial settings it is still poorly known, mainly due to the lack of suitable complete sections. This is utterly the case along the Western Tethys region, located at Pangaea's equator, where terrestrial successions are typically build-up of red beds often characterised by a significant erosive gap at the base of the Triassic strata. Henceforth, documenting potentially complete terrestrial successions along the PT transition becomes fundamental. Here, we document the exceptional Coll de Terrers area from the Catalan Pyrenees (NE Iberian Peninsula), for which a multidisciplinary research is conducted along the PT transition. The red-bed succession, located in a long E-W extended narrow rift system known as Pyrenean Basin, resulted from a continuous sedimentary deposition evolving from meandering (lower Upper Red Unit) to playa-lake/ephemeral lacustrine (upper Upper Red Unit) and again to meandering settings (Buntsandstein facies). Sedimentary continuity is suggested by preliminary cyclostratigraphic analysis that warrants further analysis. Our combined sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical data infer a humid-semiarid-humid climatic trend across the studied succession. The uppermost Permian strata, deposited under an orbitally controlled monsoonal regime, yields a relatively diverse ichnoassemblage mainly composed of tetrapod footprints and arthropod trace fossils. Such fossils indicate appropriate life conditions and water presence in levels that also display desiccation structures. These levels alternate with barren intervals formed under dry conditions, being thus indicative of strong seasonality. All these features are correlated with those reported elsewhere in Gondwana and Laurasia, and suggest that the Permian Triassic boundary might be recorded somewhere around the Buntsandstein base. Consequently, Coll de Terrers and the whole Catalan Pyrenees become key regions to investigate in detail the Permian extinction event and the Triassic ecosystems recovery.

Among these parasites, fungi from the phylum Chytridiomycota (i.e. chytrids) are the only eukaryotic microorganisms infecting cyanobacteria. Here, we address spatiotemporal dynamics of the cyanobacterial host Dolichospermum macrosporum (syn. Anabaena macrospora) and its associated chytrid parasites, Rhizosiphon spp., in an eutrophic lake by studying spatial (vertical, horizontal) and temporal (annual and inter-annual) variations. Our results show homogenous chytrid infection patterns along the water column and across sampling stations. However, the prevalence of infection presented drastic changes with time, at both intra-and inter-annual scales. In 2007, a maximum of 98% of vegetative cells were infected by R. crassum whereas this fungal species was not reported seven years later. In opposite, R. akinetum, a chytrid infecting only akinetes, increased its prevalence by 42% during the same period. High chytrid infection rate on the akinetes might have sizeable consequences on host recruitment (and proliferation) success from year to year, as supported by the recorded inter-annual host dynamics (affecting also the success of other chytrid parasites). The spatial homogenous chytrid infection on this cyanobacterium, coupled to both seasonal and inter-annual changes indicates that time, rather than space, controls such highly dynamic host-parasite relationships.

Otolith microchemistry shows natal philopatry of walleye in western Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Natal philopatry is important to the structure of fish populations because it can lead to local adaptations among component stocks of a mixed population, reducing the risk of recruitment failure. By contrast, straying between component stocks may bolster declining populations or allow for colonization of new habitat. To examine rates of natal philopatry and straying among western Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus) stocks, we used the concentration of strontium [Sr] in otolith cores to determine the natal origin of adults captured at three major spawning sites: the Sandusky (n = 62) and Maumee (n = 55) rivers and the Ohio reef complex (n = 50) during the 2012-2013 spawning seasons. Mean otolith core [Sr] was consistently and significantly higher for individuals captured in the Sandusky River than for those captured in the Maumee River or Ohio reef complex. Although logistic regression indicates that no individuals with a Maumee River or Ohio reef complex origin were captured in the Sandusky River, quadratic discriminant analysis suggests low rates of straying of fish between the Maumee and Sandusky rivers. Our results suggest little straying and high rates of natal philopatry in the Sandusky River walleye stock. Similar rates of natal philopatry may also exist across western Lake Erie walleye stocks, demonstrating a need for stock-specific management.

Particularly, the Dongting Lake's water shortage becomes very severe. To solve the problem caused by upstream dams, an innovative flood control scheme (IFCS) was introduced, and its feasibility of application in Dongting Lake is studied using the hydrodynamic module of Mike 21. The results show the IFCS can effectively convert the peak discharge of floodwater in wet seasons into water resources in dry seasons as the IFCS could significantly increase the usable water storage of the lake. For example, the usable water storage could increase to 2.85 billion m(3) and 1.81 billion m(3) in the extreme drought year of 2006 and 2011, respectively. The average increment of the water level would be about 0.4 m, 0.6 m, and 0.5 m in the West Dongting Lake (WDL), South Dongting Lake (SDL), and the East Dongting Lake (EDL), respectively, if the water stored in the inner lake was discharged uniformly in 30 days (27 November to 27 December 2006) with the application of IFCS. This study may provide an innovative method to alleviate the water shortage problem in Dongting Lake and other similar lakes.

One of the most crucial river-lake junction points in China is the junction of Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River (JPLYR), with the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) upstream. Based on remote sensing images of the dry season from 1987 to 2018, landcover change of JPLYR was obtained using the random forest classification method. Linear regression, principal component analysis (PCA), and classification and regression tree (CART) were used to determine relationships between 16 hydrological variables regarding magnitude, duration, timing, variation, and vegetation area throughout different operational stages of the TGD. Results showed that the operation of the TGD has anticipated and elongated the dry seasons, with a consequential shortening of the flood seasons that now occur later in the year. The peak water level was significantly reduced (p < 0.05), while the minimum water level remained unchanged throughout the study period. There was a 344% increase in vegetation coverage across the JPLYR from 1987 (0.677 km(2)) to 2018 (3.005 km(2)). The earlier beginning of dry season (BDS) was found to be most significant in affecting the increased vegetation area before and after the operation of TGD. The results provide an essential reference for assessing the potential influence of newly proposed dams in river-lake junctions and for optimizing future operations.					; Wang, XiaoLong/AGP-5220-2022	Tan, Zhiqiang/0000-0003-2853-4584; Zheng, Lilin/0000-0002-6170-930X													0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2020	589								125185	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125185													WOS:000568830400050

Geochemical Characterization of Two Ferruginous Meromictic Lakes in the Upper Midwest, USA	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												To elucidate the role of (bio)geochemical processes that fueled iron and carbon cycling in early Earth oceans, modern environments with similar geochemical conditions are needed. As the range of chemical, physical, and biological attributes of the Precambrian oceans must have varied in time and space, lakes of different compositions are useful to ask and answer different questions. Tropical Lake Matano (Indonesia), the largest known ferruginous lake, and Lake Pavin (France), a meromictic crater lake, are the two best studied Precambrian ocean analogs. Here we present seasonal geochemical data from two glacially formed temperate ferruginous lakes: Brownie Lake (MN) and Canyon Lake (MI) in the Upper Midwest, USA. The results of seasonal monitoring over multiple years indicate that (1) each lake is meromictic with a dense, anoxic monimolimnion, which is separated from the less dense, oxic mixolimnion by a sharp chemocline; (2) below this chemocline are ferruginous waters, with maximum dissolved iron concentrations >1mM; (3) meromixis in Brownie Lake is largely anthropogenic, whereas in Canyon Lake it is natural; (4) the shallow chemocline of Brownie Lake and high phosphorus reservoir make it an ideal analog to study anoxygenic photosynthesis, elemental ratios, and mineralogy; and (5) a deep penetrating suboxic zone in Canyon Lake may support future studies of suboxic microbial activity or mineral transformation. Earth's atmosphere acquired oxygen around 2.46-2.33billion years ago from oxygen-producing bacteria. Researchers are interested in how elements, for instance, iron and carbon, cycled between dissolved and solid phases in the ocean before oxygen was produced. In past oceans with little oxygen, all life would have been microbial. In order to study elemental cycling on early Earth, modern water bodies where oxygen is absent in deep water are needed. Water samples were analyzed from different depths within Brownie Lake in Minneapolis, MN, and Canyon Lake in the Upper Peninsula of MI. We found that these lakes have two distinct chemical layers like past oceans: a top section that has oxygen and a bottom section that has no oxygen. The bottom sections never mix with the water on top and so remain without oxygen year-round. Brownie and Canyon Lakes have different, but applicable water chemistries as compared to well-studied field sites in Europe, Africa, and Asia. With the addition of Brownie Lake and Canyon Lake as early Earth analogs, researchers will have the potential to answer many questions about early Earth's oceans.

Shallow Fracture Buffers High Elevation Runoff in Northwest Greenland	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The expansion of refrozen ice slabs in Greenland's firn may enhance meltwater runoff and increase surface mass loss. However, the impermeability of ice slabs and the pathways for meltwater export from these regions remain poorly characterized. Here, we present ice-penetrating radar observations of extensive meltwater infiltration and refreezing beneath ice slabs in Northwest Greenland. We show that these buried ice complexes form where supraglacial streams or lakes drain through surface crevasses into relict firn beneath the ice slabs. This suggests that the firn can continue to buffer mass loss from surface meltwater runoff and limit meltwater delivery to the ice sheet bed even after ice slabs have formed. Therefore, a significant time lag may exist between the initial formation of ice slabs and the onset of complete surface runoff and seasonal meltwater drainage to the subglacial system in interior regions of the ice sheet.

Most studies on HAB have been conducted for shallow freshwater lakes, such as Taihu Lake in China. However, algal blooms in urban rivers located downstream of eutrophicated lakes are also a serious problem for local administrators. It is important for them to know the current and potential risk level of MCs. This environmental issue is rarely reported or discussed. Within this context, we monitored MC concentrations in the Binhu River Network (BRN) in the algal bloom season (Aug, Sep, and Oct) in 2019. To note if the MC concentrations were dangerous, we used 1.0 mu g/L suggested by the World Health Organization as the standard value. The proportions of MC samples violating the standard value were 31.78% (Aug), 21.14% (Sep) and 30.77% (Oct). We also designed two statistical models to predict MC concentrations and the possibility to exceed the standard level based on 10 water quality surrogates: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression (LR) models. These two models were trained and validated by the monitoring dataset (n = 224). Both models had good performances during training and testing. Although the water quality varied diversely both in spatial and temporal scale, Cluster Analysis (CA) could detect similarities among the samples and separated them into 3 classes, with each class denoting different types of rivers based on the 10 water quality surrogates. Then the ANN and LR were applied as a function of chl-a in each class; by gradually increasing chl-a concentration, we detected chl-a thresholds in class 1, 2, 3 were 25.5, 224, and 109.5 mu g/L, respectively, when MCs have a 50% possibility to exceed standard level. The threshold values provided important implications for MC management in the BRN. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assesses the hydrological changes of Lake Tana Basin under future climatic changes. The study used Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) to project future climate change. The basin's hydrology was assessed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The SWAT was driven by the outputs of SDSM and calibrated against observed river flow. The results indicate that the maximum and minimum temperature trends are generally in line with the global trends, whereas the precipitation shows an inconsistent pattern. The predictive results from the RCP8.5 radiative forcing scenarios indicate that during the wet season (dry season), the evapotranspiration, streamflow, and base flow will tend to increase by 14.9%, 9.7%, and 20.9% (70.1%, 2.8%, and 16.7%) respectively by the year 2090s. The streamflow curve for the Lake Tana basin's under future climate change shows a steep slope, and stream discharge is highly variable, particularly the surface runoff. This study indicates that although climate change seems uncertain for the study area, preparedness is warranted to avoid the aggravation of soil erosion, water stress and scarcity, and often floods/droughts.					; Manjunatha, Busnur/NWH-6113-2025	Tikuye (Ph.D), Birhan Getachew/0000-0002-5229-1845; 													1474-7065	1873-5193				OCT	2022	127								103162	10.1016/j.pce.2022.103162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pce.2022.103162		JUN 2022											WOS:000811869000005

Using simulation to understand annual sea lamprey marking rates on lake trout	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Sea lampreys attack fish, killing some and leaving marks on others. Great Lakes fishery managers rely on observed marking rates to assess the success of the sea lamprey control program and estimate sea lamprey-induced mortality of lake trout. Because marking rates are only observed on survivors of sea lamprey attacks, they may not provide a reliable index of actual attack or mortality rates. To investigate the effect of survivor bias, we developed a simulation model representing a single season (June-December) of sea lamprey attacks. Simulated attack rates varied with month and lake trout size; simulated pierce and lethality rates varied with month alone. Surveyed marking rates were represented by simulated survivors in October; true rates were calculated from all simulated lake trout (dead and alive) in December. Simulation results were subsetted to include only those within the range of marking rates actually observed in the Great Lakes. Type A (piercing) marking rates were a good index of the sea lamprey attack rate and the sea lamprey-induced mortality rate if annual lethality rates were relatively constant. Type B (non-piercing) marking rates were a good index of the sea lamprey attack rate and the sea lamprey-induced mortality rate if annual pierce rates were relatively constant. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pierce and lethality rates, we recommend that sea lamprey abundance information be incorporated in existing lake trout statistical catch-at-age models via a functional response component relating sea lamprey feeding to lake trout abundance, if possible.

J	Wang, MD; Hou, JZ; Lei, YB				Wang, Mingda; Hou, Juzhi; Lei, Yanbin			Classification of Tibetan lakes based on variations in seasonal lake water temperature	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												Widespread lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are valuable archives for investigating climate and environment changes, which could provide essential information on the mechanisms of past climate changes on the TP and their interaction with the global climate systems. However, there is a lack of in-depth investigation of modern limnological processes in the Tibetan lakes, which hampers the understanding of paleolimnological records and lake ecosystem succession. In this study, we performed continuous temperature monitoring at two lakes, Bangong Co, a freshwater lake in the western TP, and Dagze Co, a brackish lake in the central TP, in order to characterize the patterns of seasonal temperature variability, stratification, and mixing. Temperature data for an entire hydrological year demonstrate that Bangong Co is a dimictic lake and that Dagze Co is a meromictic lake. The higher salinity in the deep water at Dagze Co prevents the lake from overturning completely, and this finding is supported by simulations using a physical limnological model Lake Analyzer. Continuous lake water temperature monitoring provides fundamental data for classifying Tibetan lakes, as well as the hydrological basis for understanding their paleolimnological records and ecosystem succession.

In the Brazilian semi-arid, eutrophication in reservoirs raises the risk of water scarcity. The reservoirs have also a high seasonal and annual variability of water level and volume, which can have important effects on chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla). Assessing the influence of climate and hydrological variability on phytoplankton growth can be important to find strategies to achieve water security in tropical regions with similar problems. This study explores the potential of machine learning models to predict Chla in reservoirs and to understand their relationship with hydrological and climate variables. The model is based mainly on satellite data, which makes the methodology useful for data-scarce regions. Tree-based ensemble methods had the best performances among six machine learning methods and one parametric model. This performance can be considered satisfactory as classical empirical relationships between Chla and phosphorus may not hold for tropical reservoirs. Water volume and the mix-layer depth are inversely related to Chla, while mean surface temperature, water level, and surface solar radiation have direct relationships with Chla. These findings provide insights on how seasonal climate prediction and reservoir operation might influence water quality in regions supplied by superficial reservoirs.

J	de Jong, C				de Jong, Carmen			Challenges for mountain hydrology in the third millennium	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Mountain hydrology, in particular in the European Alps, has undergone significant changes within the last decades due to climate and land use change as well as altered water consumption patterns. Climate change influences both the characteristics of droughts and floods as well as evapotranspiration, sublimation, snow-rainfall ratios, snow seasonality, and water reserves locked in glaciers. Land use change and altered water use may strongly outweigh these impacts, in particular through industrialization, urbanization, and tourism. Extreme hydrological situations such as new floods types have evolved from combined land-use and climate change and new types of water scarcity in association with accelerated and seasonally shifted water abstraction. Related water quality and pollution issues are of growing concern especially in seasonally highly populated areas. Main methodological challenges include keeping pace with recent hydrological change such as altered water inputs, water abstraction, and water quality. Emphasis should be put on the significance of small proportional changes within the total water cycle as these may have major impacts on floods, water scarcity, and general livelihood. Political challenges are strongest concerning problem reporting, initiation of monitoring programmes, and data transparency. The general lack of higher altitude hydrological data and experience with new hydrological phenomena will require an analytical approach directed more strongly toward interactions between scientists, stakeholders and decision makers encompassing local stakeholder knowledge and historical evidence. Data and innovative practices need to be exchanged more strongly between alpine regions and between the local and European level. It should be recognized that an alternative water management in mountains is fundamental for the future.						de Jong, Carmen/0000-0001-8152-6052														2296-665X					2015	3								38	10.3389/fenvs.2015.00038	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2015.00038													WOS:000458082100010

Diffusive and ebullitive transport of methane and nitrous oxide from streams: Are bubble-mediated fluxes important?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Using measured rates of bubble release and diffusive gas transport (also termed surface aeration), we address the role of these transport mechanisms in emissions of nitrous oxide and methane from four streams. While ebullition in streams and rivers has received little study, we found that ebullition was an important mode of methane emissions, contributing 20%-67% of methane emissions (among streams). Nitrous oxide emissions via ebullition were negligible (<0.1% of diffusive emissions). Total methane emissions (ebullition + diffusive transport) were over ten times greater than N2O emissions in terms of CO2 equivalents. Rates of bubble release were highly variable, ranging from 20 mL m(-2) d(-1) to 170 mL m(-2) d(-1) (seasonal average among streams, with volumes reflecting ambient temperature and pressure). Methane was the most abundant of the bubble gases that were measured (26% by volume on average among streams), followed by carbon dioxide (1% on average) then nitrous oxide. Average bubble nitrous oxide concentrations were below atmospheric mixing ratios for the majority of streams; however, one stream showed concentrations as high as 3600 ppbv. Sediment characteristics were strong predictors of bubble composition. Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were positively related to the proportion of fine sediments. High methane concentrations in bubbles were related to high sediment organic carbon.

The diversity of butterflies is known to a large extent in Nepal, but little information is available on the feeding habits of butterflies. This study was conducted along the periphery of Rupa Wetland from January to December 2019 to assess butterfly species diversity and to identify the factors influencing their foraging choices. In total, we recorded 1535 individuals of 138 species representing all six families. For our examination of butterfly-nectar plant interactions, we recorded a total of 298 individuals belonging to 31 species of butterfly visiting a total of 28 nectar plant species. Overall, total butterfly visitation was found to be significantly influenced by plant category (herbaceous preferred over woody), floral color (yellow white and purple preferred over pink), and corolla type (tubular preferred over nontubular). Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between the proboscis length of butterflies and the corolla tube length of flowers. Examining each butterfly family separately revealed that, for four of the families (Lycaenidae, Nymphalidae, Papilionidae, and Pieridae), none of the tested factors (flower color, plant category, and corolla type) were shown to significantly influence butterfly abundance at flowers. However, Hesperidae abundance was found to be significantly influenced by both flower color (with more butterflies observed at yellow flowers than purple) and flower type (with more butterflies observed at tubular flowers than nontubular flowers). Our results reveal that Rupa Lake is a suitable habitat for butterflies, providing valuable floral resources. Hence, further detailed studies encompassing all seasons, a greater variety of plants, and other influential factors in different ecological regions are fundamental for creating favorable environments to sustain important butterfly pollinators and help create balanced wetland ecosystems.					; Stewart, Alyssa/AAA-2765-2022; Subedi, Bandana/NQE-7223-2025	Subedi, Bandana/0000-0002-9590-9043; Neupane, Bijaya/0000-0003-1215-689X; Adhikari, Hari/0000-0002-9089-3249; 													2045-7758					MAR	2021	11	5					2086	2099		10.1002/ece3.7177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7177		FEB 2021						33717444					WOS:000614097200001
J	Ehrlich, E; Gaedke, U				Ehrlich, Elias; Gaedke, Ursula			Coupled changes in traits and biomasses cascading through a tritrophic plankton food web	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Trait-based approaches have broadened our understanding of how the composition of ecological communities responds to environmental drivers. This research has mainly focussed on abiotic factors and competition determining the community trait distribution, while effects of trophic interactions on trait dynamics, if considered at all, have been studied for two trophic levels at maximum. However, natural food webs are typically at least tritrophic. This enables indirect interactions of traits and biomasses among multiple trophic levels leading to underexplored effects on food web dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of mutual trait adjustment among three trophic levels in a natural plankton food web (Lake Constance) and in a corresponding mathematical model. We found highly recurrent seasonal biomass and trait dynamics, where herbivorous zooplankton increased its size, and thus its ability to counter phytoplankton defense, before phytoplankton defense actually increased. This is contrary to predictions from bitrophic systems where counter-defense of the consumer is a reaction to prey defense. In contrast, counter-defense of carnivores by size adjustment followed the defense of herbivores as expected. By combining observations and model simulations, we show how the reversed trait dynamics at the two lower trophic levels result from a "trophic biomass-trait cascade" driven by the carnivores. Trait adjustment between two trophic levels can therefore be altered by biomass or trait changes of adjacent trophic levels. Hence, analyses of only pairwise trait adjustment can be misleading in natural food webs, while multitrophic trait-based approaches capture indirect biomass-trait interactions among multiple trophic levels.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				OCT	2020	65	10					2502	2514		10.1002/lno.11466	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11466		MAY 2020											WOS:000533440600001

Nevertheless, the distribution of NEOs in artificial environments is not clear. The Beijing -Hangzhou Grand Canal is the longest canal in the world. The northern Jiangsu segment of the Grand Canal was selected to study the spatiotemporal variation and source of eight NEOs in the canal water and assess their ecological and health risks. The total NEO concentration in the canal water was 12-289 ng L-1 in the dry season and 18-373 ng L-1 in the wet season, which were within the concentration range in other 11 natural rivers worldwide. The average total NEO concentrations were not statistically different between the seasons; only the concentrations of imidaclothiz, thiacloprid (THI), acetamiprid, and dinotefuran were different. At city scale, the total NEO concentration in the dry season showed a decreasing trend along the water flow from Xuzhou City to Yangzhou City. The total NEO concentrations were found to be positively correlated with the sown area of farm crops and the rural labour force, indicating the agricultural influence on the spatial distribution of NEO concentrations. In the wet season, relatively high NEO concentrations were distributed in downstream sites under the influence of artificial regulation. The primary contributor to the NEO inputs into the canal was the nonpoint source in the dry and wet seasons, with a relative contribution of 68 %. THI, imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxan would produce chronic ecological risks in both seasons. Further consideration needs to be given to the above four NEOs and NEO mixtures. The human health risks that NEOs posed by drinking water were assessed based on the chronic daily intake (CDI). The maximum CDI for adults and children was lower than the reference doses. This suggested public health would not be at risk from canal water consumption.

However, sampling intensity may affect the estimation of functional diversity indices and thus lower the validity of functional diversity indices in monitoring long-term changes in ecosystem status. In this study, we used a simulation study to investigate the effect of sampling intensity on the estimation of functional diversity indices of fish communities in the Haizhou Bay, China, based on thirteen fish functional traits that reflect the characteristics of ferxling, habitat use, swimming behavior, ecological adaptation, reproduction and life history. in general, sampling intensity influenced the estimation of functional diversity indices, and the accuracy and precision of the estimation of functional diversity indices increased with the sampling intensity. Functional richness and functional divergence indices were less sensitive to sampling intensity than functional evenness indices. The effects of sampling intensity on the estimation of functional diversity indices also showed an obvious seasonal variability, reflecting seasonal differences in trait distribution of composite fish species. This study indicates that it is essential to evaluate and identify the seasonal sampling intensity required in monitoring programs, especially for long-term monitoring program of fisheries ecosystems.					; Zhang, Xiaofeng/KGM-8187-2024	Zhang, Chongliang/0000-0002-4753-9973; Ren, Yiping/0000-0003-2482-0284													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2021	121								107169	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107169													WOS:000604883700006

Samples were collected from Lake Ulansuhai in April, August, and October 2017 (wet season) and January 2018 (dry season). Based on the functional group classification method, 23 phytoplankton functional groups with 5 major ones were identified. During the wet season, high amounts of nutrients, elevated temperatures, and heavy rainfall produced spatiotemporal variabilities in phytoplankton communities, whereas during the dry season, the frozen period was the critical factor that determined the spatiotemporal variabilities in the phytoplankton communities. Through redundancy analyses, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were observed to directly affect the phytoplankton growth; algal growth affected the chemical oxygen demand, and pH and environmental factors interacted with the phytoplankton growth. These results highlight the complex feedbacks of shallow eutrophic lake ecosystems in arid regions. Group TC (represented by Lyngbya) was correlated with Huangtai algae. In August, a Huangtai algal bloom resulted in a relatively stable water column, which was conducive to group TC growth. Therefore, the presence of certain phytoplankton functional groups can indicate the current lake conditions by identifying the coverage of Huangtai algae, which provides a scientific basis for an early warning of a potential algal bloom.					li, meixia/LEM-7721-2024	Zhang, Zhuangzhuang/0009-0004-7115-0708													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY 15	2020	192	6							371	10.1007/s10661-020-08349-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08349-4								32415539					WOS:000536520800006

However, the mechanisms underlying BCP and the amount of generated AOC deposited effectively, are still poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a systematic study combining modern hydrochemical monitoring and a sediment trap experiment in Fuxian Lake (Yunnan, SW China), the second-deepest plateau, oligotrophic freshwater lake in China. Temperature, pH, EC (electrical conductivity), DO (dissolved O-2), [HCO3-], [Ca2+], SIc, partial CO2 (pCO(2)) pressure, and carbon isotopic compositions of HCO3- (delta C-13(DIC)) in water from Fuxian Lake all displayed distinct seasonal and vertical variations. This was especially apparent in an inverse correlation between pCO(2) and DO, indicating that variations of hydrochemistry in the lake water were mainly controlled by the metabolism of the aquatic phototrophs. Furthermore, the lowest C/N ratios and highest delta C-13(org) were recorded in the trap sediments. Analyses of the C/N ratio demonstrated that the proportions of AOC ranged from 30% to 100% of all OC, indicating that AOC was an important contributor to sedimentary organic matter (OC). It was calculated that the AOC flux in Fuxian Lake was 20.43 t C km(-2) in 2017. Therefore, AOC produced by carbonate weathering and aquatic photosynthesis could potentially be a significant carbon sink and may have an important contribution to solving the lack of carbon sinks in the global carbon cycle.					; Hu, Yundi/KLZ-3806-2024; He, Haibo/ABF-3668-2020; Liu, Zaihua/K-2869-2013	He, Haibo/0000-0002-5398-8169; Yan, Hao/0000-0002-3912-601X; 													2096-0956	2365-7499				OCT	2019	38	5					613	626		10.1007/s11631-019-00359-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11631-019-00359-5													WOS:000485296900002

The data for the surface area of Burdur Lake was collected over 34 years between 1984 and 2019 by Google Earth Engine. The seasonal variation in the water bodies area was collected using our proposed extraction method and 570 Landsat images. The reduction in the total area of the lake was observed between 206.6 km(2) in 1984 to 125.5 km(2) in 2019. The vegetation cover and meteorological parameters collected that affect the observed variation of surface water bodies for the same area include precipitation, evapotranspiration, albedo, radiation, and temperature. The selected meteorological variables influence the reduction in lake area directly during various seasons. Correlations showed a strong positive or negative significant relationship between the reduction and the selected meteorological variables. A factor analysis provided three components that explain 82.15% of the total variation in the data. The data provide valuable references for decision makers to develop sustainable agriculture and industrial water use policies to preserve water resources as well as cope with potential climate changes.

Landsat images from 2009/2010 and 2013 were used to drive baseline data including land cover, land use, stream and road. Elevation based agro-ecology and slope map were derived from SRTM DEM. Rapid wild animals survey, identifying the location of known historical, cultural and unique features were carried out in the filed with the help of key-informants. A suitability model was designed in GIS environment to assess the suitability of an area for tourism considering suitability factors such as land cover types, wild animal zone, unique features, topography and distance to a road. The result showed areas which are highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable, or unsuitable for tourism. The old giant, Podocarpus (Podocarpus falcatus) trees that serve as habitat of the endangered and endemic mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni), were identified as very high suitable areas for tourists. The highly suitable areas include forest area along the lake which is seasonally visited by mountain nyala and areas of plantation forest that are found adjacent to natural forest. These areas follow remnants of the natural forest and found along boundary between the mid-highland and the highland agro-ecologies. The agricultural land use types consisting of maize/haricotbean and wheat/barley were evaluated as marginally suitable, nevertheless these could be considered as potential for agri-tourism. The study revealed that the concession area is found to be a suitable area with its huge potential for ecotourism development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Global inundation dynamics inferred from multiple satellite observations, 1993-2000	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Wetlands and surface waters are recognized to play important roles in climate, hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, and availability of water resources. Until now, quantitative, global time series of spatial and temporal dynamics of inundation have been unavailable. This study presents the first global estimate of monthly inundated areas for 1993 - 2000. The data set is derived from a multisatellite method employing passive microwave land surface emissivities calculated from SSM/I and ISCCP observations, ERS scatterometer responses, and AVHRR visible and near-infrared reflectances. The satellite data are used to calculate inundated fractions of equal area grid cells (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees at the equator), taking into account the contribution of vegetation to the passive microwave signal. Global inundated area varies from a maximum of 5.86 x 10(6) km(2) ( average for 1993 - 2000) to a mean minimum of 2.12 x 10(6) km(2). These values are considered consistent with existing independent, static inventories. The new multisatellite estimates also show good agreement with regional high-resolution SAR observations over the Amazon basin. The seasonal and interannual variations in inundation have been evaluated against rain rate estimates from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and water levels in wetlands, lakes, and rivers measured with satellite altimeters. The inundation data base is now being used for hydrology modeling and methane studies in GCMs.					Prigent, Catherine/ABF-7175-2020; Papa, Fabrice/D-3695-2009; Rossow, William/F-3138-2015	Papa, Fabrice/0000-0001-6305-6253; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 19	2007	112	D12							D12107	10.1029/2006JD007847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JD007847													WOS:000247533900003

However, precisely due to the fact that rivers receive significant terrestrial input, the distinction between resident freshwater taxa vs. land-derived microbes can often become ambiguous. Furthermore, ecosystem perturbations could introduce allochthonous microbial groups and reshape riverine bacterial communities. Using full- and partial-length 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences, we analyzed the composition of bacterial communities in the Tar River of North Carolina from November 2010 to November 2011, during which a natural perturbation occurred: the inundation of the lower reaches of an otherwise drought-stricken river associated with Hurricane Irene, which passed over eastern North Carolina in late August 2011. This event provided the opportunity to examine the microbiological, hydrological, and geochemical impacts of a disturbance, defined here as the large freshwater influx into the Tar River, superimposed on seasonal changes or other ecosystem variability independent of the hurricane. Our findings demonstrate that downstream communities are more taxonomically diverse and temporally variable than their upstream counterparts. More importantly, pre- vs. post-disturbance taxonomic comparison of the freshwater-dominant Betaproteobacteria class and the phylum Verrucomicrobia reveal a disturbance signature of previously undetected taxa of diverse origins. We use known traits of closely-related taxa to interpret the ecological function of disturbance-associated bacteria, and hypothesize that carbon cycling was enhanced post-disturbance in the Tar River, likely due to the flux of organic carbon into the system associated with the large freshwater pulse. Our analyses demonstrate the importance of geochemical and hydrological alterations in structuring bacterial communities, and illustrate the response of temperate riverine bacteria on fine taxonomic scales to a disturbance.

The review consists of three parts: (a) the existing literature on concentrations of cyanobacterial toxins in seafood is reviewed, and the likelihood of bioaccumulation discussed; (b) we derive cyanotoxin doses likely to occur through seafood consumption and propose guideline values for seafood and compare these to guidelines for drinking water; and (c) we discuss means to assess, control or mitigate the risks of exposure to cyanotoxins through seafood consumption. This is discussed in the context of two specific procedures, the food specific HACCP-approach and the water-specific Water Safety Plan approach by the WHO. Risks of exposure to cyanotoxins in food are sometimes underestimated. Risk assessments should acknowledge this and investigate the partitioning of exposure between drinking-water and food, which may vary depending on local circumstances. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Groundwater inflow to lakes, even at low rates, has proven to be a key in both lake nutrient balances and in determining lake vulnerability to pollution. Although difficult to measure using standard hydrometric methods, significant insight into groundwater-lake interactions has been acquired by studies applying geochemical tracers. However, the use of simple steady-state, well-mixed models, and the lack of characterization of lake spatiotemporal variability remain important sources of uncertainty, preventing the characterization of the entire lake hydrological cycle, particularly during ice-covered periods. In this study, a small groundwater-connected lake was monitored to determine the annual dynamics of the natural tracers, water stable isotopes and radon-222, through the implementation of a comprehensive sampling strategy. A multilayer mass balance model was found outperform a well-mixed, one-layer model in terms of quantifying groundwater fluxes and their temporal evolution, as well as characterizing vertical differences. Water stable isotopes and radon-222 were found to provide complementary information on the lake water budget. Radon-222 has a short response time, and highlights rapid and transient increases in groundwater inflow, but requires a thorough characterization of groundwater radon-222 activity. Water stable isotopes follow the hydrological cycle of the lake closely and highlight periods when the lake budget is dominated by evaporation versus groundwater inflow, but continuous monitoring of local meteorological parameters is required. Careful compilation of tracer evolution throughout the water column and over the entire year is also very informative. The developed models, which are suitable for detailed, site-specific studies, allow the quantification of groundwater inflow and internal dynamics during both ice-free and ice-covered periods, providing an improved tool for understanding the annual water cycle of lakes.					; Guillon, Sophie/A-9044-2013; Gibson, John/D-1897-2009; GIBERT-BRUNET, Elisabeth/MEO-1966-2025	GIBERT-BRUNET, Elisabeth/0000-0001-7783-7536; Barbecot, Florent/0000-0002-3286-3156; Guillon, Sophie/0000-0002-1694-5477; Gibson, John Joseph/0000-0001-5952-0228; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUL 1	2017	31	14					2566	2581		10.1002/hyp.11206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11206													WOS:000405521700006

Alec; Haas, Christian			Retrievals of Lake Ice Thickness From Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake Using CryoSat-2	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Satellite observations have revealed decreases in the duration of the seasonal snow and ice coverage of Great Slave Lake (GSL) and Great Bear Lake (GBL), large freshwater lakes in Northern Canada. However, limited information is available about ice thickness changes. Here, we present and validate a method to retrieve lake ice thickness using the CryoSat-2 (CS2) radar altimeter. These are the first satellite altimeter retrievals of lake ice thickness. Under optimal conditions, the CS2 signal is scattered from both the snow-ice and the ice-water interfaces, with returns from each interface being of sufficient power to be identified in the radar waveform. The distance between the scattering horizons is used to determine the ice thickness, similar to traditional ground penetrating radar measurements. The seasonal evolution of ice thickness of GBL and GSL is compared with in situ measurements, modeled ice thicknesses, and previous studies. The impact of ice and snow properties on signal penetration and the thickness retrieval are examined with synthetic aperture radar imagery. The CS2 ice thickness retrievals are able to observe the seasonal thickening of the lake ice and closely match the in situ measurements over both lakes (R > 0.65, RMSE < 0.33 m). Thickness retrievals of thin ice are limited by a minimum waveform peak separation of 2 range bins, approximately 0.26 m in ice. Although not designed for lake ice studies, CS2 and future SAR satellite altimeter missions offer new possibilities to monitor the ice and water levels of climatically sensitive and influential lakes.

However, there are limited numbers of studies in the literature that focus on estimating the deposition flux of reactive P (Pr). The aim of this study is to estimate the Pr deposition on the Xiangxi River watershed, and therefore, provide a comprehensive understanding about the Pr deposition on subtropical watersheds in China. Results have shown that maximal Pr deposition fluxes reached 12 kg km(-2) in our selected subtropical watershed. Furthermore, we found out the particulate phosphorus (PP) were dominating the total Pr deposition in the Xiangxi River watershed. According to our experiments, certain forms of Pr deposition were associated with high correlation coefficients with respect to the variation of rainfall intensity. Results also demonstrated that the dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) via wet deposition had large influences on the DOP and SRP concentrations in runoff, while the PO4-P and PP via wet deposition only affected PO4-P and PP loads through runoff discharge. Our experiments also shown that most parts of the Pr in runoff water was derived from rainfall and its magnitudes varied with land types. Results suggested that during the dry season, the Pr wet deposition not only was an important source for the Pr transport driven by runoff, but also was one of the most important influencing factors that dominated the Pr transport in subtropical watersheds.

Most of the fish demonstrated a lipid content in the fillet lower than 2.0 g 100 g(-1) wet weight (range 0.6-9.7). A strong relationship between feeding behavior and fatty acid composition of the muscle lipids was observed. Planktivorous fish showed the lowest amounts of n-3 fatty acids (p < 0.05), but the highest monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) contents, in particular 18:1n-9. Conversely, carnivorous fish showed the highest amounts of saturated fatty acids and n-3 fatty acids (p < 0.05), but the lowest MUFA contents. Omnivorous fish showed substantial proportions of n-3 fatty acids and the highest contents of n-6 fatty acids. Principal component analysis showed a distinct separation between fish species according to their feeding habits and demonstrated that the most contributing trophic markers were 18:1n-9, 18:3n-3, 22:6n3 and 20:4n-6. The quantitative amounts n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in muscle tissues varied depending on the fish species, the lipid content and the feeding habits. Some species were very lean, and therefore would be poor choices for human consumption to meet dietary n-3 fatty acid requirements. Nevertheless, the more frequently consumed and appreciated fish, shad and whitefish, had EPA and DHA contents in the range 900-1,000 mg 100 g(-1) fresh fillet.

These events are difficult to monitor and quantify due to their small scale and frequent nature. However, recent developments in Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have provided a possible approach to track their spatiotemporal variation and their impact on the geomorphological evolution of the glacier terminus area. Here, we present analysis from UAV surveys conducted over eight field campaigns to the HLG Glacier, providing evidence of glacier change between October 2017 and November 2020. Structure from Motion with Multi-View Stereo (SfM-MVS) was applied to produce multi-temporal Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and orthophoto mosaics, from which geomorphological maps and DEMs of Difference (DoDs) were derived to quantify glacier changes. These analyses reveal that at the margins of the glacier terminus retreated 132.1 m over the period of analysis, and that in the area specifically affected by collapsing (i.e., the glacier collapsed terminus), it retreated 236.4 m. Overall the volume lost in the terminal area was of the order of 184.61 +/- 10.32 x 10(4) m(3), within which the volume change due to observed collapsing events comprises approximately 28%. We show that ice volume changes at the terminus due to a single ice collapse event may exceed the interannual level of volume change, and the daily volume of ice loss due to ice calving exceeds the seasonal and interannual level by a factor of ~2.5 and 4. Our results suggest that the evolution of the HLG Glacier terminus is dominantly controlled by the frontal ice-water interactions. If the future evolution of glaciers such as HLG Glacier is to be robustly predicted, the contribution of mechanical ablation should be accounted for by numerical models.					; Xu, Shuyang/GQA-8488-2022; Sun, Meng/M-7203-2019	Xu, Shuyang/0000-0002-0409-8928; Feng, Meili/0000-0002-2305-6934; Quincey, Duncan/0000-0002-7602-7926; 													0169-555X	1872-695X				AUG 15	2022	411								108293	10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.108293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.108293		MAY 2022											WOS:000807535000002

To fill that knowledge gap, a lake and a reservoir located at 53 degrees S were selected and studied during three campaigns equally distributed over one year. Among the parameters measured were CH4 and CO2 emissions, as well their dissolved concentrations in the water column, which were determined with high spatial resolution. No ebullition was observed and the CH4 flux ranged from 0.0094 to 4.47 mmol m(-2) d(-1) while the CO2 flux ranged from -22.95 to 35.68 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Dissolved CH4 concentrations varied over more than four orders of magnitude (0.025-128.75 mu mol L-1), and the dissolved carbon dioxide ranged from below the detection limit of our method (i.e., 0.15 mu mol L-1) to 379.09 mu mol L-1. The high spatial resolution of the methods used enabled the construction of bathymetric maps, surface contour maps of CH4 and CO2 fluxes, and transect contour maps of dissolved oxygen, temperature, and dissolved greenhouse gases. Overall, both lakes were net greenhouse gas producers and were not significantly different from temperate lakes located at a similar northern latitudes (53 degrees N), except that ebullition was never observed in the studied sub-Antarctic lakes.

To understand the seasonal variation in the phytoplankton community in Lake Wuchang, Anhui Province, water samples were collected in three different hydrological periods (dry season, normal season, and wet season) from December 2019 to August 2020. The dominance value (Y), niche width (B-i), niche overlap (O-ij), variance ratio method (VR), chi-squared test (chi(2)), and association coefficients were used to analyze the niche and interspecific association with respect to the dominant phytoplankton species in different hydrological periods, while the redundancy analysis method (RDA) was used to distinguish the key driving environmental factors for the dominant phytoplankton species. The results showed that 308 species belonging to 8 phyla were identified, of which 13 species from 4 phyla were the dominant species. From the dry season to wet season, the dominant species changed from Bacillariophyta to Cyanophyta, while Synedra acus was the dominant species throughout the hydrological periods. The niche width of the dominant species varied from 1.77 to 6.65, and the niche width of Dinobryon was the lowest, while that of Synedra acus was the highest. The niche overlap showed temporal and spatial differences, of which 30 dominant species pairs were greater than 0.600, indicating that they occupied the environmental resources in a highly similar way. The interspecific association results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the dominant species, especially in normal and wet seasons. Only 10 of the 48 dominant species pairs had significant associations based on the chi(2) test, and two pairs had negative associations in the wet season, which might be related to the hydrological condition in the wet season. According to redundancy analysis, NO3 (-)-N, NH4 (+)-N, PO4 (3-)-P, water depth (WD), and water temperature (WT) were the key environmental factors affecting the phytoplankton community variation in Lake Wuchang. This paper provides a new perspective for the study of the early warnings regarding the cyanobacteria bloom outbreak, and the management and protection of the water ecological environment in shallow lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

J	Huang, SF; Li, JG; Xu, M				Huang, Shifeng; Li, Jinggang; Xu, Mei			Water surface variations monitoring and flood hazard analysis in Dongting Lake area using long-term Terra/MODIS data time series	NATURAL HAZARDS												Dongting Lake is the second largest freshwater lake in China, and its water surface area varied very significantly during last decade. Remote sensing technology has more advantages in macro monitoring of lake water surface area than the traditional methods. In the paper, an integrated threshold method of water body extraction based on MODIS data is given, which synthesizes several factors, including vegetation index-NDVI, spectrum characters of water body, cloud and shadow, and the SRTM digital elevation information. With this method and 356 scenes MODIS 8-Day composite (MOD09Q1) image, water surface area of Dongting Lake was dynamically monitored from 2000 to 2009. The result shows that during 1 year, the water area variation in Dongting Lake area had a typical seasonal (monsoon) behavior, and during last decade, the water area decreased gradually and obviously. Based on variation monitoring, yearly max-submersion time index has been suggested to analyze flood hazard in study area. With the support of ArcGIS software, authors estimated the yearly submersion time of the Dongting Lake for each year separately and average submersion time from 2000 to 2009. The result shows 67.46% of study area is being with high flood hazard.																			0921-030X					MAY	2012	62	1					93	100		10.1007/s11069-011-9921-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-011-9921-6													WOS:000302408500009
J	Yi, YJ; Wang, ZY; Yang, ZF				Yi, Yujun; Wang, Zhaoyin; Yang, Zhifeng			Impact of the Gezhouba and Three Gorges Dams on habitat suitability of carps in the Yangtze River	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Gezhouba Dam and Three Gorges Project are the two largest hydraulic projects in the middle reach of the Yangtze River. Although these projects have yielded benefits to local communities by providing flood control, water supply, and safe navigation, they also have changed the physical habitat of the Yangtze River. As a consequence, aquatic organisms, including rare species and fishes with economic value, have been affected. The Yangtze River's four major carp species (YFMCS)-black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), grass carp (Ctenop haryngodon idellus), silver carp (Hypoph thal michthys molitrix), and big-head carp (Aristichyths nobilis)-have significant importance to the fresh water fishery in China. According to field surveys, the percentage of the YFMCS in the total catch of fish from Tongting Lake has gradually reduced. The percentages were 22%, 14.1%, 11.84%, and 8.5% in 1963, 1980-1982, 1997, and 2002, respectively. These reductions in species population are mainly attributed to the loss of spawning ground caused by dam construction. Considering the spawning characteristics of the YFMCS, a habitat suitability index model (HSI) has been established. A one-dimensional (1-D) mathematical model was also developed to simulate and predict aspects of the physical habitat situation for the YFMCS. By coupling the habitat suitability curves and the 1-D mathematical model, a HSI model for the YFMCS was established. The HSI model was validated by comparing measured data with predictions from the model. These comparisons show that the computed results agree well with the measured results. The HSI model for the YFMCS is used to suggest a minimum instream flow and suitable daily discharge increase during the reproduction season for the carp species. The minimum discharge needed for the YFMCS in the middle reach of the Yangtze River is 3000 m(3)/s. Different daily discharge increases are required for different initial discharges, too small or too large of an increase in daily discharge is not good for carps spawning. Therefore, adjusting reservoir operations to create reasonable water level fluctuations is a key method to improve the habitat suitability of carps spawning sites. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Functional group assessment revealed seven ecological guilds (marine estuarine opportunists, freshwater, marine estuarine dependent, estuarine, catadromous, anadromous, and amphidromous), six feeding guilds (detritivore, zooplanktivore, herbivore, zoobenthivore, omnivore, and carnivore), three vertical distribution guilds (demersal, benthopelagic, and pelagic), five reproductive-mode functional groups (oviparous with pelagic eggs, oviparous with benthic eggs, oviparous guarders, viviparous and ovoviviparous), and five flowpreference guilds (rheophilic A1, eurytopic, rheophilic A2, rheophilic B, and rheophilic C). The estuary was characterized by high species diversity, low individual species abundance, complex guild structure, varying fish diversity from upper to lower estuary and higher proportion of marine rather than `true' estuarine species. The absence of a significant relationship between season and fish guild structuring could be due to high resource availability in the estuary and low ecological connectivity between upper and lower estuarine zones as a result of anthropogenic interventions in the middle zone. Salinity variations considerably influenced the fish guild formation in the estuary. A drastic change in the hydrography of the estuary over the past sixty years due to topographical alterations has transformed the fish guilds resulting in a considerable increase in freshwater species and a reduction in marine and estuarine-dependant species.

Temporal (1970-2016) changes in human pressures and wetland response in the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Temporal changes (1970-2016) in St. Lawrence River wetlands were assessed between Cornwall and Quebec (approximate to 400 km) to assess wetland response to cumulative anthropogenic pressures in the watershed. Emergent wetlands area and biomass of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) were contrasted among five regions subjected to sharply different water level/discharge regime (stabilized, semi-natural, tidal), nutrient concentrations and shoreline use (rural to urbanized). Between 1970 and 2016, over the growing season (April-Sept.), St. Lawrence River mean water level at Sorel dropped by approximate to 1 m and mean water temperature increased by approximate to 3 degrees C. Reductions in phosphorus concentrations (by approximate to 2-fold) were observed over time both in water and in SAV tissues, in phase with improvements of urban wastewater treatment and P-reduction in upstream Lake Ontario. Nitrate concentrations inwater increased and SAV biomass decreased between the 1970s and 2008 in the downstream regions of Lake Saint-Pierre and fluvial corridor subjected to the cumulative impacts from urban centers and intensively farmed watersheds. Over the 1970-2010 period, dropping water levels yielded slightly increasing wetland areas, owing to the downslope colonization of emergent and submerged plants. In urbanized regions, emergent wetlands shifted towards drier assemblages dominated by invasive reed species. Encroachment of wetlands by agriculture accounted for most wetland losses in rural Lake Saint-Pierre, which holds the single largest area (197 km(2)) of continuous wetland habitat of the entire watershed. Our results highlight the strong response of riverine wetlands to a wide range of human pressures, including dropping water levels, changing nutrient concentrations, rising population and intensifying agriculture.

The community structures in different lakes are thereby influenced by factors such as habitat size, lake chemistry, biotic interactions, and seasonality. In our study, we used high throughput 454 sequencing to study the diversity and temporal changes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic planktonic communities in three Austrian lakes during the ice-free season. In the following year, one lake was sampled again with a reduced set of sampling dates to observe reoccurring patterns. Cluster analyses (based on SSU V9 (eukaryotic) and V4 (prokaryotic) OTU composition) grouped samples according to their origin followed by separation into seasonal clusters, indicating that each lake has a unique signature based on OTU composition. These results suggest a strong habitat-specificity of microbial communities and in particular of community patterns at the OTU level. A comparison of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic datasets via co-inertia analysis (CIA) showed a consistent clustering of prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples, probably reacting to the same environmental forces (e.g., pH, conductivity). In addition, the shifts in eukaryotic and bacterioplanktonic communities generally occurred at the same time and on the same scale. Regression analyses revealed a linear relationship between an increase in Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and elapsed time. Our study shows a pronounced coupling between bacteria and eukaryotes in seasonal samplings of the three analyzed lakes. However, our temporal resolution (biweekly sampling) and data on abiotic factors were insufficient to determine if this was caused by direct biotic interactions or by reacting to the same seasonally changing environmental forces.

Seasonal changes in peryphytic microbial metabolism determining mercury methylation in a tropical wetland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Mercury (Hg) methylation, a key process in the biogeochemical cycle of Hg, is mainly attributed to sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic Archaea. However, environmental regulation by these groups has not yet been ascertained in tropical environments, especially in respect to the seasonal flood flooding. This work evaluated the variation of net methylmercury production potential in relation to biological characteristics of the periphyton, environmental factors, and flood pulse seasons. Our results indicate that there is a seasonal change between metabolic groups as main Hg methylators, sulfate-reducing bacteria in the dry season and methanogenic Archaea in the flood season. In addition, there was a positive relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phosphorus, cyanobacteria biovolume, and periphytic Hg methylation potential. These results shed a new light on MeHg production plasticity, mediated by landscape and flood pulses in tropical wetlands, as well as on ecological relationships within the periphyton.

Don Juan Pond, Antarctica: Near-surface CaCl2-brine feeding Earth's most saline lake and implications for Mars	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The discovery on Mars of recurring slope lineae (RSL), thought to represent seasonal brines, has sparked interest in analogous environments on Earth. We report on new studies of Don Juan Pond (DJP), which exists at the upper limit of ephemeral water in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica, and is adjacent to several steep-sloped water tracks, the closest analog for RSL. The source of DJP has been interpreted to be deep groundwater. We present time-lapse data and meteorological measurements that confirm deliquescence within the DJP watershed and show that this, together with small amounts of meltwater, are capable of generating brines that control summertime water levels. Groundwater input was not observed. In addition to providing an analog for RSL formation, CaCl2 brines and chloride deposits in basins may provide clues to the origin of ancient chloride deposits on Mars dating from the transition period from "warm/wet" to "cold/dry" climates.

J	Thalmeier, MB; Kröhling, DM; Brunetto, E				Belen Thalmeier, Maria; Krohling, Daniela M.; Brunetto, Ernesto			The geomorphology and Late Quaternary sedimentary record of the Salado/Juramento fluvial megafan, Central Andes foreland basin (Chaco Plain, Argentina)	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This research provides geomorphological and sedimentary data on the Salado-Juramento fluvial megafan, the second largest megafan (204,747 km(2)) of the Chaco aggradational plain, generated by the Salado-Juramento River in NE Argentina. It comprises one of the most extensive depositional systems of the Central Andean foreland basin system in South America, also being among the largest megafans on Earth. Despite this, it has not been previously studied from the perspective of its geomorphology, stratigraphy and dynamic evolution. An integrated approach focusing on the analysis of morpho-sedimentary processes, the resulting landforms and the reconstruction of the Late Quaternary evolution is presented here. The applied methods combine geomorphological mapping from remote sensing images analysis, assessment of landforms and processes, and field data. Historical documents were also analysed. Insights into the near sub-surface stratigraphy were obtained from analysis of research boreholes (up to 30 m depth), integrated with groundwater borehole information. The Fluvial Megafan of the Salado-Juramento Geomophological System comprises four geomorphological units: 1) the middle proximal area of the megafan, 2) the distal area of the megafan, 3) the complex fluvio-aeolian belt of the Golondrinas-Calchaqui, and 4) the present fluvial belt of the Salado. Thirteen geomorphological sub-units were defined and mapped, representing the complexity of sub-environment interactions. Amalgamated braided channel deposits and aggradation lobes with limited floodplain muds are common in the proximal area, while mixed-load, low-energy, narrow, shallow, and sinuous palaeochannels and associated floodplain marsh deposits characterize the distal area, with groundwater discharges and hydromorphic soils. The megafan construction was dominated by short-term sedimentation and channel avulsions to overbank areas. Fan-shaped depositional lobes of the proximal area and sandy channel deposits and sand sheets linked to terminal splays that are covering mud flat deposits (floodplains, including palaeosols) in the middle area suggest a high-flow regime. Neotectonics favoured subsidence, avulsion, and prolonged flooding events, with high potential of preservation of an extensive Late Quaternary wetland unit, ponds, lakes, soils, and loessic deposits in the distal megafan. Aggradation and progradation patterns have been conditioned by tectonic control regulating the interaction between the megafan and its axial trunk river (Parana). Furthermore, the Late Quaternary megafan sequences would also have responded to climatic changes, primarily related to strong hydroclimatic seasonality linked to changes in the South American monsoon system strength. Seasonal high sediment load of the formative river linked to the characteristics of the Andean basin (38,000 km(2)) and its climatic patterns are considered as the main control on megafan dynamics over at least the Upper Quaternary. Morpho-stratigraphical data of the megafan presented here and the first interpretation of its Quaternary evolution is the key to support socio-economic decisions on aquifer exploitation, land uses, and infrastructure planning.

The Impact of Seasonal and Annual Climate Variations on the Carbon Uptake Capacity of a Deciduous Forest Within the Great Lakes Region of Canada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												In eastern North America, many deciduous forest ecosystems grow at the northernmost extent of their geographical ranges, where climate change could aid or impede their growth. This region experiences frequent extreme weather conditions, allowing us to study the response of these forests to environmental conditions, reflective of future climates. Here we determined the impact of seasonal and annual climate variations and extreme weather events on the carbon (C) uptake capacity of an oak-dominated forest in southern Ontario, Canada, from 2012 to 2016. We found that changes in meteorology during late May to mid-July were key in determining the C sink strength of the forest, impacting the seasonal and annual variability of net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Overall, higher temperatures and dry conditions reduced ecosystem respiration (RE) much more than gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), leading to higher NEP. Variability in NEP was primarily driven by changes in RE, rather than GEP. The mean annual GEP, RE, and NEP values at our site during the study were 1,343 +/- 85, 1,171 +/- 139, and 206 +/- 92 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The forest was a C sink even in years that experienced heat and water stresses. Mean annual NEP at our site was within the range of NEP (69-459 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) observed in similar North American forests from 2012 to 2016. The growth and C sequestration capabilities of our oak-dominated forest were not adversely impacted by changes in environmental conditions and extreme weather events experienced over the study period.

The isotopic evolution through the studied sequence supports a general trend toward less saline conditions with time. Stromatolites and muddy-grainy laminated limestones developed in lake water that underwent little renewal, compared with other carbonate facies. The palaeoclimatic value of the stable-isotope changes and concurrent textural variations in calcite stromatolite lamination is studied at different orders of cyclicity. Stromatolite lamination consists of simple laminae (dark dense, light dense and light porous) grouped into alternating composite light and dark laminae. delta C-13 and delta O-18 analyses in consecutive composite laminae (bulk sampling) yielded a cyclic pattern that mimics textural variations. Light laminae, with lower delta C-13 and delta O-18 values, reflect higher precipitation/evaporation ratio (P/E) and more influence of biogenic C-12. Dark laminae, with higher delta C-13 and delta O-18 values, reflect drier conditions, more complete atmospheric CO2 exchange with water and photosynthetic (CO2)-C-12 uptake. Textural features of laminae support these results: the dark laminae are related to higher calcite saturation in lake water during drier periods. Isotopic values from high-resolution sampling through a 2.1-cm thick stromatolite reveal palaeoclimate variations at different temporal scales. Isotopic variation in 3rd order cyclicity of alternating light/dark simple laminae is recording seasonal P/E variations. Light and dark composite laminae (2nd order cyclicity) correspond to pluriannual dominantly-humid or-dry conditions, respectively. A gradual succession from light to dark composite laminae forms the 1st order cycles driven by decreasing P/E through longer pluriannual periods, resulting in lake level lowering. The stromatolites are thus recording lake level changes of centennial to millennial scale.

We aim to expand this view by assessing potential impacts of IBF on surface water quality. We suggest that IBF can directly and indirectly affect several physical, chemical and biological processes in both the sediment and open water column, eventually leading to positive or negative changes in source water quality. Direct effects of IBF comprise water level fluctuations, changes in water level and retention time, and in organic content and redox conditions in littoral sediments. Indirect effects are mainly triggered by interrupting groundwater discharge into the surface water body. The latter may result in increased seasonal temperature variations in sediment and water and reduced discharge of solutes transported by groundwater such as nutrients and carbon dioxide. These changes can have cascading effects on various water quality, e.g., by facilitating toxic phytoplankton blooms. We propose investigating these potential effects of IBF in future field and laboratory studies to allow for more detailed insights into these yet unknown effects and their magnitude in order to assure a sustainable application of this valuable technique in the future.

There has been a significant increase in vector-borne diseases due to climate variations that lead to environmental changes favoring the development and adaptation of vectors. This study was carried out to improve knowledge of the ecology of mosquito vectors involved in the transmission of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in Senegal. Methods: An entomological survey was conducted in three Senegalese agro-systems, Senegal River Delta (SRD), Senegal River Valley (SRV) and Ferlo, during the rainy season (July to November) of 2014 and 2015. Mosquitoes were trapped using CDC light traps set at ten sites for two consecutive nights during each month of the rainy season, for a total of 200 night-traps. Ecological indices were calculated to characterize the different populations of RVFV mosquito vectors. Generalized linear models with mixed effects were used to assess the influence of climatic conditions on the abundance of RVFV mosquito vectors. Results: A total of 355,408 mosquitoes belonging to 7 genera and 35 species were captured in 200 night-traps. RVFV vectors represented 89.02% of the total, broken down as follows: Ae. vexans arabiensis (31.29%), Cx. poicilipes (0.6%), Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (33.09%) and Ma. uniformis (24.04%). Comparison of meteorological indices (rainfall, temperature, relative humidity), abundances and species diversity indicated that there were no significant differences between SRD and SRV (P = 0.36) while Ferlo showed significant differences with both (P < 0.001). Mosquito collection increased significantly with temperature for Ae. vexans arabiensis (P < 0.001), Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (P = 0.04) and Ma. uniformis (P = 0. 01), while Cx. poicilipes decreased (P = 0.003). Relative humidity was positively and significantly associated with the abundances of Ae. vexans arabiensis (P < 0.001), Cx. poicilipes (P = 0.01) and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (P = 0.007). Rainfall had a positive and significant effect on the abundances of Ae. vexans arabiensis (P = 0.005). The type of biotope (temporary ponds, river or lake) around the trap points had a significant effect on the mosquito abundances (P < 0.001). Conclusions: In terms of species diversity, the SRD and SRV ecosystems are similar to each other and different from that of Ferlo. Meteorological indices and the type of biotope (river, lake or temporary pond) have significant effects on the abundance of RVFV mosquito vectors.					; Gimonneau, Geoffrey/C-1681-2013	Tran, Annelise/0000-0001-5463-332X; BITEYE, Biram/0000-0003-3474-7578; CISS, Mamadou/0000-0002-4816-9812; Gimonneau, Geoffrey/0000-0002-0613-841X													1756-3305					JAN 9	2018	11								27	10.1186/s13071-017-2591-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2591-9								29316967					WOS:000419685400002

Since this invasive weed is extremely difficult to eradicate, sustainable management strategies should be put in place to reduce negative impacts on local ecological and socio-economic systems; this requires a better understanding of the population dynamics. In this paper, we review the seasonal change of water hyacinth coverage in Lake Tana and explore its linkages with various environmental factors. During the rainy seasons, increased nutrient concentrations, humidity, and especially water level can promote the formation of extensive water hyacinth mats. In the dry season, diminishing lake water in surrounding floodplains, along with concomitantly increased temperature and solar radiation, may support seed germination and lead to the next life cycle. Currently, water hyacinth mainly occurs in northeastern Lake Tana due to coastal eutrophication, lake topography and westerlies. Expansion of the infested area is slowing down. However, further spread of water hyacinth is still possible in other parts of the lake basin due to changing climate and environmental conditions. Integrated control methods should be put in place in the near future to prevent water hyacinth infestation in Lake Tana, and upstream basin management is vital to reduce nutrients transportation into the lake as a long-term plan.

Previous studies have shown a serious imbalance in selenium distribution in the habitat of Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii). In order to provide new ideas for wildlife conservation, we studied the distribution characteristics of selenium nutrition in the natural habitat of Przewalski's gazelle in the Qinghai Lake watershed. The results showed that the average selenium content of mixed pasture in the Hudong area was the lowest, and was seriously selenium deficient; the upper reaches of the Buha River showed subclinical selenium deficiency; and the average selenium content of mixed pasture in Bird Island Reserve was the highest. Among soil layers, contents of total and water-soluble selenium were highest in surface soil, and selenium content decreased gradually with soil depth. Among soil types, the total selenium content was highest in boggy soil and lowest in gray cinnamon soil; the water-soluble selenium content was highest in boggy soil and lowest in alpine scrub meadow soil. Among grassland types, selenium content was highest in mixed forage of Achnatherum splendens grassland and lowest in mixed forage of Artemisia frigida grassland. The selenium content in mixed forage showed obvious seasonality, being highest at the seedling stage and lowest at the growing stage. Among forage species, Clematis tangutica, Artemisia desertorum and Achnatherum splendens were the main high-selenium plants, with the selenium content the highest for Achnatherum splendens. Poa pratensis, Elymus nutans and Thermopsis lanceolata were the main selenium-deficient plants, and selenium content was lowest in Thermopsis lanceolata.						chi, yongkuan/0000-0001-7525-1304													1230-1485	2083-5906					2020	29	1					67	77		10.15244/pjoes/104661	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/104661													WOS:000492020300008

Jun; Wu, Yao; Liu, Yan; Zhang, Haibo			Assessment of water quality of best water management practices in lake adjacent to the high-latitude agricultural areas, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												A major inland alkalinity lake in Northeast China, the Chagan Lake, was studied for the changes of its water qualities over the past three decades. Water quality data, including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and fluoride (F-), were analyzed to derive key indices for guiding water quality management. Our study found that the Chagan Lake had an average trophic state index (TSI) ranging 50 to 70; the average TSI for TP ranging between 70 and 80, and the average TSI for TN being 50. Over the past three decades, the TSI values generally trended lower, but there was a slight uptrend from 2012 onwards. Seasonal variations in the concentrations of TN and TP were identified. The TSI values in September were higher than those in May, while the values of un-ionized ammonia (UIA) during rainy seasons were higher than those during dry seasons. The average values of alkalinity and F- in the lake water exceeded the upper limits set in the Chinese water quality standards, i.e., 20 mg/L and 1 mg/L, respectively. It was defined that the evolution of lake water quality proceeded in four consecutive periods, namely natural, deterioration, improvement, and risk period; the improvement period benefitted from a historical water conservation project. Our study concluded that the amount of irrigation discharge into the Chagan must be monitored, and controlled, in order to sustain the critical ecological functions currently provided by the Chagan Lake.					; Xu, Y./A-7681-2014; Liu, Xuemei/HSG-6255-2023; Wu, Yao/HSG-5577-2023; Zhang, Haibo/HLP-9266-2023	Liu, Xuemei/0000-0002-8337-2795; Zhang, Guangxin/0000-0001-5339-0426													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2020	27	3					3338	3349		10.1007/s11356-019-06858-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06858-5								31845257					WOS:000514849100071
J	de Oliveira, LFV; Margis, R				Valter de Oliveira, Luiz Felipe; Margis, Rogerio			The Source of the River as a Nursery for Microbial Diversity	PLOS ONE												Bacteria are highly diverse and ubiquitous organisms that play a key role as drivers for ecosystem processes. The application of NGS (next-generation sequencing technologies) for 16S analysis has been broadly used for understanding bacterioplankton composition and structure. Most of studies conducted on aquatic ecosystems with 16S NGS have been in seawater and lakes. A few studies using NGS have been conducted in river environments and have suggested the presence of a bacterial seed-bank. We performed 16S highly variable V4 region high-throughput analysis in the Sinos River, which is located in one of most important Brazilian industrial centers. This region has several contrasts in its environmental characteristics, presenting a longitudinal gradient of eutrophication and making it a remarkable study site for observing the dynamics of bacterioplankton. We demonstrated consistent evidence for the existence of a bacterial seed-bank and its longitudinal persistence. Seasonal shifts reinforce the importance of the source of the river in maintaining the bacterial seed-bank that spreads throughout the river. Therefore, the preservation of the source of the river is important not only for hydrologic reasons but also to maintain the microbial composition and the ecological integrity of the river.

Methane dynamics in the subarctic tundra: combining stable isotope analyses, plot- and ecosystem-scale flux measurements	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Methane (CH4) fluxes were investigated in a subarctic Russian tundra site in a multi-approach study combining plot-scale data, ecosystem-scale eddy covariance (EC) measurements, and a fine-resolution land cover classification scheme for regional upscaling. The flux data as measured by the two independent techniques resulted in a seasonal (May-October 2008) cumulative CH4 emission of 2.4 (EC) and 3.7 gCH(4) m(-2) (manual chambers) for the source area representative of the footprint of the EC instruments. Upon upscaling for the entire study region of 98.6 km(2), the chamber measured flux data yielded a regional flux estimate of 6.7 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1). Our upscaling efforts accounted for the large spatial variability in the distribution of the various land cover types (LCTs) predominant at our study site. Wetlands with emissions ranging from 34 to 53 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) were the most dominant CH4-emitting surfaces. Emissions from thermokarst lakes were an order of magnitude lower, while the rest of the landscape (mineral tundra) was a weak sink for atmospheric methane. Vascular plant cover was a key factor in explaining the spatial variability of CH4 emissions among wetland types, as indicated by the positive correlation of emissions with the leaf area index (LAI). As elucidated through a stable isotope analysis, the dominant CH4 release pathway from wetlands to the atmosphere was plant-mediated diffusion through aerenchyma, a process that discriminates against C-13-CH4. The CH4 released to the atmosphere was lighter than that in the surface porewater, and delta C-13 in the emitted CH4 correlated negatively with the vascular plant cover (LAI). The mean value of delta C-13 obtained here for the emitted CH4, 68.2 +/- 2.0 %, is within the range of values from other wetlands, thus reinforcing the use of inverse modelling tools to better constrain the CH4 budget. Based on the IPCC A1B emission scenario, a temperature increase of 6.1 degrees C relative to the present day has been predicted for the European Russian tundra by the end of the 21st Century. A regional warming of this magnitude will have profound effects on the permafrost distribution leading to considerable changes in the regional landscape with a potential for an increase in the areal extent of CH4-emitting wet surfaces.					; Friborg, Thomas/E-5433-2015; Marushchak, Maija/G-1444-2011; Shurpali, Narasinha/K-5794-2013; Biasi, Christina/E-1130-2013	Marushchak, Maija E./0000-0002-2308-5049; Friborg, Thomas/0000-0001-5633-6097; Shurpali, Narasinha/0000-0003-1052-4396; Virtanen, Tarmo/0000-0001-8660-2464; Biasi, Christina/0000-0002-7413-3354; Lind, Saara/0000-0001-7701-533X													1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	2					597	608		10.5194/bg-13-597-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-597-2016													WOS:000369524500018

Citizen scientist monitoring also benefits the citizens involved because they acquire a deeper knowledge and understanding of the benefits of ecosystems and the ways that anthropogenic activities affect them. This study details the efforts of a local non-government organization (Restauracion Ecologica y Desarrollo A. C.), the Earthwatch Institute, and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's Water Program to monitor the water quality in the Xochimilco peri-urban wetland, which is threatened by accelerated urbanization. The Xochimilco wetland includes agricultural areas in which raised beds called chinampas are surrounded by canals and small lakes. These chinampas have been managed for hundreds of years. The water in the canals is mainly used for agricultural irrigation, but it is also the habitat of a variety of aquatic species. In this study, we analyze the water quality of 7 canals and 1 lake located in areas with chinampas that have different uses such as housing, tourism, semi-intensive agriculture, agroecological farming, and abandoned agricultural land. Water samples from these sites were collected by citizen scientists over the course of 4 y. Our aim was to determine how the water quality varies across areas with management differences and between dry and rainy seasons. We found significant differences in pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, Escherichia coli, and conductivity between seasons. We expected to find suitable water quality for irrigation (based on national and international guidelines) in canals near low-impact activities in the chinampas (such as agroecological farming or chinampas without human activities). Instead, we found that the water in those canals exceeded the recommendations for pH values (>9), total coliforms (>240 CFU/ 100 mL), conductivity (>2000 mu S/cm), and dissolved oxygen concentrations (<6.5 mg/L). However, nutrient concentrations were low. The structure of the canals near agroecological farming areas are narrow, shallow, and have low water flow, so alterations in the depth and width of these canals might result in improved water quality. The only sampling site that met most of the international and national guidelines for irrigation use was located in an area with many abandoned chinampas. Volunteers that participated in this study gained insights regarding the importance of being aware of anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems like the Xochimilco wetland, a place that is important to preserve because of its agricultural, ecological, and cultural significance.

These residues' impact on seasonally ice-covered rivers remains under investigated. To understand the environmental fate of antibiotics with high-detection frequencies and concentration levels, sulfamethoxazole, lincomycin, and florfenicol were used as models in the present study. A Level IV fugacity model was established and applied to a seasonally ice-covered river receiving municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, the Songhua River in Northeast China. Model validation and sensitivity analysis suggested that the fugacity model could successfully simulate the monitoring concentration within an average difference of one logarithmic unit. The advection process played a major role in the transport and attenuation of the antibiotics in the ice-covered river receiving WWTP effluents. The scenario simulation indicated that increasing the targeted antibiotic concentrations in WWTP effluents to gL(-1) could keep the targeted antibiotic concentrations higher than 10ngL(-1) in the receiving river from the WWTP discharge source to 25km downstream. This finding also demonstrates that the depth of water and ice, as well as flow velocity, play key roles in the fate of antibiotics in the ice-covered river receiving WWTP effluents. To our best knowledge, this is the first major study to combine experimental investigation with modeling to explore the environmental behaviors and fate of antibiotics in such a river.

Cyanobacterial carbon concentrating mechanisms facilitate sustained CO2 depletion in eutrophic lakes	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Phytoplankton blooms are increasing in frequency, intensity, and duration in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. In many eutrophic lakes, these high levels of primary productivity correspond to periods of CO2 depletion in surface waters. Cyanobacteria and other groups of phytoplankton have the ability to actively transport bicarbonate (HCO3-) across their cell membrane when CO2 concentrations are limiting, possibly giving them a competitive advantage over algae not using carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). To investigate whether CCMs can maintain phytoplankton bloom biomass under CO2 depletion, we measured the delta C-13 signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)) and phytoplankton particulate organic carbon (delta C-13(phyto)) in 16 mesotrophic to hypereutrophic lakes during the ice-free season of 2012. We used mass-balance relationships to determine the dominant inorganic carbon species used by phytoplankton under CO2 stress. We found a significant positive relationship between phytoplankton biomass and phytoplankton delta C-13 signatures as well as a significant nonlinear negative relationship between water column rho CO2 and isotopic composition of phytoplankton, indicating a shift from diffusive uptake to active uptake by phytoplankton of CO2 or HCO3- during blooms. Calculated photosynthetic fractionation factors indicated that this shift occurs specifically when surface water CO2 drops below atmospheric equilibrium. Our results indicate that active HCO3- uptake via CCMs may be an important mechanism in maintaining phytoplankton blooms when CO2 is depleted. Further increases in anthropogenic pressure, eutrophication, and cyanobacteria blooms are therefore expected to contribute to increased bicarbonate uptake to sustain primary production.					; Morales, Ana/AAA-1654-2020	Downing, John/0000-0001-8547-0789; Wanamaker, Alan/0000-0002-6560-6420; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				JUN 15	2017	14	11					2865	2875		10.5194/bg-14-2865-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2865-2017													WOS:000403228000001
J	Thorp, JH; Thoms, MC; Delong, MD; Maasri, A				Thorp, James H.; Thoms, Martin C.; Delong, Michael D.; Maasri, Alain			The ecological nature of whole river macrosystems: new perspectives from the riverine ecosystem synthesis	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Opportunities to understand and protect natural aquatic diversity in both relatively pristine and managed rivers can be enhanced with a comprehensive, system-wide understanding of a river's hydrogeomorpholgy and its effects on ecological structure and functioning from the river's headwaters to its terminus in an ocean, lake, or natural endorheic basin. While a moderate number of macrosystem ecology studies have been undertaken recently in headwaters, comparable ecological approaches to studying whole rivers or at least their larger components from upstream to downstream are relatively rare. This is partially correlated with the paucity of applicable river ecosystem models developed over the last half century which could otherwise provide diverse, testable tenets (hypotheses). This manuscript focuses on a 15+ year updated, system-wide analysis of the applicability of the 17 tenets included in our previously published, lotic model - the Riverine Ecosystem Synthesis, or RES. We also propose here four new tenets and analyze the system-wide applicability of the revised RES. Those new tenets hypothesize that: (H-18) "The range and degree of impacts of a Functional Process Zone on biodiversity and ecological processes differ among several factors, including types of FPZs, total river area covered, and dependent variables examined, even in the same river network position"; (H-19) "The degree of ecological differences among types of FPZs vary seasonally with the process being examined while also differing among types of life history characteristics - especially when contrasting responses among seasonal periods of either maximum or minimum growth and reproduction"; (H-20) "The relative importance of in-stream versus watershed drivers of ecological processes in streams can vary within macrosystems and among ecoregions and partially depends on elevation, terrestrial characteristics (natural or human modified), and FPZ type and extent"; and (H-21) "The provision of ecosystem services varies significantly with FPZ type, river size, and location vis-a-vis human populations". Where appropriate, we also evaluate aspects of several other models published by colleagues that pertain to river ecology.

Therefore, in this study, sequential extraction procedure was used to evaluate abun-dance of five phosphorus chemical species. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration ranged from 672.3 to 2031.9 mu g/g in pre-monsoon and 771.7 to 2095.7 mu g/g in post-monsoon. More than 87% of TP was inorganic P and contribution of organic phosphorus was low. Potential bioavailable P (PBAP) comprised of 52.1 and 35.5% of TP in the pre and post-monsoon, respectively. Average phosphorus pollution index was higher than one in all stations and seasons, implying that sediments in the study area are polluted by phosphorus and are under eutrophication risk. Thus, in the future, foregoing information will be important for assessment of phosphorus loading and pollution in the Makran.

The impact of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) has been well documented from palynological records. Based on changes in vegetation succession, the Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) and Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) during four pollen phases CP (1-4) were calculated using the coexistence approach. Between 580 and 760 CE (pre-MWP), the occurrence of major riparian tree pollen taxa like Barringtonia, Duabanga and Sapotaceae along with scanty diatom occurrence indicates a warm and relatively less humid climate attributable to a weak Southwest monsoon with low seasonality. This changed to a strikingly enhanced seasonality from 760 to 940 CE (beginning of MWP), indicating the establishment of the dense forest around the lake under increased warm and humid climatic conditions. During the interval from 940 to 1220 CE (MWP peak), the average values of maximum MAT and MAP were the highest recorded (similar to 31 degrees C and similar to 2250 mm, respectively). From 1220 CE onwards (post MWP), the decline in arboreal pollen coincides with an exponential rise in cereal pollen clumps and shrubby pollen like Melastoma, Clerodendrum and Justicia adhatoda along with the presence of anthropogenic indicator diatom taxa like Ulnaria ulna and Gomphonema indicating increased landscape changes due to human impact under a relatively less warm and humid climate. In many parts of the world, regional data coverage pertinent to the MCA warming has now reached a point which allows compiling palaeoclimate maps for well-defined time intervals. In this direction, future studies need to address the major climatic data gaps from the Indian sub-continent especially during the last millennia.

J	Kabiri, K				Kabiri, Keivan			Estimation of the Secchi disk depth from the NASA MODIS-Aqua diffuse attenuation coefficient data in the northern Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman: A spatiotemporal assessment	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												This study aimed to propose a method for the estimation of the Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)) values in the northern Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Gulf of Oman (N-PG-SH-GO), based on MODIS- K-d(490) data. The field-observed Z(sd) values were collected during seven research cruises conducted by a research vessel between 2018 and 2021. A total number of 114 field-observed Z(sd) values were observed in 68 stations. The daily K-d(490) of MODIS-Aqua/L2 data were downloaded for all days (+/- three), where in the field-observed data were available. Different fitting models were examined to estimate the Z(sd) values from the K-d(490). A total number of 73 Z(sd) values observed in the first six research cruises were utilized to propose the optimum model, and the data of 41 stations, observed in the last research cruise were used for the validation of the results. Upon designating the optimum method, all the field-observed Z(sd) values were then employed to create the final model. The results demonstrated that the power model is optimal (R-2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 2.04 m), so the model in the form of Z(sd) = 0.34 K-d(490)(-1.42) might be utilized to compute the Z(sd) values in the N-PG-SH-GO. This model was then employed to determine the monthly and seasonal Z(sd) values to assess the spatiotemporal variation of water clarity in the N-PG-SH-GO. The results showed that the annual variation domain of the Z(sd) values in the N-GO was extremely higher than that in the N-PG and N-SH so that the maximum and minimum water clarity respectively occurred in warm months and colder ones. Compared with the N-PG and the N-GO, the average annual water clarity of the N-SH was lower where the mean annual Z(sd) values for the N-PG, N-SH, and N-GO were determined as 8.91, 6.27, and 10.27 m, respectively.

This paper evaluates the current VIIRS V1 LST product versus concurrent ground data acquired at a rice paddy site from December 2014 to August 2016. The experimental site has three different seasonal and homogeneous land covers through the year, which makes the site interesting for validation activities. An autonomous and multiangular system was used to record continuous ground data at the site. The data acquired at zenith angles similar to the VIIRS viewing angles were used for the validation to avoid possible differences between satellite and ground views due to angular dependences of the LSTs. Concurrently to surface data, downwelling sky radiances were measured at different incidence angles by the system, which were used to improve the cloud screening of the validation dataset, since cloud leakage was identified in previous validation studies as an important issue for further improvement. The validation results show good performance for the VIIRS V1 LST product at zenith angles <= 40 degrees, with systematic uncertainties within +/- 0.5 K and accuracies around 1.2 K. These values are within the threshold requirements established for the VIIRS LST product, and they are better than the validation results published previously for the beta version of the product or using VIIRS data reprocessed with the calibrated algorithm coefficients implemented from April 2014. As the VIIRS LST algorithm has regression coefficients dependent on land cover type, the impact of land cover misclassifications on VIIRS LST data accuracy was also evaluated. It was expected that changing the surface type assigned by the VIIRS product to more appropriate types at the site pixels should improve the validation results. However, the improvement was limited, likely due to the reduced range of variability of the emissivities considered for the different land cover types in the regression process of the VIIRS LST algorithm coefficients. The results reveal the difficulties and uncertainties involved in the LST retrieval when using a LST algorithm with surface type dependent coefficients.

The Role of Aquaculture and Capture Fisheries in Meeting Food and Nutrition Security: Testing a Nutrition-Sensitive Pond Polyculture Intervention in Rural Zambia	FOODS												This study tested the efficacy of a pond polyculture intervention with farming households in northern Zambia. Longitudinal data on fish consumption and the associated nutrient intake of households (N = 57) were collected over a six-month period (September 2019-March 2020). One group of people tested the intervention while another group that practiced monoculture tilapia farming, and a third group that did not practice aquaculture, acted as control groups. A similar quantity of fish was consumed on average; however, the associated nutrient intake differed, based on the quantity and type of species consumed, particularly for those who had access to pelagic small fish from capture fisheries. There was a decrease in fish consumption from December onward due to fisheries management restrictions. The ponds provided access to micronutrient-rich fish during this time. Pond polyculture can act as a complementary source of fish to capture fisheries that are subjected to seasonal controls, as well as to households that farm tilapia. Assessments of how aquatic foods can improve food and nutrition security often separate aquaculture and capture fisheries, failing to account for people who consume fish from diverse sources simultaneously. A nutrition-sensitive approach thus places food and nutrition security, and consumers, at the center of the analysis.					; Kaminski, Alexander/AAT-1220-2020; Thilsted, Shakuntala/JPU-9977-2023	Kaminski, Alexander/0000-0001-5148-0460; Middleton, Lucinda/0000-0001-5500-4410; Thilsted, Shakuntala/0000-0002-4041-1651; 														2304-8158				MAY	2022	11	9							1334	10.3390/foods11091334	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods11091334								35564057					WOS:000794470300001

Mediterranean islands constitute a place of passage where the creation of cultural landscapes can be traced through colonization and anthropization histories. Palynological studies carried out in the Balearic Islands highlight a deep vegetation change from the mid- to late-Holocene, but the climate-environmental-human interactions are not fully understood yet. In this study, we aim to disentangle the causalities of landscape changes during the last six millennia using a multi-proxy approach on an off-site core for the first time in Minorca island. We find that, during the mid-Holocene, the climate was wetter than today with less rainfall seasonality than in the current Mediterranean. This climate, favoured the expansion of box formations and the predominance of forested formations with minimal anthropized conditions. First agropastoral activities appeared in the sequence between ca. 3500-2650 cal BCE in north-eastern Minorca, coinciding with other sporadic archaeological evidence (Cova dels Morts rock-shelter) which support the possibility of a pre-Chalcolithic discovery and frequentation of the island. We record deep environmental change during the third millennium cal BCE, reflected in the substitution of the former mesophytic vegetation by Mediterranean maquis formations dominated by wild olive trees, heathers, mastic and Cistaceae. We propose that maquis, garrigues and open-land vegetation were favoured by human action in a context of increasing climatic dryness and seasonality, promoting vegetation flammability and substitution of former mesic communities to more adapted termophilous vegetation. The comparison of our new record from Addaia with other pollen studies from the Balearic Islands highlights the resilience of mesic vegetation to climate change. This is shown by the survival of box formations to the increased aridification initiated at ca. sixth fifth millennium cal BCE (ca. 7-6 cal kyr BP) in the Western Mediterranean which culminated at ca. fourth third millennium cal BCE (ca. 5-4 cal kyr BP). Additionally, whilst sporadic human presence versus stable occupation are difficult to detect in archaeological records, the coupling with paleoenvironmental studies may offer new scenarios and information for human arrival in the Balearic Islands.					; Picornell-Gelabert, Llorenç/B-3760-2016; Moffa-Sanchez, Paola/AAA-7188-2022; Servera-Vives, Gabriel/B-3026-2016; Riera, Santiago/A-8879-2012; Garcia-Molsosa, Arnau/W-6448-2019; García Álvarez, Salvia/AAB-4353-2020	Moffa-Sanchez, Paola/0000-0003-1857-8954; Servera-Vives, Gabriel/0000-0002-2352-9236; Garcia-Molsosa, Arnau/0000-0001-5416-2986; Garcia Alvarez, Salvia/0000-0001-8367-0146; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				JUN 1	2018	498						9	23		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.02.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.02.015													WOS:000430785200002

Here, we analyzed variations and trends in surface water pH of 73 sites from ten river basins in China from 2004 to 2014 with nonparametric Seasonal Kendall test method. Our analysis showed that the variations of surface water pH in China ranged from 6.5 to 9.0 in the past decade (2004-2014), which satisfied the water quality criteria in pH for protection of aquatic ecosystems in China (6.0-9.0) and USA (6.5-9.0). However, significant decreasing trends in surface water pH were found in 31 monitoring sites, which were mainly located in Haihe River, Taihu Lake and Yangtze River, while the pH value showed significant increasing trends in 22 sites, which mainly were located in Songhua River and Pearl River. Our results suggested the increased potential acidification of susceptible water bodies in China. Besides the control policy of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, the emissions of nitrous oxides (NOx) should also be reduced to protect the aquatic systems in China.

Two cyanobacterial bloom incidences were observed in the two dry seasons during this period. Rainfall pattern regulated nitrogen limitation which triggered cyanobacterial bloom development and influenced the bloom duration. Nutrient-laden influx from agricultural practices accounted for the increase in nitrate, phosphate and the relatively low silicate. Hypoxic conditions during the two bloom episodes reflected the vulnerability of this lagoon ecosystem. The cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by potentially toxic species; Anabaena circinalis, A. flos-aquae, A. limnetica and A. spiroides. A comparison of ambient nutrient ratios with the Redfield ratio (N/P/Si = 16:1:16) showed clear temporal variations that coincided with phytoplankton dynamics and the bloom regime. Low N/P ratios were recorded during the first 8 months, and there was a shift to higher ratios during the subsequent 8 months, followed by low N/P ratios in the last 2 months. Higher silicate values coincided with decreased cyanobacterial biomass, cyanobacteria bloom collapse and proliferation of diatoms during the first annual cycle. Cyanobacterial abundance exceeded the alert level 1 and almost reached alert level 2 which call for continuous environmental monitoring and management of coastal waters.					; Yin, Kedong/B-9773-2009	Akagha, Sandra/0000-0001-8815-5936; 													2190-5487	2190-5495				APR 16	2020	10	5							109	10.1007/s13201-020-01190-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-020-01190-7													WOS:000528643400001
J	Leng, MJ; Marshall, JD				Leng, MJ; Marshall, JD			Palaeoclimate interpretation of stable isotope data from lake sediment archives	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					Meeting on Isotopes in Quaternary Palaeoenvironmental Reconstruction	APR, 2002	British Geol Survey, Nottingham, ENGLAND		British Geol Survey			The isotope composition of authigenic and biogenic carbonates and diatom silica are commonly used as palaeoclimate proxies from lake sediments. This article reviews the controls on the isotope composition of lacustrine skeletal and non-skeletal deposits and illustrates how stable isotope Studies contribute to an understanding of changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, evaporation and the carbon cycle. It highlights the differences in the palaeoclimate potential of a wide range of lakes ranging from open to closed lake basins. A large number of the case historics, but not all, are drawn from studies of temperate lakes from Europe. Large closed lake systems, in the tropics and elsewhere, lose water predominantly through evaporation, and contain sediments with variable and generally high delta(18)O values. Fluctuations in the isotope composition of authigenic or biogenic minerals are mainly a function of long-term changes in the precipitation/evaporation ratio. In contrast small open lakes which have a degree of through-flow typically contain sediments with delta(18)O values that vary by no more than a few parts per thousand. These variations are generally ascribed to variations in temperature or the isotope composition of precipitation (deltap), from which either an annual or seasonally specific signal can be gained. These types of lakes are common in Northern Europe and at high altitudes. The interpretation of isotope data from a lacustrine succession requires a knowledge of the local processes that might control and modify the signal. Their effects need to be quantified, and a robust calibration using the modern lake system is necessary to establish the relationship between the measured signal, the isotopic composition of the host waters, and climate.

J	Ito, A				Ito, Akihiko			Methane emission from pan-Arctic natural wetlands estimated using a process-based model, 1901-2016	POLAR SCIENCE					5th International Symposium on Arctic Research (ISAR)	JAN 15-18, 2018	Tokyo, JAPAN					The vast pan-Arctic wetlands appear to be a large source of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas. Here, I simulated CH4 emission from pan-Arctic wetlands (above 60 degrees N) over the period 1901-2016 using a process-based biogeochemical model (VISIT), including two different schemes of wetland CH4 production, that was forced by historical atmospheric composition, climate, and land-use conditions. The two schemes simulated mean wetland CH4 emission rates of 10.9 and 11.4 Tg CH4 yr(-1) in the 2000s with slightly different spatial source distributions. Both simulations showed clear seasonal cycles of CH4 emission, but the two schemes had different amplitudes and peak months. The schemes differed markedly in their simulated long-term patterns (i.e., a stationary trend and an increasing decadal trend), making it difficult to relate them to global atmospheric trends in a consistent manner. Linear regression analysis clarified the agreements and differences in environmental sensitivity and biological control of CH4 production simulated by the schemes. The time-series of CH4 emission in northern North America, northern Europe, and Siberia showed different patterns of correlation with two major meteorological teleconnection indices. This model-based study implied that the high-latitude CH4 emission accounts for 5-7% of global wetland emission and would play increasingly important roles (e.g., positive feedback) under changing climate. To reduce estimation uncertainties, as demonstrated by the comparison of two schemes, we need further studies for improving biogeochemical models in collaboration with field studies.

In Europe, the third cycle of river basin management plans (2021-2027) according to the Water Framework Directive must take into account the potential impacts of climate change on water quality, including effects on relevant biological indicators. Here, we applied a Bayesian network as a meta-model for linking future climate and land-use scenarios for the time horizon 2050-2070, via process-based catchment and lake models, to cyanobacteria abundance and ecological status of a eutrophic lake. Building upon previous applications of the model, a new version was developed to include relevant climatic variables such as wind speed. Explorative scenarios showed that the combination of low wind and high temperature gave the most synergistic effects on cyanobacteria under high levels of eutrophication (Chl-a concentration). Considering the management target of good ecological status, however, the climate-related promotion of cyanobacteria blooms contributed most to degrading the ecological status at intermediate levels of eutrophication. Future developments of this model will aim to strengthen the link between climate variables and ecological responses, to make the model also useful for seasonal forecasting.					; Couture, Raoul/AGR-6683-2022; Moe, S./AAC-8121-2020	Moe, Jannicke/0000-0002-3681-3551; Couture, Raoul/0000-0003-4940-3372; Jackson-Blake, Leah/0000-0002-4915-8779														2073-4441				SEP	2019	11	9							1767	10.3390/w11091767	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11091767													WOS:000488834400030

Metagenomic Analysis of Virus Diversity and Relative Abundance in a Eutrophic Freshwater Harbour	VIRUSES-BASEL												Aquatic viruses have been extensively studied over the past decade, yet fundamental aspects of freshwater virus communities remain poorly described. Our goal was to characterize virus communities captured in the >0.22 mu m size-fraction seasonally and spatially in a freshwater harbour. Community DNA was extracted from water samples and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform. Assembled contigs were annotated as belonging to the virus groups (i.e., order or family) Caudovirales, Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and virophages (Lavidaviridae), or to other groups of undefined viruses. Virophages were often the most abundant group, and discrete virophage taxa were remarkably stable across sites and dates despite fluctuations in Mimiviridae community composition. Diverse Mimiviridae contigs were detected in the samples and the two sites contained distinct Mimiviridae communities, suggesting that Mimiviridae are important algal viruses in this system. Caudovirales and Phycodnaviridae were present at low abundances in most samples. Of the 18 environmental parameters tested, only chlorophyll a explained the variation in the data at the order or family level of classification. Overall, our findings provide insight into freshwater virus community assemblages by expanding the documented diversity of freshwater virus communities, highlighting the potential ecological importance of virophages, and revealing distinct communities over small spatial scales.					; P, C/KHV-7567-2024; Short, Steven/F-5578-2011	Palermo, Christine/0000-0003-3037-0064; Short, Steven/0000-0002-6576-4883														1999-4915				SEP	2019	11	9							792	10.3390/v11090792	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v11090792								31466255					WOS:000487962400037
J	Palinkas, CM; Russ, E				Palinkas, Cindy M.; Russ, Emily			Spatial and temporal patterns of sedimentation in an infilling reservoir	CATENA												River dams are ubiquitous globally, altering the connection of up- and downstream environments. In particular, they store vast amounts of sediment in their upstream reservoirs, many of which are approaching storage capacity. There is much interest in sediment management for these systems, even though quantifying sedimentation rates remains somewhat challenging. This study focuses on one such system, Conowingo Reservoir, upstream of the last and largest dam (Conowingo Dam) on the Susquehanna River before it enters Chesapeake Bay. The trapping capacity of Conowingo Reservoir has decreased since its creation in 1928, potentially increasing fluvial loading to the Bay. In addition, large flood events can scour much more than the average annual sediment load from the Reservoir bottom, delivering exceptionally large sediment loads to the Bay within days. Predicting the downstream impacts of both Reservoir infill and scour events is essential for management; however, these predictions are limited by understanding of the complex spatial and temporal variability of sedimentation. To evaluate this variability, sedimentation rates are determined throughout the Reservoir over seasonal to decadal time scales with the naturally occurring radioisotopes Be-7 and Pb-210 (half-lives 53.3 days and 22.3 years, respectively), as well as anthropogenically produced Cs-137 (half-life 30.7 y) as an independent geochronometer. These rates are placed within the context of sediment character (mud content) and fluvial sediment supply to the Reservoir, as well as its geomorphology. In general, seasonal sedimentation rates scale with fluvial loads and reflect deposition of watershed-derived sediment. Spatial patterns of seasonal sedimentation follow those of river deltas incised by channels, while decadal-scale sedimentation rates increase downstream. Episodic event sedimentation in channels is suggested by the character of Pb-210 profiles, which indicate non steady state sedimentation that makes application of sediment-age dating models challenging in this system. Although sediment mud content has clearly decreased as the Reservoir has filled, observed changes in sedimentation rates may reflect biases of these models rather than physical changes.

J	Mbigi, D; Xiao, ZN				Mbigi, Dickson; Xiao, Ziniu			Tanzanian rainfall responses to El Nino and positive Indian Ocean Dipole events during 1951-2015	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS												The relative impacts of Indian and Pacific Ocean processes on Tanzanian rainfall was evaluated using composite and correlation analyses. It was found that the seasonal responses of rainfall to positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) and El Nino events are substantial from September-October-November (SON) to December-January-February (DJF), whereas the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) exerts more control than El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in both seasons. The associated relationship with the sea surface temperature (SST) and large-scale atmospheric circulations revealed distinct features. For the pure pIOD years, there is above-normal rainfall over the entire country. A strong rainfall condition is evident over the Lake Victoria basin and coastal and north-eastern highland parts of the country during SON, while areas of the central and southern highlands exhibit substantial rains during DJF. For the pure El-Nino events, Tanzania has suffered from insignificant, weak, and non-coherent rainfall conditions during SON. However, a contrasting insignificant rainfall signature is found between the northern and southern parts of the country during the subsequent DJF season. For the co-occurrence of pIOD and El Nino, significant, excessive rainfall conditions are restricted to over the northern coast and northeastern areas of the country during SON, consistent with the rainfall pattern for pIOD. A weak, positive rainfall condition is observed over the entire country in the following season of DJF. Generally, in terms of Tanzanian rainfall, the IOD/ENSO variability and the associated impacts can be explained by the anomalous SST and circulation anomalies.

Potential impacts of emerald ash borer and adaptation strategies on wildlife communities in black ash wetlands	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Black ash wetlands cover approximately 1.2 million ha of wetland forest in the western Great Lakes region, providing critical habitat for wildlife. The future of these wetlands is critically threatened by a variety of factors, including emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis; emerald ash borer [EAB]), which has been eliminating native populations of otherwise healthy ash throughout the Great Lakes region since it was discovered in 2002. To quantify the potential impacts of tree mortality from EAB on wildlife communities, we measured seasonal bird, mammal, and amphibian diversity in black ash wetlands using a dual approach: (1) documenting bird and amphibian species across 27 mature reference black ash wetlands in northern Minnesota, USA and (2) assessing how bird, mammal, and amphibian communities respond to experimental manipulations of black ash forests that emulate mortality and management strategies related to the potential impact of EAB. In total, 85 wildlife species were recorded for the entire study including 57 bird species, 5 amphibian species, and 23 mammal species. Results from the reference sites show that hydrologic regime, percentage of ash canopy cover, and understory cover were important habitat characteristics for bird and amphibian communities. Results from the experimental sites show there may be short-term increases in species richness for mammal and bird communities associated with changes in forest structure due to ash mortality; however, anticipated changes resulting from EAB-caused mortality, particularly the conversion of these sites to non-forested wetlands, will lead to significant shifts in bird and mammal community composition. Loss of ash may cause declines in forest-dependent species and increases in open-canopy and wetland-associated species. Additionally, whereas increased ponding extent and longer hydroperiods may be beneficial for some amphibian species, the loss of the forest canopy will result in an overall decrease in bird diversity and reduce forest connectivity for all species. Our results indicate the potential for significant large-scale impacts of black ash mortality on forest-associated wildlife. Management strategies that focus on establishing alternative trees species to maintain long-term forest cover and structural complexity in these wetlands will help to maintain and conserve wildlife diversity.					; D'Amato, Anthony/AAV-3245-2021	Youngquist, Melissa/0000-0003-2721-1871; Grinde, Alexis/0000-0001-7141-0494; Palik, Brian/0000-0003-0300-9644; Slesak, Robert/0000-0002-6523-5383													1051-0761	1939-5582				JUN	2022	32	4							e2567	10.1002/eap.2567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2567		APR 2022						35138662					WOS:000786518900001

We evaluate the Archbold Biological Station (ABS) FMP for goals related to the fire regime (area burned, seasonality, severity, and fire return intervals). The goals include increasing the area burned with prescribed fires, burning more areas during the May-September natural (lightning) fire season, and maintaining variation in fire severity. The ABS FMP is based on the concept of modal fire-return intervals (FRI) for each vegetation type that allow for variation in FRI in space and time. Our analysis uses detailed spatial data (5-m grid) on vegetation, fire extent, and severity. From 1967 to 2014, ABS increased area burned with prescribed fires. Over time, a greater proportion of ABS was burned with lightning-season fires. Burns had variable but mainly high severity. Fire severity varied with vegetation but was consistent over time. Vegetation slated for frequent burns tended to be behind schedule, while rosemary scrub, slated for infrequent fire, was ahead of schedule. The intermediate scrubby flatwoods, which comprise the largest part of the ABS landscape, had a FRI distribution that matched the FMP. The combination of fire mapping, FRI targets, and GIS offers a verifiable and consistent method of tracking fire regime goals in an FMP. We discuss inevitable tradeoffs in managing fire for multiple species and vegetation types over a large landscape and we provide recommendations for FMP monitoring and evaluation that may be broadly applicable to fire-adapted vegetation.																			0885-8608	2162-4399				APR	2017	37	2					212	227		10.3375/043.037.0210	http://dx.doi.org/10.3375/043.037.0210													WOS:000398677000008
J	Tozer, DC				Tozer, Douglas C.			Marsh bird occupancy dynamics, trends, and conservation in the southern Great Lakes basin: 1996 to 2013	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Using data from 21,546 point counts conducted by volunteers in Bird Studies Canada's Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program, I assessed whether occupancy of 15 breeding marsh bird species increased or decreased throughout the southern portion of the Great Lakes basin between 1996 and 2013. I accounted for differences in detection probability, addressed spatial autocorrelation, and assessed whether initial occupancy in 1996 and subsequent colonization or extinction at a site within and across species was influenced by site, wetland, and landscape scale covariates. Occupancy of 9 of 15 (60%) species significantly decreased, whereas occupancy of only 1 (7%) species significantly increased. The results show the power of citizen science and suggest that the largest number of decreasing marsh-dependent breeding bird species will benefit from conserving, restoring, or creating large wetlands surrounded by limited urban land use, and from addressing issues within International Joint Commission Areas of Concern. Plus, individual or smaller groups of decreasing species will also benefit from conserving, restoring, or creating robust-emergent-dominated but interspersed, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria)-free, Phragmites-free wetlands surrounded by higher proportions of wetland cover in the surrounding landscape, and from addressing issues within Great Lakes coastal wetlands. These actions will help promote colonization or reduce extinction and help slow or maybe even reverse declining trends in occupancy among decreasing species across the southern portion of the Great Lalces basin.

In this study, the spatiotemporal distribution of Chahannur Lake over the past 30 years was accurately extracted using the NDVI data, and the corresponding driver analysis was conducted.& nbsp;New hydrological insights for the region: Before 2000, Chahannur Lake was always remaining watery state throughout the year and the maximum area reached 90 km(2); however, after 2000 it became a seasonal lake with a long-term dry state. During the observed period, the recovery of water body had only occurred in two stages both of which belonged to historically heavy rain years, and the maximum lake area was only 40 km(2). Although the climate has tended to be warm and humid after 2000, it cannot completely reverse the lake's drying. Additionally, the irrigated arable increased by 392 km(2) in 2000-2017, and the increased arable consumed substantial groundwater for meeting agricultural demands, which consequently caused rapid shrinkage of the Lake. Notably, the increase of NDVI is widely distributed in irrigated arable with high water consuming crops. Overall, groundwater over-exploitation and strong water consumption from crops have jointly led to the drying of Chahannur lake.

We studied the seasonal biomass and frequency patterns of dominant and companion submersed macrophytes along the water depth gradient in Lake Erhai in 2013. The results showed that the species richness and community biomass showed hump-back shaped patterns along the water depth gradient both in polydominant and monodominant communities. Biomass percentage of Potamogenton maackianus showed a hump-back pattern while biomass percentages of Ceratophyllum demersum and Vallisneria natans appeared U-shaped patterns across the water depth gradient in polydominant communities whereas biomass percentage of V. natans increased with the water depth in monodominant communities. Dominant species demonstrated a broader distribution range of water depth than companion species. Frequency and biomass of companion species declined drastically with the water depth whereas those of dominant species showed non-linear patterns across the water depth gradient. Namely, along the water depth gradient, biomass of P. maackianus and V. natans showed hump-back patterns and biomasses of C. demersum displayed a U-shaped pattern in the polydominant communities but biomass of V. natans demonstrated a hump-back pattern in the monodominant communities; frequency of P. maackianus showed a hump-back pattern and C. demersum and V. natans maintained high frequencies in the two types of communities. We can speculate that in Lake Erhai the optimum growth water depths of P. maackianus and C. demersum in the polydominant communities are 2.5-4.5 m and 1-2 m or 5-6 m, respectively and that of V. natans is 3-5 m in the polydominant communities and 2.5-5 m in the monodominant communities. This is the first report that the optimum water depth ranges in the horizontal direction of three dominant submersed macrophytes in a natural freshwater lake were determined.

Does δ18O of O2 record meridional shifts in tropical rainfall?	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Marine sediments, speleothems, paleo-lake elevations, and ice core methane and delta O-18 of O-2 (delta O-18(atm)) records provide ample evidence for repeated abrupt meridional shifts in tropical rainfall belts throughout the last glacial cycle. To improve understanding of the impact of abrupt events on the global terrestrial biosphere, we present composite records of delta O-18(atm) and inferred changes in fractionation by the global terrestrial biosphere (Delta epsilon(LAND)) from discrete gas measurements in the WAIS Divide (WD) and Siple Dome (SD) Antarctic ice cores. On the common WD timescale, it is evident that maxima in Delta epsilon(LAND) are synchronous with or shortly follow small-amplitude WD CH4 peaks that occur within Heinrich stadials 1, 2, 4, and 5 - periods of low atmospheric CH4 concentrations. These local CH4 maxima have been suggested as markers of abrupt climate responses to Heinrich events. Based on our analysis of the modern seasonal cycle of gross primary productivity (GPP)-weighted delta(OatmO)-O-18 of terrestrial precipitation (the source water for atmospheric O-2 production), we propose a simple mechanism by which Delta epsilon(LAND) tracks the centroid latitude of terrestrial oxygen production. As intense rainfall and oxygen production migrate northward, Delta epsilon(LAND) should decrease due to the underlying meridional gradient in rainfall delta O-18. A southward shift should increase Delta epsilon(LAND). Monsoon intensity also influences delta O-18 of precipitation, and although we cannot determine the relative contributions of the two mechanisms, both act in the same direction. Therefore, we suggest that abrupt increases in Delta epsilon(LAND) unambiguously imply a southward shift of tropical rainfall. The exact magnitude of this shift, however, remains under-constrained by Delta epsilon(LAND).					; Brook, Edward/AAB-7807-2021; Baggenstos, Daniel/AAK-5751-2021; Yang, Ji-Woong/KHW-8273-2024	Baggenstos, Daniel/0000-0001-9756-6884; Seltzer, Alan/0000-0003-2870-1215; Yang, Ji-Woong/0000-0001-8397-9274; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				OCT 11	2017	13	10					1323	1338		10.5194/cp-13-1323-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-13-1323-2017													WOS:000412736400001
J	Huang, LL; Wu, ZQ; Li, JH				Huang, Liang Liang; Wu, Zhi Qiang; Li, Jian Hua			Fish fauna, biogeography and conservation of freshwater fish in Poyang Lake Basin, China	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												A checklist of the fish of Poyang Lake Basin based on an extensive survey and literature review is presented. A total of 220 species and subspecies belonging to12 orders, 27 families and 100 genera, have been recorded. Of these, 131 species are endemic to China. Based on cluster analysis with presence-absence data, freshwater ecosystems in Jiangxi Province are divided into two regions, the Xunwushui River region and the region of Poyang Lake. The Xunwushui River flows into the Pearl River, whereas the region of Poyang Lake flows into the Yangtze River. The fish fauna and evolution of the fish fauna in Poyang Lake Basin owes much to geological events and belongs to the Oriental Region, South-east Asiatic sub-region and East China area. Anthropogenic activities including habitat alteration, overfishing, pollution and soil erosion have severely reduced the fish biodiversity in Poyang Lake Basin. River modifications (i.e. dam construction and sand excavation) and heavy metal pollution are the most significant threats to fish diversity and ecosystem functioning in the majority of the river systems in the province. To protect fish diversity and fisheries more effectively in Poyang Lake Basin, law enforcement should be strengthened, and the following measures could be introduced: restocking economically important fish species; establishing fish sanctuaries and freshwater protected areas, ordering a close season and developing sustainable aquaculture.

J	Si, YL; de Boer, WF; Gong, P				Si, Yali; de Boer, Willem F.; Gong, Peng			Different Environmental Drivers of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 Outbreaks in Poultry and Wild Birds	PLOS ONE												A large number of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and wild birds have been reported in Europe since 2005. Distinct spatial patterns in poultry and wild birds suggest that different environmental drivers and potentially different spread mechanisms are operating. However, previous studies found no difference between these two outbreak types when only the effect of physical environmental factors was analysed. The influence of physical and anthropogenic environmental variables and interactions between the two has only been investigated for wild bird outbreaks. We therefore tested the effect of these environmental factors on HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry, and the potential spread mechanism, and discussed how these differ from those observed in wild birds. Logistic regression analyses were used to quantify the relationship between HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and environmental factors. Poultry outbreaks increased with an increasing human population density combined with close proximity to lakes or wetlands, increased temperatures and reduced precipitation during the cold season. A risk map was generated based on the identified key factors. In wild birds, outbreaks were strongly associated with an increased Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and lower elevation, though they were similarly affected by climatic conditions as poultry outbreaks. This is the first study that analyses the differences in environmental drivers and spread mechanisms between poultry and wild bird outbreaks. Outbreaks in poultry mostly occurred in areas where the location of farms or trade areas overlapped with habitats for wild birds, whereas outbreaks in wild birds were mainly found in areas where food and shelters are available. The different environmental drivers suggest that different spread mechanisms might be involved: HPAI H5N1 spread to poultry via both poultry and wild birds, whereas contact with wild birds alone seems to drive the outbreaks in wild birds.

Methods Thirty water, soil, sediments, coastal mud, multi-color brines and salt crystals samples were extracted and cultured using different media and incubation conditions. Totally 958 isolates were obtained and 87 isolates were selected for further studies, based on morphological, physiological and biochemical tests, representing different morphotypes. Results Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, the isolates exhibited 94.6-100% sequence similarity to the closest known species of the generaBacillus,Halomonas,Oceanobacillus,Salinicoccus,Thalassobacillus,Ornithinibacillus,Halobacillus,Salicola,Virgibacillus,Aerococcus,Arthrobacter,Idiomarina,Paraliobacillus,Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Aneurinibacillus,Brevibacillus,Brevundimonas,Chromohalobacter,Gracilibacillus,Jeotgalicoccus,Kocuria,Marinilactibacillus,Marinobacter,Microbacterium,Paenibacillus,Paracoccus,Piscibacillus,PseudomonasandSediminibacillusand also, comparison of ARDRA patterns among the sequenced strains, usingAluI,BstUI andHpaII enzymes showed that these patterns are in accordance with the phylogenetic position of these strains. Conclusion The PCR-RFLP analyses suggested that ARDRA possess a functional potential for distinguishing halophilic bacteria to be used for further studies in elementary steps of isolation to reduce the tedious duplication of isolates.

FROS operates effectively in open water and ice. It can automatically measure meteorological data, such as the air temperature and solar radiation, as well as ice/snow data, including ice thickness and snow depth. These observations help to fill the current knowledge gap of lake ice observations during the early freezing and late melting periods because of the limited bearing capacity of ice cover. A mid-latitude lake was selected for field experiments to verify the effectiveness of FROS, where the duration of the survey was 101 days, of which 97 were during an ice-covered period. The results reveal that the lake ice went through a fast freezing period, equilibrium period, and a melting period, with a maximum ice thickness of 35.5 cm. The ice melting rate was 1.7 cm/day, which was approximately double the ice growth rate of 0.7 cm/day during the fast freezing period. FROS was able to record the complete evolution of lake ice and of different meteorological elements, with good stability in both open water and frozen conditions, and can accommodate wind speeds up to 6.4 m/s. Meanwhile, FROS has good versatility, and other measurement instruments such as chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen sensors, long wave radiometers, and conductivity sensors can be added to it. The application of FROS will be important for calculations of the thermal balance of snow and ice, and studies of the annual and seasonal evolution of ecological characteristics in frozen lakes.

We analyzed vascular plant-derived n-alkanes, combustion-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), fecal steroids, and bacterial and archaeal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids in concert with microcharcoal and pollen assemblages to reconstruct climatic, environmental, and human impact in the Dojran catchment and the greater Dojran area. Overall, our results suggest a relationship between anthropogenic activity and environmental/climatic change since increased human impact corresponds to phases of higher humidity and high lake levels at Lake Dojran. During the early Holocene, the record reveals increasing temperatures and humidity and concurrent increasing vegetation cover and runoff/soil erosion, respectively. Following a thermal maximum during the middle early Holocene, temperatures decrease gradually until present. The middle-Holocene at Lake Dojran is characterized by relatively stable environmental conditions followed by greater climatic instability and strong anthropogenic overprint during the late-Holocene. The fecal stanol record reveals phases of increased human impact during the early Bronze Age, the late Bonze/early Iron Age, and the Middle Ages. A phase of low stanol and PAH concentrations from the late Iron Age until the early Middle Ages is either related to ecosystem changes and/or changes in settlement pattern since concurrent pollen data indicate intensified land use. Human impact re-intensified during the Middle Ages with some variability probably related to climatic variations of the Medieval Warm Period' and the Little Ice Age'.

Tarangire revisited: Consequences of declining connectivity in a tropical ungulate population	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The hyper-abundance of migratory wildlife in many ecosystems depends on maintaining access to seasonally available resources. In Eastern and Southern Africa, land-use change and a loss of connectivity have coincided with widespread declines in the abundance and geographic range of ungulate populations. Using photographic capture-mark-recapture, we examine the historical pattern of loss of connectivity and its impact on population trends in a partially migratory wildebeest population in northern Tanzania. To estimate abundance, we use a novel modeling approach that overcomes bias associated with photo misidentifications. Our data indicate (1) diminished connectivity within and between seasonal areas as a result of human activities, (2) a reduction in the overall population size compared to historical numbers, with high variability over time, (3) the continued use of highly constrained movement corridors between the three main seasonal ranges, (4) higher recruitment in the non-migratory subpopulation (Lake Manyara National Park) than in other areas of the ecosystem, and (5) an increase in the relative abundance of resident to migrant wildebeest. Recent conservation efforts to protect seasonal habitat and to enforce anti-poaching policies outside protected areas have likely helped stabilize the population, at least temporarily, but we caution that several key vulnerabilities remain.

Studies of brGDGTs in China have been conducted on a large spatial scale, but the proposed brGDGTs-based land Holocene temperature records show contrasting temporal patterns. In this study, we used modern observations of brGDGTs combined with the analysis of other modern climate data and paleoclimate records to re-evaluate the proposed brGDGTs-based land Holocene paleotemperature records from China. Our findings indicate that: (i) the proposed brGDGTs-based Holocene paleotemperature records from Chinese loess deposits are more possibly indicative of humidity changes. (ii) brGDGTs in lake sediments are significantly influenced not only by air/water temperatures but also by water depth, salinity, seasonal freezing and so on, and therefore the paleoclimatic significance of individual brGDGTs-based Holocene climate records from Chinese lakes needs to be carefully evaluated. The long-term Holocene warming trend indicated by brGDGTs-based records from most shallow, freshwater Chinese lakes without surface freezing are relatively dependable. (iii) Given modern observations of brGDGTs are rarely conducted in peatlands in Northeast China, we therefore suggest the long-term Holocene warming trend indicated by brGDGTs-based records from the 5 peatlands along the transect from Southeast to Northwest China is more reliable than the long-term Holocene cooling trend indicated by brGDGTs-based records from the two peatlands in Northeast China. Therefore, currently, we are roughly incline to believe the long-term Holocene warming trend in some of the Chinese lake and peat brGDGTs-based records. As our knowledge of the environmental significance of brGDGTs continues to increase, we anticipate that they can make a substantial contribution to resolving the "Holocene temperature conundrum".

However, the role of morphological changes (e.g., colony size and tightness) in the adaptation to nutrient availability is not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed the morphological changes under both nutrient sufficiency and deficiency. Accordant morphological changes were found with both an isolated colonial strain and mixed field colonies. Colonies that were limited by nutrients became bloated and uncompacted structures, and this change was more pronounced under N deficiency. This looser morphology increased the availability of intra-colony light and relieved the size effect. When nutrients were sufficient, small colonies emerged, which helped to maintain rapid growth (0.32 day(-1)). Our study highlighted probable role of morphological variations in: (1) diminishing intra-colony selfshading when facing nutrient deficiency; and (2) enlarging the population under high trophic levels by generating daughter colonies. These roles were also verified using field data from Lake Taihu, which further indicated that the seasonal succession of morphospecies was probably the result of adaptive morphological changes. Adaptive morphological changes offer advantages against fluctuations in nutrient availability, which should be considered when attempting to restrain bloom formation.					; Feng, Ganyu/HCI-6688-2022; Zhu, Wei/P-3555-2015; Duan, Zhipeng/AGV-9927-2022	Feng, Ganyu/0000-0002-7497-7469; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				JUN	2022	115								102235	10.1016/j.hal.2022.102235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2022.102235		APR 2022						35623697					WOS:000887392200003

In this study, the climatology of dust deposition in the Adriatic Sea area was determined for the first time based on Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 reanalysis from 1989 to 2019. The annual cycle of deposition exhibits two maxima: a stronger maxima in March-April and a weaker maxima in November. Wet deposition is a dominant process with a relative contribution to overall deposition from 67.35% to 88.53%. Deposition hot spots are along the Montenegrin coast and Otrant. The average contribution of dust deposition events (DDEs) is 16.5% (60.2 dy yr(-1)), with the strongest deposition during 1999-2009 and a positive trend in deposited mass during the study period. The effect of dust deposition on primary production is observed by a high level of oxygen saturation up to 250% (usually it is lower, up to 150%) in the stratified middle water layer (5-8 m) of the central Adriatic marine system (Rogoznica Lake) during an intense wet deposition episode. Such extreme values of oxygen saturation can be taken as an indication of biological activity related to an increase in phytoplankton abundance and activity, diatoms in particular.

Climate data indicate anomalous conditions during the 2013 rainy period with higher rainfall and lower temperature in the beginning (November). Lake levels were influenced after the first and second hour of each rainfall, which showed a strong synchronization between seasonal fluctuation of lake levels and local weather patterns. Based on the water quality, both lakes are classified as classes "1" and "2" in the CONAMA (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente) scheme and as "excellent" to "good" in the WQI (Water Quality Index) categories. However, the limnology is distinctly different between the lakes and seasons. Higher trophic state and phytoplankton productivity were observed mainly during the rainy period in Violao Lake compared to Amendoim Lake. This may be due to deposition of leached nutrients in the former, mainly total phosphorus (TP), which was probably derived from mafic soils and guano. This is consistent with the significant positive correlation between Chlorophyll-a and TP at the end of the rainy period (March-April), whereas this was not observed in the beginning (November). This could possibly be a consequence of the more intense cloud cover, and unusual high rainfall that limits nutrient availability.

However, avifauna in wetlands is severely impacted by the anthropogenic transformation of natural habitats into other land uses. Understanding how habitat changes influence avian community dynamics is crucial for effective management and conservation of bird habitats. Here, we assessed spatio-temporal variation in taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, and assembly structures of the bird community in the Indawgyi Wetland Ecosystem in Myanmar. Bird surveys were seasonally conducted at 120 sample plots, which were equally distributed among four habitat types subject to different level of human influences (natural lake habitat, seasonally flooded grasslands, riparian forest, and agricultural land). Across habitat types, functional and phylogenetic diversity were the highest in the lake habitat, especially during the migration season, and the lowest in the cultivated habitat. Our results indicated over-dispersed functional and phylogenetic structures in the lake habitat, with clustered structures in the remaining habitats. Diversity of species important for conservation was also higher in the lake habitat and in areas far away from human disturbances. Spatial variation of bird community diversity suggests that conservation efforts in this ecosystem should concentrate more on the lake habitat and associated grassland habitats. Moreover, our results suggest the need for habitat restoration in riparian forests and increased sustainable agricultural practices in order to improve the contribution of these habitats to the diversity in the avifauna community. Our study highlighted the importance of integrating functional and phylogenetic dimensions into biodiversity analyses providing broader ecological insights for conservation.

A 2000-year sediment record reveals rapidly changing sedimentation and land use since the 1960s in the Upper Mara-Serengeti Ecosystem	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Mara River basin is a trans-boundary basin of international importance. It forms the headwaters of the Nile River and serves as the primary dry season water source for an estimated 1.1 million rural people and the largest remaining overland migration of 1.4 million wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem. Changes throughout the basin arc impacting the quantity and quality of the Mara River, yet the historical context of environmental conditions in the basin is not well known. We collected sediment cores throughout the wetland at the mouth of the Mara River, and we used isotopic dating methods and a suite of analyses to examine historical patterns of sediment quantity and source, mercury contamination, and carbon and nutrient loading. Our results show that ecological conditions in the Mara River basin were fairly stable over paleoecological time scales (2000-1000 years before present), but there has been a period of rapid change in the basin over the last 250 years, particularly since the 1960s. A shift in the source and quantity of sediments in the liver began in the late 1700s and became much more pronounced in the 1950s and 1960s, coincident with increasing mercury concentrations. The quantity of sediment from the Upper Mara increased, particularly since 1960, but the proportion of total sediment from this region decreased as the Talek and Middle Mara portions of the basin began producing more sediment. The decadal oscillation in sediment accumulation was congruent with known periods of extreme precipitation events. Carbon and nitrogen loading also increased since the 1960s, and the shift in the isotopic ratio of nitrogen provides evidence for increased anthropogenic loading. Altogether, these data likely reflect patterns of change also experienced in other basins throughout East Africa. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Stream Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Sediment Concentrations Show Contrasting Long-term Trends Associated with Agricultural Change	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Stream water quality can be greatly influenced by changes in agricultural practices, but studies of long-term dynamics are scarce. Here we describe trends over 21 yr (1994-2014) in nutrients and suspended sediments in three streams in a Midwestern US agricultural watershed. During this time, the watershed experienced substantial changes in agricultural practices, most importantly a pronounced shift from conventional to conservation tillage. In the 1990s and early 2000s, NH4, soluble reactive P, and suspended sediment concentrations (standardized for discharge and season) each declined significantly (>4-12% per year) in at least two of the three streams (P < 0.01), whereas NO3 changed relatively little. However, since the early 2000s, declines in NH4 and sediment concentrations have slowed, soluble reactive P concentrations have not declined and may actually have increased, and NO3 concentrations have declined sharply. The more recent lack of decline in soluble reactive P coincides with a plateau in the prevalence of conservation tillage and may be because of increased soil P stratification due to long-term reduced tillage. The more recent decline in NO3 may be due to improved efficiency of N fertilizer use, increased soil denitrification, and/or declines in atmospheric N deposition. Our study shows that stream concentrations of N, P, and sediment can respond in contrasting ways to changes in agriculture, and that temporal trends can moderate, accelerate, or reverse over decadal timescales. Management strategies must consider contrasting temporal responses of water quality indicators and may need to be adaptively adjusted at scales of years to decades.

Changes in Large Lake Water Level Dynamics in Response to Climate Change	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Understanding impacts of climate change on water level fluctuations across Earth's large lakes has critical implications for commercial and recreational boating and navigation, coastal planning, and ecological function and management. A common approach to advancing this understanding is the propagation of climate change scenarios (often from global circulation models) through regional hydrological models. We find, however, that this approach does not always fully capture water supply spatiotemporal features evolving from complex relationships between hydrologic variables. Here, we present a statistical approach for projecting plausible climate-related regional water supply scenarios into localized net basin supply sequences utilizing a parametric vine copula. This approach preserves spatial and temporal correlations between hydrologic components and allows for explicit representation and manipulation of component marginal and conditional probability distributions. We demonstrate the capabilities of our new modeling framework on the Laurentian Great Lakes by coupling our copula-derived net basin supply simulations with a newly-formulated monthly lake-to-lake routing model. This coupled system projects monthly average water levels on Lake Superior, Michigan-Huron, and Erie (we omit Lake Ontario from our study due to complications associated with simulating strict regulatory controls on its outflow). We find that our new method faithfully replicates marginal and conditional probability distributions, as well as serial autocorrelation, within and among historical net basin supply sequences. We find that our new method also reproduces seasonal and interannual water level dynamics. Using readily-available climate change simulations for the Great Lakes region, we then identified two plausible, transient, water supply scenarios and propagated them through our model to understand potential impacts on future water levels. Both scenarios result in an average water level increase of <10 cm on Lake Superior and Erie, with slightly larger increases on Michigan-Huron, as well as elevated variability of monthly water levels and a shift in seasonal water level modality. Our study contributes new insights into plausible impacts of future climate change on Great Lakes water levels, and supports the application and advancement of statistical modeling tools to forecast water supplies and water levels on not just the Great Lakes, but on other large lakes around the world as well.																				2624-9375				APR 13	2022	4								805143	10.3389/frwa.2022.805143	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2022.805143													WOS:000791989500001

In this study, we explored the relationships between rice yield and extreme precipitation indices using Mann-Kendall trend test, Pettitt's test, and K-means clustering methods. This study used 10 extreme precipitation indices of the rice growing season (May to October) based on the daily precipitation records and rice yield data at 52 meteorological stations during 1961-2012 in Jiangsu province. The main findings were as follows: (1) correlation results indicated that precipitation extremes occurred in the months of July, August, and October, which had noticeable adverse effects on rice yield; (2) the maximum 7-day precipitation of July and the number of rainy days of August and October should be considered as three key indicators for the precipitation-induced rice meteorological disasters; and (3) most of the stations showed an increasing trends for the maximum 7-day precipitation of July and the number of rainy days of August, while the number of rainy days of October in all the stations demonstrated a decreasing trend. Moreover, Jiangsu province could be divided into two major sub-regions such as north and south areas with different temporal variations in the three key indicators.

Here, we designed a new probe specific for the genus Sulfuritalea and performed catalysed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridisation to enumerate cells of Sulfuritalea species throughout the water column in a stratified freshwater lake. The cells stained with the Sulfuritalea-specific probe were detected in all hypoxic water samples collected in different seasons and years. Their abundance ranged from 1.4 x 10(4) to 2.1 x 10(5) cells ml(-1), corresponding to 0.5-5.5% of the total DAPI-stained cells and 2.3-15% of the total bacterial cells. A high abundance of Sulfuritalea species was recorded in hypoxic water samples without nitrate, which is the only known anaerobic electron acceptor for Sulfuritalea. Nitrate-independent anaerobic respiration was further investigated using a single cultured representative of this genus, and its growth via arsenate respiration was experimentally demonstrated. In conclusion, Sulfuritalea species were found to be a major component of the planktonic bacterial community in nitrate-depleted hypoxic water, where arsenate respiration is one of the possible energy metabolisms of Sulfuritalea.					; Kojima, Hisaya/D-9100-2012; Watanabe, Tomohiro/HTR-1086-2023; Fukui, Manabu/E-1323-2012	Iwata, Tomoya/0000-0003-4258-0050; Watanabe, Tomohiro/0000-0002-5397-2124; 													1758-2229					OCT	2017	9	5					522	527		10.1111/1758-2229.12557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.12557								28618172					WOS:000412914400008
J	Wu, GP; Liu, YB				Wu, Guiping; Liu, Yuanbo			Assessment of the Hydro-Ecological Impacts of the Three Gorges Dam on China's Largest Freshwater Lake	REMOTE SENSING												The Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has received increasing attention with respect to its potential effects on downstream hydro-ecosystems. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake downstream of the TGD, and it is not immune to these impacts. Here, we combine hydrological observations, remote sensing, a geographic information system (GIS), and landscape ecology technology to investigate the variability and spatial pattern of the hydro-ecological alterations to Poyang Lake induced by the operation of the TGD. It was found that the TGD caused significant hydro-ecological alterations across the Poyang Lake wetland. Specifically, the TGD operation altered the seasonal inundation pattern of Poyang Lake and significantly reduced the monthly inundation frequencies (IFs), which were especially notable (similar to 30-40%) from September to November. Spatially, the declining IFs led to an increase in the mudflat area that is suitable for the growth of vegetation. The vegetation area increased by 58.82 km(2) and 463.73 km(2) in the low- and high-water season, respectively, with the most significant changes occurring in the estuary delta of the Ganjiang and Raohe rivers. The results also indicated that the changes in the inundation pattern and floodplain vegetation have profoundly altered the structure and composition of the wetland, which has resulted in increased landscape diversity and a gradual increase in the complexity of the ecosystem composition under the influence of regulation of the TGD. Such results are of great importance for policymakers, as they may provide a reference for wetland water resource planning and landscape restoration in an operational dam environment.

This requires understanding of the spatial structure and variability of flow velocities and constituents in Lake Kivu. In this study, we develop a 3D hydrodynamic model of Lake Kivu, set-up within DELFT3D at a 750 m grid spacing and forced by COSMO-CLM atmosphere model results at a 2.8 km grid spacing. Validation shows that the model correctly reproduces the generation and breakdown of the temperature stratification in the upper mixed layer and predicts flow velocity magnitudes and directions similar to measurements both at the surface and at greater depth. Analysis of currents reveals a surface current pattern with two clockwise circulations, one around the whole lake and a smaller one in the northern part, with velocities around 0.1 m/s. This pattern is consistently present over an (ensemble-)averaged day, both in the wet and in the dry season, while day-by-day variations are large. Time-averaged deep currents are found to be a few mm/ s at maximum. However, the variations can be substantial, with standard deviations up to 2 cm/s for the currents at 220 m depth, attributed to internal seiches. The temperature stratification, present during the entire wet season, is found to first break down in the dry season in the southern part of the lake. This is explained by the spatial differences in the wind stress and the evaporation heat fluxes during the dry season. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The multiple P compounds primarily include orth-P (88.3%), mono-P (8.9%), DNA-P (2.1%), and pyro-P (0.8%) in the exposed sediments. A significant decreasing trend of ortheP occurred after the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), with the mean concentration decreasing from 175.9 to 142.5 mg kg(-1) from 2007 to 2012 (ANOVA: P < 0.05), whereas the temporal change in biogenic P showed great variability. The plant distribution pattern and the increase in plant biomass due to decreased water levels might be the reason that caused variations in the P species. Furthermore, the content of orth-P, mono-P, DNA-P, and pyro-P showed increasing trends as sediment exposure time increased. However, the enzyme hydrolysis rate of DNA-P decreased with exposure time and may cause the bioavailability of biogenic P to decrease. Despite the fact that the bioavailability of biogenic P might decline in the short term, the favorable environmental conditions for P release in sediment rewetting processes, together with the increase in ortheP and biogenic P due to extended exposure time, indicate that these large additions of P would enter the overlying water and cause water quality decline once the sediment is submerged underwater during the next wet season. An environmental process analysis showed that the increased exposure time induced sediment environmental conditions changes that played an important role in the biogeochemical cycle of P and may be an important way of P replenishment in Lake Poyang. The results of this study help provide a better understanding of the role of sediment drying/wetting cycles in nutrient biogeochemical behavior and fates in wetland ecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, it is necessary to assess the risk of soil salinity and analyze spatial and temporal changes. The objective of this paper is to develop a temporal and spatial soil salinity risk assessment method based on an integrated scoring method by combining the advantages of remote sensing and GIS technology. Based on correlation coefficient analysis to determine the weights of risk evaluation factors, a comprehensive scoring system for the risk of salinity in the dry and wet seasons was constructed for the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR), and the risk of spatial variation of soil salinity in the study area was analyzed in the dry and wet seasons. The results show the following: (1) The risk of soil salinity during the wet season is mainly influenced by the plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), deep soil water content (D_wat), and the effect of shallow soil salinity (SH_sal). The risk of soil salinity during the dry season is mainly influenced by shallow soil salinity (SH_sal), land use and land cover change (LUCC), and deep soil moisture content (D_wat). (2) The wet season was found to have a high risk of salinization, which is mainly characterized by moderate, high, and very high risks. However, in the dry season, the risk of salinity is mainly characterized by low and moderate risk of salinity. (3) In the ELWNNR, as the wet season changes to dry season (from May to August), moderate-risk area in the wet season easily shifts to low risk and risk-free, and the area of high risk in the wet season easily shifts to moderate risk. In general, the overall change in salinity risk of the ELWNNR showed a significant relationship with changes in lake water volume, indicating that changes in water volume play an important role in the risk of soil salinity occurrence. Ideally, the quantitative analysis of salinity risk proposed in this study, which takes into account temporal and spatial variations, can help decision makers to propose more targeted soil management options.					; Zhang, Fei/AAD-6047-2019; Chan, Ngai/AAW-9897-2020	Wang, YiShan/0009-0001-6845-7395; Zhang, Fei/0000-0002-1194-8513; 														2072-4292				AUG	2020	12	15							2405	10.3390/rs12152405	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12152405													WOS:000559119100001

We report observational evidence for seasonal variations of seismicity on the border faults of the western branch in the East African Rift System. Relying on water level changes of Lake Victoria and the surrounding rift lakes and soil moisture from the Global Land Data Assimilation System model, we calculate the crustal stress changes using a finite element model. Our results suggest the seasonal hydrological variations produce a 0.2-0.8 kPa Coulomb stress change on the border faults. The primary annual peak in seismicity is coincident with the peak Coulomb stress with an insignificant time lag. The correlation suggests seasonal variations of seismicity rates in the western branch of East African Rift System are modulated by the hydrological loading from Lake Victoria and the large rift lakes in the surrounding region. Plain Language Abstract Lake Victoria and the surrounding lakes of the East African Rift System (EARS) are the largest lakes (by surface area) in Africa and show annual water level variations concurrent with the regional dry and wet seasons. We use numerical models to calculate crustal stress changes from lake water and soil moisture surface loading and investigate if the hydrological cycle encourages or discourages earthquake activity in the western branch of the EARS. Our results show seasonal hydrological loading produces stress changes at seismogenic depths that have good spatiotemporal correlation with seismicity rate variations in the western branch in the EARS. Hydrological loading from water level changes in Victoria Lake and the rift lakes weakly modulates seismicity rates in the western branch with the most pronounced results in the central Kivu rift and southern Tanganyika rift.					; Burgmann, Roland/AAE-5138-2022	Fu, Yuning/0000-0002-9226-3857; Johnson, Christopher/0000-0002-2589-7593; Xue, Liang/0000-0002-7071-1057; Burgmann, Roland/0000-0002-3560-044X													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 28	2020	47	6							e2019GL085882	10.1029/2019GL085882	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL085882													WOS:000529097700013
J	Gooseff, MN; Wlostowski, A; McKnight, DM; Jaros, C				Gooseff, Michael N.; Wlostowski, Adam; McKnight, Diane M.; Jaros, Chris			Hydrologic connectivity and implications for ecosystem processes - Lessons from naked watersheds	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Hydrologic connectivity has received great attention recently as our conceptual models of watersheds and water quality have evolved in the past several decades. However, the structural complexity of most temperate watersheds (i.e. connections among shallow soils, deep aquifers, the atmosphere and streams) and the dynamic seasonal changes that occur within them (i.e., plant senescence which impacts evapotranspiration) create significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrologic connectivity. The McMurdo Dry Valleys, a polar desert in Antarctica, provide a unique opportunity to study hydrologic connectivity because there is no vegetative cover (and therefore no transpiration), and no deep aquifers connected to surface soils or streams. Glacier melt provides stream flow to well-established channels and closed-basin, ice-covered lakes on the valley floor. Streams are also connected to shallow hyporheic zones along their lengths, which are bounded at similar to 75 cm depth by ice-cemented permafrost. These hydrologic features and connections provide water for and underpin biological communities. Hence, exchange of water among them provides a vector for exchange of energy and dissolved solutes. Connectivity is dynamic on timescales of a day to a flow season (6-12 weeks), as streamflow varies over these timescales. The timescales over which these connections occur is also dynamic. Exchanges between streams and hyporheic zones, for example, have been estimated to be as short as hours to as long as several weeks. These exchanges have significant implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems and the biotic communities in each feature. Here we evaluate the lessons we can learn about hydrologic connectivity in the MDV watersheds that are simplified in the context of processes occurring and water reservoirs included in the landscape, yet are sensitive to climate controls and contain substantial physical heterogeneity. We specifically explore several metrics that are simple and/or commonly employed in hydrologic analyses and interpret them in the context of connectivity between and among hydrologic features.

Landslide susceptibility was analyzed by maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) using 11 conditioning factors. Potentially dangerous lakes for glacial lake outburst flood were identified based on volume, lake type, slope and distance from mother glacier. Rainfall induced flash flood conditioning factors were classified and ranked using weighted overlay approach to get flash flood risk map. About 237 km(2) is highly vulnerable to the rainfall induced flash floods, whereas, 259.36 km(2) was found high to moderately susceptible to landslides. Most of the settlement areas along the river banks, in and around geological faults are found in high risk zone. The residents of the catchment need to be cautious and appropriate logistic arrangements should be made before rainy season to reduce the fatality and infrastructure damage.					; Pandey, Arvind/U-4883-2019	PANDEY, ARVIND/0009-0005-5070-3147; dwivedi, sanjay kumar/0000-0001-8030-6701													1010-6049	1752-0762				DEC 13	2022	37	26					11998	12013		10.1080/10106049.2022.2063403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2063403		APR 2022											WOS:000794205800001

Quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) selective feeding of phytoplankton in Saginaw Bay	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Experiments from May to December measuring selective grazing and egestion of different phytoplankton taxa in natural Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron) seston by shallow-water morph quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis rostriformis) showed that the mussels were highly selective filter feeders and that their net clearance rates on different species ranged widely, resulting in food consumption that was strongly driven by seasonal phytoplankton dynamics. Overall, net clearance rates by quagga mussels on the entire phytoplankton assemblage were similar to those observed for zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) during the 1990s. Phytoplankton taxon, rather than size, was more important to food selection since quagga mussels cleared similar sized but different species of algae at very different rates. In contrast to many studies with zebra mussels, larger-sized algae such as Dinobryon divergens, Aulacoseira italica, Fragilaria crotonensis, and Anabaena were cleared at high rates and rejected at lower rates than many smaller species within the same broad taxonomic group. We suspect that these differences between dreissenid species do not stem from species differences but methodological factors and phytoplankton composition of systems studied. Small-sized diatoms, green algae with thick cell walls (Scenedesmus and Oocystis), and colonial cyanobacteria with gelatinous sheaths (Aphanocapsa, Chroococcus, and Microcystis) were cleared at low rates and rejected in high proportion in pseudofeces or feces during all seasons. We describe the likely mechanisms of pre- and post-ingestive behavior that explain these differences, which relate to phytoplankton size, morphology, cell wall characteristics, and chemical composition. Changes in the Great Lakes phytoplankton communities are consistent with mussel grazing preferences. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Wang, Y; Gao, L; Ming, Y; Zhao, LB				Wang, Yao; Gao, Lei; Ming, Yue; Zhao, Lingbin			Recent Declines in Nutrient Concentrations and Fluxes in the Lower Changjiang River	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												To elucidate nutrient variation patterns and trends over various timescales under combined effects of human activities and climate change, nutrient concentrations were monitored monthly in Lower Changjiang (Yangtze) River from November 2016 to August 2020. They were also monitored daily during an extreme flood in July 2020. Over daily and seasonal timescales, the Changjiang River discharges had a dominant influence on nutrient concentrations. By combining existing data over recent decades with those from the current study, we found that turning points for concentration trends for most nutrients emerged in the recent decade (2010-2020), i.e., 2012 for NO3-, PO43-, and NH4+ and 2014 for SiO32-. After these turning point years, NO3-, SiO32-, and PO43- concentrations decreased at annual rates of 2.953, 3.746, and 0.108 mu M/year, respectively. Regarding NO3- and PO43-, their concentrations and fluxes increased from 1960s to 2012, similar to the increasing trends of anthropogenic N and P fertilizer inputs from the drainage basin. After 2012, concentrations and fluxes of NO3- and PO43- showed significant decreasing trends, largely due to the control of N and P fertilizer usage. A comparison among eight rivers in East and South China (including the Changjiang River) indicated that basin latitudes were essential to determining areal nutrient yields, implying that latitude-related factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and areal population density, significantly impacted nutrient fluxes. This study emphasized that the deteriorating Changjiang River aquatic environment (which lasted from 1960s to 2010) has been successfully terminated over the last 10 years in 2010s.

J	Chen, ZH; Huang, P; Zhang, Z				Chen, Zhonghan; Huang, Ping; Zhang, Zhou			Interaction between carbon dioxide emissions and eutrophication in a drinking water reservoir: A three-dimensional ecological modeling approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We developed a three-dimensional model to study the dynamics of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from a subtropical drinking water reservoir. The quantitative effects of dissolved CO2 concentration on phytoplankton growth were coupled in an inorganic carbon module. Water quality monitoring was carried out to calibrate and validate the model. The simulated surface CO2 concentrations showed no significant difference between seasons (p > 0.05). Regarding the spatial distribution, high CO2 concentrations were observed in the inflow and dam regions (p < 0.05). Four scenarios of different atmospheric CO2 pressures and eutrophic levels were simulated to test the following hypotheses: (1) eutrophication will reverse the carbon budgets in reservoir systems and (2) rising CO2 levels will increase phytoplankton biomass. The results showed that water quality improvements will promote the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. Simultaneously, the elevated CO2 in the air will stimulate algal biomass, especially in nutrient-rich systems. The systematic analysis of carbon cycling revealed the different internal transformation rates under different scenarios and showed that 32% of carbon was removed via CO2 emission and carbon burial. The interaction provides a novel direction to understand the feedback loops between aquatic ecosystems and increasing CO2 pressure in the future.

The present study was conducted to simulate soil salinity in the root and transition zones in ten years of simulation period and assume the impact of drain depth and irrigation scenarios on soil salinity and depth to water table. Thus, SaltMod was used with the Geo-Hydrological data collected from Dizaj-e Dowl area located in the northwest of the Urmia Lake. The results indicated that the leaching efficiency of 0.5 in the root zone and natural drain depth of 8.5 and 5.5 m/season were the best match with the observed data. Soil salinity in the root zone had a consistent trend both above and below the drain level rise from 8 dS/m during the first season to 55 dS/m in the second season. Based on the water table, an increase of 7.7 m occurred after 10 years of the simulation period. In addition, the drain depth of 1.2 m assumed in the pilot area appeared to be feasible. Based on the results, SaltMod can be used to predict soil salinity for a long-term analysis by assuming the effect of different scenarios of irrigation and drainage depth on soil salinity in various soil horizons.

J	Leroy, D				Leroy, David			Farmers' Perceptions of and Adaptations to Water Scarcity in Colombian and Venezuelan Paramos in the Context of Climate Change	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												This study examined how members of 2 water user associations in high-elevation ecosystems in Colombia and Venezuela perceive water scarcity as well as the relationship between their perception of and adaptation to it. Among study participants, adaptation was guided not only by the perception of climate change (disturbance of the seasons, decrease in precipitation, and more extreme temperatures) but also by the perception of the socioeconomic causes of water scarcity (increase in cultivated area and population, aging irrigation infrastructure, system management problems). Farmers in the Venezuelan study site have adopted new and more efficient irrigation technologies, restored degraded infrastructure, and undertaken various actions to preserve and conserve wetlands. In the Colombian study site, farmers created a new irrigation system that draws water from a nearby lake, creating access to an abundant resource. The study shows how perceptions of water scarcity in a climate change context are critical determinants of farmers' behavior, especially collective adaptation.

Local environmental condition is associated with effect of river water chemistry (through species sorting); ecological process in region is associated with effects of land use and geography. Here, we investigated variation in bacterioplankton communities (free-living, between 0.22 and 5 mu m) in an anthropogenically disturbed river using high-throughput DNA sequencing of community 16S rRNA genes in order to investigate the importance of water chemistry, land use patterns, and geographic distance. Among environmental factors, sulfate (SO42-), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) concentrations were the water chemistry parameters that best explained bacterioplankton community variation. In addition, forest and freshwater areas were the land use patterns that best explained bacterioplankton community variation. Furthermore, cumulative dendritic distance was the geographic distance parameter that best explained bacterial community variation. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that water chemistry, land use patterns, and geographic distances strongly shaped bacterioplankton communities. In particular, the direct influence of land use was prominent, which alone contributed to the highest proportion of variation (26.2% in wet season communities and 36.5% in dry season communities). These results suggest that the mechanisms of species sorting and mass effects together control bacterioplankton communities, although mass effects exhibited higher contributions to community variation than species sorting. Given the importance of allochthonous bacteria input from various land use activities (i.e., mass effects), these results provide new insights into the environmental factors and determinant mechanisms that shape riverine ecosystem communities.					; Zhao, Jun/IUM-2453-2023	Zhao, Jun/0000-0002-7512-8215; 														1664-302X				MAY 6	2021	12								633993	10.3389/fmicb.2021.633993	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.633993								34025599					WOS:000652531300001

Sustaining the environmental conditions in the region is of vital importance for Tibet and the whole of China. The alpine grassland ecosystem in Northern Tibet is the most important ecosystem and extremely sensitive to climate change and human activity. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of climate variability based on observed meteorological data and future climate scenarios, and reviewed the impact of climate variability and to explore adaptation strategies of alpine grassland in Northern Tibet. The result showed that the annual mean temperature has increased by 0.31 A degrees C center dot 10a(-1) while the annual total precipitation has increased by 14.6 mm center dot 10a(-1) with high inter-annual and inter-seasonal fluctuations in Northern Tibet from 1961 to 2008. The rising trends of temperature and precipitation would be continued and the aridity indices showed a decreasing trend in the future, which potentially predicts that the climate in Northern Tibet becomes warmer and dryer. The climate variability results the melting of glaciers, the expansion of inland high mountain lakes and the negative impacts on alpine grassland in recent years. In order to adapt to such possible future climate changes, the alpine grassland water-saving irrigation was recommended as key adaptation measure and also rational grazing management, alpine grassland fencing and artificial grass planting were selected as adaptation measures, to lower the negative impacts of climate variability on the alpine grassland ecosystem in Northern Tibet.

J	Dauginis, AA; Brown, LC				Dauginis, Alicia A.; Brown, Laura C.			Recent changes in pan-Arctic sea ice, lake ice, and snow-on/off timing	CRYOSPHERE												Arctic snow and ice cover are vital indicators of climate variability and change, yet while the Arctic shows overall warming and dramatic changes in snow and ice cover, the response of these high-latitude regions to recent climatic change varies regionally. Although previous studies have examined changing snow and ice separately, examining phenology changes across multiple components of the cryosphere together is important for understanding how these components and their response to climate forcing are interconnected. In this work, we examine recent changes in sea ice, lake ice, and snow together at the pan-Arctic scale using the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System 24 km product from 1997-2019, with a more detailed regional examination from 2004-2019 using the 4 km product. We show overall that for sea ice, trends toward earlier open water (-7.7 d per decade, p<0.05) and later final freeze (10.6 d per decade, p<0.05) are evident. Trends toward earlier first snow-off (-4.9 d per decade, p<0.05), combined with trends toward earlier first snow-on (-2.8 d per decade, p<0.05), lead to almost no change in the length of the snow-free season, despite shifting earlier in the year. Sea ice-off, lake ice-off, and snow-off parameters were significantly correlated, with stronger correlations during the snow-off and ice-off season compared to the snow-on and ice-on season. Regionally, the Bering and Chukchi seas show the most pronounced response to warming, with the strongest trends identified toward earlier ice-off and later ice-on. This is consistent with earlier snow-off and lake ice-off and later snow-on and lake ice-on in west and southwest Alaska. In contrast to this, significant clustering between sea ice, lake ice, and snow-on trends in the eastern portion of the North American Arctic shows an earlier return of snow and ice. The marked regional variability in snow and ice phenology across the pan-Arctic highlights the complex relationships between snow and ice, as well as their response to climatic change, and warrants detailed monitoring to understand how different regions of the Arctic are responding to ongoing changes.

Such patterns call for mechanistic exploration within an integrative modelling framework. Lakes, especially reservoirs, are highly disturbed ecosystems, and the relationships between species diversity and ecosystem functioning likely differ from those of terrestrial ecosystems. Disturbance can have a great impact on local diversity and resource use efficiency (RUE) of phytoplankton assemblages and thereby influence these relationships. To elucidate how disturbance influences the diversity of phytoplankton and its relationship with ecosystem functioning, we analysed datasets from two groups of waterbodies (large-sized reservoirs and small-sized reservoirs) subjected to different disturbance regimes. We also investigated the mechanisms potentially underlying the relationships using structural equation modelling. A unimodal relationship between species richness and productivity was found in large-sized reservoirs and in small-sized reservoirs in dry seasons, while a positive linear relationship was detected in small-sized reservoirs in wet seasons. Cyanobacteria dominance increased the RUE of phytoplankton and decreased its evenness more significantly in large-sized reservoirs than in small reservoirs. The effects of water temperature and resources availability (TP) on species richness also changed with disturbance regimes. Disturbance is an important factor modifying the responses of phytoplankton communities to environmental gradients, and disturbance regimes at regional scale can largely shape the relationship between phytoplankton diversity and ecosystem functioning.

However, there is limited information available regarding the compositional distribution, bioaccumulation, and associated health and environmental risks of pyrethroids in the aquaculture areas of Eastern China. This study investigated the residues, distribution, and risk assessment of pyrethroids including deltamethrin, permethrin, fenvalerate, cypermethrin and bifenthrin in Yangcheng Lake using solid- phase extraction and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The risk assessment of water, sediment, and aquatic products of Yangcheng Lake was conducted using various evaluation methods. The results revealed that pyrethroids were found at higher levels in both water and sediment in Yangcheng Lake with some seasonal variations observed in their distribution patterns. Compared with other watersheds in China, typical aquaculture areas of the Yangtze River Delta showed higher detection rates and quantities of pyrethroid pesticides. Ecological risk assessments indicated high risks to the environment from all five tested pyrethroids at Yangcheng Lake; deltamethrin posed the highest risk among them. Dietary assessment results showed no risks associated with aquatic products from Yangcheng Lake but drinking water at certain sites presented unacceptable health risks.

The Impact of Human-Induced Climate Change on Regional Drought in the Horn of Africa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A severe drought hit the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) in 2014, but it remains unclear whether this extreme event was attributable to anthropogenic climate change or part of longer-term natural cycles. Precipitation patterns are known to be changing across the GHA, but trajectories in land surface variables are much less well known. We simulated the GHA land surface environment to assess the balance between natural cycles and human-induced climate change. Using a new form of event attribution study where we focused on both climate variables and also directly simulated land surface variables, we combined publicly volunteered distributed computing with land surface simulations to quantify land surface responses. Uncertainty was quantified both for climate model and land surface model outputs. We identified two distinct "drought trajectories" in the GHA bimodal seasonality area during the March-May (Long Rains season) of 2014. Human-induced climate change may have resulted in regions from Lake Nalubaale (Lake Victoria) to Northern Kenya receiving less precipitation in this season and having up to 20% higher probability of drought-level evapotranspiration rates (increasing drought). In contrast, the simulated anthropogenic climate change signal for this season induced somewhat wetter conditions and up to 20% lower probability of drought-level evapotranspiration in Eastern Ethiopia, Southern Somalia, and coastal Kenya (decreasing drought). Uncertainties in our modeling system varied by region and variable of focus, but broadly we found that land surface simulation uncertainty neither added significantly to climate model uncertainty nor significantly reduced it.

Flexible genomic island conservation across freshwater and marine Methylophilaceae	ISME JOURNAL												The evolutionary trajectory of Methylophilaceae includes habitat transitions from freshwater sediments to freshwater and marine pelagial that resulted in genome reduction (genome-streamlining) of the pelagic taxa. However, the extent of genetic similarities in the genomic structure and microdiversity of the two genome-streamlined pelagic lineages (freshwater "Ca. Methylopumilus" and the marine OM43 lineage) has so far never been compared. Here, we analyzed complete genomes of 91 "Ca. Methylopumilus" strains isolated from 14 lakes in Central Europe and 12 coastal marine OM43 strains. The two lineages showed a remarkable niche differentiation with clear species-specific differences in habitat preference and seasonal distribution. On the other hand, we observed a synteny preservation in their genomes by having similar locations and types of flexible genomic islands (fGIs). Three main fGIs were identified: a replacement fGI acting as phage defense, an additive fGI harboring metabolic and resistance-related functions, and a tycheposon containing nitrogen-, thiamine-, and heme-related functions. The fGIs differed in relative abundances in metagenomic datasets suggesting different levels of variability ranging from strain-specific to population-level adaptations. Moreover, variations in one gene seemed to be responsible for different growth at low substrate concentrations and a potential biogeographic separation within one species. Our study provides a first insight into genomic microdiversity of closely related taxa within the family Methylophilaceae and revealed remarkably similar dynamics involving mobile genetic elements and recombination between freshwater and marine family members.

We present a simple calculation algorithm to separate open-water CH4 fluxes measured with automatic chambers into diffusion-and ebullition-derived components. This helps to reveal underlying dynamics, to identify potential environmental drivers and, thus, to calculate reliable CH4 emission estimates. The flux separation is based on identification of ebullition-related sudden concentration changes during single measurements. Therefore, a variable ebullition filter is applied, using the lower and upper quartile and the interquartile range (IQR). Automation of data processing is achieved by using an established R script, adjusted for the purpose of CH4 flux calculation. The algorithm was validated by performing a laboratory experiment and tested using flux measurement data (July to September 2013) from a former fen grassland site, which converted into a shallow lake as a result of rewetting. Ebullition and diffusion contributed equally (46 and 55 %) to total CH4 emissions, which is comparable to ratios given in the literature. Moreover, the separation algorithm revealed a concealed shift in the diurnal trend of diffusive fluxes throughout the measurement period. The water temperature gradient was identified as one of the major drivers of diffusive CH4 emissions, whereas no significant driver was found in the case of erratic CH4 ebullition events.					; Hagemann, Ulrike/K-1882-2012; S, T/AIC-1764-2022; Hoffmann, Mathias/LOR-4712-2024	Sachs, Torsten/0000-0002-9959-4771; Hagemann, Ulrike/0000-0001-5655-8917; Hoffmann, Mathias/0000-0002-2776-1403; Sommer, Michael/0000-0003-3673-6063													1867-1381	1867-8548				JAN 6	2017	10	1					109	118		10.5194/amt-10-109-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-109-2017													WOS:000391281800002

This study aims to compare local environmental conditions, fish species abundance and diversity between paired cage and control stations at four locations over 9 months (n = 72) in Lake Victoria, Kenya. The study sites were arrayed along a limnological gradient from eutrophic waters within Winam Gulf, to more oligotrophic waters off Mfangano Island. It was hypothesized that nutrient loading, fish biomass, and species diversity would be higher at the cages than within control areas. Water quality variables were measured at 1 m depth and fish sampled using replicate sets of monofilament gillnets. A principal components analysis reduced our dataset into two significant PCs; PC1, which accounts for eutrophication and PC2, which reflects seasonal variability. Two-way analysis of variance tests on PC1 and PC2 scores found no significant differences between paired cage-control stations at any site. Significant differences between sites confirmed a strong gradient in eutrophication and variability, decreasing from the inner gulf to the open lake (PC1, F-Site = 139.426, p < .001; PC2, F-Site = 10.675, p < .001). Water transparency ranged from 0.38 (SD 0.09) to 2.65 (SD 0.4) m, increasing with distance from the inner gulf. Mean monthly fish biomass was higher near cages than controls (F-Station = 6.517, p < .05). Seventeen species across eight families were recorded. Fish species were more abundant and diverse in the inner gulf with some species significantly more abundant near cages than near controls. The findings failed to show significantly degraded water quality near cage aquaculture farms compared to control areas. This suggests that cage farms positioned in deep high-flow lake areas can act as both a refugia from fishing pressure and a submerged structure for shelter and foraging for threatened endemic fishes.					; Nyamweya, Chrispine/I-5429-2019	Nyamweya, Chrispine/0000-0002-7135-7379; Okechi, John/0000-0002-2561-8080; Peoples, Nicholas/0000-0002-3781-6295														2578-4854				NOV	2022	4	11								10.1111/csp2.12826	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/csp2.12826		OCT 2022											WOS:000864687900001

Using physically based arguments, we refine the transfer of wind energy to basin-scale internal waves (BSIWs). We consider the properties of the basin, the characteristics of the wind time series and the stability of the water column to filter and thereby optimize the magnitude of wind energy transferred to BSIWs. We show that this filtering procedure can significantly improve the accuracy of modelled temperatures, especially in the deep water of lakes such as Lake Geneva, for which the root mean square error between observed and simulated temperatures was reduced by up to 40 %. The modification, tested on four different lakes, increases model accuracy and contributes to a significantly better reproduction of seasonal deep convective mixing, a fundamental parameter for biogeochemical processes such as oxygen depletion. It also improves modelling over long time series for the purpose of climate change studies.

Copious studies assessed OPEs in various environmental media. However, there is limited summative information about OPEs in drinking water. This review provides comprehensive data for the analytical methods, occurrence, sources, and risk assessment of OPEs in drinking water. In general, liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction are the most common methods in the extraction of OPEs from drinking water, while gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are the most commonly used instrumental methods for detecting OPEs in drinking water. On the basis of these techniques, a variety of methods on OPEs pretreatment and determination have been developed to know the pollution situation of OPEs. Studies on the occurrence of OPEs in drinking water show that the total concentrations of OPEs vary seasonally and regionally, with tris(1-chloro-2-isopropyl) phosphate and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate dominant among different kinds of drinking water. Source identification studies show that there are three main sources of OPEs in drinking water: 1) source water contamination; 2) residual in drinking water treatment process; 3) leakage from device or pipeline. Besides, risk assessments indicate that individual and total OPEs pose no or negligible health risk to human, but this result may be significantly underestimated. Finally, the current knowledge gaps on the research of OPEs in drinking water are discussed and some suggestions are provided for future environmental research.

Oxygen impacts sulfur cycling through the oxidation of sulfide minerals and the production of sulfate for microbial sulfate reduction (MSR). The isotopic signature of sulfur species preserved in the geologic record is affected by the prevailing biological and chemical processes and can therefore be used to constrain past oxygen and sulfate concentrations. Here, in a study of a late Archean analogue, we find that the sulfur isotopic signature in the water column of a seasonally stratified lake in southern China is influenced by MSR, whereas model results indicate that the isotopic signature of the underlying sediments can be best explained by concurrent sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation. These data demonstrate that small apparent sulfur isotope fractionations (delta S-34(sulfate-AVS) = 4.2 parts per thousand-1.5 parts per thousand; AVS-acid volatile sulfides) can be caused by dynamic sulfur cycling at millimolar sulfate concentrations. This is in contrast to current interpretations of the isotopic record and indicates that small fractionations do not necessarily indicate very low sulfate or oxygen.

The flood series were acquired by annual and seasonal maximum flow (AMF) sampling and peaks-over-threshold (POT) sampling. Nonstationarity and uncertainty were analysed using kernel density estimation and the bootstrap resampling methods. Using the relationships between flood indices and climate indices, i.e. El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the potential causes of flooding were investigated. The results indicate that (1) the magnitudes of annual and seasonal AMF- and POT-based sampled floods generally exhibit an increasing tendency; (2) the highest occurrence rates of floods identified were during the 1990s, when the flood-affected crop area, flood-damaged crop area and crop failure area reached the highest levels; and (3) ENSO and IOD are the major climate indices that significantly correlate with the magnitude and frequency of floods of the following year.					; SINGH, VIJAY/ACV-1417-2022; Liu, Jianyu/C-9564-2019	Shi, Peijun/0000-0002-2968-7331; Gu, Xihui/0000-0002-1924-9282; Liu, Jianyu/0000-0002-8150-5312													0262-6667	2150-3435					2017	62	11					1809	1824		10.1080/02626667.2017.1349909	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2017.1349909													WOS:000407513700008

G.; Costa, Alexandre C.; de Souza Filho, Francisco de Assis; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo			Understanding the Water Quality Dynamics in a Large Tropical Reservoir Under Hydrological Drought Conditions	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Severe drought is widely recognized for its impact on water quantity, but its equally consequential role in degrading water quality often goes understudied. This issue significantly complicates reservoir management, especially in multi-purpose reservoirs, which face potential conflicts between the water users during periods of reduced water availability. Despite numerous studies addressing water quality, there is limited data availability regarding the unique dynamics observed in semiarid regions. To address this research gap, an extensive data collection effort was conducted in a semiarid region reservoir serving multiple functions, including human consumption, irrigation, and fish farming. The primary objective was to establish a comprehensive database encompassing critical water quality parameters, facilitating an in-depth exploration of spatio-temporal water quality dynamics during a hydrological drought. The findings are expected to provide a solid scientific foundation for informed water management practices during severe droughts. Notably, the study reveals distinctive water quality dynamics in semi-arid regions. Monthly assessments confirm complete nutrient mixing within the studied reservoir, with temporal variations surpassing spatial ones, suggesting the applicability of complete-mixing models in future investigations. Additionally, the research underscores the prevalence of chemical stratification in dissolved oxygen levels over thermal stratification, with dissolved oxygen declining downstream, particularly during the rainy season. In summary, this study offers a comprehensive understanding of water quality dynamics in a reservoir experiencing significant degradation during a hydrological drought, highlighting the vulnerability of semiarid reservoirs to water quality decline during such periods. These insights hold substantial importance for enhancing management strategies and mitigating water conflicts in similar tropical reservoirs, thereby contributing to the sustainable utilization of this critical resource.					; de Assis Souza Filho, Francisco/AAV-8783-2020; Costa, Alexandre/X-4942-2019; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo/B-2980-2012; Lima Neto, Iran/B-2980-2012	Costa, Alexandre Cunha/0000-0002-4771-1382; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo/0000-0001-8612-5848; Souza Filho, Francisco de Assis/0000-0001-5989-1731													0049-6979	1573-2932				JAN	2024	235	1							76	10.1007/s11270-024-06890-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-024-06890-3													WOS:001139374500001

Light and nutrient co-limitation of phytoplankton communities in a large reservoir: Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The reliance on reservoirs to meet global water demands is increasing, as is the need to develop an understanding of factors influencing water quality in these understudied water bodies. This study assessed how the interaction between light and nutrients influences phytoplanlcton dynamics in a large, heterogeneous prairie reservoir; Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan. A multiple indicator assessment of factors (light, phosphorus [P], and nitrogen [N]) influencing phytoplanlcton biomass, physiology, and gross primary productivity (GPP) was conducted. Light deficiency was assessed through the application of an indicator threshold for the mean daily mixed layer irradiance as well as the ratio of this irradiance to the light saturation parameter derived from photosynthesis-irradiance curves. Short-term physiological assays and long-term compositional nutrient status indicators were applied to assess the in situ nutrient deficiency of the epilimnetic phytoplankton communities. We observed regional differences in light conditions and nutrient chemistry related to incoming flow and nutrient load from the South Saskatchewan River. Light deficiency was detected 59% of the times measured during the open-water season of 2013. Both GPP and quantum efficiency of photosystem II (phi(PSII)) were relatively high (108 +/- 101 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1) and 0.57 +/- 0.07, respectively) across all regions and months. During conditions of light sufficiency, there was no evidence of N deficiency, and P was the limiting nutrient to phytoplankton communities 90% of the times measured. Nutrient use efficiency and GPP rates were significantly higher under light sufficient conditions. The asynchrony of light and nutrient supply influences production and biomass accrual in this reservoir.

Influence of ice-sheet geometry and supraglacial lakes on seasonal ice-flow variability	CRYOSPHERE												Supraglacial lakes play an important role in establishing hydrological connections that allow lubricating seasonal meltwater to reach the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Here we use new surface velocity observations to examine the influence of supraglacial lake drainages and surface melt rate on ice flow. We find large, spatially extensive speedups concurrent with times of lake drainage, showing that lakes play a key role in modulating regional ice flow. While surface meltwater is supplied to the bed via a geographically sparse network of moulins, the observed ice-flow enhancement suggests that this meltwater spreads widely over the ice-sheet bed. We also find that the complex spatial pattern of speedup is strongly determined by the combined influence of bed and surface topography on subglacial water flow. Thus, modeling of ice-sheet basal hydrology likely will require knowledge of bed topography resolved at scales (sub-kilometer) far finer than existing data (several km).

The potential of high-frequency profiling to assess vertical and seasonal patterns of phytoplankton dynamics in lakes: an extension of the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model	INLAND WATERS												The use of high-frequency sensors on profiling buoys to investigate physical, chemical, and biological processes in lakes is increasing rapidly. Profiling buoys with automated winches and sensors that collect high-frequency chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) profiles in 11 lakes in the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) allowed the study of the vertical and temporal distribution of ChlF, including the formation of subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SSCM). The effectiveness of 3 methods for sampling phytoplankton distributions in lakes, including (1) manual profiles, (2) single-depth buoys, and (3) profiling buoys were assessed. High-frequency ChlF surface data and profiles were compared to predictions from the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model. The depth-integrated ChlF dynamics measured by the profiling buoy data revealed a greater complexity that neither conventional sampling nor the generalized PEG model captured. Conventional sampling techniques would have missed SSCM in 7 of 11 study lakes. Although surface-only ChlF data underestimated average water column ChlF, at times by nearly 2-fold in 4 of the lakes, overall there was a remarkable similarity between surface and mean water column data. Contrary to the PEG model's proposed negligible role for physical control of phytoplankton during the growing season, thermal structure and light availability were closely associated with ChlF seasonal depth distribution. Thus, an extension of the PEG model is proposed, with a new conceptual framework that explicitly includes physical metrics to better predict SSCM formation in lakes and highlight when profiling buoys are especially informative.					; Montero, William/ABG-7984-2020; Huot, Yannick/B-4497-2008; Eckert, Werner/AAP-9335-2021; Staehr, Peter/J-3693-2013; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Pomati, Francesco/G-2367-2010; Staehr, Peter Anton Upadhyay/S-6110-2018	Eckert, Werner/0000-0002-2361-6911; Knoll, Lesley/0000-0003-0347-5979; Huot, Yannick/0000-0003-1793-761X; Colom Montero, William/0000-0002-2035-2498; Staehr, Peter Anton Upadhyay/0000-0002-1580-4875; Isles, Peter/0000-0003-4446-6788; de Eyto, Elvira/0000-0003-2281-2491													2044-2041	2044-205X					2016	6	4					565	580		10.5268/IW-6.4.890	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-6.4.890													WOS:000388608700009

The Shaluli Mountains, located in a biological hotspot, is an important breeding site for the central population of the black-necked crane, but its population size and distribution, as well as shifts in distribution under climatic change, remain unknown. Therefore, we conducted a field survey and modeled the breeding black-necked crane habitat with a species distribution model in the region. The results showed that the number of breeding black-necked cranes in the area was about 200, and they were mainly distributed in a gentle meadow and wetland along the lake. Climate change will increase the potentially suitable habitat area, with a trend of northwestward expansion and upward migration, as well as an increase in habitat suitability and connectivity. In addition, more conservation gaps will arise, but the conservation role of existing protected areas will not decline. Therefore, we suggest strengthening the long-term monitoring of black-necked cranes and wetland resources in this area. Climate change is affecting biodiversity by altering the geographical distribution range of species, and this effect is amplified in climate-sensitive areas. Studying the geographic distribution of flagship species in response to climate change is important for the long-term conservation of species and the maintenance of regional biodiversity. Therefore, we collected field survey records from 2016 to 2020 and conducted field surveys of black-necked cranes in the Shaluli Mountains (SLLMs) in May-June and August-October 2021; 103 breeding records were acquired totally, and the geographical distribution range under the current and four future climate scenarios was modeled with the MaxEnt model to predict the impact of climate change on its distribution and habitat quality. The results showed that 152 black-necked cranes were surveyed in seven counties of SLLMs in total; the estimated number of black-necked cranes in the entire SLLMs was about 200. The currently suitable habitat area is 27,122 km(2), mainly distributed in gentle meadows and wetland habitats along the lake where the Annual Mean Temperature is -1 degrees C and the Mean Diurnal Range (16 degrees C) and Precipitation Seasonality (105) are comparatively large. Furthermore, the breeding range would expand to varying degrees under future climate scenarios and showed a migration trend toward the northwest and higher elevation. Besides, as time goes by, the habitat for black-necked cranes in SLLMs would become more homogeneous and more suitable. The conservation effectiveness of the existing reserve network would keep stable with climate change, although there are large conservation gaps between protected areas, and these gaps will gradually expand over time. Overall, this study provides a preliminary understanding of the population and distribution and predicts the future distribution of black-necked cranes in the SLLMs. It also demonstrates the importance of SLLMs for protecting the central population of black-necked cranes and maintaining regional biodiversity. Therefore, we recommend long-term monitoring and conservation of the black-necked crane population and wetland resources in the region.					li, mingming/KXR-5760-2024	Zhang, Taxing/0000-0003-2014-4856													2076-2615					OCT	2022	12	19							2594	10.3390/ani12192594	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12192594								36230335					WOS:000866591500001

However, few studies have been performed on the effects of different fertilizations in upland-cropping soil. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of different fertilizations on the distribution and diversity of anammox and n-damo bacteria along the profiles of soil during wheat cropping season of the paddy-upland rotation system. In our study, a five-year fertilization (from 2010 to 2015) was conducted on a paddy-upland rotation field, with four fertilizer treatments: an unfertilized control (CK), chemical fertilizer (CF), pig manure plus 50% chemical fertilizer (PMCF), and rice straw plus 100% chemical fertilizer (SRCF). The quantitative PCR results showed that the total abundance of anammox and n-damo bacteria during the wheat cropping season were lower than those reported previously in paddy soils, and the abundance of anammox bacteria decreased with soil depth, but the abundance of n-damo bacteria remarkably increased. Long-term fertilization reduced the abundance of anammox bacteria in the 040 cm layer and that of n-damo bacteria in the 20-60 cm layer. Furthermore, Illumina high-throughput sequencing of the hzsB and pmoA genes was performed, showing that anammox bacteria were affiliated with "Candidatus Brocadia" and n-damo bacteria were related to "Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera." Diversity analysis demonstrated that the diversity of anammox bacteria increased with soil depth. Among the fertilizer treatments evaluated, pig manure plus 50% chemical fertilizer (PMCF) yielded the highest abundance and lowest diversity of anammox bacteria in the 20-60 cm layer. Moreover, fertilization diversified the community structure of anammox bacteria in deep soil. For n-damo bacteria, a higher diversity was found under chemical fertilization than under other treatments. Redundancy analysis showed that the community structure of anammox was mainly related to of total nitrogen and soil organic carbon and that of n-damo bacteria was mainly associated with NO(3)(-)content. Overall, soil depth and fertilization patterns influenced the distribution and diversity of anammox and n-damo bacteria by changing the soil properties. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Michael			A semelparous fish continues upstream migration when exposed to alarm cue, but adjusts movement speed and timing	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												Animals make trade-offs between predation risk and pursuit of opportunities such as foraging and reproduction. Trade-offs between antipredator behaviours and foraging are well suited to manipulation in laboratory and field settings and have generated a vast compendium of knowledge. However, much less is known about how animals manage trade-offs between predation risk and pursuit of reproductive opportunities in the absence of the confounding effects of foraging. In the present study, we investigated how the nonfeeding migratory life stage of sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, responds to odour from dead conspecifics (a cue that induces avoidance behaviours in laboratory and field studies). We released groups of PIT-tagged sea lamprey 65 m from the shore of Lake Michigan or 287 m upstream in Carp Lake River and used antennas to detect their movements in the river. As the breeding season progressed, sea lamprey initiated upstream movement earlier and were more likely to enter the river. Sea lamprey that began the night in Lake Michigan entered Carp Lake River at higher rates and accelerated upstream when exposed to high concentrations of alarm cue, consistent with animals attempting to minimize time spent in risky areas. Sea lampreys that began the night in the river delayed upstream movement when exposed to alarm cue, consistent with animals sheltering and gathering information about a source of risk. We attribute this context-specific reaction to alarm cue to differences in perceived vulnerability to predation in sheltered positions in the river versus exposed positions in the lake. Once in the river, the vast majority of sea lamprey moved upstream independent of alarm cue or Julian date. Although life-history-induced time and energy budgets place rigid constraints on the direction of migration, sea lamprey attend to predation risk by modifying movement timing and speed.

However, overuse has led to accumulation of P and increased the risk of environmental pollution. In this study, we investigated the effects of four P fertilization regimes in paddy soils at two field stations (CS1 and CS2) during four years of a rice-wheat cropping system. The fertilization regimes were as follows: P fertilization only during the wheat-growing season (PW), P fertilization only during the rice-growing season (PR), P fertilization during both the rice- and wheat-growing seasons (PR + W, current farming practice), and no P fertilization during either season (Pzero, control). The PW treatment did not reduce crop yield in either CS1 or CS2 compared to the PR + W. Moreover, soil Olsen-P concentrations during each rice-wheat rotation were maintained, and a positive increase in phosphate utilization efficiency by 1.2-3.6% (p > 0.05) was observed over the four rice-wheat rotations. In contrast, the PR treatment reduced the straw and grain yield of wheat by 8.74-43.2 and 19.4-47.7%, respectively, as did the Pzero treatment by 7.21-60.0 and 19.6-84.1%, respectively (p < 0.05). During the rice season, the PW treatment showed no significant differences in P fractionation and microorganism communities compared to the PR and PR+ W treatments. The results suggest that the PW fertilization regime is suitable for rice-wheat rotation systems in agro-ecosystems such as the Taihu Lake Region of China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the possibility of surveying these communities using fish eDNA passively "captured" by aquatic biofilms. To this end, biofilm samples developing on natural and artificial substrates were collected every 2 weeks for a year and a half in a large lake (Lake Geneva). DNA was extracted from biofilms and fish communities were targeted using a standard 12S barcode with a metabarcoding approach. The fish eDNA signal recovered from biofilms revealed temporal and spatial changes in fish communities. These changes were linked to fish habitat preferences and spawning season. Peaks in the eDNA signal of some taxa fitted with their spawning period reported in the literature. We evidenced that the nature of the biofilm's substrate (natural or artificial) does not affect the image obtained of the fish community composition. Furthermore, by using biofilms grown on artificial substrates, the studied temporal window of the eDNA signal can be controlled. With biofilms acting as environmental passive samplers, our results open up the possibility to accurately monitor fish communities and their temporal and spatial changes with eDNA in a faster and less expensive way than with the classical water filtration approach.

This study explores the changes in the surface water area in the ASB based on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Then, we integrate multi-source data to identify 1559 lakes and 196 reservoirs from the Joint Research Centre Global Surface Water (JRC GSW) dataset. Our results indicate that the lake area (34,999.61 km(2)) is about 10 times that of the reservoir area (3879.08 km(2)) in the ASB. The total area of surface water in the ASB decreased by 23,194.35 km(2) or 34.58% from 1992 to 2020. Specifically, the areas of permanent water shrunk at a rate of 1278.6 km(2)/year, while the areas of seasonal water increased at a rate of 522.5 km(2)/year. The proportion of lakes and reservoirs in the total surface water has decreased from 79.33% (during 1992-2000) to 75.21% (during 2000-2010) to 63.94% (during 2010-2020). The water that should have flowed into the Aral Sea to maintain its permanent water may have been converted into two parts. Part of it might continue to be permanent water but show up in other regions, while part of it might convert to seasonal water (especially in the Aral Sea itself and the ASB plain area). Our study bridges the limitations of previous studies that have ignored seasonal water change and builds a water area list for 1755 lakes/reservoirs (=0.1 km(2)) for the first time. The results can serve as important knowledge for water resource management and sustainable river basin development in ASB.

J	Gilany, N; Iqbal, J				Gilany, Naseem; Iqbal, Javed			Geospatial analysis and simulation of glacial lake outburst flood hazard in Shyok Basin of Pakistan	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Upper Indus Basin (UIB) is prone to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Physical monitoring of such a large area on regular basis is a challenging task especially when the temporal and spatial extent of the hazard is highly variable. The study has been conducted in the Shyok sub-basin of UIB, where there are several human settlements which are endangered due to the GLOF hazard. Sudden breaches in the unstable moraine dams adjoining receding glaciers may occur because of rapid and huge accumulation of turbulent water in the glacial lakes. The purpose of this study was to map the two potentially dangerous glacial lakes and simulate the associated hazard in the downward settlements using HEC-RAS in the GIS environment using Landsat 7 remote sensing data. The ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is utilized to detect flow accumulation of glacial hazard involving slope, elevation, and orientation of the mountain glaciers. The study results have revealed that settlements of the Shyok Basin are threatened by the GLOF hazard. Keeping in view the seasonal growth of the two potentially dangerous glacial lakes of the Shyok Basin, a low discharge of 100 m(3)/s from both lakes can affect 20%, whereas a moderate discharge of 300 m(3)/s and a high discharge of 500 m(3)/s, respectively, can impact 30% and 40% of the Barah village habitat. The results of the study can provide a platform for the establishment of an early warning and monitoring system to minimize the impact of future GLOFs.

J	Chen, LF; Li, YB; Liu, C; Guo, LN; Wang, XL				Chen, Lufeng; Li, Yanbin; Liu, Chang; Guo, Lina; Wang, Xiulin			Wet deposition of mercury in Qingdao, a coastal urban city in China: Concentrations, fluxes, and influencing factors	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant of public concern because of its high toxicity and capability for worldwide distribution via long-range atmospheric transportation. Wet atmospheric deposition is an important source of Hg in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Concentrations of various Hg species in precipitation were monitored from March 2016 to February 2017 in a coastal urban area of Qingdao, and their wet deposition fluxes were estimated. The results showed that the volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentrations of total mercury (THg), reactive mercury (RHg), dissolved THg (DTHg), particulate THg (PTHg), total methyhnercury (TMeHg), and dissolved and particulate MeHg (DMeHg and PMeHg) in Qingdao's precipitation were 13.6, 1.5, 5.4, 8.2, 0.38, 0.15, and 0.22 ng L-1, respectively, and their annual deposition fluxes were estimated to be 5703.0 (THg), 666.6 (RHg), 2304.0 (DTHg), 3470.4 (PTHg), 161.6 (TMeHg), 64.0 (DMeHg), and 95.7 (PMeHg) ng m(-2) y(-1), respectively. A relatively high proportion of MeHg in THg was observed in precipitation (3.0 +/- 2.6%) possibly due to higher methylation and contributions from an oceanic source to MeHg in the precipitation. Obvious seasonal variations in Hg concentrations and deposition fluxes were observed in the precipitation in Qingdao. Correlation analyses and multiple regression analyses showed that SO2, pH, and NO3- were the controlling factors for THg in precipitation, whereas the MeHg concentration was primarily controlled by the SO2, WS, Cl-, and THg concentrations. PM2.5 and Cl- were the major controlling factors for PMeHg/TMeHg, whereas the TMeHg/THg ratio was mainly influenced by Cl-. The THg and MeHg fluxes were primarily controlled by precipitation, whereas Cl- was also an important factor for the MeHg wet deposition flux. The results of a 72-h backward trajectory analysis in the study region with the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model indicated that Hg deposition in Qingdao mainly originated from four major sources, i.e., the local area, northwestern China, southeastern China and an oceanic source. This oceanic source is an important source of Hg (especially MeHg) in the precipitation in Qingdao.																			1352-2310	1873-2844				FEB	2018	174						204	213		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.11.059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.11.059													WOS:000423888400020
J	Lemay, MA; Russello, MA				Lemay, Matthew A.; Russello, Michael A.			Genetic evidence for ecological divergence in kokanee salmon	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The evolution of locally adapted phenotypes among populations that experience divergent selective pressures is a central mechanism for generating and maintaining biodiversity. Recently, the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing technology has provided tools for investigating the genetic basis of this process in natural populations of nonmodel organisms. Kokanee, the freshwater form of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), occurs as two reproductive ecotypes, which differ in spawning habitat (tributaries vs. shorelines); however, outside of the spawning season the two ecotypes co-occur in many lakes and lack diagnostic morphological characteristics. We used restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to identify 6145 SNPs and genotype kokanee from multiple spawning sites in Okanagan Lake (British Columbia, Canada). Outlier tests revealed 18 loci putatively under divergent selection between ecotypes, all of which exhibited temporally stable allele frequencies within ecotypes. Six outliers were annotated to sequences in the NCBI database, two of which matched genes associated with early development. There was no evidence for neutral genetic differentiation; however, outlier loci demonstrated significant structure with respect to ecotype and had high assignment accuracy in mixed composition simulations. The absence of neutral structure combined with a small number of highly divergent outlier loci is consistent with theoretical predictions for the early stages of ecological divergence. These outlier loci were then applied to a realistic fisheries scenario in which additional RAD sequencing was used to genotype kokanee collected by trawl in Okanagan Lake, providing preliminary evidence that this approach may be an effective tool for conservation and management.

Constrained microbial processing of allochthonous organic carbon in boreal lake sediments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated sediment bacterial metabolism in eight lakes with different inputs of allochthonous and autochthonous organic carbon in south-central Sweden. Sediment bacterial production, mineralization, and biomass were measured seasonally and along a lake depth gradient in lakes with different water and sediment characteristics. Sediment bacterial metabolism was primarily controlled by temperature but also by the quality and origin of organic carbon. Metabolism was positively correlated to measures of autochthonous influence on the sediment organic carbon, but did not show a similar increase with increasing input of allochthonous organic carbon. Hence, in contrast to what is currently known for the water column, increasing terrestrial organic carbon influence does not result in enhanced sediment bacterial metabolism. The role of allochthonous organic carbon as the main driver of sediment bacterial metabolism suggested so far is contrary to our findings. Meio- and macrobenthic invertebrate biomass were, at most, weakly correlated to bacterial metabolism and biomass, suggesting limited control of sediment bacteria by grazing. Bacterial metabolism in boreal lake sediments is constrained by low temperatures and by the recalcitrant nature of the dominant organic carbon, resulting in sediments being an effective sink of organic carbon.					; Tranvik, Lars/H-2222-2011; Steger, Kristin/F-4187-2014	Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Steger, Kristin/0000-0002-7737-0697; Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266; Premke, Katrin/0000-0001-6216-5386													0024-3590					JAN	2012	57	1					163	175		10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0163	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0163													WOS:000298321300014

The "Neglected Viruses" of Taihu: Abundant Transcripts for Viruses Infecting Eukaryotes and Their Potential Role in Phytoplankton Succession	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Drivers of algal bloom dynamics remain poorly understood, but viruses have been implicated as important players. Research addressing bloom dynamics has generally been restricted to the virus-infection of the numerically dominant (i.e. bloom forming) taxa. Yet this approach neglects a broad diversity of viral groups, limiting our knowledge of viral interactions and constraints within these systems. We examined hallmark virus marker genes in metatranscriptomic libraries from a seasonal and spatial survey of a Microcystis aeruginosa bloom in Lake Tai (Taihu) China to identify active infections by nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), RNA viruses, ssDNA viruses, bacteriophage, and virophage. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a diverse virus population with seasonal and spatial variability. We observed disproportionately high expression of markers associated with NCLDVs and ssRNA viruses (consistent with viruses that infect photosynthetic protists) relative to bacteriophage infecting heterotrophic bacteria or cyanobacteria during the height of the Microcystis bloom event. Under a modified kill-the-winner scheme, we hypothesize viruses infecting protists help suppress the photosynthetic eukaryotic community and allow for the proliferation of cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Our observations provide a foundation for a little considered factor promoting algal blooms.

The purpose of this study is to explore the process and mechanism of P release from sediments in seasonal hypoxic reservoirs. Material and methods Six sediment cores were collected from Hongfeng Reservoir, one of the largest reservoirs in southwestern China. Incubation experiments were conducted using the sediment cores under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The diffusion gradients in thin films (DGT) technique was employed to determine the concentration profiles and release characteristics of labile-P and labile-Fe at the sediment-water interface. The microbial community structure in surface sediments was determined by 16S rRNA sequencing. Results and discussion Compared with the aerobic condition, the P release flux was similar to 3.75 times under anaerobic condition, which mainly came from BD-P and NaOH-P. In addition, DGT-P and DGT-Fe were significantly positively correlated (R-2 > 0.66, p < 0.001). From 16S rRNA sequencing, SRB and PSB were shown to promote P release through sulfate reduction and P dissolution in sediments. Moreover, the control measures of internal P release are discussed due to the potential risk of it in deep-water reservoirs. Conclusion Dissolved oxygen is the key control factor of P release; thus, anaerobic conditions promoted the release of P from sediments. Fe-P reduction and dissolution are the main processes. SRB and PSB played an important role in the P cycle of sediments. It is necessary to increase oxygen in seasonal hypoxic reservoirs to reduce the risk of internal P release.					张, 瑞雪/HTP-7496-2023; Wang, Jingfu/ABG-1486-2021; He, kangkang/JCE-9920-2023	Wang, Jingfu/0000-0003-0666-6041													1439-0108	1614-7480				OCT	2021	21	10			SI		3246	3258		10.1007/s11368-021-02946-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-021-02946-7		APR 2021											WOS:000640144000001

Accumulation of Silver in Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) and Northern Pike (Esox lucius) From a Lake Dosed with Nanosilver	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A total of 15 kg of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was added continuously over two ice-free field seasons to a boreal lake (i.e., Lake 222) at the IISD Experimental Lakes Area in Canada. We monitored the accumulation of silver (Ag) in the tissues of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and northern pike (Esox lucius) exposed to the AgNPs under environmentally relevant conditions. The greatest accumulation was observed in the liver tissues of pike, and a single pike sampled in the second year of additions had the highest concentration observed in liver of 5.1 micrograms per gram of wet weight. However, the Ag concentrations in gill and muscle tissue of both pike and perch did not exceed 0.35 micrograms per gram of wet weight. Following additions of AgNP, the Ag residues in fish tissues declined, with a half-life of Ag in pike liver of 119 days. Monitoring using passive sampling devices and single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry during the AgNP addition phase confirmed that Ag nanoparticles were present in the water column and that estimated mean concentrations of Ag increased over time to a maximum of 11.5 mu g/L. These data indicate that both a forage fish and a piscivorous fish accumulated Ag in a natural lake ecosystem dosed with AgNPs, leading to Ag concentrations in some tissues of the piscivorous species that were 3 orders of magnitude greater than the concentrations in the water.					; Hintelmann, Holger/AEV-0466-2022; Paterson, Michael/AGT-8809-2022; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021	Newman, Karla/0000-0001-6400-4172; Hintelmann, Holger/0000-0002-5287-483X													0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 2	2018	52	19					11114	11122		10.1021/acs.est.8b03146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b03146								30179475					WOS:000446542100024

Can Zooplankton Add Value to Monitoring Water Quality? A Case Study of a Meso/Eutrophic Portuguese Reservoir	WATER												Despite the key role of zooplankton communities in regulating the water quality of lentic ecosystems, they are absent from the list of biological elements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) for the assessment of ecological status. Based on this, the present work was a case study that aimed to understand the relevance of zooplankton as a bioindicator for classifying the water quality of reservoirs. For one year and in each season, the water quality of the Torrao reservoir was assessed using the mandatory elements proposed by the WFD in the sampling year (second cycle) and the legislation currently applicable (third cycle). Additionally, zooplankton samples were collected to characterize the community dynamic. The water quality of the Torrao reservoir does not reach the WFD good ecological potential. Furthermore, with the updating of the criteria, the classification tends to get worse. Concerning the zooplankton, the occurrence of Cyclopoida and Bosmina are associated with lower water quality, as well as the collapse or low abundance of the Daphnia population, in the same periods. Low abundances of zooplankton are associated with better water quality, and the Shannon-Wiener diversity values decrease with the increase of the trophic state. High-efficiency feed filters and macrofiltrator organisms dominate the Torrao reservoir in all seasons, which is associated with low water quality. The Calanoida/Cyclopoida ratio shows a strong and negative association with the trophic state. The occurrence and abundance of species, Shannon-Wiener diversity, functional groups (high and low efficiency feed filters and macrofiltrators), and different ratios (large Cladocera/total Cladocera and Calanoida/Cyclopoida) are promising and valuable tools to determine the water quality status, and should be considered within the WFD metrics. Notwithstanding this, further research including reservoirs from different geographical areas with various trophic status and pressures must be analyzed.

Quickflow response to forest harvesting and recovery in a northern hardwood forest landscape	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Forest harvesting often increases catchment quickflow (QF, water delivered rapidly to the stream channel), a metric of high-flow events controlling a catchment's solute and sediment export. Nevertheless, our understanding of QF responses to various silvicultural strategies (e.g., clearcutting, selection harvest, and shelterwood harvest) is incomplete. We present a 31-year examination of QF delivery from treatment (clearcut, selection harvest, and shelterwood harvest) and control catchments in a deciduous forest landscape in central Ontario, Canada. Growing season root-zone storage capacity was estimated using a water balance approach to evaluate temporal changes in QF response to precipitation (P) for pretreatment and posttreatment periods. Threshold relationships between QF and P were assessed for control and treatment catchments for pretreatment and posttreatment periods using piecewise regression. Root-zone storage capacity demarcated shifts in the hydrologic regime arising from forest harvesting and subsequent regeneration. This was particularly pronounced for clearcutting where postharvest decline in root-zone storage capacity was followed by a rise to preharvest values. Similar pretreatment threshold relationships between QF and P, and near-identical P thresholds for producing significant QF, reflected similar soil and overburden depths in the catchments. Harvesting effects were indicated by increases in QF/P ratios for relative small P and the number of P events that generated QF, thus changing treatment QF vs. P threshold relationships. Prior to harvesting there was no significant increase in QF with P below a threshold P of 35-45 mm; however, there was a significant QF vs. P relationship below this threshold for all treatments postharvest. Clearcutting increased the number of QF events for the entire postharvest period and the first 9-year postharvest compared to the other treatments; nevertheless, evidence for intertreatment differences in total QF depth delivered from the catchments during the growing season was inconclusive. Our work suggests that changes in threshold relationships between QF and P, coupled with knowledge of the physical processes underlying them, are useful when evaluating hydrologic responses to forest harvesting.																			0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN 1	2019	33	1					47	65		10.1002/hyp.13310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13310													WOS:000453677200004

Consequently, connectivity promotes changes in food resources availability to fish. Here we tested the predictions that (a) isolated floodplain lakes have greater environmental heterogeneity than connected lakes, (b) fish diet differs more among isolated than among connected lakes and (c) trophic niche breadth of the species is smaller in isolated than in connected lakes. We used one invertivorous and one algivorous species of fish to test these two last predictions. The environmental heterogeneity (evaluated in relation to abiotic variables and the macrophyte composition) tended to be greater in isolated lakes. Diet of both species differed significantly in all isolated lakes populations, and in the majority of the populations in connected lakes; however, the main items consumed for invertivorous species were common in all connected lakes. Trophic niche breadth of the invertivorous fish was significantly greater in the connected lakes; however, the algivorous species showed no significant difference between connected and isolated lakes. Our findings suggest that connectivity can facilitate the dispersal of organisms, allowing the increase in food item richness and consequently, trophic niche breadth, as observed for invertivorous species. However, connectivity likely plays a minor role on the algivorous species, whose diet may be more affected by local conditions, such as habitat structure. Our results support the view that regional (dispersion) and local (habitat structure) factors interact with feeding habit to determine fish food composition in the floodplain lakes we studied.

However, the low use efficiency of added nutrients and organic matter may cause carp ponds to be 'hot spots' of methane (CH4) production and emission. Surface CH4 concentrations were measured and diffusive CH4 flux was estimated using a wind-based transboundary layer model in 3 nursery and 3 main carp ponds with different feeding rates and organic loading during 1 growing season. Mean (*SD) concentrations of CH4 were 1.3 +/- 0.9 pM and 0.8 +/- 0.8 pM in nursery and main ponds, respectively. All ponds were sources of CH4, with diffusive CH4 fluxes of 9.1 6.8 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in nursery ponds and 6.4 +/- 6.9 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in main ponds. Lower CH4 concentration and diffusive flux in the main ponds were probably due to bioturbation caused by the larger carp and consequent oxidation of the sediment. Seasonal dynamics of CH4 were mainly related to temperature. Methane concentration and diffusive flux levels recorded in this study were within the range of those reported in natural water bodies worldwide. Our results provide information on the role of carp aquaculture in greenhouse gas emission in temperate regions.					; Drozd, Borek/G-5034-2015; Vesely, Lukas/G-5118-2015; strunecky, otakar/M-2643-2019; Veselý, Lukáš/AAR-4875-2020; Gebauer, Radek/O-5369-2019; Hejzlar, Josef/F-8526-2014	Strunecky, Otakar/0000-0001-9735-4662; Vesely, Lukas/0000-0002-0886-4298; Gebauer, Radek/0000-0003-0894-0577; 													1869-215X	1869-7534					2019	11						19	30		10.3354/aei00296	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/aei00296													WOS:000457953300001

Exploring Space, Economy, and Interregional Interaction at a Second-Millennium B.C.E. Citadel in Central Western Anatolia: 2014-2017 Research at Kaymakci	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY												Current understandings of the archaeology of second-millennium B.C.E. central western Anatolia are enriched by ongoing research at Kaymakci, located in the Marmara Lake basin of the middle Gediz River valley in western Turkey. Discovered during regional survey in 2001, the site offers a critical node of exploration for understanding a previously unexamined period in a well-traversed geography thought to be the core of the Late Bronze Age Seha River Land known from I finite texts. Here we present results from the first three seasons of excavation on the citadel of Kaymakci plus a study season (2014-2017), introducing the site's chronology, historical and regional context, and significance through presentation of excavation areas as well as material and subsistence economies. With reference to such evidence, we discuss the site's development, organization, and interregional interactions, demonstrating its place in local and regional networks that connected Aegean and central Anatolian spheres of interest.					; Çakirlar, Canan/A-9306-2013; Marston, John/J-8248-2012; Pavuk, Peter/E-7207-2016; Roosevelt, Christopher/X-1961-2018; O'Grady, Caitlin/AAD-4500-2019; Luke, Christina/AAX-5608-2020	Scott, Catherine/0000-0003-1576-5623; Mokrisova, Jana/0000-0002-7237-1201; Cakirlar, Canan/0000-0002-7994-0091; Pavuk, Peter/0000-0002-8739-9434; Roosevelt, Christopher/0000-0002-4302-4788; Luke, Christina/0000-0003-0979-2510													0002-9114	1939-828X				OCT	2018	122	4					645	688		10.3764/aja.122.4.0645	http://dx.doi.org/10.3764/aja.122.4.0645													WOS:000469291900005

Freshwater diversity in Svalbard: providing baseline data for ecosystems in change	POLAR BIOLOGY												The high Arctic is in a rapid transition due to climate change, and both direct effects due to warming and an extended growing season, as well as an indirect effect caused by increased bird activity and density (notably geese), strongly affect ponds and lakes. Our study presents the hitherto most comprehensive data on invertebrate freshwater diversity at Svalbard and had three main purposes: to provide a current baseline of community composition, to compare current species distribution and occurrence with older data to identify changes that have already occurred, and finally to identify how diversity and community composition are related to the age of localities. To address these aims, we conducted a survey of freshwater invertebrates in 75 ponds and lakes at Svalbard in August 2014 and 2015. We provide a full report of the species' inventory data for zooplankton, benthos, and meiofauna. We also provide data for species that have likely colonized the sites over the previous decades. Finally, our study also clearly demonstrates a diversity gradient related to ecosystem age and/or parameters confounded with age (e.g., productivity), which may hint at the rate of colonization over the time span from the oldest to the youngest localities.

To better elucidate the response of bacterial communities to environmental changes, we have measured a large variety of limnetic variables and investigated bacterial community composition (BCC) and dynamics over seven consecutive years between 2003 and 2009 in mesotrophic Lake Tiefwaren (NE Germany). We separated between free-living (FL, > 0.2, < 5.0 mu m) and particle-associated (PA, > 5.0 mu m) bacteria to account for different bacterial lifestyles and to obtain a higher resolution of the microbial diversity. Changes in BCC were studied by DGGE based on PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Sequencing of DGGE bands revealed that ca. 70 % of all FL bacteria belonged to the Actinobacteria, whereas PA bacteria were dominated by Cyanobacteria (43 %). FL communities were generally less diverse and rather stable over time compared to their PA counterpart. Annual changes in reoccurring seasonal patterns of dominant freshwater bacteria were supported by statistical analyses, which revealed several significant correlations between DGGE profiles and various environmental variables, e.g. temperature and nutrients. Overall, FL bacteria were generally less affected by environmental changes than members of the PA fraction. Close association of PA bacteria with phytoplankton and zooplankton suggests a tight coupling of PA bacteria to organisms of higher trophic levels. Our results indicate substantial differences in bacterial lifestyle of pelagic freshwater bacteria, which are reflected by contrasting seasonal dynamics and relationships to a number of environmental variables.

Nevertheless, the ecology and factors influencing the spatial distribution of many fishes within the lake remain poorly understood. Using commercial fishing lot catch data from 1994/1995 to 1999/2000, fishing seasons and environmental data (land cover and bioclimatic variables), we describe spatial distribution of the eight most commercially important fish species, and investigate the effects of environmental factors on their distributions in the TSL. We found a strong variability in fish biomass across areas and between species. Specifically, Channa micropeltes was most abundant in the southern and northern sections of the TSL. Channa striata and Trichopodus microlepis were more common in the northern part of the TSL. Cyclocheilos enoplos, Barbonymus gonionotus, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, and Gymnostomus spp. were abundant in the southern areas of the TSL while Phalacronotus spp. were abundant in few areas in both the north and the south. Flooded forest positively explained the variation in the biomass of P.hypophthalmus, C. striata, C. enopolos, and Phalacronotus spp. Likewise, the lake's open water positively affects the biomass of P.hypophthalmus, C. enopolos, and Phalacronotus spp., while the agricultural field negatively impacts Gymnostomus spp. biomass distribution. We also found that some areas consistently hosted high fish biomass (e.g., lot 2, Kampong Thom; lot 6, Pursat; lot 2, Battambang, etc.). We, therefore, suggest that fisheries management and conservation planning focus on those areas, considering those areas significance as core fish habitat and important for catching fish.

In this study, the following sediment characteristics were investigated in the lake area, the natural supply area, and the lake drainage area: mineral composition; particle size distribution; magnetic susceptibility; nutrient content; content of isotopes delta C-13(org) and delta N-15; and content of heavy metals and of metallic oxides. The results showed that silicate minerals quartz, orthoclase, and anorthose were abundant in the whole lake water system. Quartz accumulated more easily in the lake area, while carbonate masses in the lake mainly came from the Huolinhe River. Moving from the lake area to the water diversion and drainage areas, fine particles clearly decreased, while coarse particles significantly increased due to the increase in hydraulic erosion. The main sources of nutrients and of organic matter are: the residual of the drainage from the Qianguo irrigated areas; the surrounding villages and the tourist area; and the decomposition of aquatic organisms. A large number of anthropogenic heavy metals, such as Hg, Cu, and As, were accumulated in the artificial water diversion area and in the farmland drainage area. This study indicates that recovering the original connected water system during the wet season, while at the same time enhancing water supply during the dry season could improve the ecological quality of Chagan Lake.

Yet ecological impacts caused by the migration, such as altered predator-prey interactions and effects on community structure, remain poorly understood. This is to a large extent due to the scarcity of naturally replicated migration systems with negative controls, that is, ecosystems without migration. In this study, we tested whether partial migration of certain species within the overall prey community affects foraging ecology of top predators and thereby alters energy pathways in food webs. We carried out the study in independent replicated freshwater lake systems, four with and four without opportunity for prey migration. Specifically, we compared predator foraging mode in lakes where cyprinid prey fish perform seasonal partial migrations into connected streams with lakes lacking migratory opportunities for prey fish. We found clear seasonal bottom-up effects of prey migration on predators, including changes in size structure and total biomass of ingested prey, size-specific changes in littoral versus pelagic origin of diet, and a higher degree of feast-and-famine for predators in systems with migratory prey. Our analyses further showed that partially migratory prey species constitute a larger part of the prey community in systems that allow migration. Hence, prey migrations have important implications for predator foraging ecology and may cause seasonal shifts in the importance of their supporting energy pathways. We suggest that such bottom-up effects of partial migration may be a widespread phenomenon both in aquatic and in terrestrial ecosystems.					; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019; Baktoft, Henrik/E-6581-2011; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014	Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; Baktoft, Henrik/0000-0002-3644-4960; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835													1432-9840	1435-0629				MAR	2020	23	2					292	306		10.1007/s10021-019-00402-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00402-9													WOS:000520408600005

Landsat-based assessments of surface water, such as the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset developed by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC), may not capture important changes in surface water during months with considerable cloud cover. This results in large temporal gaps in the Landsat record that prevent the accurate assessment of surface water dynamics. Here we show that the frequent global acquisitions by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensors can compensate for this shortcoming, and in addition allow for the examination of surface water changes at fine temporal resolution. To account for water bodies smaller than a MODIS cell, we developed a global rule-based regression model for estimating the surface water fraction from a 500m nadir reflectance product from MODIS (MCD43A4). The model was trained and evaluated with the GSW monthly water history dataset. A high estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 11.41 %, and MAE = 6.39 %) was achieved. We then applied the algorithm to 18 years of MODIS data (2000-2017) to generate a time series of surface water fraction maps at an 8 d interval for the Mediterranean. From these maps we derived metrics including the mean annual maximum, the standard deviation, and the seasonality of surface water. The dynamic surface water extent estimates from MODIS were compared with the results from GSW and water level data measured in situ or by satellite altimetry, yielding similar temporal patterns. Our dataset complements surface water products at a fine spatial resolution by adding more temporal detail, which permits the effective monitoring and assessment of the seasonal, inter-annual, and long-term variability of water resources, inclusive of small water bodies.					; Skidmore, Andrew/C-7441-2011; Wang, Tiejun/A-4671-2010; Vrieling, Anton/B-2639-2012	Vrieling, Anton/0000-0002-7979-1540; Wang, Tiejun/0000-0002-1138-8464; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				JUL 17	2019	23	7					3037	3056		10.5194/hess-23-3037-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3037-2019													WOS:000475763300003

These include diel and seasonal changes in irradiance, and changes stemming from vertical mixing over the light field. In algal mass cultures and photobioreactors, similar changes take place as cultures grow denser and as cells are mixed rapidly in the system. To survive supraoptimal, free-radical-generating irradiance levels as well as prolonged exposure to dim light, phytoplankton species are capable of photoacclimation. Under low light, light-harvesting pigments such as phycobilins, chlorophylls, fucoxanthin and peridinin increase all the way to optically becoming black cells. The same pigments decrease under high light, resulting in cells being rather transparent. The opposite takes place with the photoprotective pigments beta-carotene and astaxanthin and the elements of the xanthophyll cycle, all of which increase whenever cells are exposed to high irradiance levels, concomitant with enhanced activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxydismutase, and peroxidase. These processes are complemented by up to 5-fold changes in RUBISCO per photosystem unit (PSU) levels, and parallel changes in light-saturated photosynthetic rates. Thus, light-harvesting and utilization efficiencies are maximized under low light, whereas photosynthetic carbon assimilation and throughput rates reach their peak values whenever light is sufficiently high. Maximal photosynthesis and growth rates have to be matched by correspondingly high respiration rates, Photoacclimation can be used to optimize biomass and target product yields in biotechnological applications.																			0948-3055	1616-1564					2009	56	2-3			2		163	176		10.3354/ame01345	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01345													WOS:000270467800006

Experimental modeling of thaw lake water evolution in discontinuous permafrost zone: Role of peat, lichen leaching and ground fire	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Thaw of frozen peat in discontinuous permafrost zone produces a significant number of thermokarst lakes, which are known to contribute to Green House Gases (GHG) emission in the atmosphere. In palsa peatland of western Siberia, the thermokarst lake formation includes soil subsidences, lichen submergence and peat abrasion, leading to lateral spreading of the lake border, often intensified by ground fires. Mesocosm experiments were conducted during 3 weeks on tWo thermokarst lake waters interacting in 30-L tanks with surface horizon of peat, the dominant ground vegetation (lichen Cladonia sp.) and the ash produced by lichen burning at 450 C. The obtained results allowed a better understanding of physico-chemical factors controlling the enrichment of thermokarst lake water in organic carbon and metals, and evaluating CO2 sequestration/emission potential. The changes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), major element and divalent metal concentration in response to peat and lichen biomass addition were less than a factor of 2 over full duration of the experiment. Iron (Fe) concentration in the lake water decreased by a factor of 2 to 3 after the addition of peat and lichen biomass. The concentration of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates decreased by ca. 30 to 50%, presumably due to their co-precipitation with Fe hydroxide. The dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in tank with lichen increased by a factor of 5.5 0.5, likely due to respiration of algal component in closed environment Strong enrichment of the lake water in DIC, P, K, Ca, Mg, Si, Al, Ti, Mn, Mo, Rb, As, Sb and U upon the ash addition persisted over full duration of experiments and was significant (p <0.0001) compared to peat and lichen biomass treatments. These elements may serve as indicators of ground fire impact on thermokarst lake water's chemistry. The overall effect of ash leaching on aquatic ecosystems after ground fire of frozen Siberian peatland is predicted to be much stronger than that currently recognized for non-permafrost regions.
