In this study, temperatures from 4 to 35 degrees C were investigated herein as the major impact on SMFC performance in CBB-amended sediment. Under low temperature conditions, the SMFC could still operate, and produced a maximum power density of 4.09 mW m(-2) at 4 degrees C. Coupled with the high substrate utilization, high output voltage was generated in SMFCs at high temperatures. The application of SMFC affected the anaerobic fermentation progress and was detrimental to the growth of methanogens. At the same time, organic matter of sediments in SMFC became more humified. As a result, the fermentation of CBB was not accelerated with the SMFC application, and the removal efficiency of the total organic matter was inhibited by 5% compared to the control. Thus, SMFC could operate well year round in sediments with a temperature ranging from 4 to 35 degrees C, and also exhibit practical value by inhibiting quick CBB decomposition in sediments in summer against the pollution of algae organic matter.

Sample preparation steps were performed under water to avoid air contamination. The instrument precision for the delta(15)N measurement was high (0.03 parts per thousand), but for the whole sampling and analysis procedure the mean deviation between replicate samples was 0.13 parts per thousand for the delta(15)N measurements and 5.5% for the N(2) gas concentration analysis. The results show that the Gasbench peripheral was suitable for measurement of the (15)N natural abundance of dissolved nitrogen gas, with denitrification indicated by the over-saturation and slightly (<1 parts per thousand) depleted delta(15)N values of the dissolved N(2) gas in the suboxic zones of some of the study lakes. Calculated values for the denitrified (excess) N(2) varied between -5.3 and 0.7 parts per thousand. The denitrification potential was determined using the (15)N tracer method, with results showing nitrate-inducible denitrification and no signs of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox).

VARIABILITY OF WATER QUALITY IN WULIANGSUHAI LAKE RECEIVING DRAINAGE WATER FROM HETAO IRRIGATION SYSTEM IN YELLOW RIVER BASIN, CHINA	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Wuliangsuhai Lake is the largest lake in the basin of Yellow River, and is a very important irrigation and drainage system in the Hetao Irrigation Area. From 2005 and 2010, water quality trends for 21 sites in the lake were examined for 9 parameters: water temperature (WT), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), suspended solids (SS), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chlorophyll a (Chl a), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). Data were statistically analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2003 and Geostatistical Analyst in Arc GIS 9.3. In temporal trends, TN changed to a larger range from 1.05 to 10.99 mg/L, and TP fluctuations ranged from 0.057 to 0.622 mg/L. Decreased trend in COD was detected from 2005 to 2008 but increased trends in COD in 2009 and 2010 were because of the change of pollution sources in the upper channel. Overall, decreased trends in Chl a and EC were detected but increased trends in SS, pH, and DO. Changes in TN, TP, and COD were mainly related to agricultural irrigation, towns' sewage, and industrial wastewater, respectively. Changes in these parameters reflect the quantity of three kinds of wastewater, to some extent. In relation to season's variability, the values of TN, TP, and COD were significantly higher in winter than in other seasons, with values of approximately 91, 160, and 39% higher, respectively. These phenomena were caused by frozen lake water in which ice in the freezing process could discharge most pollutants from its body and the water under it. This unique phenomenon can help researchers find new ideas for lake water repair. In spatial distribution, variations are mainly related to the lake water source, the Main Drainage Channel. Moreover, water quality at the outlet of the lake is much better than that of the drainage channel. The average concentrations for TN, TP, COD, and Chl a in the exit compared with the entrance, were reduced to approximately 88, 81, 40, and 85%, respectively.

J	TILZEY, RDJ				TILZEY, RDJ			REPEAT HOMING OF BROWN TROUT (SALMO-TRUTTA) IN LAKE EUCUMBENE, NEW-SOUTH-WALES, AUSTRALIA	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Spawning runs of lentic-dwelling brown trout (S. trutta) and rainbrow trout (S. gairdneri) in Swamp Creek, an inlet of Lake Eucumbene, were studied for 4 consecutive years, and 3517 browns and 415 rainbows were tagged during 1968-70. A further 240 browns and 229 rainbows were marked in other inlets. Recaptures of marked browns in 1969 and 1970 showed a high incidence of repeat homing, up to 25.7 and 10.6% returning after 12 and 24 mo., respectively. Few rainbrow trout homed. Tag loss and the mortality and maturation of marked browns were estimated and percentage homing and straying in 1969, 1970 and 1971 was calculated. High percentage homing (.gtoreq. 90%) in 1969-70 and the variance in external form in the lentic population suggested some genetic isolation within the brown trout population. Homing ability was not influenced by fish age. Percentage homing fell markedly in 1971 after the moval of nearly all resident brown trout from Swamp Creek and suggested racially distinct stream trout populations to be an important navigational cue to homing brown trout.																									1977	34	8					1085	1094		10.1139/f77-165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-165													WOS:A1977DN47900002

We studied the export of DOC from Finnish rivers to the Baltic Sea between 1975 and 2010, and estimated trends in DOC fluxes (both flow normalised and non-normalised). The study encompassed the whole Finnish Baltic Sea catchment area (301,000 km(2)) covering major land use patterns in the boreal zone. Finnish rivers exported annually over 900,000 t DOC to the Baltic Sea, and the mean area specific export was 3.5 t km(-2). The highest export (7.3 t km(-2)) was measured in peat dominated catchments, whereas catchments rich in lakes had the lowest export (2.2 t km(-2)). Inter-annual variation in DOC export was high and controlled mainly by hydrology. There was no overall trend in the annual water flow, although winter flow increased in northern Finland over 36 years. Despite the numerous studies showing increases in DOC concentrations in streams and rivers in the northern hemisphere, we could not find any evidence of increases in DOC export to the northern Baltic Sea from Finnish catchments since 1975.

AN INTEGRATED DAMAGE, VISUAL, AND RADAR ANALYSIS OF THE 2013 MOORE, OKLAHOMA, EF5 TORNADO	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												An integrated damage, visual, and radar analysis of the EF5 Moore, Oklahoma, tornado that occurred on 20 May 2013 is presented. Characteristics of the damage path are discussed based on detailed ground and aerial surveys. Tree fall reveals highly convergent surface flow over the majority of the damage path. At times, the convergent flow is observed at radii less than that of the condensation funnel. A photogrammetric analysis of still photos and video shows that the damaging winds extend well beyond the condensation funnel location. The condensation funnel often coincides with the EF1, EF2, and EF3 isopleths. Observations of the tornado debris signature (TDS) by the Twin Lakes (KTLX)-Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) are presented. The TDS is not a good indicator of tornado intensity just after tornadogenesis. The spatial relationship between the TDS, condensation funnel, and damage path is highlighted. An analysis of the area encompassed by the respective EF-scale isopleths is presented to quantify damage risk. The area of successively weaker EF-scale categories exponentially increases. These results are compared to other well-surveyed EF5 tornadoes. A comparison is made between independent ground and aerial surveys that rated 4,039 structures along the entire damage path. The aerial survey produces a low bias in EF0 and EF1 ratings. No apparent bias is observed in the EF2-4 categories. It is not possible to draw definitive conclusions concerning the small number of EF5-rated structures.

J	Ross, C; Santiago-Vázquez, L; Paul, V				Ross, Cliff; Santiago-Vazquez, Lory; Paul, Valerie			Toxin release in response to oxidative stress and programmed cell death in the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												An unprecedented bloom of the cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa Katz. occurred in the St. Lucie Estuary, FL in the summer of 2005. Samples were analyzed for toxicity by ELISA and by use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific oligonucleotide primers for the mcyB gene that has previously been correlated with the biosynthesis of toxic microcystins. Despite the fact that secreted toxin levels were relatively low in dense natural assemblages (3.5 mu g l(-1)), detectable toxin levels increased by 90% when M. aeruginosa was stressed by an increase in salinity, physical injury, application of the chemical herbicide paraquat, or UV irradiation. The application of the same stressors caused a three-fold increase in the production of H2O2 when compared to non-stressed cells. The application of micromolar concentrations of H2O2 induced programmed cell death (PCD) as measured by a caspase protease assay. Catalase was capable of inhibiting PCD, implicating H2O2 as the inducing oxidative species. Our results indicate that physical stressors induce oxidative stress, which results in PCD and a concomitant release of toxin into the surrounding media. Remediation strategies that induce cellular stress should be approached with caution since these protocols are capable of releasing elevated levels of microcystins into the environment.

Satisfactory antisera were produced against 10 potential prey groups; Tricladida, Oligochaeta, Mollusca, Cladocera, Asellus, Amphipoda, Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. These were used in the precipitin test to identify the gut contents of the field-collected leeches. In productive lakes, Mollusca were fed on extensively followed by Oligochaeta and Chironomidae; in unproductive lakes, the last 2 prey groups were most heavily utilized. The lesser utilization of Mollusca in unproductive sites reflects lower availability. These 3 prey groups constituted 91% and 85% of the overall diet in productive and unproductive sites, respectively. The other prey groups formed only small proportions of the diet with Tricladida and Cladocera being least favored. Dietary composition did not vary much over 1 yr. Feeding activity is low in the reproductive period and in the winter months when low temperatures prevail. There were no significant differences in resource utilization between 3 weight classes; small, medium and large leeches.																			0022-2933	1464-5262					1981	15	3					475	489		10.1080/00222938100770351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222938100770351													WOS:A1981LJ65500008

Great Lakes coastal wetland habitat use by seven turtle species: influences of wetland type, vegetation, and abiotic conditions	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Great Lakes coastal wetlands are important habitats for turtles but few studies have looked at factors driving community structure in these systems. We evaluated the effects of wetland type, vegetation, and abiotic conditions on turtle communities for 56 wetlands in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior with data collected during the summers of 2000-2008. Overall, 1,366 turtles representing seven species were captured using fyke nets. For the majority of species, catches were highest in drowned river mouth wetlands In addition, turtles tended to be more abundant in water lilies, submersed aquatic vegetation, and cattails compared to bulrush. We also found positive correlations between catches of four of the species as well as total turtle catch and turtle species richness with a human disturbance gradient. These correlations suggest that turtles may be able to utilize coastal wetland areas that are inhospitable to fish because of hypoxic conditions. Our results show the importance Great Lakes coastal wetlands to turtles, and stress the need for managers to take into account turtle populations when preparing conservation and restoration strategies.

The lower limit of sensitivity was 1 ng of nitrosamine/ml. Formation of N-nitrosodiethanolamine from diethanolamine in lake water and sewage was demonstrated, with the identity of the product verified by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The greatest amount of the carcinogenic nitrosamine was generated in sewage, considerably less was produced in Cayuga Lake water and the least amount was formed in water from an acid lake. The amount of nitrosamine formed was related to the amount of diethanolamine added and the nitrite level in samples of the environments. Autoclaved samples of sewage and Cayuga Lake water either did not produce N-nitrosodiethanolamine or formed it at rates much lower than in nonsterile samples, suggesting a role for microorganisms or some other heat-labile factor in the formation of the nitroso compound. The nitrosamine could be metabolized in all 3 environments but it persisted in lake water samples taken in the winter.																			0047-2425	1537-2537					1981	10	3					266	270		10.2134/jeq1981.00472425001000030002x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1981.00472425001000030002x													WOS:A1981LY73600002

Four phases are recognized: yr 1-yr 20, the Polytrichum phase dominated by P. piliferum, with Lecidea granulosa and L. uliginosa as associated species; yr 21 to about yr 60, the Cladonia phase dominated by C. stellaris and C. uncialis; yr 61 to about yr 130, the spruce-Stereocaulon phase with S. paschale forming an almost pure lichen ground cover; after yr 130, the canopy closes and the lichen cover disappears and is replaced by a moss cover forming the final phase, spruce-moss woodland. These phases are confirmed by component analysis. The existence of spruce-Stereocaulon woodland in the area is dependent on cyclic burning. In the absence of fire the spruce canopy would close and the lichen cover would largely disappear. This event is rare in the area with a reburn cycle of about 100 yr. Fire is an important vector in the maintenance of this existence barren-ground caribou winter range.																			0008-4026						1976	54	23					2679	2687		10.1139/b76-288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b76-288													WOS:A1976CP16400008

Introduction to Dormancy in Aquatic Invertebrates: Mechanism of Induction and Termination, Hormonal and Molecular-Genetic Basis	DORMANCY IN AQUATIC ORGANISMS. THEORY, HUMAN USE AND MODELING	Monographiae Biologicae											Dormancy is a profound and ancient adaptation found in a wide spectrum of plants and animals of all habitats. In diapause, the switch between active and dormant states is driven by hormonal mechanism that usually includes a photoperiodic pacemaker. Temperature, food limitation, and some other stress factors as well are shown as driven by diapause induction in aquatic invertebrates. In the last decade, diapause studies from a wide variety of topics have demonstrated that diapause switch mechanisms may be developed to create novel applications in biotechnology. Resting eggs accumulated in the surface lake sediments represent a "bank" of zooplankton species that assures their persistence in a community, in spite of periodic harsh conditions. Studies on the vertical distribution of resting eggs in sediment cores yield useful information to opening important perspectives for paleolimnological climate reconstruction and paleoecology. Cultivation of live food, like rotifers, Daphnia, Artemia, or marine copepods, is an expanding application of practical use of diapause in modern aquaculture. Biotechnologies can now be imagined for maintaining ecosystems outside the Earth's biosphere. Resting stages provide at least two properties highly suitable for such ecosystems. They can be easily transported in space for a long time without special care as compared with an active ecosystem. In addition, storage of seeds and diapausing animals will provide a reserve in case of an unpredictable destruction of the active part of an ecosystem caused, for example, by a meteorite strike. The term alien species takes on a new meaning when one considers another aspect of space biology. By enlarging the distribution area of the species, colonization of new environments could be a safeguard against its extinction. Thus, it would also be important to develop technologies to guard against invasions of other species via ship ballast waters and similar means. We also suggest that molecular-genetic insights of diapause in invertebrates provide new ways of looking at carcinogenesis. Tumor cells may have parallels in postdiapause embryonic cells.					alekseev, victor/C-7086-2014	Alekseev, Victor/0000-0002-1968-2609													0077-0639		978-3-030-21213-1; 978-3-030-21212-4				2019	92						7	41		10.1007/978-3-030-21213-1_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-21213-1_2	10.1007/978-3-030-21213-1												WOS:000553031200003

Zooplankton samples were collected vertically at different depths in the main channel of Lake Nasser in front of Khor Kalabsh during July, 2007. The highest density of zooplankton (63779 Organisms/m(3)) and the highest number of species (10) was recorded between 2-5 m with an average temperature of 30.21 degrees C. The surface water layer recorded the second most abundant zooplankton (47222 Organisms/m(3)) with temperature (34.8 degrees C). This is due to the highest abundance of Brachionus calciflorus (14444 Organisms/m(3)). Also, B. calcifloris recorded high number from 0-2 m (10508 Organisms/m(3)) and not recorded at any other water layer (up to 20 m depth). This indicates that this species is thermophilic which is supported by the highest positive correlation (0.79) with temperature. Keratella tropica was recorded only between 15-20 m with an average temperature of 21.88 degrees C.

In addition to the phenology of the plant, which is inextricably linked to the climate, geological-geomorphological processes have sometimes influenced the migrations of peoples, who in turn brought with them customs and traditions, including food, transplanting them to the land of arrival. This review analysed the spread of the grapevine from the earliest finds to the end of the Roman Empire, a period to which most of the grape varieties cultivated today in Europe and Africa can be traced. This review has traced the spread of the grapevine through climatic, geological-geomorphological and social studies in order to provide a chronological development of the subject in relation to the causal factors that influenced its spread. The present manuscript has the ambition of providing a union framework on the movements of the first wine-growing areas, tracing them chronologically and evaluating them on a climatic basis.

They appeared some 200 years after the demise of the Linear Pottery culture (c. 4800 BCE). They have given a new shape to the resurgent 'Danubian Neolithic World'. However, despite intensive research, it is still unclear (1) how the transition process took place after the fall of the LBK; (2) how long rondels were function; and (3) under what circumstances they were abandoned. In this paper, we present a new approach to this problem based on an analysis of the biography of a single object based on the integration of archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data. We assume that the high -resolution pollen analysis of lake sediments provides critical data on the dynamics of population change (hiatuses, sharp declines and increases in population size) and how the environment is affected (felling of specific tree species, fires, cultivation of particular crops, grazing intensity). They provide a better understanding of the sequence of settlement and construction changes as well as alterations in material culture available in the archaeological record. The subject of the analysis is a site in the Lower Oder Valley (north-west Poland), at the furthest northern periphery of the 'Danubian World'.					; Tylmann, Wojciech/AAL-3504-2021; Niska, Monika/F-8363-2017; Czerniak, Lech/KCL-2801-2024; Podlasinski, Marek/G-8829-2016	Goslar, Tomasz/0000-0002-1346-3122; Czerniak, Lech/0000-0002-0352-5385; Podlasinski, Marek/0000-0003-3487-0664													0278-4165	1090-2686				DEC	2023	72								101551	10.1016/j.jaa.2023.101551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaa.2023.101551		OCT 2023											WOS:001101624000001
J	Long, CA				Long, CA			Ecological replacement of the Deer Mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, by the White-footed Mouse, P-leucopus, in the Great Lakes region	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												The possible ecological replacement of the boreal, long-tailed Forest Deer Mouse Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis, by the White-footed Mouse, P. leucopus noveboracensis, in Wisconsin was studied by analysis of the zoogeography (parapatric distribution and relict populations of P. m. gracilis in the south and on islands), and by surveying relative population abundance on Washington Island, where competition probably commenced in 1987, upon the arrival of P. leucopus. In Wisconsin, the geographic range of P. leucopus is expanding northward, and P. maniculatus gracilis has vanished in the south and on the Door Peninsula. The White-footed Mouse thrives in brushy and dry forest habitats (often nesting in ground burrows), and the Forest Deer Mouse seems both adapted to high tree branches and cavities, to cold weather, and to boreal (conifer, mixed conifer) forests. On Washington Island, after an initial increase of P. leucopus and the concomitant near extinction of P. m. gracilis, both species have coexisted at low to medium densities during the mild winters of the past three years.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1996	110	2					271	277																WOS:A1996UY54300003

The morphology and evolution of channels on the Wax Lake Delta, Louisiana, USA	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												River deltas are classic depositional systems, but a growing body of literature shows that their channel networks can be erosional. Furthermore, this erosion can attack channel beds of consolidated mud that acts as bedrock. To better understand the channel networks of natural deltas and engineered river diversions, we investigate bathymetric and planimetric change, bed cover, and sediment transport in the Wax Lake Delta (WLD) in coastal Louisiana, USA. Channels have eroded up to 40% of modern flow depth between the WLD's initiation in 1973 and 1999. Aerial image analysis shows that channels have widened by 11% between 1991 and 2009, forcing the downstream migration of islands. Channel beds are composed of 85-98% muddy bedrock, with the remainder covered by alluvial sands. Water velocity, grain size, and suspended sand concentration measurements during the 2009 spring flood show that almost all available grain sizes are transported in suspension. Flow was supply limited during this period, with the calculated sand concentration at the height of the bed load layer is 1-4 orders of magnitude smaller than predicted for saturated sand transport. We test the cover effect and the tools effect previously proposed for bedrock erosion in upland river channels. Bedrock erosion and alluvial cover are anti-correlated (the cover effect), but the observations do not closely follow previously proposed relationships. The difference in erosion rate between clear water and sand-rich water shows that abrasion by sand (the tools effect) accounts for 51%56% of bedrock erosion when it is present.					; Mohrig, David/O-1758-2013	Mohrig, David/0000-0003-1828-4526; Whitman, Spencer/0000-0003-4214-8081													2169-9003	2169-9011				SEP	2013	118	3					1562	1584		10.1002/jgrf.20123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgrf.20123													WOS:000325978500026

Twenty-seven of these tephra layers yielded suitable geochemical material to explore their volcanic origins. Investigations also included the acquisition of geochemical data of some relevant, chronologically compatible proximal units from Italian volcanoes. The record contains tephra from some well-known eruptions and eruptive sequences of Roman and Roccamonfina volcanoes, such as the Magliano Romano Plinian Fall, the Orvieto-Bagnoregio Ignimbrite, the Lower White Trachytic Tuff and the Brown Leucitic Tuff. In addition, the record documents eruptions currently undescribed in proximal (i.e. near-vent) sections, suggesting a more complex history of the major eruptions of the Colli Albani, Sabatini, Vulsini and Roccamonfina volcanoes between 313 and 366 ka. Six of the investigated tephra layers were directly dated by single-crystal-fusion 40Ar/39Ar dating, providing the basis for a Bayesian age-depth model and a reassessment of the chronologies for both already known and dated eruptive units and for so far undated eruptions. The results provide a significant contribution for improving knowledge on the peri-Tyrrhenian explosive activity as well as for extending the Mediterranean tephrostratigraphical framework, which was previously based on limited proximal and distal archives for that time interval.

A 50-year record of nitrate concentrations in the Slapton Ley Catchment, Devon, United Kingdom	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Slapton Ley, a coastal lake, is the largest natural body of fresh water in south-west England. There was concern in the 1960s that the lake was becoming increasingly eutrophic. To quantify inputs of water, sediment and nutrients into the lake, Slapton Ley Field Centre initiated a programme of weekly water quality sampling in September 1970. Of all the chemical properties which have been measured over the decades, the nitrate record has been the subject of more research than any other. The weekly monitoring has been supplemented by research projects aimed at understanding aspects of processes and patterns of nitrate delivery to the stream network. Three aspects of the nitrate record are reviewed: short-term process dynamics; the annual cycle of influent streams and the lake itself; and long-term trends. In the first two decades of monitoring, there was increasing concern about a trend of rising nitrate concentrations, an issue in most lowland rivers in the United Kingdom at the time. In the 1990s, nitrate concentrations levelled off and then have fallen steadily in recent years. In relation to eutrophication, there are clear signs of improvement in the influent streams, but concerns remain about water quality in the lake itself.

This paper discusses a number of important aspects of the biodiversity associated with the river. The marine dolphin inhabits the Indus River. It has anatomical evolutionary adaptations associated with the murky waters of the Indus. Its population structure and effects of barrages on the distribution pattern are highlighted. The problems caused to the migration of the anadromous fish, Tenualosa ilisha, due to construction of barrages on the Indus are discussed. The reservoirs at Tarbela, Jinnah, Chashma, Taunsa, Guddu, Sukkur and Kotri and the allied lakes and marshes provide a very good habitat for freshwater fishes, turtles, crocodiles and waterfowl. The riverine forests offer suitable habitat for a variety of wildlife, while grassy beds provide feeding grounds for seed-eating birds. The Indus Flyway is one of the most important flyways for the migratory waterfowl visiting Pakistan. More than 1,000,000 waterfowl winter at the reservoirs of the river and associated areas.

Here we used the pollen records from three lakes in this region to reconstruct the evolution of local vegetation and climate since 8200 cal. yr BP. The history of temperature and precipitation was reconstructed quantitatively with multi-bioclimatic indexes and a transfer function from pollen records. Results show that the steppe/meadow dominated during the period of 8200-6500 cal. yr BP, especially 8200-7200 cal. yr BP, indicating the central Tibetan Plateau was controlled by strong monsoon. The steppe dominated during the periods of 6000-4900, 4400-3900, and 2800-2400 cal. yr BP. The steppe decreased gradually and the meadow expanded during the period of 4900-4400 cal. yr BP. Three century-scale drought events occurred during 5800-4900, 4400-3900 and 2800 cal. yr BP, respectively. The first time when the regional climate shifted to the present level was at 6500 cal. yr BP in the central Plateau. Since 3000 cal. yr BP, the temperature and precipitation have decreased gradually to the present level. However, the cold climate between 700-300 cal. yr BP likely corresponds to the Little Ice Age.					; Cole, Julia/ABA-5759-2020; Li, Chenzhong/F-5087-2016; Liu, Kam-Biu/B-4966-2012; Shen, Caiming/F-5687-2012	Morrill, Carrie/0000-0002-1635-5469; Li, Chunhai/0000-0002-6529-6653; Shen, Caiming/0000-0002-8126-8775													1006-9313					AUG	2009	52	8					1104	1114		10.1007/s11430-009-0080-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-009-0080-5													WOS:000268983300006
J	Nelson, DM; Hu, FS				Nelson, David M.; Hu, Feng Sheng			Patterns and drivers of Holocene vegetational change near the prairie-forest ecotone in Minnesota: revisiting McAndrews' transect	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Holocene vegetational dynamics along the prairie-forest border of Minnesota were first documented in McAndrews' classic work. Despite numerous subsequent paleo-studies, a number of questions remain unanswered about the vegetation history of the region. Here, pollen, stable-isotope, mineral, and charcoal data are described from three lakes near McAndrews' sites. These data were compared with other paleoenvironmental records to reconstruct vegetation, aridity, and fire. The climate was relatively wet with increasing summer temperatures before 8000 yr before present (BP). The rates of changes were asymmetric for the onset and termination of middle-Holocene aridity, with an abrupt increase at similar to 8000 yr BP and a gradual, but variable, decline from similar to 7800 to 4000 yr BP. Early-Holocene coniferous forests changed to mixed-grass prairie without an intervening period of tallgrass prairie or deciduous forest, whereas the retreat of prairie was characterized by transitions from mixed-grass to tallgrass prairie to deciduous forest and finally to coniferous forest. Within the middle Holocene, the composition and structures of grass-dominated vegetation varied both temporally and spatially. Fire primarily responded to changes in climate and fuel loads. Vegetation was more strongly influenced by climatic changes than by fire-regime shifts.

J	Partanen, S; Hellsten, S				Partanen, Sari; Hellsten, Seppo			Changes of emergent aquatic macrophyte cover in seven large boreal lakes in Finland with special reference to water level regulation	FENNIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY												The latest studies on the development of aquatic vegetation in Finland have mainly focused on relatively small lakes. Research on emergent macrophytes in large lakes poses challenges as the habitats as well as the conditions of the lakes vary. Black and white aerial photographs from 1947-1963 and colour, mainly infrared aerial photographs from 1996-2000 were used to study quantitative vegetation changes in seven large ( 80-1116 km2) lakes in Finland: Kemijarvi, Unnukka, Kallavesi, Paijanne, Nasijarvi, Pyhajarvi and Vanajavesi. Vegetation changes were evaluated by comparing the situation before large-scale water level regulation and eutrophication to the current situation. Quantitative changes in emergent vegetation were frequently noticeable. Vegetation had decreased by 31-93% in three study lakes due to the mean water level rise and increased by 49-73% in three study lakes due to the spring flood reduction and suitable surrounding soils. The cover changes were in general relatively uniform between different study sites in each of the study lakes. The regulated and unregulated situations differed statistically from each other. The results point out the crucial impact of changing water levels and the significance of the surrounding soils to the cover of emergent aquatic vegetation.																			0015-0010	1798-5617					2005	183	1					57	79																WOS:000216634000004
J	Little, JI				Little, J. I.			Scenic tourism on the northeastern borderland: Lake Memphremagog's steamboat excursions and resort hotels, 1850-1900	JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY												Lacking the salt-water beaches, accessible mineral springs, and rugged mountains that attracted the first tourists to the northeastern United States, the Vermont-Quebec borderland did boast a number of clear and picturesque bodies of water, the largest of which was Lake Memphremagog. Once this lake became accessible by rail, American and Canadian promotional literature and graphic illustrations emphasized the romantic nature of its paddle-wheel excursions, scenic landscape, and resort hotels. This type of tourism was depicted as essentially a passive, civilizing experience in which participants affirmed their aesthetic sensibility and social status by admiring the view of lake and mountains from boat decks and hotel verandahs. But the exclusive nature of this romantic sensibility was undermined to some extent by the fact that local newspapers and railway companies encouraged groups of people from the surrounding communities to join the sight seeing tours. Local entrepreneurs were also quick to take advantage of the market for scenery and, in contrast to other tourist zones, there was no apparent conflict with the industrial development that was taking place at both ends of the lake.

J	Heris, MP; Middel, A; Muller, B				Heris, Mehdi P.; Middel, Ariane; Muller, Brian			Impacts of form and design policies on urban microclimate: Assessment of zoning and design guideline choices in urban redevelopment projects	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Urban form significantly impacts thermal conditions at the microscale. This research aims to understand how existing zoning regulations that prescribe urban form affect the microclimate of densely built redeveloped commercial and mixed-use urban areas. ENVI-met was used to simulate diurnal microclimatic conditions of two former indoor shopping malls in the Denver metropolitan area that were converted to walkable urban outdoor centers in the early 2000s - the 29th street Mall in Boulder, CO and Belmar in Lakewood, CO. Simulations were conducted for a typical summer day (June 29, 2015) and validated through on-site air temperature observations. To compare the impact of urban form on microclimate at both sites, four policy scenarios were developed to apply the hypothetical policy-driven morphology of one site to the other by changing building height, tree density, street direction, and a combination of the three factors. The combined scenario showed the largest differences in air temperature to the base case (up to 2.0 degrees C), which is in the order of magnitude of the RMSE (1.2 degrees C-2.4 degrees C). Site configuration influenced air temperature and wind speed creating hyperlocal cool and warm pockets. Mean radiant temperature (MRT) varied the most between the scenarios with differences of up to 15.0 degrees C due to tall buildings and increased shading. Urban form policies of Belmar contributed to more effective heat mitigation, particularly with respect to MRT. Findings from this empirical work demonstrate the importance of design guidelines and zoning to achieve desired microclimate outcomes and highlight the potential of planning policies to create climate-sensitive urban forms.					; Middel, Ariane/P-4221-2016	Heris, Mehdi/0000-0002-4418-5030; Middel, Ariane/0000-0002-1565-095X													0169-2046	1872-6062				OCT	2020	202								103870	10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103870													WOS:000568996300005
J	Xu, LK; Lin, XM; Amen, J; Welding, K; McDermitt, D				Xu, Liukang; Lin, Xiaomao; Amen, Jim; Welding, Karla; McDermitt, Dayle			Impact of changes in barometric pressure on landfill methane emission	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Landfill methane emissions were measured continuously using the eddy covariance method from June to December 2010. The study site was located at the Bluff Road Landfill in Lincoln, Nebraska, USA. Our results show that landfill methane emissions strongly depended on changes in barometric pressure; rising barometric pressure suppressed the emission, while falling barometric pressure enhanced the emission, a phenomenon called barometric pumping. There was up to a 35-fold variation in day-to-day methane emissions due to changes in barometric pressure. Wavelet coherence analysis revealed a strong spectral coherency between variations of barometric pressure and methane emission at periodicities ranging from 1 day to 8 days. Power spectrum and ogive analysis showed that at least 10 days of continuous measurements was needed in order to capture 90% of the total variance in the methane emission time series at our landfill site. From our results, it is clear that point-in-time measurements taken at monthly or longer time intervals using techniques such as the trace plume method, the mass balance method, or the closed-chamber method will be subject to large variations in measured emission rates because of the barometric pumping phenomenon. Estimates of long-term integrated methane emissions from landfills based on such measurements could yield uncertainties, ranging from 28.8% underestimation to 32.3% overestimation. Our results demonstrate a need for continuous measurements to quantify annual total landfill emissions. This conclusion may apply to the study of methane emissions from wetlands, peatlands, lakes, and other environmental contexts where emissions are from porous media or ebullition. Other implications from the present study for hazard gas monitoring programs are also discussed.																			0886-6236	1944-9224				JUL	2014	28	7					679	695		10.1002/2013GB004571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013GB004571													WOS:000340609800004

Snowbands over the English Channel and Irish Sea during cold-air outbreaks	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Persistent northerly-to-easterly cold-air outbreaks affected the UK during the winters of 2009-10 and 2010-11, with the resulting convection frequently organizing into snowbands over the English Channel and Irish Sea. Sounding data and composite radar reflectivity images from the Met Office Nimrod precipitation radar network reveal that these bands formed along the major axis of each body of water (or sea) when the boundary-layer flow was roughly parallel to each of those axes (along-channel). For both seas, a band was present the majority of times that the 850 hPa flow was along-channel. Of these times of along-channel flow, the 850 hPa wind speed and surface-to-850 hPa temperature difference were significantly greater when bands were present than when they were not. For the English Channel only, the land-sea temperature difference was also significantly greater when bands were present than when they were not. In a real-data Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) control simulation of a typical band over the English Channel, a trough develops over the water and offshore air streams from either side converge along it. In the absence of surface fluxes, the trough, convergence and organized precipitation fail to develop altogether. Orography and roughness-length variations are less important in band development, affecting only the location and morphology.

For this purpose, geochemical and stable isotopic analyses were carried out on sediment samples retrieved from a 160 cm long trench excavated on the eastern bank of Wular Lake located in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The chronology of the sediment strata developed using C-14 dating by accelerator mass spectrometry covered the last similar to 5600 yr BP. Our results indicated the occurrence of an extended dry climate phase from 4600 to 3800 yr BP, which coincided with the widely recognised Meghalayan Stage, when major civilisations like the Harappa and the Akkadian were known to collapse. The lake biogeochemistry revealed dominance of the emergent macrophytes during this stage. Another dry phase was observed between 3100 and 2200 yr BP. This dry phase peaked at around 2900 yr BP, coinciding with Bond Event 2. Wular Lake faced nutrient limitation due to low runoff around 2500 yr BP caused by the persistent dry and cold climate. Geochemical signatures revealed that anthropogenic activities during the last two millennia might have significantly influenced erosion in the catchment area. (c) 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, no studies have explored their entire process from application and transport to receptors within river basins. Here, we estimated the usage and loss of NNs in the Dongting Lake Basin in China using modeling approaches, and assessed NNs-associated aquatic ecological risks. Our research data showed that the annual usage of the nine NNs reached 1895 tonnes in the basin, with the peri-urban areas being the major users. We further calibrated and validated a SWAT model using various 13-years hydrological data and field measured NNs concentration data. The simulated total annual loss of NNs was 121 tonnes in the entire basin, 94 tonnes of which were discharged into the Dongting Lake. An obvious monthly variation was observed in the lake basin, with relatively higher NNs concentrations being found in summer. Results from the ecological risk assessment showed that NNs posed significant risks to aquatic organisms in approximately 11.2 % of river sections in the whole basin. The present study underscores the significant issue of NNs loss in the Dongting Lake Basin and warrants great attention to their potential risks to aquatic organisms.

Following two years of baseline data collection from these fields, consistent differences in water quantity and quality were observed for tile networks draining the fields, despite these fields being adjacent and managed together. Consequently, it was hypothesized that differences in subsurface water movement, specifically tile-drain density and connectivity, were the source of the observed differences. Our objective was to map the tile-drain network using remote sensing methodology in order to improve the understanding of nutrient and water transport as well as management on these fields. A combination of multispectral and thermal imagery, collected in spring of 2017, was incorporated to delineate the tile-drain network within each field.This imagery led to locating a cracked tile, which provided a direct path for overland flow to enter the tile-drain system and suggested that a tile-drain segment under the road connected the two fields.A ground-penetrating radar survey verified multiple tile locations, including the tile segment under the road.The distribution of these tiles helps explain the difference in water quantity and quality in the two fields.																			0022-4561	1941-3300				JAN-FEB	2019	74	1					1	11		10.2489/jswc.74.1.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.74.1.1													WOS:000454151600003

Stations were selected to characterize differences between offshore and nearshore communities, and to address the influence of the Selenga River. The contribution of small size classes to total phytoplankton biomass and photosynthesis was estimated by sieving samples prior to analyses. Photosynthesis was estimated by the uptake of C-14 along a gradient of light intensities in a ship-board incubator. The resulting P vs. I parameters were used, along with measurements of chlorophyll a and light penetration, to estimate areal photosynthesis. The results of this study showed that the < 10-mu-m phytoplankton accounted for 52-88% of the total chlorophyll a and 66-100% of the total C-14 uptake during this time of the year. Also observed was a negative correlation between this dominance and the total chlorophyll a in the sample. The P vs. I parameters also allow insight into physiological differences between the whole water and < 10-mu-m communities. The < 10-mu-m fractions were characterized by higher assimilation numbers (0.36 - 5.03 mgC mgChl-1 hr-1) than the whole water samples (0.16 - 2.76 mgC mgChl-1 hr-1). The < 10-mu-m fractions also showed higher assimilation efficiencies (1.13 - 15.01 mgC mgChl-1 mgChl-1 E-1 m2) and lower saturating irradiances (55 - 102-mu-E m-2 s-1) than the whole water samples (0.53 - 5.28 mgC mgChl-1 E-1 m2 and 62 - 152-mu-E m-2 s-1). Whole water assimilation numbers were highest in the region of the Selenga River Delta, and decreased away from the influence of the river.

J	Casper, P; Maberly, SC; Hall, GH; Finlay, BJ				Casper, P; Maberly, SC; Hall, GH; Finlay, BJ			Fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide from a small productive lake to the atmosphere	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The fluxes of CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere, and the relative contributions of ebullition and molecular diffusion, were determined for a small hypertrophic freshwater lake (Priest Pot, UK) over the period May to October 1997. The average total flux of CH4 and CO2 (estimated from 7 sites on the lake) was approximately 52 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and was apportioned 12 and 40 mmol m(-2) d(-1) to CH4 and CO2 respectively. Diffusion across the air-water interface accounted for the loss of 0.4 and 40 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of CH4 and CO2 respectively whilst the corresponding figures for ebullition losses were 12.0 (CH4) and 0.23 (CO2) mmol m(-2) d(-1). Most CH4 (96%) was lost by ebullition, and most CO2 (99%) by diffusive processes. The ebullition of gas, measured at weekly intervals along a transect of the lake, showed high spatial and temporal variation. The CH4 content of the trapped gas varied between 44 and 88% (by volume) and was highest at the deepest points. Pulses of gas ebullition were detected during periods of rapidly falling barometric pressure. The relevance of the measurements to global estimates of carbon emission from freshwaters are discussed.

Differential Incorporation of Bacteria, Organic Matter, and Inorganic Ions Into Lake Ice During Ice Formation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The segregation of bacteria, inorganic solutes, and total organic carbon between liquid water and ice during winter ice formation on lakes can significantly influence the concentration and survival of microorganisms in icy systems and their roles in biogeochemical processes. Our study quantifies the distributions of bacteria and solutes between liquid and solid water phases during progressive freezing. We simulated lake ice formation in mesocosm experiments using water from perennially (Antarctica) and seasonally (Alaska and Montana, United States) ice-covered lakes. We then computed concentration factors and effective segregation coefficients, which are parameters describing the incorporation of bacteria and solutes into ice. Experimental results revealed that, contrary to major ions, bacteria were readily incorporated into ice and did not concentrate in the liquid phase. The organic matter incorporated into the ice was labile, amino acid-like material, differing from the humic-like compounds that remained in the liquid phase. Results from a control mesocosm experiment (dead bacterial cells) indicated that viability of bacterial cells did not influence the incorporation of free bacterial cells into ice, but did have a role in the formation and incorporation of bacterial aggregates. Together, these findings demonstrate that bacteria, unlike other solutes, were preferentially incorporated into lake ice during our freezing experiments, a process controlled mainly by the initial solute concentration of the liquid water source, regardless of cell viability. Plain Language Summary Most of the freshwater lakes on Earth are found in regions where temperatures are below freezing for either all or part of the year. Here we studied the impact of freezing on the chemical and biological components of lake water. We simulated lake ice formation using water from perennially and seasonally ice-covered lakes to describe and quantify the distributions of bacteria and solutes (chemical species) between the liquid and solid water phases during progressive freezing. The results of these simulations revealed that, contrary to solutes, bacteria are preferentially incorporated into the ice. Results from the control experiment, which used dead bacterial cells dispersed in lake water, indicated that the viability of the bacterial cells did not influence the incorporation of bacterial cells into ice; live and dead bacterial cells were incorporated into the ice equally. However, only live cells formed bacterial aggregates, which were also incorporated into the ice. The observed preferential incorporation of bacterial cells was mainly controlled by the initial solute concentration of the liquid water source. Our findings have implications not only for the habitability of cold environments on Earth and their impact on biogeochemical cycles on lakes but also for extraterrestrial environments (icy worlds: Europa, Enceladus).					; Hand, Kevin/I-8246-2018; Michaud, Alex/AAC-4890-2020; Vick-Majors, Trista/AAQ-6258-2020; Santibanez, Pamela/HII-2820-2022	Michaud, Alexander/0000-0001-5714-8741; Hand, Kevin/0000-0002-3225-9426; Vick-Majors, Trista/0000-0002-6868-4010; D'Andrilli, Juliana/0000-0002-3352-2564; Santibanez, Pamela/0000-0001-7022-3232													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR	2019	124	3					585	600		10.1029/2018JG004825	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004825													WOS:000464653200010

It has been suggested that extensive and deep lakes characterized the Early Pleistocene environment but sediment exposure is highly fragmentary and reliable dating has been difficult. Here we report, for the first time, Early Pleistocene palaeoenvironmental reconstructions using stable isotopes, diatoms, tephra and pollen. We studied several stratigraphic sections of mainly non-volcanic rocks, containing the 1.3-Ma Xalnene Ash as a stratigraphic marker. The isotope and other proxy data show that topographically low points in the basin were occupied by spring-fed, shallow water lakes during the Early-Mid Pleistocene, with a trend to drier conditions. The basin was a dynamic volcaniclastic environment during this period, with the production of the Toluquilla volcanic sequence and other rhyolitic-dacitic volcanic ashes interbedded with the lake sediments at the sections studied. There is no evidence from the sections for extensive and deep lakes before or after deposition of the Xalnene Ash. Wetter conditions in the basin during the Early Pleistocene would have made it attractive for megafauna. Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

In this paper, we describe the development of a health advisory system based on the probability that real-time estimates of sewage indicator bacteria levels exceed water quality standards. Real-time estimates of bacteria concentrations were made using multivariate linear regression models and real-time input data. Probability distribution functions based on the model results and their associated variances were used to determine the probability that predicted bacteria levels exceed water quality standards. The models were developed for the Mystic River watershed, an urban watershed near Boston, using Enterococcus bacteria data measured during the summers of 2002 and 2003. The linear regression models had adjusted-R-2 values of 0.55-0.82 for two river sites, and 0.42 for both a beach on a lake and a boathouse near a dam. Independent variables with predictive power included precipitation and the time since the last rainfall. The probabilistic models for the beach and the boathouse sites correctly predicted water quality exceedances and nonexceedances with >85% accuracy.

Use of stable isotope methodology to determine natal origins of mallards at a fine scale Midwest within the upper Midwest	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Waterfowl managers often attempt to protect local breeding stocks of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from hunting pressure, but presently they cannot identify natal origins of birds shot during fall hunting seasons with certainty, unless recovered birds are banded before fledging. Accordingly, we examined whether stable isotope methodology could accurately delineate natal origins of mallards at a fine scale within the upper Midwest (USA). We determined delta C-13, delta D, and delta N-15 values from feather samples of 102 flightless mallard ducklings collected in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, USA, from 7 July to 9 September 2002. We detected inverse relationships between latitude and delta C-13 (R-2 = 0.223) and 6D (R-2 = 0.210). We also detected a weak positive relationship between easterly shifts in longitude and delta C-13 (R-2 = 0.067) and a weak negative relationship between easterly shifts in longitude and delta N-15 (R-2 = 0.076). The C-13 and deuterium values differed (P < 0.02) among states: North Dakota was most depleted in C-13, and South Dakota was least depleted in deuterium. Discriminant function analysis delineated natal origins of mallard ducklings in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin with low-to-moderate accuracy (47%), whereas we predicted natal origins of ducklings among subregions (Prairie [ND, SDI vs. Great Lakes [MN, WI] states) with moderate accuracy (72%). We conclude that stable isotope methodology has a limited ability to determine natal origins of migratory birds along a longitudinal corridor at fine scales but that it improves across ecoregions. However, the ability of deuterium to determine natal origins of migratory birds may vary as hydrological conditions, within and among areas, change throughout time. Researchers should account for annual variation in deuterium found in surface waters when investigating natal origins of migratory birds that use food derived primarily from these waters.

Most breeding pairs of all species nest on privately owned mainland locations that are subject to multiple industrial and development activities. The construction of three artificial islands in the eastern basin of Hamilton Harbour in the winter of 1995-1996 presents an opportunity to simultaneously reduce current land-use conflict and maintain the existing avian biodiversity. Accordingly, we used ecological information to determine suitable substrates and vegetation to satisfy nesting habitat preferences and to facilitate the occupation of the islands by nesting waterbirds. Our recommendations for habitat design and management emphasize techniques to prevent displacement of both tern species by ring-billed gulls and of night-herons by cormorants. We propose long-term management procedures based on aspects of the biology and known ecological interactions among the various species .																			0706-652X						1996	53			1			45	57		10.1139/cjfas-53-S1-45	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-S1-45													WOS:A1996VK06200006

Probabilistic relations between acid-base chemistry and fish assemblages in streams of the western Adirondack Mountains, New York, USA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Surface waters across much of New York's Adirondack Mountains were acidified in the late 20th century but began to recover following the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. Little data, however, are available to characterize biological impacts and predict recovery of fish assemblages in streams of the region. Quantitative fish and chemistry surveys were completed in 47 headwater streams during summer 2014-2016 to develop logistic (probabilistic) models that characterize the status of contemporary fish assemblages and predict how different nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) deposition loads may affect future fish assemblages. Models for inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al-i) and richness >= 1 species and for acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and total density >400 fish/0.1 ha, total biomass >1500 g/0.1 ha, brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) density >0 or >200 fish/0.1 ha, and brook trout biomass >1000 g/0.1 ha were suitable for evaluating community and population responses to changes in acid-base chemistry. Anticipated changes in national (US) secondary standards for atmospheric emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx) to achieve target N and S deposition loads will alter acid-base chemistry and the probabilities for observing various levels of fish metrics in streams across the region and elsewhere.

Walter; Slater, Lee			Expansion rate and geometry of floating vegetation mats on the margins of thermokarst lakes, northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska, USA	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Investigations on the northern Seward Peninsula in Alaska identified zones of recent (<50years) permafrost collapse that led to the formation of floating vegetation mats along thermokarst lake margins. The occurrence of floating vegetation mat features indicates rapid degradation of near-surface permafrost and lake expansion. This paper reports on the recent expansion of these collapse features and their geometry is determined using geophysical and remote sensing measurements. The vegetation mats were observed to have an average thickness of 0.57 m and petrophysical modeling indicated that gas content of 1.5-5% enabled floatation above the lake surface. Furthermore, geophysical investigation provides evidence that the mats form by thaw and subsidence of the underlying permafrost rather than terrestrialization. The temperature of the water below a vegetation mat was observed to remain above freezing late in the winter. Analysis of satellite and aerial imagery indicates that these features have expanded at maximum rates of 1-2myr(-1) over a 56 year period. Including the spatial coverage of floating 'thermokarst mats' increases estimates of lake area by as much as 4% in some lakes.

Groundwater Recharge in a Fire-Adapted, Semi-Arid Forest: A Watershed Water Balance Approach	GROUNDWATER												Climate change induced aridity and Euro-American settlement have altered the historical disturbance and flow regimes of large portions of the ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona. The increased occurrence of high-severity wildfires due to these changes has led to the establishment of various forest restoration programs to protect the region's forests and their watersheds. In 2014, a paired-watershed monitoring project was implemented to compare the impacts of differing levels of forest thinning to watershed hydrology in seven experimental watersheds nested within the Upper Lake Mary (ULM) watershed in Arizona. This study expands the calibration phase of the ULM paired-watershed by synthesizing historic precipitation, surface runoff, groundwater recharge, soil moisture data, and evapotranspiration (ET) data to perform regression analyses and create a holistic water balance for each watershed. The magnitude and timing of seasonal groundwater recharge events were quantified for the first time in this region using a water table fluctuation method. The results showed that recharge did not occur every year and was heavily dependent (P < 0.05) on total winter season precipitation and snowpack duration. On average, recharge composed 9% of the total water budget when present. The results of this study lay the foundation for a greater understanding of how forest restoration alters northern Arizona's forest hydrology and will provide crucial information that should be used in water policy and water resource decision-making as the region plans for future water availability.																			0017-467X	1745-6584				SEP	2025	63	5					736	751		10.1111/gwat.70011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gwat.70011		AUG 2025						40808400					WOS:001550974900001

It was originally isolated from Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in Australia; however, in European waters, its occurrence is associated with other cyanobacterial species belonging to the genera Aphanizomenon and Anabaena. Moreover, cylindrospermopsin-producing strains of widely distributed C. raciborskii have not yet been observed in European waters. The aims of this work were to assess the occurrence of CYN in lakes of western Poland and to identify the CYN producers. The ELISA tests, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-DAD, and HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS were conducted to assess the occurrence of CYN in 36 lakes. The cyrJ, cyrA, and pks genes were amplified to identify toxigenic genotypes of cyanobacteria that are capable of producing CYN. The toxicity and toxigenicity of the C. raciborskii and Aphanizomenon gracile strains isolated from the studied lakes were examined. Overall, CYN was detected in 13 lakes using HPLC-MS/MS, and its concentrations varied from trace levels to 3.0 mu g L-1. CYN was widely observed in lakes of western Poland during the whole summer under different environmental conditions. Mineral forms of nutrients and temperature were related to CYN production. The molecular studies confirmed the presence of toxigenic cyanobacterial populations in all of the samples where CYN was detected. The toxicity and toxigenicity analyses of isolated cyanobacteria strains revealed that A. gracile was the major producer of CYN.					; Meriluoto, Jussi/A-5309-2008; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/J-2427-2018; Soininen, Janne/A-4205-2008	Savela, Henna/0000-0002-2058-2779; Jurczak, Tomasz/0000-0002-1576-6741; Soininen, Janne/0000-0002-8583-3137; Meriluoto, Jussi/0000-0002-6300-301X; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/0000-0001-7358-0673; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2013	20	8					5243	5264		10.1007/s11356-012-1426-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1426-7								23378259					WOS:000321908600016

The Sr-87/Sr-86 values of the Ca-Na-Cl-type saline, deeper groundwaters fall in the narrow range of 0.7057-0.7070, similar to the Sr-87/Sr-86 value in plagioclase but not to that in K-feldspar, biotite, or the whole rock. This suggests that the water isotopic composition is the result of plagioclase-water interaction. The fracture minerals gypsum and calcite have similar Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, indicating that they have crystallized from waters similar to the present deep groundwaters. The shallow, Ca-HCO3-type, dilute groundwaters show a wider spread in the Sr ratio of 0.7065-0.7278, reflecting their derivation from minerals in the overlying soil. The results for the saline groundwaters are consistent with thermodynamic and kinetic models that demonstrate the relatively rapid dissolution of plagioclase with respect to other rock-forming silicates, and should have application to most brines located in silicate host rocks.																			0009-2541					JAN 25	1991	86	2					111	122		10.1016/0168-9622(91)90057-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-9622(91)90057-4													WOS:A1991EX31900003
J	Spitzer, H; Twikirize, J				Spitzer, Helmut; Twikirize, Janestic			Social innovations in rural communities in Africa's Great Lakes region. A social work perspective	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES												In Africa's Great Lakes region, many rural communities face serious challenges including chronic poverty, lack of infrastructure, high unemployment, inadequate education systems and healthcare services, as well as a fundamental absence of public social protection mechanisms. In some contexts, rural dwellers suffer from the additional burden of armed conflict and political violence. Yet, rural populations show remarkable indications of resilience and exhibit innovative ways of handling their problems by themselves. Some of these approaches can be qualified as social innovations. With its focus on the role of social work in rural social innovation processes, this article aims to contribute to some under-researched aspects at the intersection of social innovation, rural studies, and social work practice. Empirical evidence of rural social innovations is based on a regional study on indigenous and innovative models of problem solving in five African countries. Here, the focus is on two case examples from Uganda and Rwanda. For Uganda, a community-based concept of household clusters to promote rural development called akabondo is presented. The example from Rwanda is called umugoroba w'ababyeyi and refers to a family strengthening and community development program that has been mainstreamed into government policies. This model is located in the challenging context of a post-genocide society.A critical analysis of these models refers to the question whether they fall into the category of a social innovation; to major players in implementing such innovations; to their impact on rural communities and the wider society; as well as to challenges facing such innovations.																			0743-0167	1873-1392				APR	2023	99						262	271		10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.10.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.10.013		MAR 2023											WOS:000994023400001
J	Zhang, M; Yu, Y; Yang, Z; Kong, FX				Zhang, Min; Yu, Yang; Yang, Zhen; Kong, Fanxiang			Photochemical responses of phytoplankton to rapid increasing-temperature process	PHYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Phytoplankton is sensitive to rapidly increasing temperature in spring. However, studies on the effect of temperature on phytoplankton have mainly focused on constant temperatures. It is necessary to clarify the determining parameters of phytoplankton shifts during temperature increases, as temperatures are predicted to fluctuate more intensively and frequently in the future. In the study, we analyzed the responses of photosynthetic properties and growth in a cyanobacterium (Microcystis aeruginosa) and a green alga (Chlorella pyrenoidosa), the dominant species in Taihu, to rapid increasing-temperature process in the laboratory and in the field. The results show that gradually increasing temperature inhibited photosynthesis and the growth of C. pyrenoidosa and had almost no effect on M. aeruginosa. Elevated increasing temperature range also had more significant effects on the photosynthetic properties and growth rates of C. pyrenoidosa than those of M. aeruginosa in the laboratory and in the field. All of these results suggest that the photosynthetic performance of M. aeruginosa is more suitable to gradually increasing temperature and relatively strong temperature variations than that of C. pyrenoidosa, which might partially contribute to Microcystis excluding Chlorella competitively in aquatic ecosystem. Our findings point out the possible importance of the rapid and dramatic increasing-temperature process to the formation of cyanobacterial blooms.					yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022	, Min/0000-0002-8130-5214													1322-0829					JUL	2012	60	3					199	207		10.1111/j.1440-1835.2012.00654.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1835.2012.00654.x													WOS:000307723900005

After first being cleared for farming, the originally forested watershed subsequently underwent urbanization. The large increase in P loading accompanying agricultural intensification after World War II caused the eutrophication of the lake. However, improved soil conservation since the 1980s and urban stormwater management since the 1990s have brought watershed P loading and sediment accumulation down to levels comparable to the early 1900s. Yet, the lake continues to exhibit eutrophication-like symptoms, especially the intensification of hypoxia in the hypolimnion. Post-2000 water quality data indicate that the latter is not driven by external P loading from the watershed, but rather by rapid salinization that strengthens the lake's summer stratification and enhances internal P loading. Salinization is caused by the increasing application of deicing agents in the expanding urban area. Curbing salt inputs will therefore be essential to restore the lake. Overall, our results provide new insights into the shifts in lake biogeochemistry associated with LULC changes and the implementation of best management practices. The approaches and findings of our case study have broad applicability for the large number of freshwater ecosystems worldwide that are experiencing salinization.

Its integrated influence was separated to three components: (a) Direct Disturbance Impact (DDI) on cyan bacterial proliferation, (b) Indirect Nutrient Impact (INI) by sediment release and (c) Direct Transportation Impact (DTI) by both gentle wind-induced surface drift and wave-generated Stokes drift. By the combination of field investigation, laboratory experiment and numerical simulation their individual contributions to the severe bloom event in May 2007 in Meiliang Bay, Lake Taihu, was explored. Wind synthetically made 10.5 percent promotion to the bloom on May 28, 2007, but the impact varied with locations. DTI was featured with the strongest contribution of wind's impacts on CyanoHABs, while INI stood at the lowest level and DDI played an intermediate role. From the point of whole Meiliang Bay, the influencing weights of DTI, DDI and INI were approximately 48.55%, 32.30% and 19.15% respectively. DTI exerted the higher promotion in the regions of middle-east (ME), southwest (SW) and southeast (SE), and its actual contribution rate on CyanoHABs ranged from 6.41% to 7.46%. Due to the background nutrient load, INI was characterized by a tiny effect with the contribution rate being 2.18% on average. From the south bay to the north, DDI was detected with a decreasing tendency, with the practical contribution rate generally falling from 4.13% to 2.7%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The C-14 dates provided the chronological basis that enabled us to detect basin-scale events that are hard to ascertain in single-site records. This paper is the first attempt to compare different Holocene records from several sites along the Dead Sea, based on their chrono-stratigraphy. Included is the first publication of the paleoclimatic record of the Nahal Darga ephemeral stream valley. Such a regional compilation is needed, because only the integration and comparative evaluation of several records can produce a reliable climatic history by establishing the height of former Dead Sea levels that may be complicated by tectonics and the rise of Mount Sedom. A relatively high level of the Holocene Dead Sea occurred during the mid-Holocene around 4400 BP or about 3000 cal BCE after calibration. The lake level fell sharply around 4000 BP, i.e. 2500 cal BCE, and later fluctuated close to early 20th century levels. The C-14-based correlation is also used to estimate the rising rates of the Mount Sedom salt diapir that are apparently smaller than 10 mm. per year.

Holocene precipitation seasonality captured by a dual hydrogen and oxygen isotope approach at Steel Lake, Minnesota	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Middle-Holocene (8 to 4 ka BP) warmth and aridity are well recorded in sediment archives from midcontinental North America However, neither the climatic driver nor the seasonal character of precipitation during this period is well understood because of the limitations of available proxy indicators. For example, an important challenge is to distinguish among the interacting effects of evaporation, temperature, or precipitation seasonality in existing delta O-18 records from the region. Here we combine hydrogen isotopes of palmitic acid and oxygen isotopes of carbonate to derive lake-water isotopic values during the Holocene at Steel Lake in north-central Minnesota. In combination, these data enable us to separate variations in evaporation from variations in the isotopic composition of input-waters to lake. Variations in evaporation are used as a proxy for aridity and lake-water input isotopic values are used as a proxy for the isotopic values of meteoric precipitation. Our results suggest that lake-water input isotopic values were more negative during the middle Holocene than at present. To test whether these more negative values are related to temperature or precipitation seasonality, we compare pollen-inferred temperatures and the expected isotopic value of precipitation resulting from these temperatures to the reconstructed precipitation isotopic values. Results suggest that middle Holocene warmth and aridity were associated with increased evaporation rates and decreased summer precipitation. These inferences are consistent with climate simulations that highlight the role of seasonal insolation and sea surface temperatures in driving variations in precipitation seasonality during the Holocene. Results also suggest that changes in Holocene precipitation seasonality may have influenced the expansion of the prairie-forest border in Minnesota as well as regional variations in grassland community composition. This study demonstrates the efficacy of the dual hydrogen and oxygen isotope approach for distinguishing changes in evaporation and precipitation seasonality in the paleolimnological record.

J	Johansson, L; Wallström, K				Johansson, L; Wallström, K			Urban impact in the history of water quality in the Stockholm archipelago	AMBIO												From the historical perspective, the increasing number of inhabitants in the city of Stockholm has had a negative effect on water quality in the surrounding lakes and coastal region. Government control and measures taken to improve water quality have been in progress since the mid-19(th) century. Water conditions in the 19(th) century, compared to later years is difficult to assess from the first chemical and biological investigations, due to infrequent sampling and the different parameters and methods used. However, a retrospective evaluation of water quality can be made on the basis of results from plankton investigations, which began in the early 20(th) century. The occurrence of the cyanobacteria Planktothrix agardhii, which indicates nutrient-rich conditions, was surveyed during summers with similar temperature conditions throughout the 20(th) century. The results show that eutrophied conditions probably prevailed in the Stockholm archipelago from the beginning of 20(th) century until the early 1990s. In the last decade of the 20(th) century, water quality appeared to be better than 100 years earlier. Today's better water conditions are most probably an effect of proper measures taken in wastewater treatment.																			0044-7447					AUG	2001	30	4-5					277	281		10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0277:UIITHO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0277:UIITHO]2.0.CO;2								11697262					WOS:000171734200018
J	Gupta, A; De, B				Gupta, Aman; De, Bhaskar			Blue space resilient urban planning to enhance severely distressed thermal environment	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Water resilience is a vital aspect of current smart city planning. Maintaining the quality and volume of urban blue spaces can benefit local ecology, environment, and social well-being. The application of geospatial techniques provides an opportunity to achieve such goals in a spatially and temporally effective manner. While researchers often highlight city-level environmental problems, location-based solutions are insufficient, particularly for the rapidly sprawling Asian cities-the current work aimed to examine the water-resilient urban planning scopes for an Indian tropical megacity. The work assessed a major environmental hazard, i.e., urban heat island, which appeared to cover 9.6 %-17.4 % of the area of the city region during the summer months. The importance of blue spaces in mitigating heat islands was quantified using data from nearly 150 waterbodies, including a river, a vast wetland, and multiple lakes and urban tanks. Linear and logarithmic models established how the cooling effect increases with larger water bodies. Blue space ranging between 1.8 km2 and 2.3 km2 was recommended as the smallest yet effective size for future recreational zones. Incorporating ambient wind patterns further aided in deciding the locations of blue wedges that can be key for heat island mitigation. Moreover, to substantially amplify the blue resource recharge rate in a cost-effective manner, a multi-parameter decision analysis was carried out. Overlay of five surface characteristics contributed to planning sites for surface infiltration systems. The entire framework of the work was built to achieve sustainable development goals.

Bathymetry monitoring of shallow coastal environment using remote Sensing data	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												The Caspian Sea (CS), the largest lake in the world, is an exceptional water body that is wellknown for its rapid sea level (SL) change. This study aims to monitor the bathymetry of southeastern CS and Gorgan Bay (GB) under rapid sea level change. For this purpose, the water depth was extracted from the visible bands (blue, green, and red) of Landsat images using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The bathymetry survey results were validated through hydrography (field) and altimetry data. The results of bathymetry showed that R2 and RMSE values were 0.996 and 0.106 m, respectively in 2016. Moreover, the predicted depth for the period between 1992 and 2016 was consistent with the altimetry data. Due to rapid sea level fall, shallow coastal features like GB need to be monitored continuously. Therefore, the GB water depth was predicted by the RF algorithm for 2001 and 2023. The results showed that the GB bathymetry map corresponds closely to the altimetry data. The study also emphasizes the need for remote sensing data to prepare bathymetry maps which are hardly possible through field surveys.

Different countries and research institutes have different methods and traditions in sampling methods. In this study, the applicability of five different types of samplers - a hose, rosette, small and large bottle sampler and ship-of-opportunity-like pump sampling - were investigated in phytoplankton monitoring. Also, the effect of arithmetic integration of samples was studied. Sampling took place at three stations at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland and in the northern Baltic Proper during weak stratification and phytoplankton minimum, and strong stratification and a cyanobacterial bloom in the summer of 2005. Chlorophyll a and the number of selected species were analysed. There were some significant differences between the applied samplers but they were not consistent and - although there was a weak indication of the largest bottle sampler being the most reliable - the differences between the samplers were not large if they were operated correctly. However, ship-of-opportunity samples may underestimate the biomass of phytoplankton during cyanobacterial blooms. Chlorophyll a concentration estimated from arithmetically-integrated samples did not differ from that estimated from pooled samples.

However, their ecological importance was often neglected owing to their brittleness. Their population in freshwater was thought to be regulated mainly by grazing pressure, and the effects of lake trophy were less important. In this study, the cryptomonad species in three basins of Lake Donghu, a shallow lake in China were identified, and their distribution, seasonal dynamics, and relationships with several environmental factors were investigated. Eight cryptomonads were identified at species level by morphological examination; species belonging to the genera Komma and Cryptomonas were most common. Cryptomonads displayed inconsistent distribution and population dynamics among the three basins of different trophic status. They were the dominant species in the eutrophic basin, while their proportion was lower in the hypertrophic basin and in the mesotrophic basin. The biomass of cryptomonads was highest in the hypertrophic region. As a whole, cryptomonads kept low biomass during winter, while rapid waxing and waning of their population was observed in the other seasons. Cryptomonads species exhibit distinct seasonal trends. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed water temperature and dissolved total nitrogen were the most important factors that affected the composition of the cryptomonads community. Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated that the biomass of cryptomonads was positively correlated with pH value, dissolved total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon. In conclusion, lake trophy is a crucial factor affecting the total cryptomonads population.

The Hydrachnidia assemblages in particular types of valley water bodies (oxbows, riparian pools, permanent ponds, flooded alder carrs, sedge marshes, and springs) are strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of the water bodies in the landscape. Moreover, the formation of a fauna in a particular type of valley water body is also influenced by its origin. For example, the faunas of the oxbow lakes and riparian pools would have many characteristics in common, as these two types of water body can be characterized as originating in the river. As many as 61 species common to the valley water bodies and the KrA...piel River were noted. In the interactions between the valley water bodies and the river, the direction of migration from the former to the latter was clearly predominant. Migration in the reverse direction, from the river to the valley water bodies, took place to a far lesser degree. CCA analysis of landscape variables showed the influences of certain landscape parameters on water mites. These should be regarded as indirect influences, but as a consequence of their effects, they influence the formation of specific types of Hydrachnidia assemblages.					; Czachorowski, Stanislaw/J-2548-2012; Buczyńska, Edyta/AAZ-7715-2021; Szenejko, Magdalena/AEC-0467-2022	Buczynska, Edyta/0000-0003-1305-2451; Buczynski, Pawel/0000-0003-4009-1755; Czachorowski, Stanislaw/0000-0002-8078-4858													1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2016	17	3					247	261		10.1007/s10201-016-0479-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-016-0479-6													WOS:000381204900005

The core sediments are divided into three units based on grain-size distribution: unit 1 (top to 392cm depth, covering the last 11200 years), unit 2 (392530cm, 11.215 ka) and unit 3 (530588cm, 15.016.7 ka). These sediments were transported by local westerly winds (units 1 and 3) and fluvial processes (unit 2). Based on major element compositions and geological setting of adjacent areas, provenance of unit 1 sediments was interpreted to be the Lake terrane, and that of unit 2 to be the Idermeg terrane. Unit 3 sediments were derived from the Gobi Altai terrane. The records of total organic carbon, C/N ratio and weathering intensity suggest that paleoclimate in the source area of Lake Ulaan sediment was most humid during the Early Holocene, humid during the mid-Holocene and dry in the Late Holocene. The decrease of humidity through the Holocene is a typical characteristic of the East Asian monsoon region. Comparison with lacustrine records of other Mongolia regions suggests that the northern boundary of East Asian summer-monsoon influence could have been located further north than previously assumed.

Environmental factors associated with silver carp presence and relative abundance near an invasion front to inform removal efforts	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Management of invasive fishes has relied heavily upon understanding their spatial distributions and habitat use at fine spatial scales to guide treatments and removals. In the USA, targeted removal is used in management of bigheaded carps (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) in the Mississippi River system to reduce invasion potential into the Laurentian Great Lakes from the upper Illinois Waterway. Our study tested factors linked to fine-scale spatial distributions of the most prevalent bigheaded carp species-silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix)-in the upper Illinois River to increase effectiveness of removal efforts. Bi-monthly mobile hydroacoustic sampling was conducted from 2017 to 2018 and paired with continuous environmental data collection in the two northern-most invaded reaches of the upper Illinois River. Model selection was used to describe habitat conditions associated with silver carp presence and density. Depth was the most consistent predictor of silver carp presence and density, with shallower depths consistently associated with higher abundance. During summer months, shallow areas in large backwater habitats with lower temperature and higher dissolved oxygen concentration held more silver carp. These results may help managers focus targeted removal efforts through time, increase harvest effectiveness, and reduce the potential for further invasion toward the Laurentian Great Lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2021	848	15					3571	3585		10.1007/s10750-021-04612-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04612-y		MAY 2021											WOS:000651695000001

Single-grain optically stimulated luminescence from sediments supplemented by C-14 from charcoal and lacustrine shells was obtained to date shoreline deposits (Lake Callabonna) and the adjacent Mt Chambers Creek alluvial fan. Our findings are complemented by a U/Th-based record of speleothem growth in the Mt Chambers Creek catchment, which we interpret to reflect increased precipitation. Together, these archives shed light on the timing of, and possible sources of water for, Holocene pluvial intervals. We identified several phases of elevated lake levels dated at similar to 5.8-5.2, 4.5, 3.5-2.7 and 1 kyr, most of which correspond to fluvial activity resulting from increased precipitation in the adjacent ranges. The enhanced hydrology during phases of the late Holocene likely increased the reliability of resources for regional human populations during a time of reduced winter rainfall. When considered within the framework of the current understanding of Holocene palaeoclimate in central Australia, our data suggest that the pattern of landscape response was broadly synchronous with larger scale climatic variability and punctuated by pluvial periods greater than today.

Some basic parameters of water and sediment have also been studied. The basin of the lake system is densely populated and the water is used for various purposes including drinking. Ni and Pb along with nitrate in both lakes are significantly higher than the drinking water quality criteria of USEPA. The concentration of the metals in the sediments is noticeably higher than that present in the adjoining rock, particularly Ni and Pb. There is a significant uptake of metals by the macrophytes (Eichhornia crassipes and Hydrilla verticillata) and fish (Labeo rohita and Oreochromis niloticus) mainly in summer. The fish of Lower lake (O. niloticus) is unfit for human consumption. The data have been statistically treated. Principle component analysis and cluster analysis were performed to define the origin of metals and to assess the relationship among the sites. Overall the Lower lake is more polluted than the Upper lake. In aggregate, the lake system is under an environmental stress due to certain practices.

Phosphatase activity (PA) in plankton was studied in seven subtropical shallow lakes of different exploitation management and trophic status in the urban area of Wuhan City. Bulk PA was rather high (range 1.1-11 mu mol l(-1) h(-1)), although concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were also high (range 27 mu g P l(-1) to similar to 1.5 mg P l(-1)) in all lakes. Cell-associated extracellular PA in phytoplankton was detected using the fluorescence-labelled enzyme activity technique. Phytoplankton species partly contributed to the bulk PA. We found explicit differences in the presence of cell-associated phosphatase within the main phytoplankton groups; species belonging to Chlorophyta and Dinophyta were regularly phosphatase-positive, while Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyceae were phosphatase-negative in all but one case. Furthermore, there is a certain potential of extracellular phosphatases produced by heterotrophic nanoflagellates in most of the lakes. This new finding compromises the 'traditional' interpretation of bulk phosphatase data as being due to overall phytoplankton or bacterial P regeneration.

J	Cai, YP; Mitrano, DM; Hufenus, R; Nowack, B				Cai, Yaping; Mitrano, Denise M.; Hufenus, Rudolf; Nowack, Bernd			Formation of Fiber Fragments during Abrasion of Polyester Textiles	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Fiber fragments are one of the dominant types of microplastics in environmental samples, suggesting that synthetic textiles are a potential source of microplastics to the environment. Whereas the release of microplastics during washing of textiles is already well studied, much less is known about the release during abrasion processes. The abrasion of textiles may induce fibrillation of fibers and therefore result in the formation of much finer fiber fragments. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of abrasion of synthetic textiles on the formation of microplastic fibers and fibrils. Fleece and interlock textile swatches made of polyester were abraded using abrasion tests with a Martindale tester. The microplastic fibers and fibrils formed during abrasion were extracted from the textiles and characterized in terms of number, length, and diameter. The microplastic fibers demonstrated the same diameter than the fibers found in the textiles (fleece: 12.3 mu m; interlock: 12.7 mu m), while fibrils with a much smaller diameter (fleece: 2.4 mu m; interlock: 4.9 mu m) were also found. The number of fibrils formed during abrasion in both textiles was higher than the number of microplastic fibers. The majority of the extracted microplastic fibers had a length between 200 and 800 mu m, while most fibrils were between 30 and 150 mu m, forming two distinct fiber fragment morphologies. The number of microplastic fibers formed during abrasion was 5 to 30 times higher than the number of microplastic fibers that could be extracted from non-abraded samples. The number of fibrils increased after abrasion by more than a factor of 200 for both fabric types. The fibrils formed during abrasion have diameters that fall within the inhalable size for airborne particles. The potential release of fibrils into air during wear of textiles thus raises questions about the human exposure to these materials. Since the Martindale tester can simulate a daily application scenario of textiles over a prolonged period only in a limited way, future studies are needed to establish the correlation between the test results with a real-world scenario.					; Hufenus, Rudolf/ABB-6356-2020; Nowack, Bernd/B-6425-2008	Mitrano, Denise/0000-0001-8030-6066; Nowack, Bernd/0000-0002-5676-112X; Cai, Yaping/0000-0001-8207-8132; Hufenus, Rudolf/0000-0002-8245-6620													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 15	2021	55	12					8001	8009		10.1021/acs.est.1c00650	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00650		JUN 2021						34061503					WOS:000663939900025
J	MOLOT, LA; DILLON, PJ				MOLOT, LA; DILLON, PJ			NITROGEN MASS BALANCES AND DENITRIFICATION RATES IN CENTRAL ONTARIO LAKES	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nitrogen mass balances for seven unproductive lakes and 20 forested catchments in central Ontario were measured between 1977 and 1989. Average annual lake denitrification rates calculated with the N/P ratio method were strongly correlated with summer anoxic factor (extent of surficial sediment anoxia) whereas denitrification rates calculated with a Pb-210 sediment N accumulation method were poorly correlated with the anoxic factor suggesting that the N/P method is superior. Substantial denitrification occurred in all lakes - an average of 36% of TN inputs or 75% of the net gain. On a regional area-weighted basis, 67% of bulk atmospheric TN deposition was stored or denitrified terrestrially, 12% was denitrified in lakes, 4% was stored in lake sediments, and 17% was exported from lakes. N/P ratios were generally less in streams than in precipitation suggesting preferential N retention in catchments, whereas the N/P ratios in lake outputs were slightly higher than lake input ratios, suggesting preferential P retention in lakes. This is consistent with the notion that P-limited lakes can exist adjacent to N-limited forests.

K.; Hansson, Lars-Anders			Warming reshapes the invertebrate predation pressure on the plankton community	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Climate change stressors, including warming and heatwaves, can alter plankton composition and dominance patterns in temperate shallow lakes, which can disrupt ecosystem function and curtail ecosystem services. Understanding how these alterations could take place under future climates is therefore important. 2. To understand such changes, we performed a year-long mesocosm experiment with controls reflecting present temperature conditions and a treatment reflecting a future climate change scenario, including heatwaves of 5-8 degrees C above ambient water temperatures. 3. In the warmer conditions, the predatory invertebrate Mesostoma, exerted a strong top-down control on Daphnia, resulting in a switch in herbivore dominance to Ceriodaphnia in contrast to the controls where Daphnia remained dominant. A complementary predation experiment revealed that Mesostoma fed at a higher rate on Daphnia than on Ceriodaphnia and cyclopoid copepods. Cyclopoids were the least affected taxon but showed tendencies to sustain populations longer into the winter at elevated temperatures. Moreover, both total algal and cyanobacteria biomass increased with warming. 4. Our experiments suggest that predator-prey dynamics may alter plankton community composition and dominance patterns in a warmer climate because thermophilic predatory invertebrates have the potential to induce cascading food-chain effects and alter the herbivore dominance patterns in lake zooplankton. This may have implications for the algal population dynamics and overall ecosystem function and processes in shallow lakes.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Salis, Romana/J-4374-2019; Devkota, Nischal/NQF-4096-2025	Salis, Romana/0000-0001-7724-4984; Devkota, Nischal/0000-0003-0473-0513; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2023	68	3					365	377		10.1111/fwb.14031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14031		DEC 2022											WOS:000898937000001
J	Bau, M; Knappe, A; Dulski, P				Bau, Michael; Knappe, Andrea; Dulski, Peter			Anthropogenic gadolinium as a micropollutant in river waters in Pennsylvania, and in Lake Erie, northeastern United States	CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY												"Anthropogenic" gadolinium, Gd, used in contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging, is a micropollutant that enters river and lake waters with the discharge from wastewater treatment plants, WWTPs. Such discharge is also the source of other micropollutants, for example pharmaceuticals, such as steroids, antihistamins, and antibiotics. Together with the "natural" Gd, the anthropogenic Gd produces positive Gd anomalies in rare-earth element distribution patterns and is, therefore, easily detectable. This pilot study reports on the occurrence of anthropogenic Gd in rivers in Pennsylvania (Ohio, Beaver, Allegheny, Monongahela, Juniata, and Susquehanna) and in near-shore surface water from Lake Erie close to the city of Buffalo. Additional data are reported for the Delaware River and the headwaters of Spring Creek in Central Pennsylvania, and for Lake Ontario and Niagara River, all of which do not show significant anthropogenic Gd. Most pronounced impact of anthropogenic Gd discharged from WWTPs is observed in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan area. Such contamination is similar to that observed in densely populated areas with highly developed medical and healthcare systems in Europe and Japan. Its worldwide applicability adds to the promising potential of anthropogenic Gd as a cost-effective tracer for the presence of WWTP effluent in river, lake, ground, and drinking waters.

J	Kurek, J; Cwynar, LC; Spear, RW				Kurek, J; Cwynar, LC; Spear, RW			The 8200 cal yr BP cooling event in eastern North America and the utility of midge analysis for Holocene temperature reconstructions	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Between about 8400 and 8000 cal yr BP two sites from the White Mountains of eastern North America record loss-on-ignition (LOI) reductions in the organic content of lake sediment. At Speck Pond LOI values reach a near-Holocene minimum of 35% whereas at Surplus Pond LOI values are maintained near 35% for about 100 cal yr. We interpret this change in LOI as a response to the 8200 cal yr BP cooling event known to occur throughout the circum-North Atlantic region. Detailed midge (including Chironomidae, Chaoboridae, and Ceratopogonidae) analyses were used to measure changes in summer surface-water temperatures from about 8800 to 8000 cal yr BP at both sites. Midge-inferred temperatures are highly variable at Speck Pond (ranging from 12.2degreesC to 16.7degreesC) whereas a "no-analogue" situation persists at Surplus Pond with inferred temperatures near 30degreesC. These results bring into question the usefulness of midges as a climate proxy to infer relatively brief, small-magnitude Holocene climatic events such as the 8200 cal yr BP cooling event.

Fry placed in the lake cages were able to complete their first feeding phase on a diet of natural lake zooplankton but growth performance was improved when artificial diets were used to supplement natural food. Parr fed selectively on Daphnia catawba and mature Epischura lacustris. Parr reared in the mesh troughs were hand-fed a commercial diet. The 90-d average release weight ranged from 1.8 to 3.1 g for parr from the mesh troughs and from 0.9 to 3.1 g for parr from the lake cages. Growth of parr in these experiments resulted in an averge weight advantage of approximately 2.3-4.5 times over parr captured from natural riverine habitat at the end of the experiment. Overall swim-up fry to fall-fingerling survival from these experiments was 52% in 1983 and 76% in 1984. Survival and growth varied inversely with density in the mesh trough experiments.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1987	44	2					337	347		10.1139/f87-042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-042													WOS:A1987G352800010

Arsenite as an Electron Donor for Anoxygenic Photosynthesis: Description of Three Strains of Ectothiorhodospira from Mono Lake, California and Big Soda Lake, Nevada	LIFE-BASEL												Three novel strains of photosynthetic bacteria from the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae were isolated from soda lakes of the Great Basin Desert, USA by employing arsenite (As(III)) as the sole electron donor in the enrichment/isolation process. Strain PHS-1 was previously isolated from a hot spring in Mono Lake, while strain MLW-1 was obtained from Mono Lake sediment, and strain BSL-9 was isolated from Big Soda Lake. Strains PHS-1, MLW-1, and BSL-9 were all capable of As(III)-dependent growth via anoxygenic photosynthesis and contained homologs of arxA, but displayed different phenotypes. Comparisons were made with three related species: Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii DSM 2111, Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii DSM 243(T), and Halorhodospira halophila DSM 244. All three type cultures oxidized arsenite to arsenate but did not grow with As(III) as the sole electron donor. DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that strain PHS-1 belongs to the same species as Ect. shaposhnikovii DSM 2111 (81.1% sequence similarity), distinct from Ect. shaposhnikovii DSM 243(T) (58.1% sequence similarity). These results suggest that the capacity for light-driven As(III) oxidation is a common phenomenon among purple photosynthetic bacteria in soda lakes. However, the use of As(III) as a sole electron donor to sustain growth via anoxygenic photosynthesis is confined to novel isolates that were screened for by this selective cultivation criterion.																				2075-1729				MAR	2017	7	1							1	10.3390/life7010001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life7010001								28035953					WOS:000398680000001

Despite the great attention landfill sitting has received, so far, due to each site's particular condition, introducing a universal framework for landfill siting processes has not yet been achieved. Regarding this fact, in this study, two different zoning procedures, LEPT and AHP, have been utilized in order to perform landfill siting for Ravansar County-west of Iran. LEPT is a proposed methodology applicable for assessment of karst vulnerability in regions with sparse data. In this study, LEPT has been applied to categorize the region into four karst vulnerability classes: very low, low, high, and very high. Devoting significant attention to areas with very high and high karst vulnerability potential, thirteen criteria, divided into three main categories, were used to categorize the study area into four suitability classes for landfill siting. These criteria were aspect and wind, distance from faults, distance from gas pipelines, groundwater depth, distance from mines, distance from rivers, distance from roads, distance from lakes, distance from residential areas, slope, distance from springs, distance from water wells, and soil thickness. Results showed that 5.2% of the study area is highly suitable for landfill placement.					; Taheri, Kamal/CAG-8204-2022	Taheri, Kamal/0000-0001-5683-4678; Ghobadi, Mohammad Hosein/0000-0002-5513-516X; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	2							68	10.1007/s12665-017-6392-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6392-4													WOS:000393021400010
J	Taylor, IR				Taylor, IR			Foraging ecology of the Black-fronted Plover on saline lagoons in Australia: the importance of receding water levels	WATERBIRDS												The conditions that determine habitat suitability for waterbirds on temporary wetlands in Australia are poorly understood. This study describes the foraging behavior of the Black-fronted Plover (Elseyornis melanops) on two shallow saline lagoons with variable water depths. When water levels were receding, areas were left exposed around the periphery of the lagoons, which formed a succession from substrates still covered by water, to wet mild with a surface layer of water, to moist firm mud and eventually to dry, hard mud. The plovers showed a strong preference for feeding in areas of moist, firm mud and their prey capture rates were highest in this substrate type. When water levels rose following rainfall, previously exposed areas were partially flooded and the birds' prey capture rates fell significantly. Most abandoned the lagoon. The species was thus highly dependent on receding water levels to provide suitable foraging conditions.																			1524-4695					SEP	2004	27	3					270	276		10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027[0270:FEOTBP]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027[0270:FEOTBP]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000224562700003

However, the microbial inorganic carbon uptake rates in saline lake water and its influencing factors are still not fully understood. Here, we studied in situ microbial carbon uptake rates under light-dependent and dark conditions in the saline water of Qinghai Lake using a carbon isotopic labeling (14C-bicarbonate) technique, followed by geochemical and microbial analyses. The results showed that the light-dependent inorganic carbon uptake rates were 135.17-293.02 mu g C L-1 h-1 during the summer cruise, while dark inorganic carbon uptake rates ranged from 4.27 to 14.10 mu g C L-1 h-1. Photoautotrophic prokaryotes and algae (e.g. Oxyphotobacteria, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta and Ochrophyta) may be the major contributors to light-dependent carbon fixation processes. Microbial inorganic carbon uptake rates were mainly influenced by the level of nutrients (e.g., ammonium, dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen), with dissolved inorganic carbon content being predominant. Environmental and microbial factors jointly regulate the total, light-dependent and dark inorganic carbon uptake rates in the studied saline lake water. In summary, microbial light-dependent and dark carbon fixation processes are active and contribute significantly to carbon sequestration in saline lake water. Therefore, more attention should be given to microbial carbon fixation and its response to climate and environmental changes of the lake carbon cycle in the context of climate change.

Establishing Standards on Colors from Natural Sources	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE												Color additives are applied to many food, drug, and cosmetic products. With up to 85% of consumer buying decisions potentially influenced by color, appropriate application of color additives and their safety is critical. Color additives are defined by the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as any dye, pigment, or substance that can impart color to a food, drug, or cosmetic or to the human body. Under current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, colors fall into 2 categories as those subject to an FDA certification process and those that are exempt from certification often referred to as natural colors by consumers because they are sourced from plants, minerals, and animals. Certified colors have been used for decades in food and beverage products, but consumer interest in natural colors is leading market applications. However, the popularity of natural colors has also opened a door for both unintentional and intentional economic adulteration. Whereas FDA certifications for synthetic dyes and lakes involve strict quality control, natural colors are not evaluated by the FDA and often lack clear definitions and industry accepted quality and safety specifications. A significant risk of adulteration of natural colors exists, ranging from simple misbranding or misuse of the term natural on a product label to potentially serious cases of physical, chemical, and/or microbial contamination from raw material sources, improper processing methods, or intentional postproduction adulteration. Consistent industry-wide safety standards are needed to address the manufacturing, processing, application, and international trade of colors from natural sources to ensure quality and safety throughout the supply chain.					; Giusti, Monica/B-3367-2012; Decker, Eric/O-1666-2013	Ferruzzi, Mario/0000-0003-1384-2672; Giusti, M.

Climate versus human-driven fire regimes in Mediterranean landscapes:: the Holocene record of Lago dell'Accesa (Tuscany, Italy)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A high-resolution sedimentary charcoal record from Lago dell'Accesa in southern Tuscany reveals numerous changes in fire regime over the last 11.6 kyr cal. BP and provides one of the longest gap-free series from Italy and the Mediterranean region. Charcoal analyses are coupled with gamma density measurements, organic-content analyses, and pollen counts to provide data about sedimentation and vegetation history. A comparison between fire frequency and lake-level reconstructions from the same site is used to address the centennial variability of fire regimes and its linkage to hydrological processes. Our data reveal strong relationships among climate, fire, vegetation, and land-use and attest to the paramount importance of fire in Mediterranean ecosystems. The mean fire interval (MFI) for the entire Holocene was estimated to be 150yr, with a minimum around 80yr and a maximum around 450yr. Between 11.6 and 3.6kyrcal.BP, up to eight high-frequency fire phases lasting 300-500yr generally occurred during shifts towards low lake-level stands (ca 11,300, 10,700, 9500, 8700, 7600, 6200, 5300, 3400, 1800 and 1350 cal. yr BP). Therefore, we assume that most of these shifts were triggered by drier climatic conditions and especially a dry summer season that promoted ignition and biomass burning. At the beginning of the Holocene, high climate seasonality favoured fire expansion in this region, as in many other ecosystems of the northern and southern hemispheres. Human impact affected fire regimes and especially fire frequencies since the Neolithic (ca 8000-4000 cal.yr BP). Burning as a consequence of anthropogenic activities became more frequent after the onset of the Bronze Age (ca 3800-3600 cal. yr BP) and appear to be synchronous with the development of settlements in the region, slash-and-burn agriculture, animal husbandry, and mineral exploitation. The anthropogenic phases with maximum fire activity corresponded to greater sensitivity of the vegetation and triggered significant changes in vegetational communities (e.g. temporal declines of Quercus ilex forests and expansion of shrublands and macchia). The link between fire and climate persisted during the mid- and late Holocene, when human impact on vegetation and the fire regime was high. This finding suggests that climatic conditions were important for fire occurrence even under strongly humanised ecosystem conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rose, WI; Conway, FM; Pullinger, CR; Deino, A; McIntosh, WC				Rose, WI; Conway, FM; Pullinger, CR; Deino, A; McIntosh, WC			An improved age framework for late Quaternary silicic eruptions in northern Central America	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Five new stepwise-heating 40Ar/39Ar ages and one new high-sensitivity C-14 date of ash-fall and ash-now deposits from late Quaternary silicic volcanoes in northern Central America,document the eruption rates and frequencies of five major rhyodacite and rhyolite calderas (Atitlan, Amatitlan, Ayarza, Coatepeque, and Ilopango) located north of the basalt, andesite, and dacite stratovolcanoes of the Central American volcanic front. These deposits form extensive time-stratigraphic horizons that intercalate regionally, and knowledge of dates and stratigraphy provides a valuable framework for age determinations of more localized volcanic and nonvolcanic events. The new data; especially when integrated with previous stratigraphic and dating work, show that all five calderas erupted several times in the past 200 ka and, despite a lack of historic activity, should be considered as active centers that could produce highly explosive eruptions again. Because of their locations near the highly vulnerable economic hearts of Guatemala and El Salvador, the risks of eruptions from these calderas should be carefully considered along with risks of major earthquakes and volcanic front volcanoes, which are much more frequent but inflict less severe and extensive damage. This investigation also includes some examples of dating efforts that failed to produce reasonable results.

Observation of out-of-plane ambient noise on two vector sensor moorings in Lake Travis	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Two Autonomous Underwater Multi-Dimensional Acoustic Recorders (AUMDAR) were deployed in the southeastern part of Lake Travis during the summer of 2018. Each AUMDAR system possessed a three-axis acoustic vector sensor capable of estimating the azimuthal and vertical arrival angles from discrete sound sources. A unique and complicated propagation environment existed during the experiment due to the mooring locations and the range-dependent lake bathymetry. The AUMDAR systems were almost entirely shielded from sound emanating from surface vessels to the south and southeast of the deployment location, while a larger, yet limited, direct acoustical field of view was realized to the north and northeast. During the evening hours, the low-frequency received level increased without a corresponding increase in the number of detected discrete surface vessels. During the same time, the predominant direction of the received sound pointed toward the bend in the river channel. A three-dimensional ray model was employed to assess the various arrival angles from a grid of source positions located throughout the lake. The model results are consistent with the observations and suggest that the ambient noise field originated from vessels physically located to the northwest of the sensors, but arriving at angles consistent with out-of-plane sound propagation.																			0001-4966	1520-8524				SEP	2019	146	3					1903	1912		10.1121/1.5125429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.5125429								31590496					WOS:000489159400056

Lake Como is one of the deepest and largest lakes in Northern Italy, serving important ecosystem services (i.e., drinking water, recreational, industrial, irrigation uses), some of which are currently at risk giving the current water scarcity and climate change scenarios. The highest concentrations measured in lake water were those of diclofenac, followed by carbamazepine, its metabolite, and clarithromycin. The data measured allowed to calibrate and run a fugacity-based lake model, which showed that the most important chemical load generally comes from the advective water from the north of the lake, rather than from the direct wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges. This indicates that only an important reduction of chemical discharge (reduced use or extensive treatment) at a drainage basin level could significantly reduce concentrations in water. This has strong implications on how to implement the EU zero pollution action plan to significantly improve water ecosystem and human health protection.

Disappearing Arctic tundra ponds: Fine-scale analysis of surface hydrology in drained thaw lake basins over a 65year period (1948-2013)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Long-term fine-scale dynamics of surface hydrology in Arctic tundra ponds (less than 1ha) are largely unknown; however, these small water bodies may contribute substantially to carbon fluxes, energy balance, and biodiversity in the Arctic system. Change in pond area and abundance across the upper Barrow Peninsula, Alaska, was assessed by comparing historic aerial imagery (1948) and modern submeter resolution satellite imagery (2002, 2008, and 2010). This was complemented by photogrammetric analysis of low-altitude kite-borne imagery in combination with field observations (2010-2013) of pond water and thaw depth transects in seven ponds of the International Biological Program historic research site. Over 2800 ponds in 22 drained thaw lake basins (DTLB) with different geological ages were analyzed. We observed a net decrease of 30.3% in area and 17.1% in number of ponds over the 62year period. The inclusion of field observations of pond areas in 1972 from a historic research site confirms the linear downward trend in area. Pond area and number were dependent on the age of DTLB; however, changes through time were independent of DTLB age, with potential long-term implications for the hypothesized geomorphologic landscape succession of the thaw lake cycle. These losses were coincident with increases in air temperature, active layer, and density and cover of aquatic emergent plants in ponds. Increased evaporation due to warmer and longer summers, permafrost degradation, and transpiration from encroaching aquatic emergent macrophytes are likely the factors contributing to the decline in surface area and number of ponds.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR	2015	120	3					466	479		10.1002/2014JG002778	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JG002778													WOS:000353046200006

So far, these triggers have been related mostly to nutrients as the immediate driver. During May 2004 the rio Cruces wetland, a Ramsar site located in Southern Chile, underwent a major regime shift, from a clear water state, vastly dominated by the invasive macrophyte Egeria densa, to a turbid water state. In this article we show, through the analysis of long-term meteorological data that late fall 2004 was anomalous due to the presence of a high-pressure cell that persisted most of the month of May over Southern Chile. This climatic event caused an almost complete absence of precipitations and lower temperatures during this period, including several freezing nights. Eco-physiological experiments showed that 6 h exposure to desiccation kill the macrophyte. We developed a simple-biology dynamic model, under Stella Research 9.1, to show that the climatic anomaly of May 2004, plus the increased sedimentation of the wetland's floodplains, and the associated response of E. densa, explains its sudden disappearance from rio Cruces wetland.

J	HUGHES, RJ; REED, A; GAUTHIER, G				HUGHES, RJ; REED, A; GAUTHIER, G			SPACE AND HABITAT USE BY GREATER SNOW GOOSE BROODS ON BYLOT ISLAND, NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The brood-rearing season is a critical time for arctic-breeding geese because plant production is low and the growing season short. Thus, parental geese must efficiently exploit resources if young are to acquire adequate size and condition in preparation for fall migration. Current knowledge of habitat and space use by arctic-breeding geese is limited to some observations of unmarked birds. Thus, we studied habitat and space use of individual radio-marked greater snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) in a high arctic environment. We radiotracked 20 goose families throughout the brood-rearing period in July and August 1989 and 1990, in a 70-km2 area of wet tundra and upland habitats on Bylot Island, Northwest Territories. Average use of habitat by radio-marked families was similar to that of unmarked geese, but individual space and habitat use patterns varied considerably. We identified 3 space use groups: sedentary (use of a single concentrated area of activity) families, shifters (use of >1 concentrated area), and wanderers (no concentrated area of activity). Home-range sizes for the 3 groups averaged 680, 1,660, and 1,820 ha, respectively. Initial movements between the nest and brood-rearing site ranged from <1 to 5 km for individual families in all 3 groups, but subsequent movements were greater for shifters (P < 0.001) and wanderers (P < 0.001) than for sedentary families. Sedentary families used a greater proportion of habitats with abundant ponds and lakes, compared with families in the other 2 groups, which used more upland habitat. Young of sedentary families tended to hatch earlier than those of shifters or wanderers, suggesting that sedentary females were more experienced individuals. Differences in use of habitat among families may account for some variation observed in body mass of goslings captured prior to fledging.

We examine how phosphorus released through salmon decomposition and other environmental factors potentially limit primary productivity in two Lake Ontario tributaries in New York State. Contribution of phosphorus (measured as total phosphorus) from salmon carcasses, computed as the percentage of the estimated phosphorus discharged from the stream, was very low (<1 %.yr-1), but of modest importance (>50%.d-1) during restricted periods in the spring. Experimental results from three stream sites demonstrated that phosphorus, which is present naturally at high concentrations, is not limiting primary productivity during the period that the salmon are in the streams. Finally, results from an analysis of 1 5 free-water oxygen studies indicate that the streams are productive (gross primary production 0.9-10.2 g O2.m2-d-1) and that light appears to limit stream primary productivity more than nutrients. We conclude that salmon migrations are unlikely to substantially increase the rate of primary productivity in these already fertile streams.					; McDowell, William/E-9767-2010	McDowell, William/0000-0002-8739-9047; Kennen, Jonathan/0000-0002-5426-4445; 													0706-652X					NOV	1992	49	11					2377	2385		10.1139/f92-262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-262													WOS:A1992KF38800020

Usually, the jets are closely related to winter snowstorms, wildfire spreading and air pollution dispersion. However, our knowledge on the northerly low-level jets is quite limited. In this study, an ensemble simulated approach, which is based on the WRF-LETKF ensemble Kalman filter numerical prediction/data assimilation system, is used to investigate a northerly low-level jet (N-LLJ) occurred on 1st October 2014 over the state of Indiana during the INFLUX experiment. The simulations are carefully verified by using the Halo Streamline Doppler lidar Profiler data and flight observational datasets. Results show that, the ensemble simulations are more efficient to reproduce the N-LLJ than a single simulation. Based on the ensemble simulation results, the characteristics and mechanisms of the formation and evolution of the N-LLJ are further studied. It is shown that the N-LLJ exhibits typical meso-scale characteristics. Both the increased negative buoyancy and the thermal wind imbalance caused by synoptic frontogenesis are responsible for the formation of this N-LLJ. However, controlled by a shallow large scale system, this N-LLJ does not show significant diurnal cycles. Besides, the comparisons among the ensembles imply that the strength of the N-LLJ is closely related to the intensity of negative buoyancy and frontogenesis.																			0169-8095	1873-2895				NOV 15	2018	213						361	369		10.1016/j.atmosres.2018.06.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2018.06.018													WOS:000442169800030

Hominin diversity in the Middle Pliocene of eastern Africa: the maxilla of KNM-WT 40000	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The 3.5-Myr-old hominin cranium KNM-WT 40000 from Lomekwi, west of Lake Turkana, has been assigned to a new hominin genus and species, Kenyanthropus platyops, on the basis of a unique combination of derived facial and primitive neurocranial features. Central to the diagnosis of K. platyops is the morphology of the maxilla, characterized by a flat and relatively orthognathic subnasal region, anteriorly placed zygomatic processes and small molars. To study this morphology in more detail, we compare the maxillae of African Plio-Pleistocene hominin fossils and samples of modern humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, using conventional and geometric morphometric methods. Computed tomography scans and detailed preparation of the KNM-WT 40000 maxilla enable comprehensive assessment of post-mortem changes, so that landmark data characterizing the morphology can be corrected for distortion. Based on a substantially larger comparative sample than previously available, the results of statistical analyses show that KNM-WT 40000 is indeed significantly different from and falls outside the known range of variation of species of Australopithecus and Paranthropus, contemporary Australopithecus afarensis in particular. These results support the attribution of KNM-WT 40000 to a separate species and the notion that hominin taxonomic diversity in Africa extends back well into the Middle Pliocene.

This paper synthesizes pollen, delta C-13, eolian, and paleohydrological proxies to document the spatial and temporal patterns in the onset and rate of drying. The timing of onset ranged from 14 to 6 ka with most sites drying between 10 and 8 ka (calendar years ago). The dominant spatial pattern is time transgressive, with interior Great Plains sites beginning to dry before peripheral sites. This time-transgressive trend can be explained as a region-wide drying that caused ecotones to shift eastward, or could indicate a progressive shift in atmospheric drying from west to east. One-third of sites responded rapidly to drying; a cluster of rapid responses occurred ca. 8 ka. The combination of onsets between 14 and 6 ka and rapid responses at 8 ka strongly suggests that (1) the combination of high summer insolation, Laurentide Ice Sheet retreat, and Lake Agassiz drainage drove midcontinental drying, and (2) drying accelerated with Laurentide Ice Sheet collapse at 8.4 ka. Local factors strongly mediate the timing and rate of site responses to regional drying. Local responses to future drying in the Great Plains also should be highly variable, which challenges impact assessments of future climate changes.

The Cloud -Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite simultaneously detected a multitude of smoke aerosols surrounding the same area. Combing a Lagrangian Flexible Particle dispersion model (FLEXPART) executed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output, the transport of smoke aerosols and the quantification of impact of Russian forest fires on the Asia were investigated. From model simulations, two transport paths were determined for the smoke plumes from the Russian forest fires. The first path was directed southwestward from Russia to Central Asia and eventually Xinjiang Province of China, furthermore, the second path was directed southeastward through Mongolia to Northeast China. The FLEXPART-WRF model simulations also revealed that the smoke aerosol concentrations entering the Central Asia, Mongolia and Northern China were approximately 60-300 mu g m(-3), 40-250 mu g m(-3) and 5-140 mu g m(-3), respectively. Meanwhile, the aerosol particles from these forest fires have an impact on the air quality in Asia. With the arrival of smoke aerosols from the Russian forest fires, the near-surface PM10 concentrations over Altay, Hulunbuir and Harbin increased to 61, 146 and 42 mu g m(-3), respectively. In conclusion, smoke aerosols from Russian forest fires can variably influence the air quality over Central Asia, Mongolia and Northern China.

METABOLOMICS CONFIRMS THAT DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON MITIGATES COPPER TOXICITY	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Reductions in atmospheric emissions from the metal smelters in Sudbury, Canada, produced major improvements in acid and metal contamination of local lakes and indirectly increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Metal toxicity, however, has remained a persistent problem for aquatic biota. Integrating high-throughput, nontargeted mass spectrometry metabolomics with conventional toxicological measures elucidated the mediating effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the toxicity of Cu to Daphnia pulex-pulicaria, a hybrid isolated from these soft water lakes. Two generations of daphniids were exposed to Cu (0-20g/L) at increasing levels of natural DOM (0-4mg DOC/L). Added DOM reduced Cu toxicity monotonically with median lethal concentration values increasing from 2.3g/L Cu without DOM to 22.7g/L Cu at 4mg DOC/L. Reproductive output similarly benefited, increasing with DOM, yet falling with increases in Cu. Second generation reproduction was more impaired than the first generation. Dissolved organic matter had a greater influence than Cu on the metabolic status of the daphniids. Putative identification of metabolite peaks indicated that DOM elevation increased the metabolic energy status of the first generation animals, but this benefit was reduced in the second generation, although evidence of increased oxidative stress was detected. These results indicate that Sudbury's terrestrial ecosystems should be managed to increase aquatic DOM supply to enable daphniid colonists to both survive and foster stable populations.

Here we use an existing hypolimnetic oxygen model to define the lower boundary of the optimal habitat by identifying the depth at which 6 mg.L-1 oxygen occurs at the end-of-summer stratification period. Then we develop a new model to predict the 10 degreesC depth or upper habitat boundary for the same date. These two boundaries can be used in conjunction with measured individual strata volumes to calculate the optimal habitat volume. Parameters needed for the models include lake morphometry, total phosphorus (TP) concentration, and Secchi depth or dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. Thus, the optimal habitat model can be used to predict the effects on optimal habitat volumes of changes in trophic status (increases or decreases in TP), or changes in light transmission (caused by changes in DOC or its surrogate in these lakes, i.e., Secchi depth) that result from changes in climate, land use, acid-base status, or incident ultraviolet radiation levels.

However, the southern Tibetan Plateau (STP) is an exception, where summer monsoon precipitation amount has decreased, and lakes have shrunk. The cause for the precipitation decrease is not clear yet. Here we show that the monsoon (June to September) mean precipitation changes in the STP from 1979 to 2018 features a decadal variation component with a peak of around 10 years that is superposed on an upward 'trend' from 1979 to 1998 and a downward 'trend' afterward. We find that the decadal variation of the STP precipitation is associated with a large-scale dipolar sea surface temperature (SST) pattern between the equatorial central Pacific and the Indo-Pacific warm pool. A wet STP corresponds to negative SST anomaly in the equatorial central Pacific and positive SST anomaly in the Indo-Pacific warm pool. This equatorial SST gradient in the western Pacific generates pronounced easterly anomalies and a dipolar rainfall anomaly (i.e. a positive rainfall anomaly over the Maritime Continent and a negative anomaly in the equatorial western and central Pacific). Due to less precipitation over the equatorial western Pacific, the suppressed heat source appears to excite an anomalous anticyclonic band along 15-20 degrees N extending from the Philippine Sea to the Bay of Bengal by emanating westward propagating descending transient Rossby waves. The low-level anticyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal further enhances northward moisture transport toward the STP and promote upward motion in the STP through changing local meridional circulation. Besides, the linearized atmospheric general circulation model experiments demonstrate that the dipole heating source can generate a high-pressure zone under the control of anticyclone over the western Pacific, which can extend westward to the Indian monsoon region.

Subsequent total organic carbon (TOC) content measurements and rock-eval analysis showed that the black shale section was generally classified as excellent source rock, with TOC contents commonly over 12% and an average genetic potential reaching 90 mg HC/g rock. The black shale samples of the Yanchang Formation contain kerogen of types I and II1, indicating the presence of oil source rocks, and the T-max values range from 438 to 442 degrees C, which indicate a maturity stage in the early oil window. To reconstruct the depositional environment of the black shales with high TOC contents, various geochemical elements and their ratios were analyzed, yielding a number of interesting results: (i) the paleoclimate indexes CIA, CIW and C-values range from 50 to 72 (mean 65), 56 to 85 (mean 75), and 0.8 to 2.6 (mean 1.5), respectively, indicating humid conditions during the sedimentation period of the black shales; (ii) the redox conditions during the sedimentation of the black shales were dysoxic to anoxic as evidenced by the cross-plot of V/Cr vs. V/(V + Ni); (iii) the water column environment was a deep, fresh-water lake, further confirming the moist paleoclimate and reducing environment; and (iv) the high TOC contents of the black shales are attributed to inputs from hydrothermal fluids as evidenced by the samples falling into or near to the hydrothermal area of the Ni/Cr vs. Ti plot and the Ti vs. V plot.					he, cong/KJM-7213-2024; Su, Ao/AAY-2224-2021; Ji, Liming/B-2573-2013	li, jing/0000-0002-4180-2400; Wu, Yuandong/0000-0002-3566-0733; 													0920-4105	1873-4715				FEB	2019	173						899	911		10.1016/j.petrol.2018.10.089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2018.10.089													WOS:000455118800076

The Preservation of Climate-Driven Landslide Dams in Western Oregon	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Bedrock landsliding, including the formation of landslide dams, is a predominant geomorphic process in steep landscapes. Clarifying the importance of hydrologic and seismic mechanisms for triggering deep-seated landslides remains an ongoing effort, and formulation of geomorphic metrics that predict dam preservation is crucial for quantifying secondary landslide hazards. Here, we identify >200 landslide-dammed lakes in western Oregon and utilize dendrochronology and enhanced C-14 dating ("wiggle matching") of "ghost forests" to establish slope failure timing at 20 sites. Our dated landslide dataset reveals bedrock landsliding has been common since the last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake in January 1700 AD. Our study does not reveal landslides that date to 1700 AD. Rather, we observe temporal clustering of at least four landslides in the winter of 1889/1890 AD, coincident with a series of atmospheric rivers that generated one of the largest regionally recorded floods. We use topographic and field analyses to assess the relation between dam preservation and topographic characteristics of the impounded valleys. In contrast to previous studies, we do not observe systematic scaling between dam size and upstream drainage area, though dam stability indices for our sites correspond with "stable" dams elsewhere. Notably, we observe that dams are preferentially preserved at drainage areas of similar to 1.5 to 13 km(2) and valley widths of similar to 25 to 80 m, which may reflect the reduced downstream influence of debris flows and the accumulation of mature conifer trees upstream from landslide-dammed lake outlets. We suggest that wood accumulation upstream of landslide dams tempers large stream discharges, thus inhibiting dam incision.

J	STONEBURNER, DL; SMOCK, LA				STONEBURNER, DL; SMOCK, LA			PLANKTON COMMUNITIES OF AN ACIDIC, POLYMICTIC, BROWN-WATER LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The plankton of an acidic, polymictic, brown-water lake was investigated over 1 yr. The phytoplankton community was dominated by Chlamydomonas sp., Melosira varians and Peridinium pusillum during different times of the year. Densities were abnormally low, with a maximum of only 13,781 individuals/l during the March bloom. The water column was nearly void of phytoplankton during the fall. These low densities were attributed to several of the physical and chemical characteristics of the water, including low pH, low levels of nutrients and light limitation. The latter factor was important because of low light transmission into the highly colored water, shading from macrophytes and the nearly continuous transport of the phytoplankton into the aphotic zone due to mixing of the water column by sea breezes. The zooplankton was dominated by Diaptomus floridanus, Polyarthra vulgaris, Keratella cochlearis and Daphnia ambigua. The observed densities were typical of southeastern oligotrophic lakes. The zooplankton community did not exhibit a decrease in density that corresponded with the observed low phytoplankton densities, suggesting the possibility that they relied heavily on bacterial and detrital food sources.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	69	1-2					131	137		10.1007/BF00016542	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016542													WOS:A1980JM32400016

However, inefficiency and excessive independence on expert knowledge limits the usage of HRS images on a large scale. As a knowledge organization and representation method, ontology can assist in improving the efficiency of automatic or semi-automatic land cover information extraction, especially for HRS images. This paper presents an ontology-based framework that was used to model the land cover extraction knowledge and interpret HRS remote sensing images at the regional level. The land cover ontology structure is explicitly defined, accounting for the spectral, textural, and shape features, and allowing for the automatic interpretation of the extracted results. With the help of regional prototypes for land cover class stored in Web Ontology Language (OWL) file, automated land cover extraction of the study area is then attempted. Experiments are conducted using ZY-3 (Ziyuan-3) imagery, which were acquired for the Jiangxia District, Wuhan, China, in the summers of 2012 and 2013. The experimental method provided good land cover extraction results as the overall accuracy reached 65.07%. Especially for bare surfaces, highways, ponds, and lakes, whose producer and user accuracies were both higher than 75%. The results highlight the capability of the ontology-based method to automatically extract land cover using ZY-3 HRS images.

The behavior of rare-earth elements, Zr and Hf during biologically-mediated deposition of silica-stromatolites and carbonate-rich microbial mats	GONDWANA RESEARCH												Venere Lake, in the Pantelleria Island thermal system (Central Mediterranean Sea) consists of a mix of seawater and hydrothermal volcanic fluids containing high levels of dissolved SiO2. Close to the lake's thermal springs, siliceous stromatolites are deposed under high bacterial activity conditions whereas roughly interlaminated Ca-carbonates and microbial mats are widely scattered in the lake. The dissolved REE speciation in lake waters is dominated by [REE(CO3)(2)](-) [REE(CO3)](+) and [REE(H3SiO4)](2+) complexes. On the contrary the most abundant Zr and Hf species are hydroxyl- and fluoride-complexes. The behavior of REE Zr and Hf in the Venere lake waters is controlled by precipitation of amorphous silica, carbonates and bacterial activity. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns in stromatolites are characterized by positive La anomalies, superchondritic Y/Ho ratios and negative Eu anomalies. The Eu depletion is also found in microbial mats where is associated to a "chondritic" Y/Ho signature. Zr and Hf differently behave in dissolved phase and in newly-formed siliceous and carbonatic material: Hf reacts easily into amorphous silica surfaces whereas Zr is preferentially partitioned onto phosphate binding sites on microbial cell surfaces similar to the observed behavior of heavy REE (HREE). We suggest that the Zr-Hf relationship reflect the interface processes between mineral phases and bacterial membranes or compounds produced by bacterial activity.

LARS-WG's calibration and validation results show that the model can generate future climatic data. PET's future projection was based on the LARS-WG model's forecast of future temperatures. The results revealed that the increment in PET under the scenario of RCP8.5 is higher than RCP4.5. Monthly PET is expected to rise from 5.70% to 18.09%, with the smallest in October and the largest in May. Its increment is most noticeable in the spring. PET is projected to rise by up to 15.70% as the annual mean temperature rises to 2.04 degrees C. Future climate change projections could have a significant impact on PET, which influences the water cycle and could pose a drought risk in the research area.																			1758-2083	1758-2091					2023	31	2					165	177		10.1504/IJGW.2023.133981	http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJGW.2023.133981													WOS:001084488700002

However, the characteristics of extreme climate events, especially extreme precipitation, frequently show complex variations in the context of climate change. Taking the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLR-YR) in China as a case study, extreme daily precipitation during 1961-2012 was analyzed from the aspects of frequency and intensity. The changes in extreme daily precipitation in the MLR-YR were further attributed to several factors, including large-scale circulation, hydrologic engineering and local topography. Our analyses indicate that both frequency and intensity of the extreme daily precipitation in the MLR-YR showed overall increasing trends from 1961 to 2012. The increase could be associated with weakened East Asian summer monsoon in past decades. In addition, inverse trends could also be found locally between the frequency and the intensity. For instance, extreme precipitation intensity revealed an enhanced trend in the western part of the middle reach of the Yangtze River, while extreme precipitation frequency showed decreasing trends in this region. These phenomena could be associated with the effects of some local factors (e.g., lake regulation, hydropower engineering, topography). Our study highlights the important role of local factors on extreme precipitation changes.					; wang, kun/LVR-9889-2024; Pei, Fengsong/GVS-5972-2022; Zhou, Yi/NWG-8423-2025	Pei, Fengsong/0000-0001-8239-9542; Zhou, Yi/0000-0001-7939-4353; 														2073-4441				DEC	2017	9	12							943	10.3390/w9120943	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9120943													WOS:000419225500037

Reactivity continuum of dissolved organic carbon decomposition in lake water	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												We determined microbial decomposition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over 3.7 year long dark bioassays of six Swedish lake waters. The overall lost DOC fraction was similar in clearwater lakes (34.8 +/- 2.4%) and in brownwater lakes (37.8 +/- 1.9%). Reactivity continuum modeling revealed that the most labile DOC fraction, degrading at rates >0.01 d(-1), was larger in the clearwater lakes (11.1 +/- 1.2%) than in the brownwater lakes (0.8 +/- 0.1%). The initial apparent first-order decay coefficient k was fivefold larger in the clearwater lakes (0.0043 +/- 0.0012 d(-1)) than in the brownwater lakes (0.0009 +/- 0.0003 d(-1)). Over time, k decreased more steeply in the clearwater lakes than in the brownwater lakes, reaching the k of the brownwater lakes within 5 months. Finally, k averaged 0.0001 d(-1) in both lake categories. In the brownwater lakes, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption decayed with an initial k twice as large (0.0018 +/- 0.0008 d(-1)) as that of DOC. The initial k was inversely correlated with initial specific UV absorption and CDOM absorption and positively correlated with initial tryptophan-like fluorescence as proxy for autochthonous DOC. Exposure to simulated sunlight at the end of the incubations caused loss of color in the clearwater lakes and loss of DOC in the brownwater lakes, where subsequent mineralization was also stimulated. The DOC lost in the absence of photochemical processes fell below previously reported watershed-scale losses in Sweden by 25% at most. This suggests that a major part of the in situ DOC loss could potentially be attributed to dark reactions alone.

J	Xue, HP; Zeng, FM				Xue, Hongpan; Zeng, Fangming			Holocene environmental evolution in the Qinghai Lake area recorded by aeolian deposits	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Aeolian deposits, widely distributed in the Qinghai Lake area, provide independently palaeoclimatic information. Herein we report the detailed investigation results of Gangcha (GC) and Reshui (RS) sections, located at the northern Qinghai Lake area. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) and Al2O3-(CaO*+Na2O)-K2O (A-CN-K) ternary diagram suggest that most of the sediments experienced the degree of weak and moderate chemical weathering. The study area had undergone the great alternation between wet and dry climate, reflected by the variation of CIA values. The accumulation hiatus in the palaeosol layer was identified in the RS section. Our comprehensive results indicate that the relatively dry climate conditions and strong aeolian activity occurred from 11.0 to 7.5 ka in the Qinghai Lake area, in agreement with widespread aeolian sand deposits and loess deposits in the investigated aeolian sections. The middle Holocene (from 7.5 to 3.0 ka) was characterized by humid climate conditions and weak aeolian activity, supported by commonly developed palaeosol deposits in the Qinghai Lake area. After 3.0 ka, the aeolian activity was again strengthened due to drier climate conditions. The variations of summer insolation and the Asian monsoon may cause the increase or decrease of effective moisture, thereby result in the climate changes between dry and wet in the Qinghai Lake area.

As primary productivity increased during spring, the delta(13)C of photic-zone POM increased from -34parts per thousand to -24parts per thousand. This C-13 enrichment reflects decreasing C-isotope fractionation between organic and inorganic carbon pools in response to decreasing surface water [CO2(aq)]. Variations in the delta(15)N of surface-water POM (+2parts per thousand to +8parts per thousand) collected during the productive period were attributed to isotope effects associated with nitrate uptake, nitrogen fixation, and mixing of different organic matter sources. The apparent N-isotope enrichment (epsilon) associated with nitrate assimilation varied with epsilon = - 1.0parts per thousand +/- 0.9 for diatoms and epsilon = - 3.4parts per thousand +/- 0.4 for green algae. The mechanisms controlling the N-isotopic composition of surface-water nitrate include the combined processes of nitrate assimilation, nitrification, mixing of water masses, and external nitrate loading. There was no consistent relation between the delta(15)N of POM, the delta(15)N of nitrate, and the nitrate concentration in surface waters. Low delta(13)C (-60parts per thousand) of POM from the benthic nepheloid layer (BNL) indicated that as much as 80% of the POM in the BNL consisted of methanotrophic bacteria. The delta(13)C and delta(15)N of near-bottom POM allowed tracing a "bacteriocline", which rose with the expanding volume of bottom-water suboxia. Associated with the development of anaerobic conditions and coupled to decreasing [NO3-], the delta(15)N of bottom-water nitrate progressively increased from +8parts per thousand to +27parts per thousand, indicating active denitrification in the hypolimnion. This study demonstrates the potential of natural-abundance level measurements of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to trace biogeochemical processes in lakes. However, the delta(15)N of POM in eutrophic lakes is of limited use as an indicator of the degree of nitrate utilization and trophic state.

Estimation of ice thickness on lakes using artificial neural network ensembles	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Artificial neural network ensemble (ANN ensemble) prediction is a technique in which the outputs of a set of separately trained ANNs are combined to form one unified prediction. ANN ensemble models are developed in this paper to improve the results of single artificial neural network (single ANN) for the estimation of the ice thickness in a number of selected Canadian lakes during the early winter ice growth period. An effective ensemble consists of a set of ANNs that may not be highly performing when they are used separately, but have their prediction errors greatly reduced once combined. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a number of ensemble techniques including randomization, bagging and boosting for creating members of an ensemble, then averaging and stacking techniques for combining ensemble members. The experiments show that, in the context of estimation of lake ice thickness, boosting is much better than randomization, and sometimes better than bagging. Stacking was found to be more competitive than averaging. Overall, ANN ensemble models for the estimation of ice thickness proved to be more accurate than single ANN models, especially when boosting is used for combining ensemble members and when stacking is used to combine the outputs from individual members. ANN ensembles achieve the best generalization performance when the ensemble size is increased to around 20. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using GIS to display complex soil salinity patterns in an inland salt marsh	CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY	Developments in Environmental Science											Inland salt marshes are found near salt lakes and desert springs in areas of high evaporation and low precipitation. Spatial and seasonal fluctuations of the soil salinity levels are assumed to be associated with local climate. However, topography complicates the general soil salinity patterns attributed to climate. To better demonstrate and display these spatial and temporal relationships, soil salinity data were gathered over a ten-month period and then examined with a geographic information system software package. A variety of surface contour plots can be generated depending on the software used, the interpolation method, and the input variables chosen. To demonstrate some of this variation, surface plots were interpolated using the inverse distance weighted method in ArcView 3.3 and the ordinary kriging method in ArcGIS 8. Various methods and settings should be examined to create the clearest interpolated surface to present the collected data. Using the same data, ordinary kriging generated a gradual, smooth surface while the overall quality of the inverse distance weighted surface was irregular. The ordinary kriging method produced mean error and root-mean-square error statistics closer to zero indicating it would generally yield a better estimation of the soil salinity. The surfaces generated showed some seasonal fluctuation in soil salinity but spatial changes were more distinct. The low-elevation areas in the center of the salt marsh had low levels of soil salinity while the marsh edges at slightly higher elevations had increased levels of soil salinity. The spatial patterns of soil salinity appear to depend on seasonality, specifically rainfall and plant activity and the amount of water present in the salt marsh. However, local surface anomalies can mask these patterns. Through the use of global information systems (GIS) and interpolation some of the masking effects can be reduced revealing the underlying patterns.																			1474-8177		978-0-08-054973-6				2007	5						407	431		10.1016/S1474-8177(07)05019-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1474-8177(07)05019-X													WOS:000310534300020

The method is based on the assumption that the influence of each environmental factor on the life of a species can be expressed by an S-shaped function having lethal, limiting and non-limiting ranges, and the combined effect of several environmental factors is expressed by a multiple of these functions. To single out a lethal factor, we used the cumulative curve of abundance arranged in the order of each environmental factor. Comparison of these curves enables us to identify the most effective environmental factor limiting the life of a particular species and determine its effective range. Determination can be made from a single field observation without recourse to specially prepared experimental data if a sufficiently extensive survey was made in a field observation.

J	Rith-Najarian, JC				Rith-Najarian, JC			The influence of forest vegetation variables on the distribution and diversity of dragonflies in a northern Minnesota forest landscape: A preliminary study (Anisoptera)	ODONATOLOGICA												Dragonfly communities were surveyed at 24 sites in 2 adjacent study regions, during the summer of 1994. In each of the 2 regions, 12 sites were grouped into 3 different study areas based on forest status. Forest status was determined by stand age and time since last logging disturbance, resulting in study areas defined as old-growth forest, mature second-growth forest, or recently clear-cut areas. Study sites within each forest-status study area included stream, pond, lake, and bog/swamp habitats. Recently-cleared forest areas exhibited the lowest species number and species diversity, while the greatest species number and diversity were found in the old-growth study areas. These differences were correlated with different vegetation structure variables characteristic of each forest-status study area. Furthermore, Beta-diversity, indicating changes in species composition across the forest-status gradient in each study area, was greater between the sites adjacent to the smallest old-growth forest "habitat island". These findings may be of importance in understanding dragonfly response to forest disturbance in the northern Minnesota landscape mosaic.																			0375-0183					SEP 1	1998	27	3					335	351																WOS:000075597600004
J	RITCHIE, JC				RITCHIE, JC			A HOLOCENE POLLEN RECORD OF BOREAL FOREST HISTORY FROM THE TRAVAILLANT LAKE AREA, LOWER MACKENZIE RIVER BASIN	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												A 396-cm sediment sequence from a lake in the boreal woodland zone near Travaillant Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, provides a Holocene record of pollen percentages and species interactions. Three local pollen assemblage zones are described: a Betula-Populus-Juniperus zone from 10,500 to 9000 yr BP, a Picea-Betula zone from 9000 to 5100 yr BP, and a Picea-Betula-Alnus zone from 5100 yr BP to the present. The earliest vegetation recorded at this site is a mosaic of poplar groves, juniper and Shepherdia shrub, and fragmentary patches of tundra, replaced rapidly by spruce woodland at roughly 8500 yr BP, dominated initially by Picea glauca. P. mariana spread extensively between 8500 and 5000 yr BP, probably as a function of increasing paludification. The present spruce-dominated vegetation was in place by 5000 yr BP. Some changes in the pollen record can be explained by the Milankovitch early Holocene period of warmer summers followed by a cooling to modern conditions by 5000 yr BP. Others require explanations in terms of edaphic factors or biological interactons among the main taxa.																			0008-4026						1984	62	7					1385	1392		10.1139/b84-188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b84-188													WOS:A1984TC69600009

Identifying the ancient glacial deposits and their associated sedimentary structures are of paramount significance for understanding the Earth's climate in the Cryogenian Period. Ice-induced sedimentary structures (IISS) are considered as types of primary structures preserved on surfaces and in upper parts of unconsolidated sediments by physical cryospheric processes of seasonal ice freezing and thawing, and therefore sensitive not only to climate, but also to paleogeography, hydrology, and type of environment. Despite the common occurrence of modern IISS in a wide variety of environments, from high-latitude regions to lowlatitude areas of high altitude, available records from ancient geologic archives are scarce. Herein, we integrated sedimentological and geochemical proxies to study IISS and geochemical signals as reliable indicators of cold climate in an outstanding example of the Eocene-Oligocene interval from the Niubao Formation in the Lunpola Basin, central Tibet. Detailed field sedimentological, petrographic microscopic investigations, and bulk carbonate oxygen (818Ocarb) and carbon (813Ccarb) isotope geochemistry were conducted in this lacustrine succession. Seven sets of IISS are represented by ice crystal marks, frozen cracks, ice-frozen bubbles, ice-expanding laminae, ice-rafted debris (dropstones), ice water pea-like, and ice water pits. They are classified into three groups based on major deriving mechanisms: ice-related crystal marks, deformation-related ice structures, and gravitational fall IISS. Positive 818Ocarb excursions at the Eocene-Oligocene transition provide evidence of a shift toward cold or near-freezing climatic snaps in response to global cooling episodes at this time. Integrating the paleogeomorphic scenario of central Tibet with the stratigraphically reported IISS and glendonite clusters, the results support that the Lunpola lake sustained cold or near-freezing conditions at Eocene-Oligocene transition. These findings provide one of the most comprehensive sedimentological and isotopic analyses of ancient IISS and a more direct spatial-temporal constraint for the regional climate system of central Tibet.					; Mansour, Ahmed/AAR-4969-2020; Ahmed, Mohamed/GQP-1116-2022; Radwan, Ahmed/M-1034-2017	radwan, ahmed/0000-0002-3011-5832; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR 1	2024	637								112010	10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.112010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.112010		JAN 2024											WOS:001153898000001

In the present paper, 287 matchup data obtained from ten experimental sites by three organizations are analyzed. The radiance difference of OBC and VC shows almost no correlation with surface temperature and precipitable water vapor at each experimental site, but shows some dependence on the type of the experimental site. For example, the OBC-VC comparisons at Cold Springs Reservoir (NV) which is a small water body shows some bias due to the straylight effect of ASTER/TIR. The comparisons at Lake Kussharo covered by snow also show some bias maybe because of an extrapolation effect of ASTER radiometric calibration. The comparisons at Mauna Loa lava flows show a large deviation due to non-uniformity of surface temperature caused by the rough surface. Except for these cases, the results show that the latest version of radiometric calibration coefficients (version 3.x) for ASTER/TIR has been keeping the designed accuracy (1 K for the temperature range of 270 to 320 K).					; Hook, Simon/D-5920-2016; Tonooka, Hideyuki/IWD-9992-2023	Tonooka, Hideyuki/0000-0002-4866-5955; Kato, Soushi/0000-0002-6708-593X; Hook, Simon/0000-0002-0953-6165; 													2153-6996		978-1-4577-1005-6				2011							3653	3656		10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6050016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6050016													WOS:000297496303159

In this study, we reconstruct a Holocene wildfire history using soot record from Qinghai Lake sediments in the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau. This record reflects climate change on a regional scale. Except for enhanced wildfire activity during the middle-late Holocene when climate became dry, the results also show rapid increasing periods of wildfire centered at ca. 1.6, 2.5, 4.1, 4.9, 6.3, 7.8, 9.6, 10.5 and 11.4 calibrated kiloyears before present (cal ka BP) that are strongly correlated with abrupt climate events. Drought climate in association with a weakened monsoon appear to be the major factor driving the increase of wildfires on suborbital and millennial timescales, likely modulated by solar radiation (activity). Potential human activities may promote wildfire occurrences and enhance soot emissions to some extent as well. The connection of wildfire with millennial timescale abrupt dry/cold climate events may differ from the broad expectation of increased fire occurrences in warmer periods and can provide new insights for fire prediction.

Cation exchange within burnt catchments resulted in proton flux and a 9% reduction in mean pH. Lakes in burnt catchments contained more than twofold higher (P << 0.01) mean concentrations of total, total dissolved, and soluble reactive phosphorus, 1.5-fold higher (P << 0.01) concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, and more than 1.2-fold higher (P < 0.05) concentrations of total and total dissolved nitrogen, nitrate + nitrite, and ammonium compared with reference lakes. Total phosphorus concentration explained 86% of the variance in reference lake chlorophyll concentration but was not related to chlorophyll concentration in burnt lakes. Analysis of chlorophyll - total phosphorus residuals suggested that algae in burn-impacted lakes were light limited. With the addition of five lakes burnt between 1961 and 1985, time since disturbance and percent disturbance combined explained 74% of the variance in total phosphorus among burnt lakes. Fire caused increased flux of materials to the study lakes with slow recovery over decades.

This Pantanal region is known for its tourist and scenic value, covering springs and rivers with extensive formation of active limestone tufa. Six species of Dorofeyukea were investigated under light and electron microscopy. The genus is characterized by a narrow stauroid fascia surrounded by some irregularly shortened striae, uniseriate slightly radiated striae, areolae circular or rectangular covered internally by a hymenes and apical pseudosepta. Four new species are described and compared with similar taxa Dorofeyukea bahlsii sp. nov., D. bodoquenensis sp. nov., D. calcarea sp. nov., and D. pantanalensis sp. nov. The new species are distinguished from each other and from similar taxa of Dorofeyukea mainly by the valve contour and shape of the apices.

Climate and human water use diminish wetland networks supporting continental waterbird migration	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Migrating waterbirds moving between upper and lower latitudinal breeding and wintering grounds rely on a limited network of endorheic lakes and wetlands when crossing arid continental interiors. Recent drying of global endorheic water stores raises concerns over deteriorating migratory pathways, yet few studies have considered these effects at the scale of continental flyways. Here, we investigate the resiliency of waterbird migration networks across western North America by reconstructing long-term patterns (1984-2018) of terminal lake and wetland surface water area in 26 endorheic watersheds. Findings were partitioned regionally by snowmelt- and monsoon-driven hydrologies and combined with climate and human water-use data to determine their importance in predicting surface water trends. Nonlinear patterns of lake and wetland drying were apparent along latitudinal flyway gradients. Pervasive surface water declines were prevalent in northern snowmelt watersheds (lakes -27%, wetlands -47%) while largely stable in monsoonal watersheds to the south (lakes -13%, wetlands +8%). Monsoonal watersheds represented a smaller proportion of total lake and wetland area, but their distribution and frequency of change within highly arid regions of the continental flyway increased their value to migratory waterbirds. Irrigated agriculture and increasing evaporative demands were the most important drivers of surface water declines. Underlying agricultural and wetland relationships however were more complex. Approximately 7% of irrigated lands linked to flood irrigation and water storage practices supported 61% of all wetland inundation in snowmelt watersheds. In monsoonal watersheds, small earthen dams, meant to capture surface runoff for livestock watering, were a major component of wetland resources (67%) that supported networks of isolated wetlands surrounding endorheic lakes. Ecological trends and human impacts identified herein underscore the importance of assessing flyway-scale change as our model depictions likely reflect new and emerging bottlenecks to continental migration.					; King, Stephanie/C-8633-2016	Silverman, Nick/0000-0003-0231-8605; Donnelly, Patrick/0000-0002-9910-0794; Collins, Dan/0000-0003-1113-4736; Moore, Johnnie/0000-0002-6634-2113; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				APR	2020	26	4					2042	2059		10.1111/gcb.15010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15010		FEB 2020						31967369					WOS:000513172700001
J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			SULFUR VS SILICA RETENTION IN OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE-SEDIMENTS - TEST OF A SIMPLE RESIDENCE TIME MODEL	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Limnologists have modeled solute retention (% of input) in lake sediments using the parameter: 100 k(s) {(z:t(w) + k(s)}(-1), where k, is an empirical mass transfer coefficient or 'sedimentation velocity' (m yr(-1)), z is lake mean depth (m), and t(w) is lake hydraulic residence time (yr). This flushing or residence time model was tested against sulfate and silica concentrations in lakes of the northeastern and northcentral U.S.A., using data collected during the U.S. EPA's Eastern Lake Survey. This parameter failed to predict intra-regional variations in lake sulfate at fall turnover, but was consistently negatively correlated with silica in each of the regional lake populations. However, except in the western section of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, lake sulfate was everywhere inversely dependent on DOC [mean slope = -0.020(SE = 0.03) meg mM(-1)]. Sulfur retention in aquatic environments appears more closely coupled to organic carbon and trophic state, than to variations in hydraulic residence time.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	1995	81	3-4					373	383		10.1007/BF01104022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01104022													WOS:A1995RM44500012

Results of chemical fractionation showed that total P (TP) content in sediment ranged from 443 to 611 mg kg(-1). Of the P fractions including inorganic P (IP) and organic P (OP), IP was a dominant component of TP and present in the form of P bounded to calcium (Ca-P) while the bioavailable P content bounded to Al, Fe, and Mn oxides and hydroxides (Fe/Al-P) varied from 14 to 102 mg kg(-1). The batch experiments showed that the sediments had appreciable maximum P adsorption capacity from 141.86 to 377.37 mg kg(-1). However, the zero P equilibrium concentration (C-eq(0)) in most sampling sites was larger than the P concentration in water column. Accordingly, the sediments from those sampling sites would release P into the overlying water at the positive P flux rates as a P release source. Significant positive correlation between P flux rates and Fe/Al-P revealed that the sediment P release would mainly originate from the bioavailable P fraction. It is evident that the inherent phosphorus present in lake sediments would be a major threat to the water quality and ecosystem reservation in Baiyangdian lake.

This study focusses on the mechanisms of sediment redistribution in the catchment of the Korabelny Stream, located at the western end of the Bellingshausen Ice Dome on King George Island (Shetland Islands). The catchment area of the stream covers 2.83 km2, with 1.17 km2 under the glacier. Two main sediment sources have been identified: a) the glacierized part, extending along the glacier edge and represented by a complex of moraine deposits lacking protective vegetation cover, along with part of the catchment under the glacier; b) the periglacial part, occupying territory with permafrost and a thin loose cover unevenly protected by early successional vegetation. We combine a tracer-based fingerprinting technique, sediment delivery estimates based on sediment flow connectivity index and geomorphological mapping to quantify the sources contribution to sediment yield. The proportional contribution of the glacierized part was 60-66 % of the total sediment yield based on two independent methods, suggesting the reliability of the results. It is noteworthy that sediment transport from the glacierized part exceeds that from the periglacial part. However, a significant portion of the sediment is redeposited in temporary reservoirs formed along the glacier edge and Lake Mesyats, located in the central part of the Korabelny Stream catchment. The main factor determining sediment yield in the catchment is the water reserves in snow at the beginning of the ablation season. In years when water reserves in snow significantly exceed longterm average values, such as observed in the austral summer of 2014-2015 when study was conducted, sediment yield was low. This is attributed to the faster melting of ice on the glacier compared to snow, due to differences in albedo.

Evaluation of anhydrosugars as a molecular proxy for paleofire activity: A case study on a Holocene sediment core from Agios Floros, Peloponnese, Greece	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The anhydrosugars, levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan, are regarded as suitable molecular indicators of natural biomass combustion. Here, we evaluate summed anhydrosugars (SAS) as a paleofire indicator in a 6000 year-long fossil core from Agios Floros fen, Peloponnese, Greece, by analyzing charcoal fragments in parallel, throughout the sediment sequence. Modern surface soil samples from the same region were analysed for the presence of SAS, confirming the biomarker as an indicator of recent fire activity. The highest SAS concentrations in the fossil core were found in sections representing periods of wet conditions, both on local and regional scales and regionally widespread arboreal vegetation. Low amounts, or the absence, of SAS in the fossil core were associated with periods of dryness, regional dominance of non-arboreal vegetation and the presence of a fen rather than a lake ecosystem at the site. Micro-charcoal fragments were generally more abundant under these conditions. This suggests that SAS yield and deposition may vary with fuel availability and fire behavior, which in turn is affected by climate, local moisture and vegetation type. Forest fires result in more SAS compared to grass fires. SAS yield is also favored by low-temperature fires sustained under wet climate conditions. Preservation of SAS is likely to be compromised in the only seasonally wet fen ecosystem under the dry and warm Mediterranean climate conditions. The moist and shallow conditions in the wetland during hot summer months probably promote oxidation and biodegradation of the labile SAS molecules, compared to the more robust charcoal fragments. Thus, a multiproxy approach - using several proxies, both for fire, hydroclimate and vegetation change - is preferred when aiming to reconstruct past biomass burning from wetland ecosystems in a Mediterranean environment. The micro-charcoal record from Agios Floros reveals significant fire activity between 4400 and 2800 cal yr BP. This partly overlaps the Bronze Age period, associated with intense human environmental interaction and climate change in this area of Peloponnese, Greece. (C) 2021 The Authors.

J	Lavretsky, P; Sedinger, B				Lavretsky, Philip; Sedinger, Benjamin			Migratory patterns of mallards in eastern North America as revealed from band-recovery data	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) distributions have changed in North America over the last century because of altered habitat and the direct augmentation of eastern populations with captive-bred game-farm mallards in the early twentieth century. Geographical overlap between wild and game-farm individuals has resulted in interbreeding, with North American mallard populations now ranging from largely wild to more feral and feral x wild hybrids. How changing genetic integrity of North America's mallards translates behaviorally remains unknown. We analyzed band-recovery data from 1949-2019 to estimate emigration rates and geographic distributions of mallards to understand whether the admixed genetic heritage of mallards in North America's Mississippi and Atlantic flyways resulted in variable autumn distributions. We included American black ducks (Anas rubripes) as a flyway migratory comparative, and analyzed datasets partitioned by flyway and major international space (i.e., Canada vs. United States). We present results that correspond to the hypothesis that western mallard populations of the 1950s expanded eastward and were the precursor populations of mallards in the Canadian provinces of the Atlantic Flyway, while mallards of the Atlantic Flyway in the United States showed substantially differing patterns. Specifically, we estimate that since 1990, approximately 23% of banded mallards on the United States side of the Atlantic Flyway are annually recovered in the Mississippi Flyway as compared to about 5% of those banded in Canadian provinces of the Atlantic Flyway. Given that mallards from the United States side of the Atlantic Flyway are considered a feral x wild hybrid swarm, annual westward emigration of 23% of these mallards is concordant with increasing prevalence of game-farm mallard molecular variation detected in the Great Lakes and mid-continent mallard populations.

Here we show both that taxonomic richness of benthic invertebrates (as a measure of stream health) and breakdown rate of leaf litter (a major process in stream ecosystems) in three naturally acid streams were not significantly different from richness and breakdown rates of three circumneutral control streams in the same area in northern Sweden. In contrast, a comparative data-set representing a gradient from circumneutral to acidified streams in France showed decreasing richness and litter breakdown rates (by 60% and 70% between pH 6.5 and 4.5, respectively) typical of acidified streams. The strong negative effects found in many freshwater systems may be a consequence of low capacity to adjust to rapidly changed conditions. In contrast, organisms in naturally acidic systems, such as streams of the boreal region in catchments with accumulating organic material and a geology poor in buffering substances, seem better adapted as a consequence of protracted exposure to low pH over evolutionary time. These results have implications for the management of streams and rivers in northern Sweden, where considerable efforts are spent on remediation without consideration of the fact that the natural state of many of these systems is acidic.

Each tank (volume: 300 L; depth: 40 cm) was covered with a layer (similar to3 cm) of sediment from lake El Toro (40degrees 14' S; 70degrees 22' W) and filled with filtered water. The experimental design consisted of two treatments: full natural radiation (UV-exposed) and natural radiation without ultraviolet radiation (UV-shielded). UV-exposed and UV-shielded treatments differed in most studied variables as revealed by repeated measures ANOVA. UV-exposed tanks displayed lower CDOM levels (dissolved absorbance) of lower average molecular size (absorbance ratio between 250 and 365 nm), higher bacterial biomass, and lower chlorophyll a concentration. The effect on consumers (rotifers and crustaceans) was less noticeable. The results are consistent with UV stimulation of bacteria production mediated by higher rates of CDOM photobleaching, and the photoinhibition of planktonic algae. Thus, a major effect of UVR in shallow, high CDOM ecosystems appears to be the stimulation of heterotrophic pathways and a simultaneous inhibition of photoautotrophs.					; Perez, Alejandra Patricia/NTQ-2898-2025	Perez, Alejandra Patricia/0000-0003-2334-4191; Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960; 													1474-905X	1474-9092				FEB	2003	2	2					118	123		10.1039/b209656k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b209656k								12664971					WOS:000181431800007
J	Borovic, S; Terzic, J; Pola, M				Borovic, Stasa; Terzic, Josip; Pola, Marco			Groundwater Quality on the Adriatic Karst Island of Mljet (Croatia) and Its Implications on Water Supply	GEOFLUIDS												Water supply of the islands is a global challenge, especially in the countries which have highly indented coastlines with numerous islands. The island of Mljet in Croatia was investigated due to its unique source of water supply: desalination of water from brackish lakesblatinasfed by groundwater and connected to the sea by karst conduits. Water sampling and chemical analyses were performed during hydrological minimum and maximum with regard to groundwater levels in 2005/2006 and minimum in 2016. A total of 13 samples were analysed within the study: 10 samples were taken from blatinas, 1 from pit well, and 2 from borehole wells. All waters sampled from the lakes are of Na-Cl type. The seawater percentage in the lakes used to extract feed water for desalination plants, calculated by conservative mixing approach, is relatively low (0.7-9.8%) and varies in correlation with hydrological seasons. Low proportion of seawater is an essential factor of cost minimisation in desalination by the installed reverse osmosis (RO) plants. Daily monitoring of total dissolved solids in the feed water was introduced in May 2016, and its results were analysed in the context of precipitationa sole source of island aquifer recharge. Maximum concentrations were observed during September and interpreted to be caused by a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressure during the summer tourist season. Minimum concentrations were expected after the rainy season in the cold part of the year but were observed in June instead. Due to a short observation period and untypical distribution of precipitation in the same time interval, the data can only be considered indicative. An unusual pattern of sulphate anion concentrations, which cannot be attributed solely to fresh- and seawater mixing, was observed in one of the blatinas, but its origin could not be determined based on available data. Taking into account all the presented data on groundwater quality, climate change predictions, the connection of water supply system to the mainland and problems with the effluent treatment, it is clear that the main future challenge will be the creation of an island-wide sustainable water management plan followed by continuous monitoring and research.

To fill this gap, we carried out a field study in the supralittoral zone of 146 Tunisian wetlands belonging to eight types (lagoon, river, lake, sebkha, dam, hill reservoir, beach and chott) and to five bioclimatic zones (humid, subhumid, semi-arid, arid and Saharan). Field work was carried out in spring 2010. Terrestrial isopods were collected in the morning by hand search each time with the same sampling effort. During the study, 22 species of terrestrial isopods belonging to nine families were collected. Porcellio variabilis, Porcellio laevis, Chaetophiloscia elongata and Armadillidium pelagicum are the most common species identified. From the northern to the southern regions, a gradual decrease in species richness has been shown. The identified species belonged to different biogeographical categories: Mediterranean, Mediterranean-Atlantic, North Africa with circum-Sicilian islands, semi-arid and Saharan species. Some of these species are endemic to Tunisia (Porcellio dominici) or to North Africa (Armadillidium sulcatum, Armadillidium tunisiense, Porcellio marginenotatus and P.variabilis). Terrestrial isopod species differ according to wetland type and bioclimatic zone.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				MAR	2018	56	1					38	50		10.1111/aje.12415	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.12415													WOS:000424713200006

More than 4700 taxa have been recorded from this region. Desmids, diatoms and cyanobacteria are among the better studied groups of organisms, while phytoflagellates have received very little attention. Phytoplankton communities in tropical lakes are generally similar to summer communities of temperate lakes. In addition, there is a large number of typical tropical taxa, including pantropical and regional endemic elements. Local endemism occurs in the old Tertiary lakes of the region. The composition of algal communities changes markedly along an altitudinal gradient, and tropical taxa are gradually replaced by taxa characteristic for cool climatic conditions. Biogeographical distribution patterns are exemplified for the desmids and diatoms. Among the more than 2680 desmids recorded from the Indo-Malaysian North Australian region, about 800 have never been found elsewhere. Dispersal by migratory birds and past climatic changes might explain distribution patterns. Because of incomplete taxonomy and a general lack of understanding of the autoecology, distribution and speciation of freshwater algae, however, there remain serious obstacles for detailed biogeographical analyses.																			0018-8158					OCT 25	1996	336	1-3					107	120		10.1007/BF00010824	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00010824													WOS:A1996WB14500011

Experimental confirmation of multiple community states in a marine ecosystem	OECOLOGIA												Small changes in environmental conditions can unexpectedly tip an ecosystem from one community type to another, and these often irreversible shifts have been observed in semi-arid grasslands, freshwater lakes and ponds, coral reefs, and kelp forests. A commonly accepted explanation is that these ecosystems contain multiple stable points, but experimental tests confirming multiple stable states have proven elusive. Here we present a novel approach and show that mussel beds and rockweed stands are multiple stable states on intertidal shores in the Gulf of Maine, USA. Using broad-scale observational data and long-term data from experimental clearings, we show that the removal of rockweed by winter ice scour can tip persistent rockweed stands to mussel beds. The observational data were analyzed with Anderson's discriminant analysis of principal coordinates, which provided an objective function to separate mussel beds from rockweed stands. The function was then applied to 55 experimental plots, which had been established in rockweed stands in 1996. Based on 2005 data, all uncleared controls and all but one of the small clearings were classified as rockweed stands; 37% of the large clearings were classified as mussel beds. Our results address the establishment of mussels versus rockweeds and complement rather than refute the current paradigm that mussel beds and rockweed stands, once established, are maintained by site-specific differences in strong consumer control.

J	Laybourn-Parry, J; Bell, EM; Roberts, EC				Laybourn-Parry, J; Bell, EM; Roberts, EC			Protozoan growth rates in Antarctic lakes	POLAR BIOLOGY												The growth rates of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN), mixotrophic cryptophytes, dinoflagellates and ciliates in field assemblages from Ace Lake in the Vestfold Hills (eastern Antarctica) and Lakes Fryxell and Hoare (McMurdo Dry Valleys, western Antarctica), were determined during the austral summers of 1996/1997 and 1997/1998. The response of the nanoflagellates to temperature differed between lakes in eastern and western Antarctica. In Ace Lake the available bacterial food resources had little impact on growth rate, while temperature imposed an impact, whereas in Lake Hoare increased bacterial food resources elicited an increase in growth rate. However, the incorporation of published data from across Antarctica showed that temperature had the greater effect, but that growth is probably controlled by a suite of factors not solely related to bacterial food resources and temperature. Dinoflagellates had relatively high specific growth rates (0.0057-0.384 h(-1)), which were comparable to Antarctic lake ciliates and to dinoflagellates from warmer, lower latitude locations. Temperature did not appear to impose any significant impact on growth rates. Mixotrophic cryptophytes in Lake Hoare had lower specific growth rates than HNAN (0.0029-0.0059 h(-1) and 0.0056-0.0127 h(-1), respectively). They showed a marked seasonal variation in growth rate, which was probably related to photosynthetically active radiation under the ice at different depths in the water column. Ciliates' growth rates showed no relationship between food supply and mean cell volume, but did show a response to temperature. Specific growth rates ranged between 0.0033 and 0.150 h(-1) for heterotrophic ciliates, 0.0143 h(-1) for a mixotrophic Plagiocampa species and 0.0075 h(-1) for the entirely autotrophic ciliate, Mesodinium rubrum. The data indicated that the scope for growth among planktonic Protozoa living in oligotrophic, cold extreme lake ecosystems is limited. These organisms are likely to suffer prolonged physiological stress, which may account for the highly variable growth rates seen within and between Antarctic lakes.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				JUL	2000	23	7					445	451		10.1007/s003009900103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003009900103													WOS:000088181500001
J	RIDGWAY, MS; SHUTER, BJ; POST, EE				RIDGWAY, MS; SHUTER, BJ; POST, EE			THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF BODY SIZE AND TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR ON NESTING ASYNCHRONY IN MALE SMALLMOUTH BASS, MICROPTERUS-DOLOMIEUI (PISCES, CENTRARCHIDAE)	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												(1) Nesting asynchrony among male smallmoth bass, Micropterus dolomieui Lacepede, varied significantly from year to year (1980-85). Much of the observed variation in timing of nesting was explained by a consistent relationship between the size of individual males and their thermal history (number of degree-days above 10-degrees-C) immediately prior to nesting: larger males accumulated fewer degree-days prior to nesting than smaller males. Larger females also appeared to spawn earlier than smaller females. (2) Environmental effects were stronger than phenotypic effects in explaining the seasonal timing of reproduction in males that renested in subsequent years. A significant proportion of adult males did not nest, and the magnitude of that proportion was negatively density-dependent. Nesting habitat was not limiting the number of nesters. (3) Removal experiments showed that the territorial behaviour of nesting males did not affect the seasonal timing of nesting among males of different sizes nor did it limit the total number of nesting males. These experiments did show that removal of experienced spawners from nesting areas in one year was followed by increased recruitment of inexperienced males to the nesting areas in subsequent years. However, this was not accompanied by a significant increase in the total number of nesters. (4) Two bioenergetic hypotheses can account for why male body size acts as a constraint on the timing of reproduction: (i) large males emerge from winter with a lower energy deficit and are therefore capable of breeding before smaller males: (ii) large males allocate energy to reproduction rather than growth earlier in a season than small males. Both of these hypotheses could also account for our observation of size dependence in female reproductive behaviour.

Five temporary monitoring stations installed during the summers of 2015 and 2016 observed wind speed/direction around the two lakes. In addition, an official meteorological station located 15 km north of the lakes is permanently available. Our goal was to develop a model that could evaluate wind speed and direction over the two lakes using only data from the permanent station. Statistical analysis for the spatio-temporal wind data revealed that (1) local wind speed is correlated with the elevation and its cyclic pattern is identical to that of the official-station data, and (2) the local wind direction field is spatially homogeneous and is strongly correlated with the official-station data. Based on these results, we built two regression models for estimating spatial distribution of local wind speed and directions based on the digital elevation model (DEM) and official-station data. We compared the predicted wind speeds/directions by the proposed model with the corresponding observation data and a numerical result for model validation. We found that the proposed model could effectively simulate heterogeneous local wind fields and considers uncertainty of estimates.

Rainbow trout provide the first experimental evidence for adherence to a distinct Strouhal number during animal oscillatory propulsion	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												The relationship between tail (or wing) beat frequency (f(tail)), amplitude (A) and forward velocity (U) in animals using oscillatory propulsion, when moving at a constant cruising speed, converges upon an optimum range of the Strouhal number (St=f(tail) . A/U). Previous work, based on observational data and supported by theory, shows St falling within the broad optimum range (0.2<St<0.4) and considers this adequate to indicate its importance in governing wing or tail kinematics. This study presents the first evidence using an experimental manipulation that supports the importance of maintaining kinematics at a single optimum (or preferred) St. The tail beat kinematics of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were disturbed by increasing water temperature (T-water) from 11 +/- 1 to 20 +/- 1 degrees C. Elevated Twater increased ftail and decreased A, whilst St at any given U was conserved. St increased with U, driven by concomitant increases in A, whilst ftail was unaffected by U. An increase in Twater also increased basal metabolic costs, but did not affect the incremental increase in metabolic cost with increasing U. Predicted future changes to Twater of lakes and rivers (5-10 degrees C over the next 100 years) may not present major locomotory problems to salmonids.

J	NELSON, WR				NELSON, WR			REPRODUCTION AND EARLY LIFE HISTORY OF SAUGER STIZOSTEDION CANADENSE IN LEWIS AND CLARK LAKE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Studies were conducted to determine factors affecting year-class strength, in Lewis and Clark Lake reservoir. Sauger spawn in the Missouri River below Fort Randall Dam when spring water temperatures reach 43 F and is usually complete in 2 weeks. Maximum egg survival occurs 4 ft. below minimum river water level. Eggs hatch in 21 days when temperature averages 47 F and larvae drift down the Missouri River and into Lewis and Clark Lake. Early stage larvae feed primarily upon Cyclops and larger size larvae on Daphnia and Diaptomus. Fish are a major food after sauger reach 70 to 110-millimeters in length. Adult year-class strength was inversely related to water level fluctuations over the spawning grounds. Abundance of larvae was 15 times greater in 1965 when water levels fluctuated 2.67 ft/day than in 1963 when water levels fluctuated 4.44 ft/day. Apparently, year-class strength is dependent upon water level fluctuation during the incubation period and is determined before young-of-the-year enter Lewis and Clark Lake.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1968	97	2					159	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1968)97[159:RAELHO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1968)97[159:RAELHO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1968B031500008

BESS, the Benthic Shuttle System, is a low-cost instrument package built around a small ROV system, which is designed to carry out a variety of sampling protocols within the benthic boundary layer of large lakes and the coastal ocean. The hallmark of this system is its small size, its flexibility of reconfiguration, its ability to hover, land and reposition on the bottom, and its capabilities for observation and collection of data in real-time. To date, BESS has been used successfully in the Laurentnan Great Lakes to perform simultaneous, in situ benthic flux experiments of chemical exchange across the sediment-water interface, microprofiler measurements of submillimeter chemical gradients within surface sediments, near bottom water column profiling, and high precision coring. BESS is easily deployed with small coastal research vessels and a scaled down version has been launched by hand through winter ice.

High-resolution tephrochronology of the Wilson Creek Formation (Mono Lake, California) and Laschamp event using 238U-230Th SIMS dating of accessory mineral rims	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Sediments of the Wilson Creek Formation surrounding Mono Lake preserve a high-resolution archive of glacial and pluvial responses along the eastern Sierra Nevada due to late Pleistocene climate change. An absolute chronology for the Wilson Creek stratigraphy is critical for correlating the paleoclimate record to other archives in the western U.S. and the North Atlantic region. However, multiple attempts to date the Wilson Creek stratigraphy using carbonates and tephras yield discordant results due to open-system effects and radiocarbon reservoir uncertainties as well as abundant xenocrysts. New ion microprobe U-238-Th-230 dating of the final increments of crystallization recorded by allanite and zircon autocrysts from juvenile pyroclasts yield ages that effectively date eruption of key tephra beds and delimit the timing of basal Wilson Creek sedimentation to the interval between 26.8 +/- 2.1 and 61.7 +/- 1.9 ka. Tephra (Ash 15) erupted during the geomagnetic excursion originally designated the Mono Lake excursion yields an age of 40.8 +/- 1.9 ka, indicating that the event is instead the Laschamp excursion. The new ages support a depositional chronology from magnetostratigraphy that indicates quasi-synchronous glacial and hydrologic responses in the Sierra Nevada and Mono Basin to regional climate change, with intervals of lake filling and glacial-snowpack melting that are in phase with peaks in spring insolation.

J	Scharf, W				Scharf, Wilfried			Rehabilitation and management of a moderately deep-stratifying reservoir by the use of nutrient reduction and food-web management	HYDROBIOLOGIA												As expected from its short renewal time, the hypertrophic Lingese Reservoir responded rapidly but incompletely to external nutrient reduction in 1993. Although there was a sudden decline in lake phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations, the 'turbid regime' revealed resistance in this weakly stratified reservoir of intermediate depth. Draining the reservoir in autumn 1995 provided an unprecedented opportunity for sediment treatment-the phosphorus-rich surface layer was inverted and covered with deeper nutrient-poor layers-and removal of the dense cyprinid fish stock which had not responded to sewage diversion, at least in the short term. Commencing with refilling in 1999, a new fish stock was built up from 2000 by only stocking predators (fingerlings of pike, pike-perch and larger specimens of rainbow-trout in the first years) in combination with catch restrictions. Concomitantly, with the appearance of daphnids in 1999, a 'clear water regime' was established and lake water phosphorus concentrations decreased at unchanged external loading. Reduced zooplanktivory as well as reduced fish-mediated phosphorus release from the sediments were driving mechanisms behind successful reduction of internal loading and achievement of a 'clear water regime'. Hence, phosphorus concentrations were revealed to be a response variable not only to input management but also to food-web management. As the development of cyprinid dominance was prevented in the long-term, there is ample evidence that the fish community responded to the applied management measures as expected featuring successful food-web management. Overall, the biological structure was revealed to be of major importance for lake phosphorus availability and turbidity as in shallow lakes, without, however, the establishment of macrophyte dominance.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2010	649	1					77	94		10.1007/s10750-010-0195-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0195-x													WOS:000277720100008
J	Zwieback, S; Chang, QY; Marsh, P; Berg, A				Zwieback, Simon; Chang, Qianyu; Marsh, Philip; Berg, Aaron			Shrub tundra ecohydrology: rainfall interception is a major component of the water balance	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												As shrubs expand across the Arctic, they alter all cycles in the Earth system, including the water cycle. However, the coupling of shrubs with the water cycle during summer remains poorly understood. Rainfall interception, a major cause of divergent hydrological responses between vegetated and non-vegetated environments, is particularly poorly constrained. We quantified shrub rainfall interception and redistribution in birch and alder in the Western Canadian Arctic using networks of throughfall and stemflow gauges. We find that rainfall interception losses are a major component of the water budget, as effective rainfall was reduced by 15%-30% in the birches. Underneath alders, effective rainfall was almost as large or larger than gross rainfall, but they also left a rain shadow. The spatial variability in throughfall was substantial underneath both shrub species. Stemflow was a small but non-negligible component, as the alders concentrated similar to 15% of rainfall to their few vertical stems, compared to the similar to 8% the birches funnelled along their numerous, predominantly skewed stems. The substantial small-scale variability in effective rainfall may create islands in which conditions for certain biogeochemical processes are particularly favourable. On larger scales, rainfall interception reduces the water yield and thus the runoff received by downstream ecosystems such as lakes. The interception losses are predicted to increase with shrub density in a way that also depends on climatic conditions, with large losses in many coastal environments. The extent to which shrub expansion leads to drier Arctic ecosystems is, however, unclear because of the complex interplay between many ecohydrological processes. Shrub rainfall interception is one major, previously overlooked piece of this puzzle.

In this study, the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) product level 3 (MOD11A2) was used to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of LWST for 56 large lakes across the Tibetan Plateau and examine the factors affecting the LWST variations during 2000-2015. The results show that the annual cycles of LWST across the Tibetan Plateau ranged from -19.5 degrees C in early February to 25.1 degrees C in late July. Obvious diurnal temperature differences (DTDs) were observed for various lakes, ranging from 1.3 to 8.9 degrees C in summer, and large and deep lakes show less DTDs variations. Overall, a LWST trend cannot be detected for the 56 lakes in the plateau over the past 15 years. However, 38 (68%) lakes show a temperature decrease trend with a mean rate of -0.06 degrees C/year, and 18 (32%) lakes show a warming rate of (0.04 degrees C/year) based on daytime MODIS measurements. With respect to nighttime measurements, 27 (48%) lakes demonstrate a temperature increase with a mean rate of 0.051 degrees C/year, and 29 (52%) lakes exhibit a temperature decrease trend with a mean rate of -0.062 degrees C/year. The rate of LWST change was statistically significant for 19 (21) lakes, including three (eight) warming and 17 (13) cooling lakes for daytime (nighttime) measurements, respectively. This investigation indicates that lake depth and area (volume), attitude, geographical location and water supply sources affect the spatiotemporal variations of LWST across the Tibetan Plateau.

J	Strong, C; Kochanski, AK; Crosman, ET				Strong, C.; Kochanski, A. K.; Crosman, E. T.			A slab model of the Great Salt Lake for regional climate simulation	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												A slab lake model was developed for the Great Salt Lake (GSL) and coupled to a regional climate model to enable better evaluation of regional effects of projected climate change. The GSL is hypersaline with an area of approximately 4400 km(2), and its notable shallowness (the deeper sections average 6.5-9 m at current lake levels) renders it highly sensitive to climate change. A time-independent (constant) effective mixing depth of approximately 5 m was determined for the GSL by numerically optimizing model-observation agreement, and improvement gained using a time-dependent effective mixing depth assumption was smaller than the uncertainty in the satellite-based observations. The slab model with constant effective mixing depth accounted for more than 97% of the variance in satellite-based observations of GSL surface temperature for years 2001 through 2003. Using a lake surface temperature climatology in place of the lake model resulted in annual mean near-surface air temperature differences that were small (similar to 10(-2) K) away from the lake, but differences in annual precipitation downstream reached 3 cm (4.5%) mainly because of enhanced turbulent heat fluxes off the lake during spring. When subjected to a range of pseudo global warming scenarios, the annual mean lake surface temperature increased by 0.8 degrees C per degree of air temperature increase.

Apparent and inherent optical properties in relation to the chlorophyll a vertical distribution were investigated in seven lakes including deep (Z(max) > 90 m) and shallow (Z(max) < 12 m) ones. Sampling was carried out during the thermal stratification period (summer) of the deep lakes since in the shallower lakes no stable thermal stratification was detected. The large deep lakes presented very low diffuse attenuation coefficients of photosynthetically active radiation (K-d PAR), and a DCM situated at 0.98-2% of surface PAR irradiance, coinciding with the maximum abundance of the mixotrophic ciliate Ophrydium naumanni and autotrophic picoplankton, Both fractions seemed to be favoured by dim light conditions of particular wavelengths, since at these DCM layers mainly green and blue wavelengths prevailed (<600 mn). In contrast, shallow lakes showed higher K-d PAR values, with a higher concentration of dissolved yellow substances, which caused substantial differences in the spectral quality that may have contributed to explain the absence of this ciliate population in these lakes.

Late Glacial and Early Holocene climatic changes based on a multiproxy lacustrine sediment record from Northeast Siberia	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Palynological (species assemblage, pollen accumulation rate), geochemical (carbon to nitrogen ratios, organic carbon and biogenic silica content), and sedimentological (particle size, magnetic susceptibility) data combined with improved chronology and greater sampling resolution from a new core from Elikchan 4 Lake provide a stronger basis for defining paleoenvironmental changes than was previously possible. Persistence of herb-dominated tundra, slow expansion of Betula and Alnus shrubs, and low percentages of organic carbon and biogenic silica suggest that the Late-Glacial transition (ca. 16,000-11,000 cal. yr BP) was a period of gradual rather than abrupt vegetation and climatic change. Consistency of all Late-Glacial data indicates no Younger Dryas climatic oscillation. A dramatic peak in pollen accumulation rates (ca. 11,000-9800 cal. yr BP) suggests a possible summer temperature optimum, but finer grain sizes, low magnetic susceptibility, and greater organic carbon and biogenic silica, while showing significant warming at ca. 11,000 cal. yr BP, offer no evidence of a Holocene thermal maximum. When compared to trends in other paleo-records, the new Elikchan data underscore the apparent spatial complexity of climatic responses in Northeast Siberia to global forcings between ca. 16,000 and 9000 cal. yr BP.

The cell-wall peptidoglycan type of strain YIM 70179(T) was A4 alpha, L-Lys-Gly-L-Glu. Cells of the isolate contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and an unknown glycolipid, MK-8 as major menaquinone and anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-16:0 as major fatty acids. The DNA G + C content was 68.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 70179(T) fell within the radiation of species of the genus Nesterenkonia. Levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain YIM 70179(T) and the type strains of recognized Nesterenkonia species were below 97%, except to Nesterenkonia halobia DSM 20541(T) (99.6%), but these two strains exhibited a low level of DNA-DNA relatedness (18.4%). Based on genetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that strain YIM 70179(T) represents a novel species of the genus Nesterenkonia, for which the name Nesterenkonia halophila sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 70179(T) (=DSM 16378(T) =KCTC 19048(T)).

J	Berger, S; Walther, GR				Berger, Silje; Walther, Gian-Reto			Distribution of evergreen broad-leaved woody species in Insubria in relation to bedrock and precipitation	BOTANICA HELVETICA												An increasing number of evergreen broad-leaved species has naturalised in deciduous lowland forests near the lakes of southern Switzerland and northern Italy (Insubria), favoured by rising winter temperatures of the last few decades. We investigated how the abundance of these species varies across the Insubrian region, and whether distribution patterns can be explained by the responses of particular species to local environmental constraints. Species composition, cover values and maximal size of exotic and indigenous evergreen broad-leaved species were recorded at 22 study sites throughout the Insubrian region and analysed in relation to the regional precipitation gradient and geological bedrock. The survey revealed distinct differences in the distribution and composition of evergreen broad-leaved species: some species were restricted to the moister western part of Insubria, probably due to low drought tolerance, whereas other species were mainly found in the drier eastern part of Insubria or on calcareous rock, probably due to competitive exclusion from more fertile sites. These ecological preferences generally correspond to those reported from the core range of the species, but some local limitations suggest a restricted ecological breadth of species occurring at their northern range margin.																			0253-1453	1420-9063				JUN	2006	116	1					65	77		10.1007/s00035-006-0749-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-006-0749-8													WOS:000238772800006
J	Theis, LJ; Knox, JC				Theis, LJ; Knox, JC			Spatial and temporal variability in floodplain backwater sedimentation, pool ten, Upper Mississippi River	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Sedimentation in Upper Mississippi River (UMR) aquatic habitats known as "backwaters" has been an issue of concern since the installation of navigation locks and dams in the late 1930s. The impounded river subjects previously protected aquatic habitat to increased durations of river flow and associated sedimentation. Four cores were extracted from isolated backwaters in Navigation Pool Ten near Bagley, Wisconsin, in summer 2001. Particle size, organic carbon, and carbonate analyses were used to determine sedimentation response to changes in flooding associated with the dams. UMR flooding heavily influences backwaters adjacent to the main channel, while backwaters more distant from the main channel have the potential to be influenced by small tributary streams. High spatial variability in sedimentation patterns of the Bagley Bottoms backwaters suggests the importance of relative site location when evaluating these habitats. In addition, recent large magnitude floods on the UMR seem to be a major source of backwater sediments. Therefore, potential changes in recurrence frequencies of large UMR floods and their driving forces should also be considered in evaluating the future of backwaters.																			0272-3646					JUL-AUG	2003	24	4					337	353		10.2747/0272-3646.24.4.337	http://dx.doi.org/10.2747/0272-3646.24.4.337													WOS:000221769600004

Constraints on aragonite precipitation in the Dead Sea from geochemical measurements of flood plumes	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The laminated sequences of the Holocene Dead Sea (DS) and its late Pleistocene precursor Lake Lisan comprise primary aragonite and fine detritus that record the hydro-climate conditions of the late Quaternary Levant. Several studies suggested that the primary aragonite precipitated due to mixing between runoff that brought bicarbonate to the lake and the lake's Ca-chloride brine. However, the factors controlling the aragonite precipitation were not robustly established. Here, we addressed this issue by measuring the chemical composition (pH, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+,Cl-, Br-, B, alkalinity) of flood plumes where the mixing occurs. The results indicate that: (a) Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Cl- are conservative during the floodwater-brine mixing whereas Ca2+ and Sr2+ adsorb on flood's suspended sediments; (b) Boron (an important alkalinity species in the DS) adsorption on flood's suspended load enabled the bicarbonate that entered the lake via runoff to react with the Ca2+ thus facilitating aragonite precipitation (c) Dissolution of calcite dust blown from the Sahara during winter storm is the source of bicarbonate which is required for aragonite precipitation. These observations explain the occurrence of aragonite laminae both during the wet last glacial period and during the dry last 3000yr. Although the water input during these two periods was completely different, they both were characterized by high dust fluxes and a stratified lake configuration in which the boron concentrations in the epilimnion were low enough to enable the bicarbonate that entered the lake via runoff to react with the lake brine Ca2+ and precipitate aragonite.

J	Webb, PW				Webb, Paul W.			The Impact of Changes in Water Level and Human Development on Forage Fish Assemblages in Great Lakes Coastal Marshes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Changes in water levels and development of shorelines are expected to negatively affect coastal marshes. The small-bodied fish assemblage was sampled in the inner marsh vegetation zone in five Les Cheneaux bays with differing levels of development. Observations were made from 1996 to 2004 during which time summer water levels varied from 177.2 in to 176.0 in (chart datum = 176.0 in). Each marsh was sampled for 10 consecutive days in July and August using gangs of five baited commercial minnow traps. Assemblage composition was assayed by species richness, the number of native minnow species, the percentage of selected tolerant fishes (bowfin, Amia calva, mudminnow, Umbra limi, common carp, Cyprinus carpio, and brown bullhead, Ameiurus nebulosus), and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). There were no consistent relationships between fish assemblage measures and year, water level, annual change in water level, exposure, and water temperature. Fish assemblage measures except CPUE were impacted by the density of building along the shoreline, a measure of development. Impervious surface area was < 4.5% and was not consistently related to fish assemblage measures.																			0380-1330					DEC	2008	34	4					615	630																WOS:000262663900005

Unique allacustrine migration patterns of a bull trout population in the Pend Oreille River drainage, Idaho	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We captured and radio-tagged six adult bull trout Salvelinus confluentus in a spawning tributary of the East River basin, Idaho. These fish were tracked for a year to determine the type of migration they endured to reach their overwintering and spawning locations. Our tracking efforts revealed that the fish made complex postspawning migrations downstream and then upstream either towards or into Lake Pend Oreille, To reach the lake, bull trout migrated at least 12 kin out of the East River basin into the Priest River, traveled 34 kin down the Priest River into the Pend Oreille River, and then turned upstream and migrated 36 km to Lake Pend Oreille. Three of the six bull trout returned to the East River basin during the subsequent spring. These movement patterns are uniquely complex and extensive for outlet-spawning or allacustrine bull trout. This work illustrates the type of allacustrine migrations bull trout can have and suggests the need for new approaches for accomplishing bull trout population expansion into historically occupied habitats. Eliminating barriers downstream of lakes could potentially contribute to and increase bull trout populations considerably.																			0275-5947					NOV	2007	27	4					1268	1275		10.1577/M06-137.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M06-137.1													WOS:000252065400021

The field location, in the densely populated, water-stressed Mexico City region gives this record particular societal relevance. A detailed paleoclimate reconstruction from central Mexico will enhance our understanding of long-term natural climate variability in the North American tropics and its relationship with changes at higher latitudes. The site lies at the northern margin of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), where modern precipitation amounts are influenced by sea surface temperatures in the Pacific and Atlantic basins. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), more winter precipitation at the site is hypothesized to have been a consequence of a southward displacement of the mid-latitude westerlies. It thus represents a key spatial node for understanding large-scale hydrological variability of tropical and subtropical North America and is at an altitude (2240 m a.s.l.), typical of much of western North America. In addition, its sediments contain a rich record of pre-Holocene volcanic history; knowledge of the magnitude and frequency relationships of the area's explosive volcanic eruptions will improve capacity for risk assessment of future activity. Explosive eruption deposits will also be used to provide the backbone of a robust chronology necessary for full exploitation of the paleoclimate record.

J	OREN, A				OREN, A			THE DEAD-SEA - ALIVE AGAIN	EXPERIENTIA												In the thirteen years of quantitative studies on the microbiology of the Dead Sea from 1980 onwards three distinct periods can be discerned. Mass development of the green unicellular alga Dunaliella parva (up to 8,800 cells/ml) and red archaeobacteria (2 x 10(7) cells/ml) was observed in 1980, following a dilution of the upper water layers by rain floods. This bloom disappeared at the end of 1982 as a result of a complete mixing of the water column. During the period 1983-1991 the lake was holomictic, and no Dunaliella cells were observed. Viable bacteria were present during this period in very low numbers. Heavy rain floods during the winter of 1991-1992 caused a new stratification as the upper five meters of the water column became diluted to 70% of their normal salinity. In this upper water layer Dunaliella reappeared (up to 3 x 10(4) cells/ml at the beginning of May, rapidly declining to less than 40 cells/ml at the end of July), and a bloom of red archaeobacteria (3 x 10(7) cells/ml) once more imparted a red coloration to the lake.

The sedimentology and microfossil assemblages of these layers are consistent with deposition by tsunamis. Radiocarbon ages suggest that the tsunamis were generated by plate-boundary earthquakes at the Cascadia subduction zone about 2600, 1600 and 300 years ago. Diatom and protozoan contents of the gyttja layers indicate that relative sea level fell in the periods between tsunamis. The sea-level changes are probably a product of interseismic uplift of the North America plate margin. Post-tsunami diatom and protozoan assemblages are generally more marine than their pre-tsunami counterparts, suggesting that the study site subsided during earthquakes. Estimates of interseismic and coseismic deformation during one earthquake cycle indicate that less than half of the interseismic uplift was recovered during the earthquake, leading to cumulative, or permanent. uplift of the area.

J	Whinam, J; Copson, G				Whinam, J; Copson, G			Sphagnum moss: an indicator of climate change in the sub-Antarctic	POLAR RECORD												Sphagnum moss has been used globally as an indicator of climate change. Since continuous meteorological recording started in the late 1940s, there has been a marked change in the climates of Southern Ocean islands. The distribution of Sphagnum on Macquarie Island appeared to be expanding through the 1980s. All patches of Sphagnum were mapped in the 1992/93 austral summer, with H 2 Sphagnum moss patches (< 3 m(2)) and 12 larger (>= 3 m(2)) patches recorded. The vast majority of sites recorded were lowland coastal. with a few sites around plateau lakes. The area of moss beds ranges from 0.03 m(2) to 32.4 m(2). A total of 23 sites were pegged and tagged by 1996, but only 14 of these sites still had Sphagnum moss present by 2004. It is considered that the climatic conditions (higher than average temperatures and wind speeds and lower than average humidity and precipitation) that occurred between April 1999 and May 2000 would have resulted in a period of desiccation that accounts for the destruction of the smaller and/or shallower Sphagnum beds on the island. It is highly likely that both the spatial distribution and size of Sphagnum moss beds on Macquarie Island will continue to decline with predicted changes in sub-Antarctic climate.																			0032-2474	1475-3057				JAN	2006	42	220					43	49		10.1017/S0032247405004900	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0032247405004900													WOS:000235260300005
J	Istvánovics, V; Osztoics, A; Honti, M				Istvánovics, V; Osztoics, A; Honti, M			Dynamics and ecological significance of daily internal load of phosphorus in shallow Lake Balaton, Hungary	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. As supported by field data, turbidity recorded by light scattering sensors could reliably be converted into concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and coefficient of vertical light attenuation (K-d) in Lake Balaton. 2. Autocorrelation analysis revealed that proper determination of SPM concentration and K-d required daily sampling. To approximate daily rate of resuspension, 15 min or more frequent measurements were needed. Thus, routine monitoring provides very little insight into environmental variability of shallow lakes as habitats for phytoplankton. 3. The internal P load was estimated from daily rate of resuspension and P desorption capacity of sediments. The latter was assumed to be proportionate to the potentially mobile inorganic P content of SPM. A comparison with net primary production and nutrient status of phytoplankton showed that the proposed method of estimating time series of internal P load captured seasonal trends. 4. The daily rate of resuspension was high whereas that of internal P load was low in Lake Balaton relative to other shallow lakes. The latter reflects favourable behaviour of the calcite-rich sediments. As a consequence, carrying capacity of Basin 1 of Lake Balaton was P-determined. 5. The timing of external and internal loads was radically different. While the former showed mostly seasonal changes, large pulses characterised the latter. As a consequence, internal load may supply more P to phytoplankton growth during the critical summer months than external load. However, the relative importance of these sources may show substantial interannual variability. 6. Large resuspension events often followed each other during periods of 10-15 days. It has been shown that disturbances in this frequency range are of key importance in maintaining the diversity of phytoplankton. We propose that resuspension can be perceived not only as a disturbance factor but also as a factor that periodically relaxes nutrient stress. The former feature may dominate the instantaneous effect, whereas the latter may determine the persistent effect of resuspension on succession of phytoplankton.					; Honti, Mark/A-8410-2014	Istvanovics, Vera/0000-0003-2433-1528; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2004	49	3					232	252		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01180.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01180.x													WOS:000188989600002

A lakeshore site's TI value was positively related to the temperature difference between the substrate and lake surface, indicating higher TI values were associated with greater groundwater input. YOY brook trout tended to occupy lakeshore sites with relatively large TI values. Groundwater habitat available to YOY brook trout was relatively rare, with only a few sites used consistently on an annual basis. Larger lakes had fewer groundwater habitat sites per unit length of shoreline than smaller lakes. Logistic regression analysis and model selection (via Akaike's Information Criterion) indicated the odds of finding YOY brook trout increased significantly when a site was a stream and, in the summer, when there was a large difference in temperature between lake substrate and lake surface. Most of the stream sites used by brook trout were not on the Ontario base map system but were revealed by the TI approach.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2006	63	2					239	253		10.1139/F05-212	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F05-212													WOS:000235232000002
J	ARTS, MT; SPRULES, WG				ARTS, MT; SPRULES, WG			ENERGY RESERVES OF 3 ZOOPLANKTON SPECIES FROM 2 LAKES WITH DIFFERENT METAL CONCENTRATIONS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Dry weight and lipid content of three zooplankton species in two lakes differing in concentrations of copper, nickel, and aluminium were assayed for two consecutive summers. Epischura lacustris and Holopedium gibberum had lower lipid levels and were generally lighter in the lake with elevated metals. The lipid droplet in eggs of H. gibberum was 21% smaller in the lake with elevated metal levels. Total body burdens of copper in H. gibberum were twice as high in the lake with elevated metals. There was no difference in dry weight and levels of energy reserves of Diaptomus minutus between the lakes. Lower lipid content and decreased weight of E. lacustris and H. gibberum from Round Lake could not be explained by lowered food availability, since both the edible portion of phytoplankton biomass and abundance of small Bosmina were similar in the two lakes. Since there were no differences in food levels of E. lacustris and H. gibberum in the two lakes, we attributed lower energy reserves in these species to effects of heavy metal contamination.

J	Appt, J; Imberger, J; Kobus, H				Appt, J; Imberger, J; Kobus, H			Basin-scale motion in stratified upper Lake Constance	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This paper describes experimental and modeled wind-induced oscillations in Upper Lake Constance with an emphasis on a coherent understanding of the basin-scale internal dynamics in this example of a large and stratified lake. Data were collected with eight Lake Diagnostic Systems (LDSs) consisting of thermistor chains and wind anemometers. The isotherm displacements as measured by the LDSs were interpreted using the three-dimensional hydrodynamic Estuary and Lake Computer Model (ELCOM). Three types of basin-scale waves were found to dominate the wave motion: the vertical mode-one Kelvin wave that had an observed period around 90 h, two vertical mode-one Poincare waves that had periods near 8 h and 12 h, and a vertical mode-two Poincare wave that had a period near 14 h. After strong westerly winds, upwelling of cold bottom water was observed east of the Sill of Mainau, where the lake's two subbasins connect. The width and length ratios of the subbasins, spatial variations of the wind field, and rotational effects over the lake are shown to play critical roles in the details of the upwelling structure. A sudden fall of the isotherms in Lake Uberlingen formed a surge. The reflection of the surge from the northwestern boundary induced a vertical mode-two response leading to an intrusion in the metalimnion that caused a three-layer velocity structure in the smaller subbasin.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2004	49	4					919	933		10.4319/lo.2004.49.4.0919	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.4.0919													WOS:000224979700004

We present data with a high spatio-temporal resolution from a 72-h field survey in Bautzen Reservoir (Saxony, Germany). The aims of this survey were to observe hydrophysical processes during a period of unstable stratification in spring and investigate the effect of wind-induced internal waves on the vertical distribution of zooplankton. 2. Wind velocities up to 10 m s(-1) caused a strong downwelling event of warm water at the sampling site and led to the generation of internal waves with an amplitude of 4 m. 3. The zooplankton community, which was dominated by Daphnia galeata, inhabited epilimnetic waters. Downwelling enlarged the thickness of the epilimnetic layer and, hence, led to high zooplankton abundances down to relatively deep water strata indicating lateral transport of zooplankton. As a consequence, area-specific zooplankton abundances increased considerably (max. fourfold) during downwelling. 4. We conclude that classical limnological field sampling, such as for monitoring purposes, can lead to severely biased estimates of zooplankton abundance due to the interfering effects of hydrophysical processes like internal waves. 5. Backscattering strengths measured by a simultaneously deployed Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (600 kHz) were found to be correlated with estimated zooplankton abundances based on plankton samples.

In the summer of 2002, air samples were collected at Dingri at a height of 4400m above sea level (m a.s.l.) and at Rongbuk Valley (4976 in a.s.l.) in the Mt. Everest region and analyzed using large volume injection gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The mean concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the samples were 19.2, 11.2, 7.7, 8.9, 10.4, 27.6, 5.1, 5.1, and 3.7 pgm(-3) for alpha-HCH, beta-HCH, gamma-HCH, HCB, heptachlor, alpha-endosulfan, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDT, respectively. Backward trajectories were used to assess the association between Source regions, transport paths, and observed OCP concentrations. During the sampling period, the o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT concentration ratios were observed to be between 1.23 and 1.41, much higher than that of technical DDT, indicating the existence of a DDT source other than technical DDTs in the source regions.

The lake water had approximately 15 % w/v salt content. Phylogenetic diversity of prokaryotes inhabiting the water and sediment of the lake was studied using cultivation and cultivation-independent methods following a sampling in spring 2009. According to the results of 16S rRNA gene-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), the richness of Bacteria was higher than Archaea on the basis of the number and position of dominant bands in the gel. Sequences from DGGE bands were affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria (Halomonas and Alkalilimnicola) and Bacteroidetes (Psychroflexus) as well as Euryarchaeota. Cultivation from five different saline media resulted in 101 bacterial strains of which Gammaproteobacteria (Halomonas, Marinobacter and Salinivibrio) were the most abundant. Firmicutes (Bacillus) and Alphaproteobacteria (Aurantimonas and Roseovarius) were also identified among the isolated strains. The 16S rRNA genes from 82 bacterial and 95 archaeal clones were also phylogenetically analyzed. Bacterial clones were related to various genera of Gammaproteobacteria (Alkalilimnicola, Alkalispirillum, Arhodomonas, Halomonas, Saccharospirillum), Bacteroidetes (Gracilimonas, Psychroflexus) and Alphaproteobacteria (Oceanicola, Roseinatronobacter, Roseovarius).

HYDROBIOLOGIA												We investigated sexual reproduction patterns of a ubiquitous littoral cladoceran Alonella nana (Anomopoda, Chydoridae), using ecological and paleoecological approaches to clarify the forcing mechanisms behind its sexual reproduction. Contemporary sampling of A. nana populations in two environmentally different lakes showed abundant sexual reproduction in the lake with eutrophic, oxygen-deficient conditions and scarce gamogenesis in the oligotrophic, well-oxygenated lake. Sediment core studies from the same lakes indicated that comparable sexual reproduction patterns had prevailed for many centuries. However, in eutrophic Lake Hamptrask, A. nana increased its sexual reproduction from 1700 ad onward, consistently with decreasing trend in chironomid-inferred oxygen. The core samples, together with a surface sediment dataset of 25 lakes from southern and central Finland, showed a negative correlation between ephippia of A. nana and winter oxygen, although the surface sediment data per se did not show any significant correlation. When the dataset was scaled locally to include lakes in close proximity in southern Finland, the correlation became clearer. The results imply that the spatial and temporal variations in sexual reproduction of A. nana populations may partly be explained by differences in oxygen levels.

J	Huttunen, JT; Väisänen, TS; Hellsten, SK; Martikainen, PJ				Huttunen, JT; Väisänen, TS; Hellsten, SK; Martikainen, PJ			Methane fluxes at the sediment-water interface in some boreal lakes and reservoirs	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Methane (CH4) fluxes at the sediment-water interface were studied during summer in six lakes and two reservoirs in Finland. The oxygen penetration in the sediments of these boreal mesotrophic-hypereutrophic freshwater ecosystems varied from 0 to 8 mm, and the CH4 concentrations within the uppermost 10 cm from 17 to 51000 ppm(v). The diffusive methane fluxes to the overlying water column ranged from 0.44 to 105 mg m(-1) d(-1) and correlated negatively (R-2 = 0.68) with the oxygen penetration in the sediment. This demonstrated that the CH4 concentration and the diffusive CH4 fluxes in the lake sediments are closely related to the 0 2 conditions, which regulate both CH, production and CH, oxidation in the sediment. The comparison between the diffusive CH4 fluxes at the sediment-water interface and CH4 fluxes at the water-air interface previously measured in situ in one lake and two reservoirs showed that the sediment CH4 fluxes poorly predict the CH4 release from the water surface to the atmosphere. This indicates that the CH4 oxidation in water column, advective transport of CH4 and CH4 ebullition have importance in the net CH4 release to the atmosphere. The increased CH4 concentration in water column close to the sediment is an indicator of serious oxygen depletion within sediment.																			1239-6095	1797-2469				FEB 20	2006	11	1					27	34																WOS:000235662200003
J	van Middlesworth, PE; Wood, SA				van Middlesworth, PE; Wood, SA			The aqueous geochemistry of the rare earth elements and yttrium. Part 7. REE, Th and U contents in thermal springs associated with the Idaho batholith	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Concentrations of the rare earth elements (REE), Th and U have been determined in thermal waters emerging from a number of locations in and around the Idaho Batholith. Previous investigators have suggested that the source of heat for the geothermal systems studied is the radioactive decay of K, Th and U which are enriched in the rocks through which the fluids how. Thus, knowledge of the behavior of REE, Th and U in these systems may contribute to a better understanding of the potential consequences of the interaction of hydrothermal fluids with deeply buried nuclear waste. Such studies may also lead to the possible use of REE as an exploration tool for geothermal resources. The thermal waters investigated may be characterized as near-neutral to slightly alkaline, dilute, NaHCO3-dominated waters with relatively low temperatures of last equilibration with their reservoir rocks (<200 degrees C). REE, Th and U concentrations were measured using Fe(OH)(3) coprecipitation, followed by ICP-MS, which yielded detection limits of 0.01-0.003 mu g/l for each element, depending on the volume of fluid sample taken. The concentrations of REE, Th and U measured (from <0.1 up to a few mu g/l) are 3-5 orders of magnitude less than chondritic, in agreement with concentrations of these elements measured in other similar continental geothermal systems. The REE exhibit light REE-enriched patterns when normalized to chondrite, but when normalized to NASC or local granites, they exhibit hat or slightly heavy REE-enriched trends. These findings indicate that the REE are either taken up in proportion to their relative concentrations in the source rocks, or that the heavy REE are preferentially mobilized. Concentrations of REE and Th are often higher in unfiltered, compared to filtered samples, indicating an important contribution of suspended particulates, whereas U is apparently truly dissolved. In some of the hot springs the REE concentrations exhibit marked temporal variations, which are greater than the variations observed in major element concentrations, alkalinity and temperature. There are also variations in the fluid concentrations of REE, Th and U related to general location within the study area which may be reflective of variations in the concentrations of these elements in the reservoir rocks at depth. Thermal waters in the southern and central parts of the field area all contain Sigma REE concentrations exceeding 0.1 mu g/l (up to as high as 3 mu g/l), Th exceeding 0.2 mu g/l and U generally <0.4 mu g/l. In contrast, thermal waters from the northern area contain lower Sigma REE (<0.6 mu g/l) and Th (<0.1 mu g/l), but higher U (>3.0 mu g/l). Using experimentally measured and theoretically estimated thermodynamic data, the distribution of species for La, Ce and Nd have been calculated and also the solubility of pure, endmember (La, Ce, Nd) phosphate phases of the monazite structure in selected hot spring fluids. These calculations indicate that, at the emergence temperatures, CO32- and OH- complexes of the REE are the predominant species in the thermal waters, whereas at the deep-aquifer temperatures, OH complexes predominate. In these thermal waters, monazite solubility is strongly prograde with respect to temperature, with solubility often decreasing several orders of magnitude upon cooling from the deep-aquifer to the emergence temperature. At the surface temperature, calculated monazite solubilities are, within the uncertainty of the thermodynamic data, comparable to the REE concentrations measured in the filtered samples, whereas at the deep-aquifer temperature, monazite solubilities are generally several orders of magnitude higher than the REE concentrations measured in the filtered or unfiltered samples. Therefore, a tentative model is suggested in which the thermal fluids become saturated with respect to a monazite-like phase (or perhaps an amorphous or hydrated phosphate) upon ascent and cooling, followed by subsequent precipitation of that phase. The temporal variations in REE content can then be explained as a result of sampling variable mixtures of particulate matter and fluid and/or variable degrees of attainment of equilibrium between fluid and solid phosphate.

Comparing seasonal heterogeneity of phytoplankton habitat and community in northern lakes with low to moderate but historically variable DOC concentrations	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) influences several physical and chemical drivers of phytoplankton habitat. Increasing variability in lakewater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in recent decades has raised uncertainty over temporal responses of phytoplankton communities to changing DOM. We conducted limnological surveys in four lakes with low (similar to 2 mg l(-1)) to moderate (similar to 4 mg l(-1)) DOC in Maine, USA, from February to November 2020 to assess variability in phytoplankton metrics and habitat gradients. Low-DOC lakes had similar thermal structure patterns compared to moderate-DOC lakes, but more stable euphotic depths. While moderate-DOC lakes had greater seasonal heterogeneity of biomass and vertical distribution of chlorophyll-a, the low-DOC lake had greater phytoplankton community turnover (Morisita-Horn Dissimilarity Index), underscored by a shift in dominance from autotrophs in the winter under ice to mixotrophs throughout the open water season. Long-term trends showed DOC concentrations generally increased for one decade beginning in 1995, followed by decreases in all four lakes for 12-15 years until 2020 by rates of 0.02-0.15 mg l(-1) year(-1), during which time water clarity increased in one lake. Small differences in or changes to DOC elicit greater variability of phytoplankton in lakes with low to moderate DOC concentrations.

The simple redox reaction of iodide and nitrite in an acidic medium was used instead of the conventional nitrite methods based on the formation of azo dye. The quantitative relationship between the yellow-colored iodine formed because of the reaction and nitrite was determined by the digital image-based colorimetric method (DIC). In the optimal experimental conditions, detection limit and R-2 values were determined as 0.02 mg/L and 0.9925, respectively. New method (Redox-DIC method) was validated by the standard Griess Method for nitrite in lake waters. The perfect recovery results (94-112%) were calculated for lake, river, tap, and spring waters spiked at different concentrations, and very good (< 5.0%) percent relative standard deviation values were recorded. Unlike conventional nitrite methods, organic reagents and solvents were not used in this method. The method is fast, simple, and low cost.

J	Ewart, A				Ewart, A.			Two new genera and five new species of Mugadina-like small grass cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae: Cicadettini) from Central and Eastern Australia: comparative morphology, songs, behaviour and distributions	ZOOTAXA												Moulds (2012) established the genus Mugadina for two small cicadas, M. marshalli (Distant) and M. emma (Goding and Froggatt), both grass inhabiting species known from Queensland and New South Wales. Both species are notable for their relatively simple 'ticking' songs. Moulds further noted that there were at least two superficially similar genera of cicadas, but each with different genitalia. This paper describes two new genera of small (9-15 mm body lengths) and distinctive grass cicadas with genitalia that are very similar to those of Mugadina, but possess clear morphological, colour and calling song differences. The new genera are: Heremusina n. gen. with two known species namely H. udeoecetes n. sp. and H. pipatio n. sp.; the second new genus is Xeropsalta n. gen., containing four known species, X. thomsoni n. sp., X. aridula n. sp., X. rattrayi n. sp., and X. festiva n. comb. Heremusina n. gen. species are described from the Alice Springs area of Northern Territory and the Cloncurry area of northwest Queensland, from arid to semi arid habitats. The Xeropsalta n. gen. species are described from western, southwest and central Queensland, and from the Simpson and Strzelecki Deserts in northeastern South Australia and northwestern New South Wales, respectively, all locations in very arid to arid habitats, but close to seasonal (often irregular) rivers and lakes. X. festiva n. comb. occurs in semi arid habitats in southern and southeastern Australia. Detailed taxonomic descriptions are provided of the new species, together with distributions, habitats, and the calling songs. The Heremusina species emit songs with short repetitive buzzing echemes, the echeme durations differing between each species. The Xeropsalta songs are notable for their complexity, containing multiple elements with rapid changes of amplitudes and temporal structures, rather atypical of the songs of most small grass dwelling cicadas. Detailed song structures distinguishing each of the species are illustrated and interpreted in each case in light of their respective taxonomic status.																			1175-5326	1175-5334				APR 20	2018	4413	1					1	56		10.11646/zootaxa.4413.1.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.4413.1.1								29690120					WOS:000430462600001

Surface water samples (n = 68) were collected in the summer 2017 and analyzed for glyphosate, atrazine (ATZ), 8 systemic insecticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, fipronil, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) and some metabolites. Overall, 99% of the surface water samples were positive to at least one of the targeted pesticides. The most recurrent compounds were glyphosate (detection frequency: 84%), ATZ (82%), thiamethoxam (59%), desethylatrazine (DEA: 47%), and clothianidin (46%). Glyphosate displayed variable levels (4-3,000 ng L-1), with higher concentrations in south tributaries (e.g., Nicolet and Yamaska). In positive samples, the sum of ATZ and DEA varied between 5 and 860 ng L-1, and the sum of 6 priority neonicotinoids between 1.5 and 115 ng L-1. From Repentigny to the Sorel Islands, the spatial distribution of pesticides within the St. Lawrence River was governed by the different upstream sources (i.e., Great Lakes vs. Ottawa River) due to the limited mixing of the different water masses. Cross-sectional patterns revealed higher concentrations of glyphosate and neonicotinoids in the north portions of transects, while the middle and south portions showed higher levels of atrazine. In Lake St. Pierre and further downstream, cross-sections revealed higher levels of the targeted pesticides near the southern portions of the SLR. This may be due to the higher contributions from south shore tributaries impacted by major agricultural areas, compared to north shore tributaries with forest land and less cropland use. Surface water samples were compliant with guidelines for the protection of aquatic life (chronic effects) for glyphosate and atrazine. However, 31% of the samples were found to surpass the guideline value of 8.3 ng L-1 for the sum of six priority neonicotinoids. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantifying landscape change in an arctic coastal lowland using repeat airborne LiDAR	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Increases in air, permafrost, and sea surface temperature, loss of sea ice, the potential for increased wave energy, and higher river discharge may all be interacting to escalate erosion of arctic coastal lowland landscapes. Here we use airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data acquired in 2006 and 2010 to detect landscape change in a 100 km(2) study area on the Beaufort Sea coastal plain of northern Alaska. We detected statistically significant change (99% confidence interval), defined as contiguous areas (>10 m(2)) that had changed in height by at least 0.55 m, in 0.3% of the study region. Erosional features indicative of ice-rich permafrost degradation were associated with ice-bonded coastal, river, and lake bluffs, frost mounds, ice wedges, and thermo-erosional gullies. These features accounted for about half of the area where vertical change was detected. Inferred thermo-denudation and thermo-abrasion of coastal and river bluffs likely accounted for the dominant permafrost-related degradational processes with respect to area (42%) and volume (51%). More than 300 thermokarst pits significantly subsided during the study period, likely as a result of storm surge flooding of low-lying tundra (<1.4 m asl) as well as the lasting impact of warm summers in the late-1980s and mid-1990s. Our results indicate that repeat airborne LiDAR can be used to detect landscape change in arctic coastal lowland regions at large spatial scales over sub-decadal time periods.					; Stoker, Jason/KHX-9288-2024; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011	Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Stoker, Jason/0000-0003-2455-0931; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141													1748-9326					OCT-DEC	2013	8	4							045025	10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/045025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/045025													WOS:000329604900089

Additionally, we assembled 167 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). These MAGs were de-replicated into 83 unique genomes representing different species found in the lakes. All the MAGs exhibited >70% completeness and <10% contamination, with 79 MAGs being classified as 'nearly complete' (completeness >90%), while 54 falling within 80-90% range and 34 between 75-80% complete. The most abundant MAGs identified across all samples were Proteobacteria (n = 80), Firmicutes_A (n = 35), Firmicutes (n = 13), and Bacteriodota (n = 22). Other groups included Desulfobacteria_I (n = 2), Verrucomicrobiota (n = 4), Campylobacterota (n = 4) and Actinobacteriota (n = 6). Importantly, phylogenomic analysis identified that approximately 50.3% of the MAGs could not be classified to known species, suggesting the presence of potentially new and unknown bacteria in these lakes, warranting further in-depth investigation. This study provides valuable new dataset on the diverse and often unique microbial communities living in polluted lakes, useful in developing effective strategies to manage pollution.					; Tekere, Memory/C-7409-2015; Ogola, Henry/N-5904-2017; Ijoma, Grace/AAW-6727-2021; Pillay, Preenan/JPY-2757-2023	Tshisekedi, Kalonji Abondance/0000-0002-0518-1643; Ijoma, Grace/0000-0002-1568-8851; 														2052-4463				MAY 6	2024	11	1							456	10.1038/s41597-024-03286-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03286-0								38710672					WOS:001214947100003

In the Baltic Sea, pine (Pinus sylvestris) pollen is found in large amounts in shallow bays in early summer. Pollen is a significant C-source in freshwater ecosystems and may also be important in coastal food webs. We examined the consumption of pollen and autochthonous resources by benthic invertebrates in shallow bays of the Baltic Sea. We used stable isotopes to estimate diets and reconstructed consumer-resource networks (food webs) for grazers and particulate organic matter (POM)-feeders to compare how these different guilds used pollen. We found that P. sylvestris pollen was consumed in small amounts by a variety of animals and in some cases made up a sizeable proportion of invertebrates' diets. However, invertebrates generally depended less on pollen than other resources. The degree of pollen consumption was related to feeding traits, with generalist invertebrate grazers consuming more pollen (> 10% of diet) than the more specialist POM-feeders (< 5% of diet contributed by pollen). POM-feeders may consume additional microbially-degraded pollen which was not identifiable in our model. We suggest that pollen is a small but substantial allochthonous C-source in shallow bay food webs of the Baltic Sea, with the potential to affect the dynamics of these ecosystems.					; Bradshaw, Clare/AFU-1886-2022; Liénart, Camilla/ACO-5564-2022	Hedgespeth, Melanie/0000-0002-3683-3114; Bradshaw, Clare/0000-0002-8421-2750; Cirtwill, Alyssa/0000-0002-1772-3868; Lienart, Camilla/0000-0001-5945-9869													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2022	67	1					53	65		10.1002/lno.11974	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11974		NOV 2021											WOS:000717970400001

The lake develops from a fractured rocks aquifer, with groundwater stored in fractures, joints, bedding planes and cavities of the rock mass located at the foot of the Pizzo Groppera mountain. The model is based on the daily resolution of two continuity equations (water balances of both the catchment soils and the aquifer). The results show that the risk of emptying is increased after the climate change of the end of the 80s, perhaps enhanced by land use changes observed in the area (new ski runs). Emptying phenomena observed in 1994, 2004, 2005 and 2006 are correctly simulated. The establishment of a quantitative monitoring of lake level and meteorological variables (first of all snow and rainfall) is crucial to obtain the data-sets useful to validate the proposed model and to obtain future answers to our questions.					cola, gabriele/AAM-2498-2020; Mariani, Luigi/AAB-9464-2019														2038-5625					APR	2011	16	1					37	44																WOS:000208680700004

This study determined whether the recent drop in the water level has created additional breeding grounds for malaria vectors. Methods: The recent and past shorelines were estimated using landmarks and a satellite image. The locations of breeding habitats were recorded using a GPS unit during the high and low lake water periods. GIS was used to determine whether the breeding habitats were located on newly emerged land between the new and old shorelines. Results: Over half of the breeding habitats existed on newly emerged land. Fewer habitats for the Anopheles gambiae complex were found during the low water level period compared to the high water period. However, more habitats for Anopheles funestus were found during the high water level period, and they were all located on the newly emerged land. Conclusion: The recent reduction in water level of Lake Victoria has increased the amount of available habitat for A. funestus. The results suggest that the water drop has substantially affected the population of this malaria vector in the Lake Victoria basin, particularly because the lake has a long shoreline that may harbour many new breeding habitats.

J	Moring, JR; Mink, LH				Moring, JR; Mink, LH			Anadromous alewives, Alosa pseudoharengus, as prey for white perch, Morone americana	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The reintroduction of anadromous alewives, Alosa pseudoharengus, to their historic habitats in the inland waters of the United States and Canada, has prompted concerns about possible interactions with a popular sport fish, white perch, Morone americana. Both species are now widely distributed in northeastern North America. Diets of white perch in Lake George, Maine, U. S. A., where alewives were absent, were monitored and compared with those of white perch populations that were sympatric with anadromous alewives in two coastal Maine lakes, Biscay Pond and North Pond. In the presence of introduced alewives, the diet of adult white perch became almost exclusively juvenile alewives by late summer in ponds where both species were present. White perch that were sympatric with alewives were more piscivorus than were Lake George white perch, which primarily consumed Cladocera. Not only were alewives the principal prey item in the diet of white perch in Biscay and North ponds, but adult alewives were largely cannibalistic by August. Thus, success of reintroducing anadromous alewives in waters containing white perch may be negatively impacted by predation as well as cannibalism.																			0018-8158					JUL	2002	479	1					125	130		10.1023/A:1021078803198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021078803198													WOS:000179168700013

Ninety-three per cent of the territory is taken up by mountains. The country is rich in water resources (glaciers, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, mineral springs, etc.) The rivers of Tajikistan form 55.4% of the average annual surface runoff of the Aral Sea basin. The total area of land potentially suitable for irrigation in the country is estimated at 1.57 Mha, of which 763,000 ha were developed by 2021, of which 289,000 ha are irrigated with the help of 390 pumping stations with 1500 pumps and 213,000 ha are irrigated with the help of 228 cascade pumping stations with 922 aggregates. The irrigation and drainage networks are mainly located in the basins of the Syr Darya, Zarafshan, Kafernigan, Vakhsh and Pyanj rivers. In general, 26,700 km of irrigation networks, main canals and 11,400 km of collector-drainage networks, 7099 hydraulic structures, 505 vertical wells, 169 siphons, 110 aqueducts, 5455 water distribution points and 3858 gauging posts function to serve irrigated lands in the country.																			1531-0353	1531-0361				NOV	2023	72	5			SI		1230	1240		10.1002/ird.2835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.2835		MAY 2023											WOS:000985995700001

The event was characterized by heavy precipitation, hail and intense wind gusts, causing injuries and damages to trees, buildings and infrastructures. The description of the case study draws upon a wide palette of observational data. Surface and upper-air observations helped characterize the event, emphasizing the rapid changes in the meteorological parameters in the study area; satellite data highlights the presence of deep moist convection, associated with strong updrafts; Doppler radar allows the identification of the main features of the event in terms of storm-motion, hail detection/probability and the possible presence of a mesocyclone. A high-resolution (3 km inner grid spacing) simulation with the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model was performed to study the atmospheric conditions conducive to convection, as well as to estimate the main instability parameters. The main features of the storm were well reproduced with WRF; furthermore, the high values of the simulated instability parameters denote the presence of favourable conditions for severe convection. The analysis of this event shows that supercells can develop also in a pre-alpine environment, characterized by a complex orography, in particular in the sub-regions where the local morphology creates conditions favourable for severe weather development.

To study the pollution level, a total of seven fish species, namely Heteropneustes fossillis, Channa punctata, Nandus nandus, Chanda nama, Anabas testudineus, Mystus gulio, and Colisa fasciata, were collected in winter from the Dhaleswari River and the total concentrations of Cr, Pb, Ni, and Zn in head and body tissues were analyzed separately. The concentrations of Cr, Pb, and Zn were found 300, 20, and 10 times higher, respectively, than the guideline value of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO), indicating possible health risks to humans. In most cases, bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) exceeded the highest limit, expressing that most of the species, especially C. nama, A. testudineus, and C. fasciata, were in the highly bioaccumulative state. The health risks associated with fish consumption were determined in terms of estimated daily intake (EDI), non-carcinogenic risks (THQ), and carcinogenic risk (TR) factors. The THQs for Cr and Pb crossed the maximum value of 1 in all the fish species except Pb in Mystus gulio, which might cause different non-carcinogenic diseases upon consumption of these fishes. In all the fish species, the carcinogenic risk factor for Cr exceeded the standard value (10(-4)), indicating chronic cancer risk to humans. Although the estimated daily intake (EDI) values did not cross the permissible limit, continuous consumption of contaminated fish from the target area may cause serious health complications. This study revealed that consumption of these fishes exposed people to a higher risk of non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic consequences in terms of human health.					; Islam, Md Mahfuz/AAB-7159-2022	Islam, Md Mahfuz/0000-0002-2514-089X; 													0163-4984	1559-0720				AUG	2022	200	8					3854	3866		10.1007/s12011-021-02963-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02963-0		OCT 2021						34689300					WOS:000710591200001

Most of the salt pans investigated are very shallow (mean depth mostly < 0.5 m), highly alkaline and inorganically turbid. Salinity ranged from 1.6 to 4.5 g l(-1) in 1996 and 1997, but reached its highest values (> 50 g l(-1)) during the dry summer of 1998. A comparison of the benthic community in 20 salt pans at two sampling dates in 1997 revealed a negative relationship between salinity and species richness of Oligochaeta and benthic Crustacea. However, the decline of diversity was observed at salinity values much lower that those reported in the literature for most benthic invertebrates. It is thus doubtful whether or not salinity has in fact directly affected the benthic community in the salt pans of Seewinkel. Rather, it is suggested that biotic interactions controlled by changes in the hydrochemical situation are responsible for the reduction in diversity of the benthic community. Actual experiments or more detailed data on changes over a full gradient of salinity will be necessary to attribute changes in the species composition of benthic invertebrates to any environmental impact with certainty. The phenology of benthic invertebrates in Unterstinker, a sub- to hyposaline (0.5-20 g l(-1)) salt pan studied in greater detail, was distinctly influenced by the development of submerged macrophytes. Abundances of chironomids and crustaceans, the two dominant major benthic groups, were high only in June and July, when Charophyceae had stabilized the lake bottom and prevented further erosion of fine sediments. Substrate characteristics and the abundance of macrophytes appeared to determine the seasonal development of the benthic community as long as the ion concentration remains low (< 3 g l(-1)).

We report the first finding of a cryptotephra layer in southern and central Finland. Sediment samples from five lakes and 10 peatlands, most of them located in the tephra fallout zone of the Hekla 1947 eruption, were investigated for the presence of cryptotephra to assess the potential for tephrochronology in Finland. Tephra shards were extracted from their host matrix and electron probe microanalysis was conducted on single shards for geochemical characterization. Our results confirm the presence of Askja 1875 tephra in Finland, thus extending the known dispersal area of the Askja 1875 tephra eastwards. Most of the shards are rhyolitic, but a minor concentration of tephra with dacitic composition forms a narrow dispersal zone extending from Sweden to southern Finland. This zone possibly represents the main dispersal axis of the tephra in the distal area. Our results suggest that Finnish environmental research could benefit greatly from adding tephrochronology to the array of dating methods commonly used. Additionally, the absence of Hekla 1947 tephra in the previously inferred fall-out zone is an important result indicating the complexity of tephra deposition and preservation.

Lake Urmia in Iran is plagued by natural and anthropogenic driving forces and its water level has fallen by about 3 m below the minimum ecological water level. To deal with the divergent interests and multiple objectives associated with the lake's water resources, a multidisciplinary and flexible approach is then required. The present research phases included: (1) determining the effective internal and external factors along with formulating strategic alternatives for reviving the lake's water resources via strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT-TOWS) matrix; (2) prioritizing the alternatives according to sustainable development criteria via extended fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) technique, and (3) applying sensitivity analysis to monitor the robustness of the ranking. Representatives of the stakeholders, managers and experts participated in the process of decision making. To consider the different viewpoints and the overall possibility distributions of fuzzy numbers, three ranking procedures were developed through the extended FAHP, reflecting neutral, optimistic, and pessimistic viewpoints. According to the final prioritization, human resources management and promotion of stakeholders' participation stood superior to the other strategic alternatives. In this framework, SWOT-TOWS analysis performed as an appropriate prerequisite to formulate practical strategies for supporting of a sustainable development vision. The extended FAHP made a valid contribution to the proposed framework and sensitivity analysis of the results proved capability of the extended FAHP as a robust tool for decision making in comprehensive water problems.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2015	73	1					13	26		10.1007/s12665-014-3391-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3391-6													WOS:000347446100002

Lawrence; Cheng, Hai			Oxygen isotope precipitation anomaly in the North Atlantic region during the 8.2 ka event	GEOLOGY												An annual laminated stalagmite from northern Spain recorded two outstanding oxygen isotope (delta O-18) pulses during the 8.2 ka event. Most of the oxygen isotope record variability is related to the amount of rainfall, although other factors affect the signal. The lamina thickness record, which is also related to amount of rainfall, does not show any significant anomaly at the time of oxygen isotope spikes. Considering the factors affecting the isotope signal, the two prominent falls in delta O-18 during the event are interpreted to be caused by the release of large amounts of fresh waters into the North Atlantic. Thus, O-18-depleted ocean surface waters shifted the rainfall delta O-18 composition for Europe and Greenland. Our precise chronology provides the timing of the outbursts that caused the delta O-18 anomalies at 8350-8340 and 8221-8211 +/- 34 yr B. P., most probably generated by the drainage of proglacial lakes Agassiz and Ojibway. Therefore, in the North Atlantic region delta O-18 records during the 8.2 ka event trace important hydrological modifications in the ocean, not just local climate. As a consequence, paleoclimate reconstructions from Europe and Greenland using the delta O-18 proxy that does not take this into account would be overestimating the magnitude of the anomalies during the 8.2 ka event.

However, with the exception of several previous studies, there is a lack of knowledge regarding possible effects of early diagenesis on the delta D values of n-alkanes. We therefore investigated the n-alkane patterns and delta D values of long-chain n-alkanes from three different C3 higher plant species (Acer pseudoplatanus L., Fagus sylvatica L. and Sorbus aucuparia L.) that have been degraded in a field leaf litterbag experiment for 27 months. We found that after an initial increase of long-chain n-alkane masses (up to similar to 50%), decomposition took place with mean turnover times of 11.7 months. Intermittently, the masses of mid-chain n-alkanes increased significantly during periods of highest total mass losses. Furthermore, initially high odd-over-even predominances (OEP) declined and long-chain n-alkane ratios like n-C(31)/C(27) and n-C(31)/C(29) started to converge to the value of 1. While bulk leaf litter became systematically D-enriched especially during summer seasons (by similar to 8 parts per thousand on average over 27 months), the delta D values of long-chain n-alkanes reveal no systematic overall shifts, but seasonal variations of up to 25 parts per thousand (Fagus, n-C(27), average similar to 13 parts per thousand). Although a partly contribution by leaf-wax n-alkanes by throughfall cannot be excluded, these findings suggest that a microbial n-alkane pool sensitive to seasonal variations of soil water delta D rapidly builds up. We propose a conceptual model based on an isotope mass balance calculation that accounts for the decomposition of plant-derived n-alkanes and the build-up of microbial n-alkanes. Model results are in good agreement with measured n-alkane delta D results. Since microbial 'contamination' is not necessarily discernible from n-alkane concentration patterns alone, care may have to be taken not to over-interpret delta D values of sedimentary n-alkanes. Furthermore, since leaf-water is generally D-enriched compared to soil and lake waters, soil and water microbial n-alkane pools may help explain why soil and sediment n-alkanes are D-depleted compared to leaves.

The spatiotemporal evolution of crane populations and their habitats has great value in clarifying the pivotal role of regional lake wetlands in biodiversity conservation. Therefore, 2562 data points of four crane species were selected in this study. The data reflected the distributional position of the cranes over the period 2000-2020. Twelve surrounding environmental factors were selected to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution in the study area by using the MaxEnt model. The Jackknife method was used to identify the main environmental factors affecting the choice of crane habitats. The results indicated that: (1) Developed land in the study area increased by 42,795.81 hm2. The crane populations were mainly distributed in the farmland and mudflat, and their number decreased yearly. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the area of suitable crane habitat experienced an overall decrease. Specifically, the mid-suitable area dwindled by 6234.23 hm2, marking a substantial reduction of 52.05 %. Similarly, the most suitable area saw a decline of 786.41 hm2, representing a noteworthy decrease of 71.09 %. (3) The findings from the analysis of influencing factors revealed a dynamic pattern over the years. Habitat type, water density, and distance to water were the main influencing factors in the study area from 2000 to 2020. This study provides a new perspective on the conservation and structural habitat restoration of crane populations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

The palynostratigraphy of Lake Fimon provided proxies for regional vegetation and climate change and was coupled with sediment petrography, loss on ignition and magnetic susceptibility, disentangling alluvial phases from fluvioglacial activity related to culminations of the southeastern Alpine glaciers. The Fimon area was not reached by alluvial fans during the penultimate glacial maximum, nor by the sea transgression during the last interglacial, but a closed lake soon developed at the Eemian onset due to enhanced rainfall. Sea-level fall at glacial inception triggered the entrenchment of the drainage network in the plain reaching the outer Fimon Basin. Slow aggradation, but no sign of fluvioglacial activity, lasted to 38.2 +/- 1.45 cal. ka BP, when a major forest withdrawal took place, coeval to the spread of alluvial fans. By 27.5 perpendicular to 0.5 cal. ka BP the Fimon Basin was dammed by the Brenta outwash system. The main step of of forest recovery commenced at around (15.8) cal. ka BP, when apex trenching of the outwash fans was triggered by the glacier's decay. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Compositions of first flush and composite storm water runoff in small urban and rural watersheds, north-central Texas	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												The objective of this study was to evaluate chemical compositions of first flush and composite storm water runoff in four small, mixed land use watersheds in north-central Texas. The watersheds range from urban to rural, all discharging to a local lake providing aquatic habitat, recreation, flood control and drinking water. Automated devices near watershed outlets collected samples from seven storm events, from April 2001 to September 2003. Samples were analyzed for suspended solids, pesticides (diazinon, triazine and chlorpyrifos), nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), fecal coliforms and metals. Observed concentrations of most parameters were low relative to drinking water maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) and aquatic life criteria. Fecal coliforms and lead were detected in most samples, with highest lead concentrations in the most developed watershed, likely influenced by building material and automobile traffic. Pesticide concentrations were higher in an initial spring storm event following applications to control weeds and insects. Typical of urban runoff, most ammonia and phosphorus observations exceeded freshwater criteria for streams draining to lakes. Treated wastewater effluent accounted for the highest nitrogen and phosphorus observations. For most constituents, composite concentrations exceeded first flush concentrations, though differences were significant only for fecal coliforms.																			1573-062X						2006	3	1					43	49		10.1080/15730620600578678	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15730620600578678													WOS:000208364500006

To examine how the abundance of cold-water fishes changes along environmental gradients, we assessed the vertical environmental DNA (eDNA) distributions of three salmonid species which may have different water temperature tolerances during both stratification and turnover periods using quantitative PCR (qPCR). In addition, we examined on the vertical distribution of diverse fish fauna using an eDNA metabarcoding assay. The results suggested that the kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) eDNA were abundant in deep, cold waters. On the other hand, rainbow trout (O. mykiss) eDNA were distributed uniformly throughout the water column, suggesting that they may have high water-temperature tolerance compared with kokanee salmon. The eDNA concentrations of masu salmon (O. masou) were below the detection limit (i.e., <10 copies mu L-1) at all stations and depths and hence could not be quantified during stratification. Together with the finding that the eDNA distributions of other prey fish species were also constrained vertically in species-specific ways, our results suggest that climate change will result in substantial changes in the vertical distributions of lake fish species and thus affect their populations and interactions.					; Kadoya, Taku/L-7536-2013; Tsuchiya, Kenji/T-1541-2019	Kondo, Natsuko/0000-0002-0883-0506; Kadoya, Taku/0000-0002-7816-5484; Ito, Hiroshi/0000-0002-4903-8726; Tsuchiya, Kenji/0000-0002-6644-1701													2045-7758					MAR	2024	14	3							e11091	10.1002/ece3.11091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11091								38500853					WOS:001186178800001
J	Degraff, JV; James, A; Breheny, P				Degraff, Jerome V.; James, Arlington; Breheny, Patrick			The Formation and Persistence of the Matthieu Landslide-Dam Lake, Dominica, WI	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												Research shows that the majority of natural dams formed by landslides exist for only a matter of days or weeks. Thus, the persistence of the 11-year-old Matthieu landslide dam and its resulting lake in Dominica, West Indies, is atypical. In addition, its association with the two earlier landslide dams, which formed and failed within weeks of emplacement of the persistent dam, adds to the unusual circumstances surrounding the Matthieu landslide dam. The persistence of the lake is attributed to the size and composition of the Matthieu landslide dam and the rate of inflow from the Matthieu River. Based on end-of- the-year measurements, the water impounded behind the Matthieu landslide dam rose rapidly by 64 m for the first 7 years before stabilizing at the current level. The stabilized lake level may be the result of seepage discharge from an area of springs on the dam face that equals inflow from the Matthieu drainage basin. Unquantified lake evaporation and seepage discharge to the regional groundwater system may also be factors that contribute to stabilized lake levels. The persistence of the lake behind the Matthieu landslide dam will depend on whether the decreased threat of dam overtopping is replaced by an increased threat of failure by piping.																			1078-7275					MAY	2010	16	2					73	89		10.2113/gseegeosci.16.2.73	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gseegeosci.16.2.73													WOS:000278351400001

Land use influences stream nitrate uptake in the Lake Taupo catchment	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												We quantified nitrate (NO3 -) uptake during summer for 11 streams draining into oligotrophic Lake Taupo. Nitrate uptake lengths (S w ) ranged from 258 to 12035 m, uptake velocities (V f ) ranged from 0.2 to 6.8 m/day and removal efficiencies (P r ) ranged from 1% to 59%. Nitrate uptake velocities and areal uptake rates were, respectively, 9- and 26-fold higher for streams in pasture and pine forest land use than in native vegetation. However, average NO3 - export from these streams was also 8-fold higher. Our results suggested that NO3 - uptake velocity (V f ) was highest in streams with higher dissolved phosphorus (P) concentrations and flow velocities, and smaller benthic substrate size, which were characteristic of catchments dominated by pasture and pine forest land use. Uptake (as removal efficiency, P r ) accounted for an average 16% of the stream NO3 - export to Lake Taupo. However, since most uptake is assimilatory, removal from the water column is likely to only represent temporary sequestration of NO3 - and a conversion of inorganic to organic and/or particulate N.

The density and distribution of male, female, and vegetative ramets was determined for three transects parallel, and three transects perpendicular to the island, at mean water depths of 38-306 cm. A strong male-biased sex ratio was observed in shallow water, while sex ratios became increasingly female-biased, and plant density increased, at greater water depths. Cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis was used to characterize the allozyme phenotype of each ramet that had been screened for seven enzyme systems. Overall, 91 allozyme phenotypes were identified. A single allozyme phenotype accounted for 33%-55% of all the ramets (depending on the transect), indicating extensive regional vegetative growth. However, the population as a whole displayed high genetic diversity (H-T = 0.3403), with most of the diversity occurring within transects (H-S = 0.3297) rather than between transects (D-ST = 0.0106). The possible factors accounting for the high small-scale genetic diversity of this clonal aquatic plant species are discussed.

Furthermore, they are also important repositories of high-resolution palaeoenvironmental information and are potentially key archives in the reconstruction of environmental, climatic conditions and past human impacts in areas where other such repositories may not be available. Many saline lakes are threatened by increased farming and irrigation practices and the effects of global warming. Geochemical XRF analyses of a transect of sediment cores from Laguna Salada de Chiprana, a permanent hypersaline lake in the Iberian Peninsula, provide insights into geochemical processes and palaeoenvironmental changes occurring at the site throughout the last 300-400 years. Key changes identified within the sequence are defined both from a spatial and temporal aspect and characterise the profundal and littoral sub-environments of the lake. Initially, the onset of a phase of widespread agriculture and irrigation in the region occurred in the late 16-17th century to similar to 1850AD and was associated with relative increases in lake levels. This was followed by decreasing lake levels between 1850 and 1950AD, likely associated with increasing evaporative processes and decreased irrigation returns to the lake, which also allowed for increased organic productivity in the profundal setting. This may have been associated with the transition of the site to a wetland-type setting, where biological processes were able to flourish in the shallower central depocentres of the lake. In sequence, the introduction of farm machinery and changing irrigation patterns occurred around 1950, causing small increases in lake levels, colonization by charophytes as well as increased organic productivity in the littoral setting, likely due to the establishment of suitable environments for biological processes to occur in the shallower margins of the lake when water levels rose. From this period to the present day, slow drawdown of the lake has occurred coupled with increasing management of the site by the regional government, leading to several phenomena. Evaporative processes are high throughout the lake; there are falling but highly variable water levels and there is a segmentation of organic productivity, whereby falling lake levels permit increased organic productivity in the profundal setting but decrease productivity in the littoral setting due to the establishment of harsh evaporitic and erosive conditions in this area. The reconstruction reveals the high sensitivity of Lake Chiprana as an environmental archive and illustrates the need to utilise multiple sediment cores for accurate palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of saline lakes due to the strong variability in depositional and geochemical sub-environments.					; Garcés, Blas/L-4246-2014; Schröder, Stefan/P-4613-2015; Corella, Juan Pablo/J-2486-2013; Schroder, Stefan/P-4613-2015; Corella, Juan Pablo/CAI-6873-2022	Yarwood, Jonathan/0009-0009-4364-1661; Bishop, Thomas/0000-0001-8253-9293; Corella, Juan Pablo/0000-0001-5127-9011; Valero Garces, Blas/0000-0003-2214-7057; Schroder, Stefan/0000-0001-5464-0108; 														2076-3263				OCT	2022	12	10							381	10.3390/geosciences12100381	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences12100381													WOS:000873340900001

Compared with other regions in Southeast Asia the assemblages are of relatively low diversity. Geochronological data indicate that the Great Songkhla Lakes record one of the earliest mangrove environments in Southeast Asia (8420-8190 cal. yr BP), which are subsequently replaced by a freshwater swamp at 7880-7680 cal. yr BP owing to the decline of marine influence. Sea-level observations from Great Songkhla Lakes and other areas of the Malay-Thai Peninsula reveal an upward trend of Holocene relative sea level from a minimum of -22 m at 9700-9250 cal. yr BP to a mid-Holocene high stand of 4850-4450 cal. yr BP, which equates to a rise of c. 5.5 mm/yr. The sea-level fall from the high stand is steady at c. -1.1 mm/yr. Geophysical modelling shows that hydro-isostasy contributes a significant spatial variation to the sea-level signal between some site locations (3-4 m during the mid-Holocene), indicating that it is not correct to construct a single relative sea-level history for the Malay-Thai Peninsula.					; Gibbard, Phil/AAU-8014-2021	Horton, Benjamin/0000-0001-9245-3768; 													0959-6836					DEC	2005	15	8					1199	1213		10.1191/0959683605hl891rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl891rp													WOS:000233922100009

ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Space-for-time approaches are often used to indicate current or future changes over time. A European gillnet standard facilitates spatial-scale comparisons of fish communities in European lakes. Fish size was generally lower and densities higher in warmer lakes, but less is known about trends over decadal time scales. We analysed the size of European perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) in 2121 Swedish lakes sampled during 1996-2021. The aim was to test whether size changed over time, and whether trends were similar in southern and northern regions. We analysed mean length and occurrence or relative abundance of size classes from the smallest (<100 mm) to the largest individuals (>= 350 mm), and length at 1 and 5 years. The large data set was used to find general trends over time within regions, and within-lake trends were tested for 40 time-series lakes. The mean length of perch decreased in the southern and increased in the northern region. The proportion of the smallest perch increased in the southern, but not in the northern region. The most general trend was an increasing occurrence and proportion of the largest-sized perch in both regions in the large dataset. The average trends in the southern region of the large dataset also appeared as predominant trends within time-series lakes, although opposite trends occurred within some lakes in each region. This study also revealed that perch size at age 1 often increased within lakes over time, while more variable trends were found for size at age 5. The duration of the growth season has generally increased during the time frame of the present study, while other changes may differ between lakes in the same region. We recommend more studies based on time series of fish monitoring, including studies on possible reasons for the increased occurrence of very large perch in Swedish lakes.					; Petersson, Erik/K-7236-2017	Holmgren, Kerstin/0000-0002-0164-8883; Petersson, Erik/0000-0001-6443-4172													0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2023	32	4					735	749		10.1111/eff.12719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12719		MAR 2023											WOS:000961664800001

The study was conducted in the Nechako River Basin in British Columbia (Canada). Relationships were analyzed between daily SCA calculated from filtered MODIS images and the fraction of the flood volume that had already entered the reservoir during the snowmelt period. Results indicate a robust (R-2 = 0.87) and significant (p < 0.001) correlation over a 14-years (2000-2013) period. A similar analysis was conducted for each sub-basin, producing an even more robust relationship (R-2 = 0.90) for the Tahtsa Lake sub-basin. Two distinct relationships corresponding to years with either large or small spring runoff were identified by classifying years according to their maximum snow water equivalents (SWE), peak inflows and flood volume, thus improving the correlations. These empirical relationships are a simple forecasting tool that does not require any additional data other than MODIS SCA and SWE measurements. This straightforward approach can be applied to other mountainous watersheds dominated by snow accumulation and melt.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				JUN	2016	30	8					2735	2747		10.1007/s11269-016-1319-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-016-1319-5													WOS:000374593500010
J	Cheng, GD; Wu, TH				Cheng, Guodong; Wu, Tonghua			Responses of permafrost to climate change and their environmental significance, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												In this paper we summarize recent research in geocryological studies carried out on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau that show responses of permafrost to climate change and their environmental implications. Long-term temperature measurements indicate that the lower altitudinal limit of permafrost has moved up by 25 m in the north during the last 30 years and between 50 and 80 m in the south over the last 20 years. Furthermore, the thickness of the active layer has increased by 0.15 to 0.50 m and ground temperature at a depth of 6 m has risen by about 0.1 degrees to 0.3 degrees C between 1996 and 2001. Recent studies show that freeze-thaw cycles in the ground intensify the heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ground surface. The greater the moisture content in the soil, the greater is the influence of freeze-thaw cycling on heat exchange. The water and heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ground surface due to soil freezing and thawing has a significant influence on the climate in eastern Asia. A negative correlation exists between soil moisture and heat balance on the plateau and the amount of summer precipitation in most regions of China. A simple frozen soil parameterization scheme was developed to simulate the interaction between permafrost and climate change. This model, combined with the NCAR Community Climate Model 3.6, is suitable for the simulation of permafrost changes on the plateau. In addition, permafrost degradation is one of the main causes responsible for a dropping groundwater table at the source areas of the Yangtze River and Yellow River, which in turn results in lowering lake water levels, drying swamps and shrinking grasslands.

Furthermore the durability of production wells may decrease considerably with the presence of oxygen and ferrous iron due to the precipitation of trivalent iron oxides and subsequent clogging. Field measurements are presented for oxygen at a bank filtration site in Berlin, Germany, along with simplified calculations of different oxygen pathways into the groundwater. For a two-dimensional vertical cross-section, oxygen input has been calculated for six scenarios related to different water management strategies. Calculations were carried out in order to assess the amount of oxygen input due to (1) the infiltration of oxic lake water, (2) air entrapment as a result of water table oscillations, (3) diffusive oxygen flux from soil air and (4) infiltrating rainwater. The results show that air entrapment and infiltrating lake water during winter constitute by far the most important mechanism of oxygen input. Oxygen input by percolating rainwater and by diffusive delivery of oxygen in the gas phase is negligible. The results exemplify the importance of well management as a determining factor for water oscillations and redox conditions during artificial recharge.

G.; Frey, D., I			Ice thickening caused by freezing of tidal jet	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												We observed freezing of strong tidal jet of ice-free water as it flows under the ice in Lake Vallunden in the Van Mijen Fjord, Spitsbergen. The size of Lake Vallunden is approximately 1.2 km by 650 m, and its depth is 10 m. It is connected to the Van Mijen Fjord by a channel 100 long and 10 m wide. Due to strong tides, periodical tidal current in the channel exceeds 1 m/s. In winter, water temperature in the channel is close to freezing. It strongly cools while propagating along the ice-free channel. The jet of high velocity from the channel continues into the lake and its velocity decreases in the lake. As the strong current diverges and slows down in the lake, the water freezes in close vicinity of the channel. Ice thickness was measured over the entire lake. Intense freezing occurs approximately at a distance of 100 m from the channel where the velocity of the tidal jet decreases. The ice thickness in this region reaches 120 cm, whereas in the entire lake it is 70 cm. A mathematical model is suggested showing the velocity field of diverging and circulating tidal flow in the lake. The model for numerical simulation is based on a system of shallow water equations together with the transport equation.

Statistical analysis showed that they belonged to two morphologically distinct sub-populations with only small overlap. The rhinoceroses from the two areas fall into the subspecies D. b. michaeli Zukowsky, 1964. The Ngorongoro area does not form an intergrade zone between the subspecies michaeli and D. b. minor Drummond, 1876. An analysis of the data published by Groves (1967) and those collected in the present study, shows that the group of skulls delimited as subspecies minor appear to be situated within a cline between subspecies michaeli and subspecies D. b. ladoensis Zukowsky, 1964. Even if the subspecies concept has no strict biological meaning, it has importance for nature conservation, and much effort should be concentrated on saving the Small East African black rhinoceros D. b. michaeli, as its numbers in the wild appear to be as low as fifty to one hundred.																			0044-3468					AUG	1990	55	4					260	269																WOS:A1990DW12900008
J	Bernotas, P; Öglü, B; Noges, P				Bernotas, Priit; Oglu, Burak; Noges, Peeter			How do environmental factors affect the yield of European eel (Anguilla anguilla) in a restocked population?	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Restocking of European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a widespread practice throughout Europe. Conditions during restocking activities and mortality related to restocking practices have been discussed, however, factors affecting these restocked populations afterwards are mostly not considered. In this study we used a machine learning method followed by generalized linear model to analyze long time eel restocking, commercial fishery and environmental data from Lake Vortsjarv, Estonia, to detect whether significant relationships exist within these data. It was found that environmental parameters can have an effect on the commercial eel yield both retrospectively and during the particular fishing year. Considering that 7-year old eel was the most common age group in commercial catch, we introduced a 7-year gap between eel restocking and yield to study the most important abiotic and biotic factors during the first year of eel restocking that have an effect on the yield. According to our results, cyanobacterial biomass and summer water temperature during the year of restocking had the strongest negative impact on the yield 7 years after, while the number of restocked individuals and copepod biomass had a positive effect. During particular fishing year, however, the yield was most notably positively affected by total phosphorous concentration, number of individuals restocked 7 years before and metazooplankton biomass in the lake.					; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020; Öğlü, Burak/V-6027-2019	Bernotas, Priit/0000-0002-1094-6866; Oglu, Burak/0000-0002-3302-2500; 													0165-7836	1872-6763				OCT	2020	230								105649	10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105649	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105649													WOS:000553385900026

Numerical simulation of a tsunami event during the 1996 volcanic eruption in Karymskoye lake, Kamchatka, Russia	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Karymskoye caldera lake is a nearly circular body of water with a diameter of approximately 4 km and a depth of up to 60 m. The sublacustrine, Surtseyan-type eruption in the lake on 2-3 January 1996 included a series of underwater explosions. A field survey conducted the following summer showed signs of tsunami wave runup around the entire coastline of the lake, with a maximum of 29m runup at the north shore near the source of the eruption, and 2-5m runup at locations on the east and south shore far away from the source. The tsunami has been simulated using the numerical long wave model COULWAVE, with input from reconstructed realistic pre-eruption bathymetry. The tsunami source was chosen as suggested by Le Mehaute (1971) and Mirchina and Pelinovsky (1988). The initial wave was prescribed by a parabolic shape depression with a radius of R = 200 m, and a height of 23m at the rim of the parabola. Simulations were conducted to show principle directions for wave propagation, wave speed and arrival time for the leading wave group at the shore, and the distribution of wave height throughout the lake. Estimated result for wave runup are of the same order of magnitude as field measurements, except near the source of the eruption and at a few locations where analysis show significant wave breaking.

J	Murphy, EC; Tracy, JC				Murphy, EC; Tracy, JC			Century-long impacts of increasing human water use on numbers and production of the American White Pelican at Pyramid Lake, Nevada	WATERBIRDS					29th Annual Meeting of the Pacific-Seabird-Group	FEB 20-23, 2002	Santa Barbara, CA	Pacific Seabird Grp				Anaho Island, Pyramid Lake, Nevada supports the largest colony of the American White Pelican (Pplecanus erythrorhynchos) in western North America. Counts of adults, nests and chicks, from 1903 to the present, are positively correlated with flow volumes of the Truckee River in spring near Nixon, Nevada, 15 km from the lake. Upriver diversions of water have markedly reduced flows of the lower Truckee River and have likely depressed pelican production; for example, the Derby Dam, completed in 1906, diverts water from the Truckee River into the Truckee Canal and out of the Truckee River basin. American White Pelican production was negatively correlated with flows in the Truckee Canal, If water had remained in the river instead of being diverted, it is estimated that annual colony production would have averaged 8% higher. A more complete model, accounting for seasonal diversions of water from the river between the gage upriver at Farad and the gage near Nixon, predicted that colony production would have averaged as much as 58% higher if natural flow regimes had persisted in the Truckee River downriver from Farad. Human removals of water from the Truckee River, and thus simulated reductions on pelican colony production, were highest in drought years. Despite the likely reductions in production throughout the last century, particularly in drought years, numbers of adults and nests at this breeding colony demonstrated no long-term directional trends. Therefore, reductions in production apparently have been offset by higher survival or immigration from other colonies. Even so, higher production could be an important buffer against high mortality events, such as the disease die-offs of large numbers of American White Pelicans at Salton Sea, California, and even natural disasters described by other authors in this symposium.

This issue requires careful investigation. We studied allelopathic activity of freshwater picocyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. on phytoplankton assemblages from three freshwater lakes. In this study, the allelopathic activity of the Synechococcus sp. on the total abundance, biomass, as well as structure of the phytoplankton assemblages were investigated. Our results indicated that addition of exudates obtained from Synechococcus sp. affected the number of cells and biomass of the phytoplankton communities; the degree of inhibition or stimulation was different for each species, causing a change in the phytoplankton abundance and dominance during the experiment. We observed that some group of organisms (especially cyanobacteria from the genus Aphanothece, Limnothrix, Microcystis, and Synechococcus) showed tolerance for allelopathic compounds produced and released by Synechococcus sp. It is also worth noting that in some samples, Bacillariophyceae (e.g., Amphora pediculus, Navicula pygmaea, and Nitzschia paleacea) were completely eliminated in the experimental treatments, while present in the controls. This work demonstrated that the allelopathic activity exhibited by the Synechococcus sp. is probably one of the major competitive strategies affecting some of the coexisting phytoplankton species in freshwater ecosystems. To our best knowledge this is the first report of the allelopathic activity of Synechococcus sp. in the freshwater reservoirs, and one of the few published works showing allelopathic properties of freshwater picocyanobacteria on coexisting phytoplankton species.					; Szczerba, Agnieszka/AAO-1871-2021; Śliwińska-Wilczewska, Sylwia/AAJ-5695-2020; Możdżeń, Katarzyna/AAD-5755-2020	Bubak, Iwona/0000-0001-8387-3883; Szczerba, Agnieszka/0000-0001-9342-0167; /0000-0002-3147-6605														2072-6651				APR	2020	12	4							259	10.3390/toxins12040259	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins12040259								32316304					WOS:000533393900012

Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) add to the chemical cocktail in peregrine falcon eggs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A suite of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) were determined in 41 peregrine falcon eggs collected in South Greenland between 1986 and 2014. Median concentrations of perfluorinated sulfonic acids (SPFSA) and perfluorinated carboxylic acids (SPFCA) were 303 ng/g dry weight (dw) (58 ng/g wet weight, ww) and 100 ng/g dw (19 ng/g ww), respectively, which was comparable to other studies. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) accounted for 94% on average of all PFSAs, but did not show a significant time trend. Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS) and perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS) showed non-linear decreases over the study period, while some long-chain PFCAs increased significantly. The PCN profilewas dominated by the penta-, hexa-and tetrachlorinated congeners CN-52/60, CN-66/67 and CN-42. CN-54, an indicator of combustion, accounted for 2.4% of SPCN on average. All PCN congeners showed a decreasing tendency, which was significant for lipid-normalized concentrations of CN-53, CN-54 and CN-63. The SPCN median concentration was 21 ng/g lipid weight, which is in the high end of concentrations reported for bird eggs. The PCN and PFAS concentrations add to an already high contaminant burden and a complex chemical cocktail in the peregrine falcon population in Greenland, mainly reflecting contaminant exposure during migration and winter stays in Central and South America.

J	Knowlton, MF; Jones, JR				Knowlton, MF; Jones, JR			Connectivity influences temporal variation of limnological conditions in Missouri River scour lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Two scour takes in the Missouri River floodplain were sampled 20 months (April 1996 - December 1997) to examine effects of river inflow on mixing, seston, and nutrient dynamics. Lake NC-11 (approximate to4 ha) is deep (approximate to16 m), sheltered, dimictic, and connected to the river only during floods. Lake S-19 (approximate to20 ha) comprises two sub-basins, a deep (approximate to12 m) riverine forewater perennially connected to the river and a shallow (approximate to4 m), polymictic backwater of variable connectivity. Stratification in NC-11 affected, and was affected by, river inputs - cool inflows mixed completely and sometimes destratified the lake, warmer inflows were partly or completely confined to the epilimnion. Mixing between basins at S-19 was incomplete except during floods. During floods, concentrations of seston and particulate N and P were similar in the two basins of S-19, but conditions in the two basins diverged substantially during inter-flood periods as lower water levels reduced lateral exchange. Seston concentrations in NC-11 during floods were much less (approximate to90% less) than in S-19 or the river. In NC-11, algal blooms (chlorophyll 50-90 mug . L-1) occurred in summer post-flood periods, but larger blooms (chlorophyll 50-256 mug . L-1) occurred in the S-19 backwater during periods of low connectivity in all seasons. Nitrate-N peaked at > 2 mg.L-1 during floods but was exhausted during algal blooms along with up to approximate to90% of dissolved phosphorus Silica declined sharply (up to 93%) in many, but not all blooms, but remained >0.5 mg.L-1 in all observations. Connectivity influenced many take features and enhanced nutrient availability, but other floodplain lakes lacking river connections have similar algal biomass.																			1040-2381					JUN	2003	19	2					160	170		10.1080/07438140309354082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140309354082													WOS:000184887600008
J	HUGHES, P; BRUNDRIT, GB				HUGHES, P; BRUNDRIT, GB			THE VULNERABILITY OF THE FALSE BAY COAST LINE TO THE PROJECTED RISE IN SEA-LEVEL	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AFRICA												Over the past century the average global surface temperature has increased between 0,5-degrees-C and 0,7-degrees-C and the global sea level has risen at a rate of between 10 cm/100 years and 15 cm/100 years. These two observations are thought to be attributable to the initial response to the 'greenhouse effect'. As a result of further and more intense responses, sea levels are predicted to rise by up to 1,5 m by the end of the next century. This paper demonstrates the vulnerability of the northern end of the False Bay coastline and identifies likely sensitive areas in terms of coastal erosion, flood risk and waterlogging. Fish Hoek, Muizenberg, Zeekoevlei, Strandfontein, Strand and Gordon's Bay will all suffer significant losses of property through coastal erosion if no protective measures are taken. These areas and Marina da Gama and Lakeside will also be prone to flooding from sea storms. Areas of Fish Hoek, Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha will experience waterlogging each winter.																			0035-919X						1991	47		4-5				519	534																WOS:A1991GR34700011

Seasonal lake surface water temperature trends reflected by heterocyst glycolipid-based molecular thermometers	BIOGEOSCIENCES												It has been demonstrated that the relative distribution of heterocyst glycolipids (HGs) in cultures of N-2-fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria is largely controlled by growth temperature, suggesting a potential use of these components in paleoenvironmental studies. Here, we investigated the effect of environmental parameters (e.g., surface water temperatures, oxygen concentrations and pH) on the distribution of HGs in a natural system using water column filtrates collected from Lake Schreventeich (Kiel, Germany) from late July to the end of October 2013. HPLC-ESI/MS (high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry) analysis revealed a dominance of 1-(O-hexose)-3,25-hexacosanediols (HG(26) diols) and 1-(O-hexose)-3-keto-25-hexacosanol (HG(26) keto-ol) in the solvent-extracted water column filtrates, which were accompanied by minor abundances of 1-(O-hexose)-3,27-octacosanediol (HG(28) diol) and 1-(O-hexose)-3-keto-27-octacosanol (HG(28) keto-ol) as well as 1-(O-hexose)-3,25,27-octacosanetriol (HG(28) triol) and 1-(O-hexose)-3-keto-25,27-octacosanediol (HG(28) keto-diol). Fractional abundances of alcoholic and ketonic HGs generally showed strong linear correlations with surface water temperatures and no or only weak linear correlations with both oxygen concentrations and pH. Changes in the distribution of the most abundant diol and keto-ol (e.g., HG(26) diol and HG(26) keto-ol) were quantitatively expressed as the HDI26 (heterocyst diol index of 26 carbon atoms) with values of this index ranging from 0.89 in mid-August to 0.66 in mid-October. An average HDI26 value of 0.79, which translates into a calculated surface water temperature of 15.8 +/- 0.3 A degrees C, was obtained from surface sediments collected from Lake Schreventeich. This temperature - and temperatures obtained from other HG indices (e.g., HDI28 and HTI28) - is similar to the one measured during maximum cyanobacterial productivity in early to mid-September and suggests that HGs preserved in the sediment record of Lake Schreventeich reflect summer surface water temperatures. As N-2-fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria are widespread in present-day freshwater and brackish environments, we conclude that the distribution of HGs in sediments may allow for the reconstruction of surface water temperatures of modern and potentially ancient lacustrine settings.					; Bauersachs, Thorsten/AFY-5641-2022; Schwark, Lorenz/AAF-1902-2021	Schwark, Lorenz/0000-0003-0683-0817; Bauersachs, Thorsten/0000-0003-4858-9443; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	12					3741	3751		10.5194/bg-12-3741-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-3741-2015													WOS:000357119000006

Interaction between the severity of the infection by the nematode Anguillicola crassus and the tolerance to hypoxia in the European eel Anguilla anguilla	ACTA PARASITOLOGICA												An experiment was conducted to test the effect of the infection by the swimbladder nematode Anguillicola crassus on the survival of the European eel Anguilla anguilla when exposed to hypoxic conditions. Forty-four wild caught and naturally infected eels were placed in an aquarium filled with water from the fishing site (Vaccares Lagoon, French Mediterranean coast). In this confined environment (271), under decreasing oxygen resources, the first eel death occurred after 45 h (O-2 = 0.98 mg l(-1)) and the last one after 96 h (O-2 = 0.48 mg l(-1)). After dissection and parasite examination, analyses revealed significant negative correlations between the time to death and various parameters of parasite pressure (e.g., number of lumen worms, parasite mass, health state of the infected organ). It was shown that the severity of damage to the swimbladder rather than the count of living parasites was the major contributing factor in explaining the variation in time to death. These semi-experimental data demonstrating an increased eel mortality rate under severe oxygen stress are discussed for their relevance under field conditions, especially during hot summer months.					; Lefebvre, Francois/B-8128-2008	Lefebvre, Francois/0009-0002-9143-1799; 													1230-2821					JUN	2007	52	2					171	175		10.2478/s11686-007-0013-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11686-007-0013-4													WOS:000246729900011

Contemporary spatial extent and environmental drivers of larval coregonine distributions across Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Coregonine fishes are important to Laurentian Great Lakes food webs and fisheries and are central to basin-wide conservation initiatives. In Lake Ontario, binational management objectives include conserving and restoring spawning stocks of cisco (Coregonus artedi) and lake whitefish (C. clupeaformis), but the spatial extent of contemporary coregonine spawning habitat and the environmental factors regulating early life success are not well characterized. In Spring 2018, we conducted a binational ichthyoplankton assessment to describe the spatial extent of coregonine spawning habitat across Lake Ontario. We then quantified the relative importance of a suite of biophysical variables hypothesized to influence coregonine early life success using generalized additive mixed models and multimodel inference. Between April 10 and May 14, we conducted 1,092 ichthyoplankton tows and captured 2,350+ coregonine larvae across 17 sampling areas, predominantly within embayments. Although 95% of catches were in the eastern basin, corego-nine larvae were also found in historical south shore spawning areas. Most coregonine larvae were cisco; <6% were lake whitefish. Observed catches of both species across sampling areas were strongly and similarly associated with ice cover duration, but the importance of site-specific characteristics varied, such as distance to shore and site depth for cisco and lake whitefish, respectively. These results suggest that regional-scale climatic drivers and local environmental habitat characteristics interact to regulate early life stage success. Furthermore, strong regional and cross-species variation in larval distributions emphasize the importance of lake-wide assessments for monitoring both the current eastern basin populations and potential expansions into western Lake Ontario habitats.

The sampling was performed randomly in different seasons of the year and 35 colonial species of cyanophycota belonging to 9 genera were identified. Most of the species were found abundantly in summer season and at alkaline pH greater than 7, which indicate that warmer conditions are required for optimal growth of colonial cyanophycota. Among 35 colonial cyanophycotes, Largest genus was found to be Aphanocapsa with its 8 species having variable pH and EC ranging from 7.68-8.9 and 75.3-144, followed by Merismopedia (7 spp.) having pH and EC ranging from 7.66-8.7 and 92.8-161, Chroococcus (5 spp.) having pH and EC ranging from 7.87-9.8 and 93.67-150.5, Gloeocapsa (4 spp.) having pH and EC ranging from 8.12-8.82 and 130.8-149.2, Synechoccus (3 spp.) having pH and EC ranging from 8.5-8.88 and 102.8-135 and Microcystis (3 spp.) having pH and EC ranging from 7.85-8.7 and 122.3-126, Gloeothece (2 spp.) having pH and EC ranging from 8.12-8.36 and 109.5-118.7, Aphanothece (2 spp.) having pH and EC ranging from 8.07-9.21 and 116.8-122.7 and Eucapsis (1 sp.) with pH and EC i.e., 8.3 and 12.02 respectively.

It was found that Urumqi city was the severest polluted city over the world. The average PM2.5 and TSP concentrations in the winter of 2007 were 187 and 385 mu g m(-3) with maximum of 487 and 1313 mu g m(-3), respectively, 12 times higher than USA standard for PM2.5 and 3 times the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of China for TSP. The city's industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide were converted to sulfate in the air, and sulfate-rich soil dust was transported to Urumqi's air from agricultural fields south of Jungger Basin and surrounding salt lake areas. The mixing of the local anthropogenic aerosol with the transported soil dust from outside the city was the main sources of the high concentration of sulfate, one of the main factors causing the heavy air pollution over Urumqi. The high concentration of ammonium and sulfate salts in the aerosol from both inside and outside city and the low wind speed might be the main factors to form the heavy haze over the Urumqi.

Tree rings are routinely used to reconstruct Holocene climate variations at high temporal resolution(2), but only rarely have they offered insight into climate variability during earlier periods(3). Fitzroya cupressoides-a South American conifer which attains ages up to 3,600 years-has been shown to record summer temperatures in northern Patagonia during the past few millennia(4). Here we report a floating 1,229-year chronology developed from subfossil stumps of F. cupressoides in southern Chile that dates back to approximately 50,000 C-14 years before present. We use this chronology to calculate the spectral characteristics of climate variability in this time, which was probably an interstadial (relatively warm) period. Growth oscillations at periods of 150-250, 87-94, 45.5, 24.1, 17.8, 9.3 and 2.7-5.3 years are identified in the annual subfossil record. A comparison with the power spectra of chronologies derived from living F. cupressoides trees shows strong similarities with the 50,000-year-old chronology, indicating that similar growth forcing factors operated in this glacial interstadial phase as in the current interglacial conditions.

High Intra-Seasonal Variability in Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Temperate Constructed Ponds	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Inland waters play a major role in global greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets. The smallest of these systems (i.e., ponds) have a particularly large-but poorly constrained-emissions footprint at the global scale. Much of this uncertainty is due to a poor understanding of temporal variability in emissions. Here, we conducted high-resolution temporal sampling to quantify GHG exchange between four temperate constructed ponds and the atmosphere on an annual basis. We show these ponds are a net source of GHGs to the atmosphere (564.4 g CO2-eq m-2 yr-1), driven by highly temporally variable diffusive methane (CH4) emissions. Diffusive CH4 release to the atmosphere was twice as high during periods when the ponds had a stratified water column than when it was mixed. Ebullitive CH4 release was also higher during stratification. Building ponds to favor mixed conditions thus presents an opportunity to minimize the global GHG footprint of future pond construction. Ponds are an important contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, but there is still much uncertainty associated with global emissions estimates. To clarify this uncertainty, we investigated seasonal patterns of greenhouse gas emissions from four constructed ponds in a temperate region of the northeastern United States. We found that methane made up most of pond greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis, leading the ponds to be a net source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Methane and carbon dioxide exchange between ponds and the atmosphere followed clear seasonal patterns, with highest rates of methane release to the atmosphere during warm summer months. Ponds consumed carbon dioxide during warm months when aquatic plants were growing rapidly. We also found high variability in methane and carbon dioxide emissions over weekly time periods that was associated with whether the water column in the pond was mixed or stratified. When ponds were stratified, methane emissions were higher than during mixed conditions, possibly due to low availability of oxygen near sediments where methane is produced by micro-organisms that require low oxygen conditions. These results provide a path forward to better estimating pond greenhouse gas emissions at a global scale. Constructed ponds are a net source of global greenhouse gass to the atmosphere on annual basisCO2 and CH4 exchange between ponds and the atmosphere show strong seasonal trends, with CH4 highly variable within seasonSummertime diffusive CH4 release dominates annual emissions budget					; Ray, Nicholas/W-9035-2019	Ray, Nicholas/0000-0002-1959-3120; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				SEP 28	2023	50	18							e2023GL104235	10.1029/2023GL104235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104235													WOS:001067671300001

Halophilic and halotolerant bacteria associated with an unexplored dry salt lake in Algeria have been investigated. A total of 17 isolates were phenotypically characterized. Optima temperature, pH, and salt concentration for growth have been determined. Bacteria strains have been identified based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Enzymes production and antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi strains have been investigated. The results showed that isolates were assigned to three phylotypes, within eight isolates belonging to the genus Virgibacillus, eight isolates to Bacillus, and the genus Halomonas with one representative isolate. All phylotypes were able to thrive on large scales of salt, temperature and pH. In addition, the screening of extracellular enzymes showed that all the isolates were able to produce at least two enzymes. The gelatinase, and caseinase activities were the most produced. The screening of antimicrobial compounds production revealed that these strains exhibited significant activity against Gram-positive, Candida albicans, Fusarium, and Penicillium species. Finally, this biotechnological profiling and the PCA analysis have been shown that LMB3038, LMB3095, and LMB3082 were the most performant strains and present a promising source of important molecules.					; SAIBI, Amina/GOK-2009-2022; AISSAOUI, Nadia/ABI-1791-2020	Aissaoui, nadia/0000-0001-8688-5302; ARAB, Mounia/0000-0002-4135-2649; BOUKEROUI, Yasmina/0000-0001-6685-463X; SAIBI, Amina Nour Elhouda/0000-0001-9406-6278; 													0149-0451	1521-0529				SEP 1	2022	39	9					816	831		10.1080/01490451.2022.2079777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2022.2079777		JUN 2022											WOS:000808177200001

It is based on a range of sedimentological techniques validated in previous studies, with a combination of systematic lithostratigraphic investigations of the infillings accumulated in the lacustrine basin, and sediment analyses of two selected cores. The chronology is based on 10 radiocarbon dates and pollen stratigraphy. On a millennial scale, the Cerin lake-level record shows three distinct successive phases characterised by higher lake-level conditions until ca. 9000 cal. a BP, followed by a maximal lowering at ca. 9000-8500 cal. a BP, and a progressive rise until the present. This rise was punctuated by centennial-scale fluctuations, with major events around 4000, 2800 and after 1500 cal. a BP. Considered on a multimillennial scale, the general pattern of palaeohydrological changes reconstructed at Cerin reflects the impact of orbitally driven summer insolation. This is in agreement with other regional and extra-regional palaeoclimatic records, although every record shows peculiarities in timing and shape depending on the proxy used for reconstruction. In this general context, centennial to multicentennial oscillations appear to have been second-order events in comparison with the major influence of the orbital factor.

Effects of retrogressive permafrost thaw slumping on sediment chemistry and submerged macrophytes in Arctic tundra lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Global warming is predicted to cause changes in permafrost cover and stability in the Arctic. Zones of high ion concentration in regions of ice-rich permafrost are a reservoir of chemicals that can potentially be transferred to fresh waters during thawing. Consequently, input of enriched runoff from the thaw and sediment and vegetation from the landscape could alter lakes by affecting their geochemistry and biological production. 2. Three undisturbed lakes and five lakes disturbed by retrogressive permafrost thaw slumps were sampled during late summer of 2006 to assess the potential effects of thermokarst shoreline slumping on water and sediment chemistry, the underwater light regime, and benthic macrophyte biomass and community structure. 3. Undisturbed lakes had sediments rich in organic material and selected micronutrients, while disturbed lakes had sediments richer in calcium, magnesium and strontium, greater transparency of the water column, and a well-developed submerged macrophyte community. 4. It is postulated that enriched runoff chemistry may alter nutrient availability at the sediment-water interface and also the degradation of organic material, thus affecting lake transparency and submerged macrophytes. The results suggest that retrogressive permafrost slumping can significantly affect food webs in arctic tundra lakes through an increase in macrophyte biomass and development of a more complex benthic habitat.

It was found that the biomass of picoplankton was small (< 0.01 to 0.57 mg l(-1)). The content of picoplankton in total biomass ranged from 0.04 to 28.4% and exceeded 10% only in three cases. The biomass of nanoplankton was much bigger than that of picoplankton ranging from 0.2 to 8.8 mg l(-1). Its share in total biomass was small (8.8%) only in one reservoir and in the rest of them was much higher - from 21.1 to 91.8%. Microplankton reached the highest values of biomass (up to 15.9 mg l(-1)) and its share in the total biomass in four reservoirs was very high (67.2 - 91.0%). Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae were the groups dominating in the phytoplankton community in most cases.

J	Ruffini, G; Heller, V; Briganti, R				Ruffini, Gioele; Heller, Valentin; Briganti, Riccardo			Numerical modelling of landslide-tsunami propagation in a wide range of idealised water body geometries	COASTAL ENGINEERING												Large landslide-tsunamis are caused by mass movements such as landslides or rock falls impacting into a water body. Research of these phenomena is essentially based on the two idealised water body geometries (i) wave flume (2D, laterally confined wave propagation) and (ii) wave basin (3D, unconfined wave propagation). The wave height in 2D and 3D differs by over one order of magnitude in the far field. Further, the wave characteristics in intermediate geometries are currently not well understood. This article focuses on numerical landslide-tsunami propagation in the far field to quantify the effect of the water body geometry. The hydrodynamic numerical model SWASH, based on the non-hydrostatic non-linear shallow water equations, was used to simulate approximate linear, Stokes, cnoidal and solitary waves in 6 different idealised water body geometries. This includes 2D, 3D as well as intermediate geometries consisting of "channels" with diverging side walls. The wavefront length was found to be an excellent parameter to correlate the wave decay along the slide axis in all these geometries in agreement with Green's law and with diffraction theory in 3D. Semi-theoretical equations to predict the wave magnitude of the idealised waves at any desired point of the water bodies are also presented. Further, simulations of experimental landslide-tsunami time series were performed in 2D to quantify the effect of frequency dispersion. This process may be negligible for solitary- and cnoidal-like waves for initial landslide-tsunami hazard assessment but becomes more important for Stokes-like waves in deeper water. The findings herein significantly improve the reliability of initial landslide-tsunami hazard assessment in water body geometries between 2D and 3D, as demonstrated with the 2014 landslide-tsunami event in Lake Askja.					; Heller, Valentin/K-9543-2019	Ruffini, Gioele/0000-0001-9576-6874; Briganti, Riccardo/0000-0002-5643-4049; Heller, Valentin/0000-0001-7086-0098													0378-3839	1872-7379				NOV	2019	153								103518	10.1016/j.coastaleng.2019.103518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2019.103518													WOS:000495520900001

Killer whales (Orcinus orca) face protracted health risks associated with lifetime exposure to PCBs	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations declined rapidly in environmental compartments and most biota following implementation of regulations in the 1970s. However, the metabolic recalcitrance of PCBs may delay responses to such declines in large, long-lived species, such as the endangered and highly PCB-contaminated resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) of the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. To investigate the influence of life history on PCB-related health risks, we developed models to estimate PCB concentrations in killer whales during the period from 1930 forward to 2030, both within a lifetime (similar to 50 years) and across generations, and then evaluated these in the context of health effects thresholds established for marine mammals. Modeled PCB concentrations in killer whales responded slowly to changes in loadings to the environment as evidenced by slower accumulation and lower magnitude increases in PCB concentrations relative to prey, and a delayed decline that was particularly evident in adult males. Since PCBs attained peak levels well above the effects threshold (17 mg/kg lipid) in similar to 1969, estimated concentrations in both the northern and the more contaminated southern resident populations have declined gradually. Projections suggest that the northern resident population could largely fall below the threshold concentration by :2030 while the endangered southern residents may not do so until at least 2063. Long-lived aquatic mammals are therefore not protected from PCBs by current dietary residue guidelines.					; Macdonald, Robie/A-7896-2012	Macdonald, Robie/0000-0002-1141-8520; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 15	2007	41	18					6613	6619		10.1021/es0702519	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0702519								17948816					WOS:000249500700051

From Highs to Lows: Changes in Dissolved Organic Carbon in a Peatland Catchment and Lake Following Extreme Flow Events	WATER												The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in freshwater catchments has implications for carbon availability in downstream lakes and for water supplies. The links between catchment hydrology and stream and lake DOC concentrations are, however, still not fully understood. Much of the literature has been from catchments with organo-mineral soils, with fewer studies from upland peat sites. We used high-frequency fluorescence data, a proxy for DOC, to investigate 1. the relationship between stream discharge and concentration in a blanket peat catchment during extreme high flows and 2. the relationship between inflow and in-lake estimated DOC concentrations. We found that for approximately two thirds of extreme events, there was a decrease in stream DOC concentration (i.e., a dilution) on the rising limb rather than an increase (i.e., a flushing out of DOC from terrestrial stores). Flushing events dominated only in summer when concentrations in the stream were also increasing. In comparison to the stream, concentrations in the downstream lake were less variable, and peaks and troughs were damped and lagged. Replicating these patterns and processes in DOC models would be critical in order to provide appropriate simulations in response to shorter- and longer-term changes in climate, and thus inform future catchment and lake management.

Geometric mean concentrations of total PBDEs (Sigma of nine congeners) ranged from 1.78 ng/mL in the upper St. Croix River watershed to 12.0 ng/mL on the Mississippi River. Lake Superior nestlings fell between these two extremes. Between 2006 and 2011, trends differed among study areas with three declining, two remaining stable, and one increasing. Variation in Sigma PBDE trends among study areas was linked to trends in individual congeners. The lower brominated PBDEs (BDE-47, -99, and -100) declined 4-10% while the higher brominated congeners (BDE-153 and -154) increased by about 7.0% annually from 2006 to 2011. This increase was the greatest in nestlings from the St. Croix River and below its confluence with the Mississippi River. Region-wide, our data suggest Sigma PBDEs increased in bald eagle nestlings from 1995 through the mid-2000s and then declined by 5.5% annually from 2006 to 2011. These regional trends are consistent with the removal of penta- and octa-PBDEs from the global market.					; Dykstra, Cheryl/IAN-1402-2023	Key, Rebecca/0009-0004-5859-4873; Dykstra, Cheryl/0000-0002-9089-3847; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 4	2014	48	21					12516	12524		10.1021/es501859a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es501859a								25272197					WOS:000344449100006

Round Lake lies near the ecotone between sagebrush steppe and dry pine forest, making it highly sensitive to changes in precipitation-evaporation (P-E) balance. We present isotopic, sedimentological, and paleoecological data from a single sedimentary sequence analyzed at sufficient resolution to detect sub-decadal climatic variability. During the early Holocene (11,000-8500 cal yr BP), when summer insolation was higher than present, Round Lake experienced persistent aridity that led to reduced forest cover and small, probably frequent surface fires. Sub-centennial hydroclimate fluctuations during this period were muted, as indicated by low multi-decadal variability in delta 18Ocarbonate records from the region. Oxygen isotopes indicate increased cool-season moisture during the middle Holocene (85005300 BP), but stratigraphic evidence suggests intermediate and variable lake levels. The deposition of the Mazama tephra (ca. 7600 cal yr BP) immediately preceded to a protracted expansion of steppe at the expense of forest. Increased hydroclimate variability and fire activity following ash deposition likely restricted conifer taxa even when elevated cool-season moisture would have facilitated their growth. The late Holocene was marked by persistently high lake levels, as indicated by the lithostratigraphic and pollen records. Comparatively large multidecadal variations in precipitation, which peaked during the last millennium, were also prominent features of late-Holocene hydroclimate, and may have been related to the strengthening of the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Pinus and Pseudotsuga show a 60-100 year lag in their response to hydroclimatic variations inferred from the oxygen isotope records. These results highlight how millennial-todecadal scale hydroclimate conditions, along with abrupt landscape change, influence ecology in a waterstressed region of western North America.					; Fernandez, Alejandro/KVB-8825-2024	Mark, Sam/0000-0003-0479-7048; Fernandez, Alejandro/0000-0002-0343-0634													0277-3791	1873-457X				JUN 1	2024	333								108668	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108668	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108668		MAY 2024											WOS:001239167100001

Identifying resilient Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus) peatland hummock hibernacula	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												At the northern limit of the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake's (Sistrurus catenatus (Rafinesque, 1818)) range, individuals spend up to half the year overwintering. In hummock hibernacula found in peatlands, it is likely that subsurface temperature and water table position are contributing factors dictating habitat suitability. As a step towards assessing the vulnerability of hibernacula to anthropogenic changes, we combined subsurface temperature and water table dynamics to assess the likelihood that unflooded and unfrozen conditions were present in hummock hibernacula. Our results indicate that taller hummocks are more resilient to an advancing frost line and fluctuating water table by providing a larger area and duration of unfrozen and unflooded conditions, and a critical overwintering depth that is farther from the hummock surface. In two study sites along eastern Georgian Bay, an unflooded and unfrozen zone was present for over 90% of the overwintering period for hummocks taller than 25-27 cm. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of peatland hummocks to variability of winter weather where deep freezing and (or) water table rise may nonlinearly reduce resilience. This suggests that height is not the only component affecting the suitability of hummock hibernacula and that further research should examine the structure and spatial arrangement of hummocks within a peatland.

Modal mineralogy of CI and CI-like chondrites by X-ray diffraction	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The CI chondrites are some of the most hydrated meteorites available to study, making them ideal samples with which to investigate aqueous processes in the early Solar System. Here, we have used position-sensitive-detector X-ray diffraction (PSD-XRD) to quantify the abundance of minerals in bulk samples of the CI chondrite falls Alais, Orgueil and Ivuna, and the Antarctic CI-like chondrites Y-82162 and Y-980115. We find that Alais, Orgueil and Ivuna are dominated by a mixed serpentine/saponite phyllosilicate (81-84 vol%), plus minor magnetite (6-10%), sulphides (4-7%) and carbonates (<3%). This reflects an extended period of aqueous alteration and the near-complete transformation of anhydrous phases into a secondary mineral assemblage. The similarity in total abundance of phyllosilicate suggests that the CI chondrites all experienced the same degree of aqueous alteration on the parent body. In contrast, Y-82162 contains a highly disordered serpentine/saponite phyllosilicate (68 vol%), sulphide (19%), olivine (11%) and magnetite (2%). This mineralogy is distinct from that of the CI chondrites, attesting to both a different starting mineralogy and alteration history. The structure and relatively low abundance of the phyllosilicate, and the high abundance of olivine, are consistent with previous observations that Y-82162 represents CI-like material that following aqueous alteration suffered thermal metamorphism at temperatures >500 degrees C. Similarly, Y-980115 contains disordered serpentine/saponite (71 vol%), sulphide (19%), olivine (8%) and magnetite (2%), confirming that it too is a thermally metamorphosed CI-like chondrite. We suggest that the CI-like chondrites are derived from a different parent body than the CI chondrites, which underwent short-lived thermal metamorphism due to impacts and/or solar radiation.

Estimating ice breakup dates on Eurasian lakes using water temperature trends and threshold surface temperatures derived from MODIS data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Ice breakup dates on lakes have a confirmed relationship with the local climates and are useful as a quantitative indicator of climate change, especially in the middle-high latitudes. Many lakes on the Eurasian continent freeze over in winter, but data on their ice breakup dates are incomplete. In this study, we attempt to infer ice breakup dates for 18 lakes on the Eurasian continent using the proposed method based on long-term surface temperature (water temperature trend) and threshold surface temperature. The threshold surface temperature was estimated using reflectance data from the near infrared band together with surface temperature data derived from MODIS. After obtaining the estimated ice breakup dates, we compared them with observed results in order to evaluate our proposed method for ice breakup date estimation. According to this comparison, the estimation error of the ice breakup dates was less than three days. In the last stage of this study, we estimated the ice breakup dates at the centres of 18 Eurasian lakes from 2001 to 2003. The mean ice breakup dates on these lakes in 2002 were two weeks earlier than in 2003 and one week earlier than in 2001.

In perennial water bodies these crustaceans are registered for the whole snowless period, while in ephemeral water bodies for not more than 1.5 months. In subarctic water bodies investigated the animals grow evenly up to the third egg laying, their size being similar to that of the animals from the part of the range. The growth slows down after the third egg laying, but it does not stop completely. Sexual reproduction was observed in all water bodies investigated. Females spawn from seven (perennial pools and small lakes) to three (ephemeral pools) batches of latent eggs. A female lays from 130 (ephemeral water bodies) up to 500 (perennial water bodies) eggs. The older the female is, the more eggs it lays. The numbers of the animals in water bodies strongly decrease since they are eaten away by birds and are carried out by the river flow during spring overflowings. Change to cannibalism is characteristic of water bodies drying out.																			0044-5134					JUN	1987	66	6					826	831																WOS:A1987J874800004

Though, the extent to how plant morphological plasticity actively influences these feedbacks has received little scientific attention. The nymphaeid macrophyte species Nuphar lutea (L.) Smith is characterized by a distinct leaf duality. Floating leaves shade most of the submerged leaves thereby limiting light penetration in the water. Despite their apparent negligible photosynthetic role, submerged leaves of N. lutea remain intact during summer and contribute a significant part to the total biomass. Our results indicate that the submerged leaves are crucial in plant-flow interactions and hence in the engineering potential of the plant, i.e. the capacity to locally reduce flow velocities and to promote sedimentation, including organic matter deposition. Plant individuals growing in running river water were compared to individuals from adjacent oxbow lake water. The number and size of submerged leaves were significantly higher for river standing individuals and the accumulated sediment contained significantly more organic matter, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, and was characterized by a lower carbon/nitrogen ratio and a finer grain size. We therefore argue that the submerged N. lutea canopy in rivers has the ability to create a high-nutrient, low hydrodynamic environment, resembling the conditions found in oxbow lakes.

The forcing mechanisms, the timing, and the spatial extent of this major climatic transition are not well understood and remain the subject of ongoing research. We have used a detailed palaeo-shoreline record from Lake Turkana (Kenya) to decipher and characterise this marked climatic transition in East Africa. We present a high-precision survey of well-preserved palaeo-shorelines, new radiocarbon ages from shoreline deposits, and oxygen-isotope measurements on freshwater mollusk shells to elucidate the Holocene moisture history from former lake water-levels in this climatically sensitive region. In combination with previously published data our study shows that during the early Holocene the water-level in Lake Turkana was high and the lake overflowed temporarily into the White Nile drainage system. During the mid-Holocene (similar to 5270 +/- 300 cal. yr BP), however, the lake water-level fell by similar to 50 m, coeval with major episodes of aridity on the African continent. A comparison between palaeo-hydrological and archaeological data from the Turkana Basin suggests that the mid-Holocene climatic transition was associated with fundamental changes in prehistoric cultures, highlighting the significance of natural climate variability and associated periods of protracted drought as major environmental stress factors affecting human occupation in the East African Rift System.

Glen			A short-term look at potential changes in Lake Michigan slimy sculpin diets	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Diporeia hoyi and Mysis relicta are the most important prey items of slimy sculpins (Cottus cognatus) in the Great Lakes. Slimy sculpins were collected from dreissenid-infested bottoms off seven Lake Michigan ports at depths of 27-73 m in fall 2003 to study their lake-wide diets. Relatively large dreissenid biomass occurred at depths of 37- and 46-m. Quagga mussels (Dreissena bugnesis) composed at least 50% of dreissenid biomass at Manistique, Saugatuck, and Sturgeon Bay. Mysis accounted for 82% of the sculpin diet by dry weight at eastern Lake Michigan while Diporeia composed 54-69% of the diet at western Lake Michigan and dominated the diets of slimy sculpins at all sites deeper than 46 m. In northern Lake Michigan, this diet study in new sites showed that slimy sculpin consumed more prey with low energy contents, especially chironomids, than Mysis and Diporeia in shallow sites (depth <55 m). We recommend diet studies on sedentary benthic fishes to be conducted along perimeters of the Great Lakes to observe changes in their diets that may be impacted by changing benthic macroinvertebrate communities.

Cost and Effectiveness of Hand Harvesting to Control the Eurasian Watermilfoil Population in Upper Saranac Lake, New York	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												An intensive hand harvesting project was undertaken to achieve whole-lake control of Eurasian watermilfoil in Upper Saranac Lake, New York. Beginning in 2004, six crews of divers hand harvested the entire littoral zone of Upper Saranac Lake twice per summer for three years, after which the harvesting effort was scaled down to a maintenance configuration. Eurasian watermilfoil cover and removal data were collected by the crews, and the process was also monitored using permanent underwater transects to track the Eurasian watermilfoil response to management. Eurasian watermilfoil cover was reduced to rare (<5% cover) for more than 90% of the littoral area, and plant removal decreased from about 16,640 kg in 2004 to 460 kg in 2006, the final year of intensive management. Eurasian watermilfoil density in the transects dropped from 1650 stems/ha (+/- 343 S.E.) in August 2004 to 63 stems/ha (+/- 9.26 S.E.) in August 2006, with similarly low density during the maintenance period. Labor cost averaged $351,748/yr during intensive management and $146,475/yr during the maintenance period. Results indicate that hand harvesting is a viable management technique for achieving whole-lake control of Eurasian watermilfoil; however, successful use of hand harvesting requires a large financial investment.																			0146-6623					JAN	2010	48						1	5																WOS:000290834900001
J	Murdoch, A; Power, M				Murdoch, A.; Power, M.			The effect of lake morphometry on thermal habitat use and growth in Arctic charr populations: implications for understanding climate-change impacts	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Oxygen stable isotope temperature reconstruction methods were used to estimate mean experienced summer temperatures from growth zones within individual Arctic charr otoliths sampled from lakes with contrasting morphologies but proximate locations. For either lake, otolith-estimated temperatures were not significantly related to back-calculated growth. Fish in the smaller lake evidenced an increase in growth with age related to increasing use of cooler thermal habitats, with the use of thermal habitat possibly governed by predation risks. No relationships between age, growth or temperature were observed in the larger lake. Significant negative effects on back-calculated growth were observed due to increasing air temperatures in the smaller and shallower lake, possibly owing to warmer surface and littoral waters and a limited amount of preferred cool-water habitat. A similar relationship was not observed in the larger and deeper lake and indicated that resident Arctic charr were not as vulnerable to the impacts of temperature warming, possibly because of better behavioural thermoregulation opportunities in the cooler, deeper lake. Results provide evidence for differing climate-influenced growth outcomes among proximately located populations, with outcomes likely to depend on the differences among habitats, including lake size and morphometry which may act to influence fish densities in available preferred thermal habitats.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2013	22	3					453	466		10.1111/eff.12039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12039													WOS:000319872900011

Diatoms, scaled chrysophytes, and C and N geochemistry show perturbations consistent with recent agricultural activities (post-ad 1980), superimposed upon long-term environmental variability. While the response to Norse agriculture (similar to AD 986-1450) is weak, the biological response to the last 30 years of modern sheep farming is marked, with drastic changes in diatom taxa, delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic ratios, and a sharp increase in scaled chrysophytes. Indeed, current conditions in the lake during the last 30 years are unprecedented in the context of the last 1450 years. The dominant driver for recent changes is likely an intensification of agricultural practices combined with warming summer temperatures. Warm temperatures and agricultural disturbance together during Norse Landnam did not lead to the marked changes seen in the modern lake environment over the last 30 years. The synergistic response between increased climate warming and agriculture will likely have unanticipated effects. These findings confirm the sensitivity of Arctic lakes to external anthropogenic forcing and are the first analyses of their kind for the effects of agriculture in Greenland.					; MATHIEU, Olivier/J-6317-2014; Gauthier, Emilie/C-6640-2013	Christophe, PETIT/0000-0003-4903-356X; Gauthier, Emilie/0000-0002-9238-8190; Perren, Bianca/0000-0001-6089-6468; MATHIEU, Olivier/0000-0002-6387-6996; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2012	22	9					1025	1033		10.1177/0959683612437865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683612437865													WOS:000307641500006

Taxonomic assessment of a toxic cyanobacteria shift in hypereutrophic Grand Lake St. Marys (Ohio, USA)	HARMFUL ALGAE												Grand Lake St. Marys (Ohio, USA) is a hypereutrophic reservoir prone to persistent toxic cyanobacterial blooms fueled by agricultural nutrient runoff. The pervasive and highly toxic 2010 bloom led to the collapse of the local tourism industry, with microcystin concentrations exceeding 2000 mu g mL(-1) at some locations during the peak of the bloom. Sampling from a location adjacent to the intake to the Celina Water Treatment Plant, chlorophyll a levels remained above 25 mu g mL(-1) from June to September, reaching a maximum in excess of 100 mu g mL(-1) in July. Molar ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) declined below 16 in July and August, suggesting the cyanobacterial population became N-limited during the bloom peak. Cyanobacterial biomass was dominated by Planktothrix spp. throughout late summer 2010, but phylogenetic analysis of mcyA sequences revealed the presence of toxic Microcystis spp. during July that coincided with the highest toxin measurements. August and September samples indicated the community shifted to yield Planktothrix spp. as the major toxic genus. Community shifts of this nature may impede targeted remediation efforts, and therefore a thorough understanding of the taxa involved is necessary prior to implementing strategies to limit bloom formation.

The target chemicals fall under the classes of amphetamine-type stimulants, cocaine compounds, opiates and opioids, benzodiazepines, lysergic compounds, antipsychotics, anesthetics, antiepileptics, antidepressants, sympathomimetics, cannabinoids, blood thinners, antihistamines, beta-blockers, caffeine derivatives, nicotine derivatives, z-drugs, new designer drugs, and Alzheimer medications. The sample preparation procedure was designed for unfiltered wastewater and freshwater without the need to separate the particulate matter (if any) from the aqueous phase prior to extraction. Samples were pre-concentrated by rotary evaporation in the presence of a solvent. Method precision (absolute values; N = 6 replicate analyses at the fortification level of 50 ng, k = 6 days) for 87 out of 89 target analytes ranged from 2.8 to 34% (RSD %). The limits of detection ranged from 0.11 to 202 ng L-1, and the matrix effects ranged from +16 to -84%. A total of 10 samples, 8 wastewater, 1 drinking water, and 1 lake water, were collected from New York State, USA, and were analyzed for the target compounds to demonstrate the applicability of the developed method.

Relationships between lake transparency, thermocline depth, and sediment oxygen demand in Arctic lakes	INLAND WATERS												The burial of organic matter within lake sediments can be a significant component of landscape carbon cycling. Whether organic matter deposited in lake sediments is sequestered or mineralized depends on factors limiting the decomposition rate of organic matter, such as temperature and the availability of oxygen. In stratified lakes, the distribution of temperature and oxygen is determined by the depth of the thermocline, and therefore sediment organic matter burial should be sensitive to changes in thermocline depth. Using a survey of more than 30 lakes over 3 years in the Alaskan Arctic, we found that thermocline depth during the summer was positively correlated with water transparency. Furthermore, using sediment incubations from 3 lakes, we found that variation in sediment oxygen demand is primarily affected by variation in temperature and the availability of oxygen with limited effect of the source of the sediments. Because variation in temperature and oxygen concentration in stratified lakes is mainly determined by the depth of thermocline, these results indicate that changes in transparency can have indirect effects on the rate of organic matter mineralization in lakes. A reduction in thermocline depth that results from decreased lake transparency may decrease the breakdown of sediment organic matter and increase the storage of organic carbon in lake sediments.

Temporal and between-site variation in helminth communities of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from NE Poland.: 2.: The infracommunity level	PARASITOLOGY												The relative importance of temporal and spatial effects was assessed in helminth communities of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in 3 woodland sites in N.E. Poland in the late summers of 1999 and 2002. Among common species the rank order of sites in relation to prevalence and abundance of infection was maintained between surveys. Site effects accounted for most of the deviance (in statistical models), bind time was less important, so the exact location from which voles were sampled was of critical importance. The only exception was Syphacia petrusewiczi. In contrast, for derived measures Such as species richness and diversity, most deviance was accounted for by host age, and the interaction between site and year was significant, implying that rank order of sites changed between years. Temporal effects on derived measures were generated primarily by a combination of relatively small changes in prevalence and abundance of the common, rather than the rare, species between the years of the study.

As a result, the trophic state of the majority of the lakes is higher than their potential of trophy, determined by the natural situation. About 65% of the investigated lakes of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are polymictic, predominantly formed during the last glacial epoch. Besides only a few lakes with a summer clearwater phase accompanied by high densities of macrophytes, these shallow lakes are more or less strongly eutrophicated and characterised by permanent massive phytoplankton blooms. Thus the sustained improvement of the water quality is necessary for most shallow lakes in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Based on the research results of the Lake Project in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, a Redevelopment and Restoration Programme has been developed. To ensure sustained success, lake internal measures are only taken when the catchment area has been redeveloped or a redevelopment success becomes visible. The first measures of the programme already have been realised and further ones will be prepared.																			0018-8158					NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					797	802		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008580.93513.44	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008580.93513.44													WOS:000188455600103

At the same time, we recorded meteorological parameters such as air temperature, soil temperature, wind speed and solar radiation using a multi-function mini-weather station (global water 111). Soil, moss and fertilizer samples in study area were also collected. The Hg fluxes of air/soil surface rangeed from -11.0ng m(-2) h(-1) to 219.0ng m(-2) h(-1), averaged at 29.2 ng m(-2) h(-1)(n=508). The data show that the exchange of mercury is bi-directional between air and soil surface: namely both emission and deposition of mercury occurs, but Hg emission is much more frequent than deposition process (n(deposition) = 3,n(emission) = 505). The average mercury content in soil, moss, fertilizer sample are 249.9 +/- 24.1 ng/g(n = 3),450.4 +/- 64.6ng/g(n=2),53.4ng/g(n = 1) respectively.

Part II: Nonlinear scale interactions	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Linearly organized convection and associated horizontal roll vortices occasionally occur in atmospheric conditions in which theory predicts only cellular organization. One possible contributor to the occurrence of rolls in such conditions is nonlinear interactions between different scales of motion. In the winter of 1997/98, the Lake-Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) was conducted in part to investigate scale interactions in linearly organized convection. As discussed in Part I of this series. transient linear organization was observed during a wintertime lake-effect event during Lake-ICE. In Part II two-part nonlinear scale interactions and their possible role in the occurrence of linear organization in an unfavorable environment are investigated. Turbulence-scale vertical velocity variance peaks were consistently observed during roll strengthening and decay, suggesting, a link between the scales. Composites of the nonlinear interaction terms in the roll-scale vertical turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget revealed that nonlinear interactions between the roll and turbulence scales were large compared to the observed change in roll-scale TKE. but do not coincide in time.

Communities were described from 22 sets of emergence data. Two hundred and twelve species were recognized of which 153 were Chironomidae (Diptera). Through clustering and ordination techniques, five communities were recognized: one in the flooded shrub zone along the shore, two littoral, one sublittoral and one profundal. Differences between the communities were more quantitative than qualitative. The majority of species inhabited the shore and littoral stations, and only the hardiest reached the deepest zone. There were few species characteristic of the profundal, none of them abundant. Discriminating, dominant, and characteristic species were determined for each community, as were the ubiquitous species. There is a general decrease in species richness, species diversity and population density, and a change in community structure along the depth gradient. A discontinuity at 1-2 m is related to a sharp increase in Chaoboridae in the deeper waters.																			0020-9309						1986	71	5					655	685		10.1002/iroh.19860710505	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19860710505													WOS:A1986F923900004
J	TOETZ, DW				TOETZ, DW			EFFECTS OF WHOLE LAKE MIXING ON WATER-QUALITY AND PHYTOPLANKTON	WATER RESEARCH												The effect of artificial mixing of 2 Oklahoma [USA] lakes, with a downflow pump, on water quality and algal biomass is described. Artificial pumping in Arbuckle Lake (951 ha), advanced autumnal turnover, but never destratified the lake completely. Ammonia decreased in the epilimnion, while sulfide declined and dissolved oxygen (DO) increased in the hypolimnion. Other water quality parameters did not change. Near-bottom concentrations of Mn2+ increased, indicating pumping did not affect water chemistry near deep sediments (> 16 m). Pumping did not change significantly the depth of the Secchi disc or algal biomass as measured by chlorophyll a. The algal flora was dominated by diatoms at all times, and the density of blue-green algae was always low. Pumping kept Ham''s Lake (41 ha) destratified, but seldom produced completely isothermal conditions or isochemical concentrations of DO. There was no drastic change in other water quality parameters. Artificial mixing decreased water clarity and increased algal biomass by a factor of about 2.5, probably by reducing sinking rates of the phytoplankton. Artificial mixing apparently eliminated a fall pulse of Microcystis.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1981	15	10					1205	1210		10.1016/0043-1354(81)90095-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(81)90095-6													WOS:A1981MH44200007

This study quantifies the processes of hypoxia formation and recovery in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, under conditions of developing metalimnion during early summer, specifically from early May to mid-July 2022. We conducted direct observations of vertical turbulent fluxes of dissolved oxygen (DO), as well as heat and momentum fluxes using an eddy-covariance system (ECS), enabling simultaneous measurements of various variables near a sampling volume. Additionally, autonomous acquisition of vertical profiles for DO, temperature, and Chlorophyll a in the lake's vicinity was performed. Our observations revealed that thermal stratification temporarily developed, leading to hypoxia near the bottom when near-surface air temperature exceeded 25 degrees C. During the metalimnetic period under stable stratification, the ECS demonstrated downward transport of heat and DO, resulting in daily averages of approximately 30-40 W m-2 and 1-1.5 x 10-5 mg L-1 m s-1 (equivalent to 1.1-1.7 mmol m-2 h-1), respectively. Using ECS observations, we estimated a turbulent diffusivity of approximately 5 x 10-6 m2 s-1 during enhanced stratification, consistent with previous reports. Under weak stratification in mid-May, the ECS indicated enhanced vertical fluxes, with occasional upward DO flux. We propose the possibility that phytoplankton acted as oxygen suppliers through photosynthesis activity, promoting vertical DO transfer.

J	Ostad-Ali-Askari, K; Shayannejad, M				Ostad-Ali-Askari, Kaveh; Shayannejad, Mohammad			Quantity and quality modelling of groundwater to manage water resources in Isfahan-Borkhar Aquifer	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Groundwater resources are increasingly exposed to significant overexploitation in many parts of the world, markedly in Iran, one of the most arid areas. Social, economic and environmental aspects including water quality and quantity concerns are necessary for sustainable management of water resources. The aim of the current study was to investigate the changes in groundwater levels and quality in the Isfahan-Borkhar aquifer. Groundwater fluctuation contour lines maps provided in Geographic Information System (GIS) during 1971-2005 in this area indicate that excessive extraction of wells has led to major decline in water levels and a marked increase in concentration of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). The Groundwater Modeling System, a three-dimensional MODFLOW model paired with MT3D, was utilized to survey the aquifer characterization in the area. In the first step, usage high amount of hydrological and geological data, the conceptual model was developed and calibrated in both steady and transient states. The results of the calibration showed that the error between calculated and observed levels was in optimal level. Subsequently, since rainfall is decreasing annually in the study area and the aquifer is in danger of drought, and uncontrolled exploitation of wells has led it to a crisis, two scenarios were considered to simulate quantity changes in the aquifer: Simulation in drought and rainfall reduction. The results indicate that during both the drought period and increasing exploiting from the pumping wells, the level of water has fallen 0.5-0.1 m/s annually, and it will destroy the aquifer. Finally, the calculated hydraulic heads and velocity of flow of groundwater in the aquifer are recovered in the mass transport modelling package MT3D to find the concentration of TDS in the groundwater. Simulation results indicate that concentration of TDS is with far more amount in the areas around the lake located in central parts due to evaporation of Borkhar-Isfahan Aquifer and geological structure of the region. Scenarios considered for prediction by transport model show that concentration of TDS would enhance if the current situation continues; however, this is mainly influenced by hydrology and geology of the area.

J	Thornton, JA; Slawski, TM; Lin, H				Thornton, Jeffrey A.; Slawski, Thomas M.; Lin, Hebin			Salinization: the ultimate threat to temperate lakes, with particular reference to Southeastern Wisconsin (USA)	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												Many lakes in Southeastern Wisconsin (the metropolitan-Milwaukee area) are gradually becoming increasingly "salty". While these waterbodies would not be considered presently to be saline lakes, there has been a rapid increase in the chloride concentrations in most of these lakes over the last 30 years, with the lakes increasing from a mean chloride concentration of about 19 mg/L to over 100 mg/L in some cases. While ecological impacts can be expected when chloride values exceed 250 mg/L, the rate of increase presents a basis for concern, especially since the underlying geology of the region is based on limestone/dolomite which is deficient in chlorides. Thus, the origin of the chlorides is anthropogenic: human and industrial wastewaters (treatment of which has effected improvements in trophic status but has not affected other water-borne contaminants) and winter de-icing practices based upon large quantities of sodium chloride are major contributors to the increasing concentrations of chloride in the region's waterways. Without taking remedial measures, the rate of salinization is expected to continue to increase, resulting, ultimately, in the alteration of the freshwater systems in the region.					; Lin, Hebin/A-8500-2015	Lin, Hebin/0000-0003-2177-4008; Thornton, Jeffrey/0000-0002-9886-9323													0254-4059	1993-5005				NOV	2015	33	6					1461	1475		10.1007/s00343-015-4368-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-015-4368-3													WOS:000364506200013
J	Chlachula, J				Chlachula, J			Geology and quaternary environments of the first Preglacial Palaeolithic sites found in Alberta, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A pebble-tool industry, including two chronologically different stone artifact assemblages reminiscent of the Eurasian Palaeolithic, has been recorded in Late Pleistocene sections at two locations in the Bow River valley, southwestern Alberta. Authenticity and provenance of the deeply buried archaeological record is evidenced by culture-diagnostic percussion-flaked artifacts incorporated in preglacial fluvial gravels and overlying glacial diamictons and by identical textural patterns on stone tools found in and eroded from the exposures. Geological context suggests a fluctuating braided river setting during the earlier occupation. Discarded (lower series) quartzite and hard carbonate rock artifacts, subglacially entrained into the Cordilleran Bow Valley till, document distortion of the earlier site (Silver Springs) by a valley glacier emerging from the Rocky Mountain ice-lobe. Following the valley deglaciation, a later occupation episode is manifested by a formally analogous flaked lithic assemblage excavated in situ on top of the till at a nearby site (Varsity Estates). This more recent occupation surface was subsequently buried under 24 m of glaciolacustrine sediments after submergence of the river valley by a proglacial lake (Glacial Lake Calgary) dammed by the Laurentide ice advance into the eastern Calgary area, implying a minimum early Late Wisconsinan age (ca. >21,000 BP) for the Lithic industry. The presence of the later (upper series) artifact assemblage and the associated palynological data do not support the view that envisages an extremely cold, inhospitable glacial environment on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains throughout the Late Wisconsinan. Their stratigraphic position also indicates temporal asynchroneity between Cordilleran and Laurentide ice during the last glacial maximum in the Bow River valley, the area of presumed coalescence of the two ice-masses. Although a more rapid response of the western mountain glacier to climatic change is evident, the apparent absence of pedogenic alteration of the till surface and the fresh appearance of the excavated stone artifacts suggest that a short time span separated the two glacial events. The archaeological record provides evidence of an earlier Palaeo-American peopling of western interior Canada long before the emergence of the Final Pleistocene Palaeoindian cultures, characterized by elaborate bifacial stone projectile-point flaking technologies traditionally regarded as the earliest cultural manifestations in North America. Silver Springs is the first early site on the continent found below glacial deposits. Realization that other American Palaeolithic sites, potentially of considerable antiquity, should be recognized in similar geological settings, and introduction of adequate geoarchaeological site-survey techniques, have crucial relevance for elucidation of the earliest New World prehistory.

Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) enamel phosphate δ18O values reflect climate seasonality: Implications for paleoclimate reconstruction	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Stable oxygen isotope (delta O-18) compositions from vertebrate tooth enamel are widely used as biogeochemical proxies for paleoclimate. However, the utility of enamel oxygen isotope values for environmental reconstruction varies among species. Herein, we evaluate the use of stable oxygen isotope compositions from pronghorn (Antilocapra americana Gray, 1866) enamel for reconstructing paleoclimate seasonality, an elusive but important parameter for understanding past ecosystems. We serially sampled the lower third molars of recent adult pronghorn from Wyoming for delta O-18 in phosphate (delta O-18(PO4)) and compared patterns to interpolated and measured yearly variation in environmental waters as well as from sagebrush leaves, lakes, and rivers (delta O-18(w)). As expected, the oxygen isotope compositions of phosphate from pronghorn enamel are enriched in O-18 relative to environmental waters. For a more direct comparison, we converted delta O-18(w) values into expected delta O-18(PO4*) values (delta O-18(W)-(PO4*)). Pronghorn delta O-18(PO4) values from tooth enamel record nearly the full amplitude of seasonal variation from Wyoming delta O-18(W-PO4*) values. Furthermore, pronghorn enamel delta O-18(PO4) values are more similar to modeled delta O-18(W-PO4*) values from plant leaf waters than meteoric waters, suggesting that they obtain much of their water from evaporated plant waters. Collectively, our findings establish that seasonality in source water is reliably reflected in pronghorn enamel, providing the basis for exploring changes in the amplitude of seasonality of ancient climates. As a preliminary test, we sampled historical pronghorn specimens (1720 +/- 100 AD), which show a mean decrease (a shift to lower values) of 1-2 parts per thousand in delta O-18(PO4) compared to the modern specimens. They also exhibit an increase in the delta O-18 amplitude, representing an increase in seasonality. We suggest that the cooler mean annual and summer temperatures typical of the 18th century, as well as enhanced periods of drought, drove differences among the modern and historical pronghorn, further establishing pronghorn enamel as excellent sources of paleoclimate proxy data.

To address this, we described the fauna of 12 shallow freshwater bodies distributed from the coast to the central highlands of Iceland. We identified 16 species in 11 genera belonging to six families of Cladocera, and 12 species in eight genera belonging to four families of Copepoda. Five of the species we identified (Alona werestschagini, Cyclops vicinus, Daphnia cristata, Diacyclops abyssicola, and Heterocope borealis) represent new distribution records for Iceland, increasing the number of species now known from this region to 34 Cladocera and 38 Copepoda taxa. Additionally, we discuss the taxonomy of some species with doubtful taxonomical status. Six crustacean taxocenes are described, each characterized by the dominance of different taxa, with bottom sediment characteristics best explaining species assemblage structure. We evaluated the relationships between Icelandic Cladocera and Copepoda faunas and those of the adjacent Svalbard, Faroe, and Shetland Islands, Greenland, and the mainland Norway. The taxonomic composition of the Icelandic fauna is dominated by widely distributed Holarctic, and secondarily Palaearctic and Nearctic species, and is more similar to the faunas of the major North Atlantic islands (64.2-71.8 % similarity) than it is to that of continental Norway.

The former occupied the deeper or central areas of the lake and were most abundant near mid-day; the latter preferred the shallows and were present from early evening until dawn. Although interactions between the 2 spp. were rare, common loons were dominant to red-throated loons except when the latter were close to shore. During peak abundance, common loons congregated in large groups: red-throated loons usually occurred in pairs. Common loons used the lake primarily for foraging, with peak activity in mid-morning and at dusk; the dominant fish species present was threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Red-throated loons obtained much of their food during daily visits to the ocean and foraged intermittently on the lake. Dive durations in shallow water were approximately 30 s for both species and, in open water, 40 s for common loons.																			0008-3550						1980	94	4					398	404																WOS:A1980KZ20000004

Patch age since disturbance drives patch dynamics for flycatchers breeding in both reservoir and riverine habitat	ECOSPHERE												Species dependent upon early-successional landscapes often occupy patches at different stages of recovery after disturbance. The demographic processes that drive patch dynamics in these systems have rarely been described but are important for developing effective conservation and management plans, especially when humans have modified the timing and intensity of disturbances that drive regeneration. In riparian systems, disturbance by floods historically initiated plant regeneration, but many rivers are now regulated and stream flows disrupted by dams and reservoirs. We studied the demography and patch dynamics of an endangered, neotropical migrant bird dependent on remnant riparian patches for breeding, the southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax trailli extimus), over 9 yr at both a riverine and reservoir site in central Arizona. We found that at both sites, number of territories/ha within patches increased for 2-4 yr after colonization and then declined, with several patches abandoned after 6-10 yr. Age of birds increased with patch age, with younger birds in colonizing patches and older, site-faithful birds in older patches, while mean per capita reproductive success did not differ with patch age. Natal dispersal and breeding dispersal were primarily from intermediate-aged patches into either young- or other intermediate-aged patches. At both riverine and reservoir sites, both the number of patches and the number of territorial birds increased over time, with the percentage of territories shifting into younger and younger patches. The type of disturbance driving patch regeneration differed between riverine and reservoir sites (seasonal flooding vs. falling lake levels due to drought), but the demographic patterns did not, indicating that reservoirs can generate patch dynamics similar to those on rivers. Managing stream flows and reservoir levels to maintain disturbance cycles sufficient to generate riparian patches at different stages of regeneration through time would benefit succession-dependent species like the endangered flycatcher we studied, whether those disturbances arise from natural flooding events along free-flowing rivers or through changes in reservoir levels.																			2150-8925					SEP	2018	9	9							e02425	10.1002/ecs2.2425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2425													WOS:000446834100029
J	Teller, JT				Teller, James T.			Lake Agassiz during the Younger Dryas	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Lake Agassiz was ponded on the northward-sloping surface of the Hudson Bay and Arctic Ocean basins, as the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated. The level of Lake Agassiz abruptly fell similar to 12.9 cal (11 C-14) ka BP, exposing the lake floor over a large region for >1000 yr. The routing of overflow during this (Moorhead low-water) period is uncertain, and there is evidence on the continent and in ocean basins for both an easterly route through the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence to the North Atlantic and for a northwesterly route through the Clearwater-Athabasca-Mackenzie system to the Arctic Ocean. The Moorhead low water phase coincides with the Younger Dryas cooling, and a cause-effect relationship has been proposed by attributing a change in ocean thermohaline circulation to the re-routing of Lake Agassiz freshwaters from the Gulf of Mexico to more northern oceans. Paleodimatic interpretations from ecosystems in lake sediments in the region, and a simple calculation of the paleohydrological budget of Lake Agassiz, indicate that the climate remained wet and cool throughout the YD in this region, and was not warm nor dry enough to allow evaporative loss to offset the influx of meltwater and precipitation; thus, the Moorhead phase resulted from changes in the outlet that carried overflow.

Water level control over submerged macrophyte development in five shallow lakes of Mediterranean Turkey	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The functioning of shallow lakes is supposedly very sensitive to water level fluctuations (WLF). Relationships between WLF and submerged macrophyte development were investigated in five Turkish shallow lakes located in a semi-arid to and Mediterranean climate where the hydrological event of WLF is a common phenomenon. In all lakes, WLF emerged as a major factor determining submerged plant development. High submerged plant coverage was observed in four of the study lakes, Lake Beysehir, Lake Uluabat, Lake Marmara and Lake Mogan when the water level was low throughout the year or during growing season, submerged plants expanded; however, in Lake Isikli extensive submerged plant development was observed at high water levels during winter. In Lake Isikli, an increase of 25% in the surface area was recorded, which, in turn, might have resulted in an increased potential for expansion of submerged plants. Furthermore, in all the lakes excluding Lake Beysehir, high submerged plant coverage coincided with a significant decrease in the amplitude of intra-annual water level fluctuations. The depth profile, expressed as the morphometry index (Z(mean)/Z(max)), appeared to be critical for the development of extensive vegetation. Expansion of vegetation coincided with either an increased morphometry index or a flatter bottom profile. However, the impact of hydrology on lake morphometry differed between the lakes. In Lake Isikli, the high water level generated a slightly flatter, albeit not significantly so, bottom; however, in the remaining lakes the same effect was observed at low water level. Differences in the morphometry index in response to WLF appeared to depend on the original bottom profile, which is either conical or ellipsoid. Therefore, the impact of hydrology on the bottom profile of a lake may profoundly affect the extent of the littoral zone. Biomass of carp (Cyprinus carpio) had a strong inverse correlation with vegetation development in Lake Marmara and Lake Uluabat, therefore, carp might also have been important in macrophyte development. It may be concluded that littoral plant communities in shallow lakes located in semi-arid to and regions appear to be particularly susceptible to water level fluctuations.

J	Li, DQ; Zhang, QS				Li, Dongqi; Zhang, Qingsong			Hydrogen releasing law and in situ computed tomography investigation of structural damage of waded lithium-ion batteries	JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE												Wading event of new energy electric vehicles occurs frequently, and wading safety of lithium-ion batteries has been increasingly paid great attention. Here, hydrogen releasing kinetics of waded lithium-ion battery packs are systematically studied. Structural damage of waded lithium-ion batteries are carefully investigated in real time by in-situ computed tomography, and its thermal runaway and explosion limit is further analyzed. The results demonstrate that wading corrosion leads to a significant releasing of hydrogen gas, and hydrogen producing rate is positively correlated with total dissolved solids and the terminal voltage of the battery pack in different water bodies, such as tap water, river water and lake water. Wading corrosion can cause issues such as falling off and displacement of connection nickel plate, thinning of anode metal cap, perforation and failure of the safety valve. Thermal runaway characteristics of Li-ion batteries are obviously affected by wading events, and excessive wading corrosion of anode metal cap causes the battery to lose its explosive characteristic. This research has important theoretical and practical value in solving the wading safety problem of lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle design.																			2352-152X	2352-1538				APR 30	2024	85								110907	10.1016/j.est.2024.110907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2024.110907		FEB 2024											WOS:001204087600001

The results reveal that waters are generally slightly acidic to neutral. The relative abundance of major dissolved species are Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ for cations and HCO3- >> NO3- > Cl- > SO42- for anions. The main water type is Ca-Mg-HCO3. Observed salinity is related to water-rock interaction, ion exchange process, and anthropogenic activities. Nitrate and chloride have been identified as the most common pollutants. These pollutants are attributed to the chlorination of wells and leaching from pit latrines and refuse dumps. The stable isotopic compositions in the investigated water sources suggest evidence of evaporation before recharge. Four major groups of waters were identified by salinity and NO3 concentrations using the Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Consistent with the isotopic results, group 1 represents fresh unpolluted water occurring near the recharge zone in the general flow regime; groups 2 and 3 are mixed water whose composition is controlled by both weathering of rock-forming minerals and anthropogenic activities; group 4 represents water under high vulnerability of anthropogenic pollution. Moreover, the isotopic results and the HCA showed that the CO2-rich bottom water of LM belongs to an isolated hydrological system within the Foumbot plain. Except for some springs, groundwater water in the area is inappropriate for drinking and domestic purposes but good to excellent for irrigation.

B	Luka, N; Lister, NM		Nelson, G		Luka, Nik; Lister, Nina-Marie			Georgian Bay, Muskoka, and Haliburton: More Than Cottage Country?	BEYOND THE GLOBAL CITY: UNDERSTANDING AND PLANNING FOR THE DIVERSITY OF ONTARIO												The mere mention of "cottage country" anywhere in Canada almost inevitably conjures up images of Ontario's forested lakelands. This chapter explores the georegion stretching from Georgian Bay eastward to Haliburton and the Algonquin Highlands and from the French River southward to the Trent-Severn waterway and the Oak Ridges Moraine. Although permanently if sparsely settled since the early nineteenth century, it is widely considered a summer leisure destination, and indeed it is now dominated by second homes numbering in the tens of thousands. Residents of major cities in the lower Great Lakes basin have extended their everyday life-spaces to include its waterfront settings for over a century. What once were modest summer cottages are increasingly elaborate permanent dwellings occupied part-time by Greater Toronto Area residents, entrenching the quasi-suburban role of this georegion. This chapter highlights the confluence of abiotic, biotic, and cultural components in the Georgian Bay, Muskoka, and Haliburton georegion, suggesting how its hybrid cultural-natural ecologies stem from its transitional qualities-both symbolically, as an exurban cultural "edge" to the Toronto-centred metropolis, and functionally, in geophysical terms. Contemporary Ontario folklore tells us that the province contains a space known as "cottage country"-a swath stretching from Georgian Bay through Muskoka into Haliburton and the Kawartha Lakes. History shows that this space is more than a hinterland of second homes for an increasingly (sub) urban society. However, at various junctures in human history it has been the home territory and hunting ground for various aboriginal groups, a place of ruthless resource extraction, and (with varying degrees of success) an agricultural area. As a georegion, it is a compelling case study in the confluence of abiotic, biotic, and cultural forces-the ABC paradigm that underlies the case studies in this volume. This chapter traces how these forces have generated a hybrid of cultural-natural ecologies in this georegion. We pay close attention to the georegion's transitional quality. This is true both symbolically-for this area has become an exurban cultural edge to the Toronto-centred metropolitan region-and functionally, in terms of its geology and ecology, since it straddles the transition from the arable St Lawrence Lowlands to the rocky Canadian Shield, with its proliferation of freshwater lakes. By markedly shaping settlement possibilities and patterns, this "edge" has also tended to be self-reinforcing. It has embedded itself in the materiality of its own cultural landscapes. Its haunting beauty and ruggedness, in concert with the Anglo-American compulsion to "escape" the city, have, moreover, elevated parts of central Ontario to near-mythic status as the very archetype of a summer playground. In this chapter, we present the Georgian Bay/Muskoka/Haliburton georegion through a summary of its physiographic and ecosystem characteristics, along with an account of its human settlement and activity patterns over the past several thousand years. We also introduce a set of critical arguments concerning what this "cottage country" georegion now is and what it represents in the Anglo-American world. Key questions are presented as we trace social history from the earliest human settlement through European colonization and the late-nineteenth-century rise of large-scale tourism. Of particular interest is how this georegion has come to be uniquely replete with saleable landscape commodities in the form of waterfront or water-oriented second homes, most of which have been built, owned, and used by city dwellers. Of course, other regions in Ontario, across North America, and around the world are also strongly marked by the presence of second homes. Yet in this area these waterfront settlement patterns represent an especially characteristic intersection of abiotic, biotic, and cultural layers of the landscape of the georegion of which they are part. They are not the only distinguishing features, but they are extremely salient. We suggest ways in which the curious blend of abiotic, biotic, and cultural forces in this georegion can offer hope for the contemporary challenge of getting people to understand the links between "nature" and "culture" in human settlement systems. Our chapter therefore culminates with a set of comments for planning and design practice.

J	Szymanek, M				Szymanek, Marcin			Environmental changes of the Mazovian (Holsteinian/∼MIS 11) palaeolake near Szymanowo (eastern Poland) in the light of malacological analysis	ACTA GEOLOGICA POLONICA												The malacofauna of the palaeolake deposits at Szymanowo (eastern Poland) was investigated. It represents the younger part of the climatic optimum of the Mazovian (Holsteinian) Interglacial (similar to MIS 11) and possibly the post-optimal period. The mollusc assemblage is composed of both standing and running water species, mostly connected with temperate climate. The presence of biostratigraphical indicators of the Mazovian, Viviparus diluvianus (Kunth, 1865), Lithoglyphus jahni Urbanski, 1975 and Pisidium clessini Neumayr, 1875, is noteworthy. Variability in the structure and composition of the assemblage enables palaeoecological reconstruction. Changes in the water-level, vegetation and energy conditions are inferred from the malacological succession. Three stages of the lake development were distinguished. The first one is connected with deeper conditions and predominance of V. diluvianus and L. jahni. The second one, dominated by Bithynia tentaculata (Linnaeus, 1758), records a fall of the water-level and the growth of aquatic plants, evidenced by high frequencies of Valvata cristata Muller, 1774 and Acroloxus lacustris (Linnaeus, 1758). The third stage corresponds to another rise of the water-level and an increase in V. diluvianus, L. jahni, Valvata piscinalis M ller, 1774 and Pisidium henslowanum (Sheppard, 1823), which evidence some higher energy conditions.

Eight freshwater hydrophobic DOM(HPO) share 10-17% formulas that were mainly lignin-like compounds. Unique signatures were synthesized: unique to the high-humic HPO (Suwannee River and Blavet River) were condensed aromatic and some aliphatic compounds with H/C > 1.5 and O/C < 0.2, which is considered as decisive of these black river water. Medium-humic isolates (Loire River, Seine River, South Platte River, and Ribou Dam) did not show explicit unique signatures. Nonetheless, enhanced chemodiversity was observed for mediumhumic isolates extracted from a variety of indigenous environmental conditions. As an example, South Platte River HPO isolated in winter showed signatures similar to low-humic HPO (Colorado River), i.e., predominantly aliphatic CHO (H/C > 1.0). Effluent HPO was mainly aliphatic molecules with 0.2 < O/C < 0.5 and enriched in S-bearing molecules, and molecules unique to glacial DOM (Pony Lake) incorporated N-bearing compounds that were inferiorly oxidized and were considered as microbial-derived. The weight-averaged double bond equivalent and elemental ratio derived from FTICR-MS were compared with SUVA(254) and the results from elemental analysis. This acts as the first study to synthesize unique chemical compositions that distinguish different types of DOM and determine certain reactivity. It is also a significant reference for future studies using similar types of DOM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This instrument, sensitive to thermal infrared radiation in the 8-14 mu m wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum is fitted with a telephoto lens and gives a restricted held of view at the water surface, enabling temperature estimation to +/-0.2 degrees C. For example, over a period of 1 h it was possible, from suitably selected vantage points, to record 475 point measurements of temperature over the entire surface of a reservoir some 1 km(2) in area (Embalse de Rioseco, northern Spain). Repeated sets of observations permitted the recognition of upwelling and sinking water masses. The technique enabled the detection of influx of cold water from springs along a geological fault zone in the Embalse de Tanes. Additionally, the inception and the temporal and spatial evolution of an influent plunging plume was monitored using this equipment. Although thermal radiometry is restricted to the measurement of surface water temperatures, its speed of data acquisition over a wide area should enhance appreciation of the thermal behaviour of lakes and provide an important complement to existing techniques.

It is the most important wintering area for the endangered Siberian cranes. Identifying the scale characteristics of habitat selection for Siberian cranes is essential for habitat conservation. In this study, a habitat suitability index (HSI) model based on multiscale habitat features was developed to assess the distribution and fragmentation degree of the suitable habitat for Siberian cranes before and after the construction of the proposed Poyang Lake Hydraulic Project (PLHP). The habitat of the entire lake area was divided into four ranks on the basis of HSI values. 2D shallow-water equations (SWEs), combined with remote sensing and geographic information system technology, were utilized to determine the key habitat features. Results indicated that the established HSI model could effectively recognize the potentially suitable habitats for Siberian cranes in Poyang Lake. The highly suitable habitat in the wet year was larger than that in the dry year, and the complexity of patch shapes and patch fragmentation increased. The influence of the PLHP on the suitable habitat for cranes mainly depended on its regulated water level, and this project could promote the formation and reduce the fragmentation degree of the suitable habitat under a properly regulated water level in the dry year. However, a higher regulated water level may cause a considerable negative impact on the distribution of suitable habitats in both years. This study provided a quantitative method to evaluate the potentially suitable habitats for Siberian cranes, and it could serve as a reference for the water level management of the proposed PLHP.

J	Pillsbury, RW; Lowe, RL				Pillsbury, RW; Lowe, RL			The response of benthic algae to manipulations of light in four acidic lakes in northern Michigan.	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We investigated the effects of light on benthic algal communities in four acidic lakes (Johnson Lake, McNearney Lake, Avery Lake and Garlinghouse Lake) in northern Michigan (U.S.A.) that differed in dissolved organic content. In mid-summer, a series of light filters was placed 1 cm above the sediment of each lake at a depth of 2-3 m to filter out 0%, 80% and 90% of light reaching the lake bottom. After 5 weeks, the biomass and taxonomic composition of algal communities developing under these light conditions were quantified. Light accounted for most of the variation in algal biomass (r(2)=0.79). High-light conditions promoted filamentous green-algal ( Zygnematales) growth, while diatoms and desmids had both a greater absolute and relative abundance in lower light conditions. We hypothesize that shading by large colonies of filamentous green algae, common in acidic lakes could positively affect diatom abundance possibly by protection from UV-light or photoinhibition. Large colonies of Mougeotia sp. could also benefit by self-shading in excessive light conditions.																			0018-8158						1999	394						69	81		10.1023/A:1003509420743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003509420743													WOS:000081925200008

In this study, a merged temperature inference model using fossil chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) datasets from Finland and Poland was constructed to fill the lack of an applicable training set for East European sites. The developed weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) inference model showed favorable performance statistics, suggesting that the model can be useful for downcore reconstructions. The combined calibration model includes 212 sites, 142 taxa, and a temperature gradient of 11.3-20.1 degrees C. The 2-component WA-PLS model has a cross-validated coefficient of determination of 0.88 and a root mean squared prediction error of 0.88 degrees C. We tested the new East European temperature transfer function in chironomid stratigraphies from a Finnish high-resolution short-core sediment record and a Polish paleolake (Zabieniec) covering the past similar to 20 000 yr. In the Finnish site, the chironomid-inferred temperatures correlated closely with the observed instrumental temperatures, showing improved accuracy compared to estimates by the original Finnish calibration model. In addition, the long-core reconstruction from the Polish site showed logical results in its general trends compared to existing knowledge on the past regional climate trends; however, it had distinct differences when compared with hemispheric climate oscillations. Hence, based on these findings, the new temperature model will enable more detailed examination of long-term temperature variability in Eastern Europe, and consequently, reliable identification of local and regional climate variability of the past.

J	Mason, RP; Rolfhus, KR; Fitzgerald, WF				Mason, RP; Rolfhus, KR; Fitzgerald, WF			Mercury in the North Atlantic	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Reactive mercury (Hg) concentrations (0.80 +/- 0.44 pM), measured during a cruise in the sub-polar North Atlantic (50-70 degrees N) in August 1993 were lower those of more southerly regions of this ocean, A large fraction of the Hg in the surface waters was elemental Hg (Hg degrees; 88% of the reactive Hg, on average; 0.65 +/- 0.50 pM), Little dimethylmercury (DMHg) or monomethylmercury (MMHg) was found in surface waters but higher concentrations were found at depth. The high surface water Hg degrees concentrations likely reflect production of Hg degrees in concert with the short season of primary production in these waters. Overall, gas exchange plays a dominant role in the cycle of Hg in the upper waters of this region. For the sub-thermocline waters, a comparison of the Hg speciation in different water masses suggests that surface waters accumulate reactive Hg and methylated Hg-due to input of reactive Hg via remineralization and conversion of reactive Hg to methylated Hg-after sinking during winter to form North Atlantic deep water. Reactive Hg concentrations varied between water masses with the lowest concentrations being found in the waters north of Iceland (the source waters for deep water formation). DMHg was found throughout the sub-thermocline water column and the limited data set for MMHg suggests that this species was also prevalent. These observations suggest that methylated Hg production in the ocean is not confined to low oxygen or anoxic regions, as has been found in lakes. Concentrations of DMHg (0.08 +/- 0.07 pM, on average) were lower than those previously measured in the equatorial Pacific. Total Hg concentrations averaged 2.4 +/- 1.6 pM but little of this was particulate Hg (<10 pg l(-1), typically). There was evidence of colloidally-bound Hg in surface waters. Overall, the data strengthen our hypotheses concerning Hg biogeochemical cycling in the ocean and confirm the importance of gas exchange and Hg methylation in the fate and transport of Hg in the ocean.

Water, suspended matter, and bottom sediment samples were collected at eleven stations in Lake Ontario. The concentrations of t-PCBs in the suspended matter in the nepheloid layer ranged from 151 to 728 ng/g (dry wt) in 1987-1989, and were greater than those in most of the top 3-cm sediments (<1-405 ng/g dry wt). The suspended matter in the nepheloid layer contained more lower chlorinated biphenyls, particularly tetra- and pentachlorobiphenyls, than the bottom sediments. The greatest concentrations (up to 4100 ng/g dry wt) existed in the suspended matter at 15 m above the lake bottom after the development of the nepheloid layer. The results of the study indicated the association of t-PCBs with allochthonous particles originating mainly during the summer months in the surface water which were sinking through the water column and accumulated in the nepheloid layer in late August and September.																			0048-9697					DEC 18	1994	158	1-3					113	125		10.1016/0048-9697(94)04248-L	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(94)04248-L													WOS:A1994PZ32800013

The resolution of this record is better than 50 yr and the age model is derived from radiocarbon ages of terrestrial charcoal, which eliminates errors associated with the lake hard-water effect. We made down-core geochemical measurements of % carbonate, % organic carbon, C/N and delta C-13 of bulk organic matter, delta C-13 and delta O-18 of carbonate, and % dolomite. Proxy calibration and modern water-balance reconstruction show that these are proxies for lake depth and the amount of monsoon precipitation. We find that lake level and monsoon precipitation have been decreasing at Ahung Co since the early Holocene (similar to 7500 cal yr B.P.). Superimposed on this trend are rapid declines in monsoon rainfall at 7000-7500 and 4700 cal yr B.P. and seven century-scale wet-dry oscillations. The cores do not contain sediment from the last similar to 4000 yr. Surface sediments from the lake accumulated during the 20th century, however. From this, we argue that lake levels have risen again recently following a late Holocene dry period. (c) 2005 University of Washington.

The following features were analysed: the start and end of ice phenomena and ice cover, their duration, and the stability of ice cover at observation sites of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management on lakes located in various physical-geographic regions. Multi-year tendencies of change in the ice parameters under study were identified. The most statistically significant negative trends were observed for the ending dates of ice phenomena and their duration. Changes in the ice characteristics in the different NAO(DJFM) stages were determined on the basis of their deviations: between years with high (> 1.7) and low (< - 1.09) values of the winter NAO index, and from average values from the years 1961-2010. Changes in the intensity of the North Atlantic Oscillation affect all the parameters of ice phenomena except their starting dates. In a negative NAO(DJFM) stage, ice phenomena and ice cover end later and last longer; also, the maximum thickness of ice cover is greater, its forms later and is more stable than in a positive stage and in average conditions.

We found that the species composition of phytoplankton in each lake is strictly individual. The ecological preferences of diatom species in the studied water bodies were determined for more than 90% of the list. Indicator characteristics show a certain response of the species composition of phytoplankton to changes in salinity and organic pollution. Several regularities were revealed in the spatial distribution of diatom communities in the study area in connection with the physicochemical parameters of their habitat, the height of the lake, its remoteness from the seacoast, and belonging to a specific watershed. Statistical mapping of the data on the diversity of communities and the chemical properties of water revealed a strong reaction of the communities of water bodies to point one-time anthropogenic pollution, and also made it possible to assume the influence of summer, northeast winds on the species composition as a climatic factor. The results of the study are important for developing the foundations for monitoring the non-impact (background), ecologically sensitive territory of the Arctic. They are highly relevant for assessing the consequences of local anthropogenic impacts and climate change in the future. Spatial ecological mapping in conjunction with bioindication can be used as a new method for identifying natural and non-natural stress factors.					; Genkal, Sergeyl/Q-8090-2016; Barinova, Sophia/AAH-6720-2019	Barinova, Sophia/0000-0001-9915-2503; 														2073-4441				APR	2023	15	8							1533	10.3390/w15081533	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15081533													WOS:000977976300001

This study examines the potential impacts of temperature thresholds on the water budget in the GSL, emphasizing the influence on snowmelt, evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff under varying climate warming scenarios. Current hydrological models such as the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model use a universal temperature threshold to partition snowfall and rainfall across different regions. Previous studies have argued that there is a wide range of thresholds for partitioning rainfall and snowfall across the globe. However, there is a clear knowledge gap in quantifying water budget components in the Great Salt Lake (GSL) basin corresponding to varying temperature thresholds for separating rainfall and snowfall under the present and future climates. To address this gap, the study applied temperature thresholds derived from observation-based data available from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to the VIC model. We also performed a suite of hydrological experiments to quantify the water budget of the Great Salt Lake basin by perturbing temperature thresholds and climate forcing. The results indicate that higher temperature thresholds contribute to earlier snowmelt, reduced snowpack, and lower peak runoff values in the early spring that are likely due to increased ET before peak runoff periods. The results show that the GSL undergoes higher snow water equivalent (SWE) values during cold seasons due to snow accumulation and lower values during warm seasons as increased temperatures intensify ET. Projected climate warming may result in further reductions in SWE (similar to 71%), increased atmospheric water demand, and significant impacts on water availability (i.e., runoff reduced by similar to 20%) in the GSL basin. These findings underscore the potential challenges that rising temperatures pose to regional water availability.

Anaerobic processes accounted for an average of 92% of D-total in the depressions of deep-water lakes; for the sediments of shallow lakes, high rates of oxygen uptake were noted. The SR rate in different lakes varied from 0.09 to 2.60 mg S2-/(dM(3) day). At low sulfate concentrations (13.3-70.6 mg S-SO42-/dm(3)), characteristic of the BS of freshwater ecosystems, the main factor that affected the SR rate in the BS of the lakes studied was the content of readily available organic matter; only in special cases, was it affected by a change in the sulfate ion concentration. In shallow lakes, temperature-dependent activation of sulfate-reducing bacteria and their inhibition by acidification of the environment were recorded. The contribution of SR to D-total was 0.2 to 11.0%.

In a perspective of the 6110 of I I modern Ethiopian lakes and their shells, the 8110 of the Hadar fossil shells provide a snapshot of the nature of ancient Lake Hadar and Ethiopia's climate in the Pliocene. Ethiopia's modern lakes both in the Rift and on the Western Plateau are fed by drainage of Plateau rain with its well established barely negative delta(18)O(SMOW) of -1.3%(0). Except for the man-made Lake Koka reservoir, all other Ethiopian lakes are isotopically quite positive ranging from +5.4 to +16.0%(0), indicating how significant evaporation is in their water budget. Shells from lakes with extant mollusk populations are mostly in isotopic equilibrium with the delta(18)O and temperature of their lake water. The upper transgressive interval in the Sidi Hakoma Member is the largest one in the Formation beginning at its base with the 'Gastropod Beds' beach deposits. Mollusks from shell beds other than the 'Gastropod Beds' show more positive and more variable delta(18)O between shells, with internal variations within shells as much as 7%(0). At these times the site must have been underlain by a shallow partially isolated embayment of Lake Hadar which underwent rapid expansions and then contractions by evaporation, within the few year lifetimes of the individual mollusks. The results from the 'Gastropod Beds' are of most significance for interpreting the overall paleoclimate at Hadar. Their uniformly negative delta(18)O(PDB) shell values that average -6.7%(0) represent a much less evaporated stage of Lake Hadar when its delta(18)O(SMOW) was 8%(0) lower than the spectrum of modern lakes in Ethiopia, and indeed even 3 %(0) or more lower than average modern Plateau rain. To explain such negative values we hypothesize that the Atlantic-derived air mass component to the Ethiopian monsoon was persistently strengthened during Pliocene summers, which intensified the amount and the negative isotopic character of rainfall onto both the Afar and the Ethiopian Plateaus that drained to Lake Hadar. A similar phenomenon characterized the brief periodic pluvial episodes of the Quaternary, including the latest in the early Holocene, known as the African Humid Period. In contrast to the hot semi-desert steppe conditions of today's western Afar, the diverse abundant terrestrial fossil fauna at Hadar, including the early hominid Australopithecus afarensis, is explained by the wetter, and probably cooler, summers that persisted throughout the Late Pliocene.

We examined the impact of these factors by contrasting abundance changes of birds of different breeding habitat, latitudinal distribution, and migratory behavior. We examined data from the semiquantitative Breeding Bird Atlas of Lake Constance, which borders Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. Changes in the regional abundance of the 159 coexisting bird species from 1980-1981 to 2000-2002 were influenced by all three factors. Farmland birds, species with northerly ranges, and long-distance migrants declined, and wetland birds and species with southerly ranges increased in abundance. A separate analysis of the two decades between 1980-1981 and 1990-1992 and between 1990-1992 and 2000-2002 showed that the impact of climate change increased significantly over time. Latitudinal distribution was not significant in the first decade and became the most significant predictor of abundance changes in the second decade. Although the spatial scale and temporal resolution of our study is limited, this is the first study that suggests that climate change has overtaken land-use modification in determining population trends of Central European birds.

The lagoon is connected to the North Atlantic Ocean through a 6 m deep narrow channel. Four hydrographic surveys in spring 2012, and a 2011 4-month long temperature and salinity time series of lagoon inflow show that the lake has significantly changed since 1976. Warm saline ocean water enters each tidal cycle and descends below the maximum sampled depths. The lagoon has a surface layer of ice melt, freshwater and Atlantic derived water. Beneath 10 m depth an advective/diffusive balance is responsible for determining the temperature and salinity of the lagoon waters down to similar to 90 m. To maintain the observed hydrographic structure, we calculate an upwelling of deep water of similar to 0.2 m d(-1). A survey within 30 m of Breioamerkurjokull showed that the warmest and most saline waters sampled within the lagoon below 10 m depth were adjacent to the glacier face, along with multiple interleaved warm and cold layers. A heat and salt balance model shows that submarine melting along the ice face generates multiple meltwater plumes that are mixed and diluted within 200 m of the ice face.

Environmental influence on cyanobacteria abundance and microcystin toxin production in a shallow temperate lake	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The increasing frequency of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater systems is a commonly recognized problem due to detrimental effects on water quality. Vancouver Lake, a shallow, tidally influenced lake in the flood plain of the Columbia River within the city of Vancouver, WA, USA, has experienced numerous summertime cyanobacterial blooms, dominated by Aphanizomenon sp. and Anabaena sp. Cyanobacteria abundance and toxin (microcystin) levels have been monitored in this popular urban lake for several years; however, no previous studies have identified which cyanobacteria species produce toxins, nor analyzed how changes in environmental variables contribute to the fluctuations in toxic cyanobacteria populations. We used a suite of molecular techniques to analyze water samples from Vancouver Lake over two summer bloom cycles (2009 and 2010). Both intracellular and extracellular microcystin concentrations were measured using an ELISA kit. Intracellular microcystin concentrations exceeded WHO guidelines for recreational waters several times throughout the sampling period. PCR results demonstrated that Microcystis sp. was the sole microcystin-producing cyanobacteria species present in Vancouver Lake, although Microcystis sp. was rarely detected in microscopical counts. qPCR results indicated that the majority of the Microcystis sp. population contained the toxin-producing gene (mcyE), although Microcystis sp. abundance rarely exceeded 1 percent of overall cyanobacteria abundance. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that PO4-P was the main environmental variable influencing the abundance of toxic and non-toxic cyanobacteria, as well as intracellular microcystin concentrations. Our study underscores the importance of using molecular genetic techniques, in addition to traditional microscopy, to assess the importance of less conspicuous species in the dynamics of harmful algal blooms.

Early HAB detection is possible by monitoring chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration. Ground-based Chl-a data have limited spatial and temporal coverage but can be geo-registered with temporally coincident satellite imagery to calibrate a remote sensing-based predictive model for regional mapping over time. When matching ground and satellite data, positional and temporal discrepancies are unavoidable due particularly to dynamic lake surfaces, thereby biasing the model calibration. This limitation has long been recognized but so far has not been addressed explicitly. To mitigate such effects of data mismatching, we proposed an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)-like weighted regression algorithm that relies on an error-based heuristic to automatically favor "good" data points and downplay "bad" points. We evaluated the algorithm for estimating Chl-a over inland lakes in Ohio using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2. The AIC-like weighted regression estimates showed superior performance with an R2 of 0.91 and an error variance (sigma E2) of 0.29 mu g/L, outperforming linear regression (R2 = 0.34, sigma E2 = 2.34 mu g/L) and random forest (R2 = 0.82, sigma E2 = 0.92 mu g/L). We also noticed the poorest performance occurred in the spring due to low reflectance variation in clear water and low Chl-a concentration. Our weighted regression scheme is adaptive and generically applicable. Future studies may adopt our scheme to tackle other remote sensing estimation problems (e.g., terrestrial applications) for alleviating the adverse effects of geolocation errors and temporal discrepancies.					; Park, Jongmin/AAR-8282-2020	Khanal, Sami/0000-0003-3875-4054; Byun, Kyuhyun/0000-0001-7645-2917; 														2072-4292				AUG	2024	16	15							2761	10.3390/rs16152761	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16152761													WOS:001287043600001
J	Shi, JJ; Chang, SW; Holt, TR; Hogan, TF; Westphal, DL				Shi, JJ; Chang, SW; Holt, TR; Hogan, TF; Westphal, DL			A meteorological reanalysis for the 1991 Gulf War	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												In support of the Department of Defense's Gulf War Illness study, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has performed global and mesoscale meteorological reanalyses to provide a quantitative atmospheric characterization of the Persian Gulf region during the period between 15 January and 15 March 1991. This paper presents a description of the mid- to late-winter synoptic conditions, mean statistical scores, and near-surface mean conditions of the Gulf War theater drawn from the 2-month reanalysis. The reanalysis is conducted with the U. S. Navy's operational global and mesoscale analysis and prediction systems: the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) and the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS*). The synoptic conditions for the 2-month period can be characterized as fairly typical for the northeast monsoon season, with only one significant precipitation event affecting the Persian Gulf region. A comparison of error statistics to those from other mesoscale models with similar resolution covering complex terrains ( though in different geographic locations) is performed. Results indicate similar if not smaller error statistics for the current study even though this 2-month reanalysis is conducted in an extremely data-sparse area, lending credence to the reanalysis dataset. The mean near-surface conditions indicate that variability in the wind and temperature fields arises mainly because of the differential diurnal processes in the region characterized by complex surface characteristics and terrain height. The surface wind over lower elevation, interior, land regions is mostly light and variable, especially in the nocturnal surface layer. The strong signature of diurnal variation of sea - land as well as lake - land circulation is apparent, with convergence over the water during the night and divergence during the day. Likewise, the boundary layer is thus strongly modulated by the diurnal cycle near the surface. The low mean PBL height and light mean winds combine to yield very low ventilation efficiency over the Saudi and Iraqi plains.																			0027-0644	1520-0493				FEB	2004	132	2					623	640		10.1175/1520-0493(2004)132<0623:AMRFTG>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(2004)132<0623:AMRFTG>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000188893900013

J	Wolford, RA; Bales, RC; Sorooshian, S				Wolford, RA; Bales, RC; Sorooshian, S			Development of a hydrochemical model for seasonally snow-covered alpine watersheds: Application to Emerald Lake watershed, Sierra Nevada, California	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												We have developed and tested a model to assess the hydrologic and biogeochemical responses of seasonally snow covered alpine areas to changes in inputs of water, chemicals, and energy. This alpine hydrochemical model (AHM) is capable of incorporating a detailed understanding of watershed processes in order to simulate events critical to biota such as the ionic pulse associated with spring snowmelt, which is only a few days long and may involve only a portion of the catchment. The model computes integrated water and chemical balances for multiple terrestrial, stream, and lake subunits within a watershed, each of which can have a unique and variable snow-covered area. Two years of data from the Emerald Lake watershed in the southern Sierra Nevada were used for fitting and testing by comparing observations with modeled daily output. To the extent possible, model parameters were set on the basis of independent physical or chemical measurements, leaving only a few fitted parameters. In its current application, model capabilities include (1) tracking of chemical inputs from precipitation, dry deposition, snowmelt, mineral weathering, flows external to the watershed, and user-defined sources and sinks; (2) tracking surface and subsurface water and chemical movements through vegetation canopy, snowpack, soil litter, multiple soil layers, streamflow, and lakes; (3) calculating chemical speciation, including precipitates, exchange complexes, and acid-neutralizing capacity; (4) simulating nitrogen reactions; (5) using a snowmelt optimization procedure to aid in matching observed watershed outflows; and (6) modeling riparian areas. Using one year of stream data for parameter estimation and a second for evaluation, the agreement between model and data was judged to be quite good. AHM is a flexible, precise algorithm for simulating watershed hydrochemistry and can readily be adapted to other alpine catchments using the Emerald results as a guide. Application of AHM to forested catchments should also be feasible.					sorooshian, soroosh/B-3753-2008	sorooshian, soroosh/0000-0001-7774-5113													0043-1397					APR	1996	32	4					1061	1074		10.1029/95WR03726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95WR03726													WOS:A1996UC93900026

Conspicuous patterns depict the operation of important processes that include the development of deep chlorophyll maxima, the entry of major tributary and tunnel inflows as interflows, and the development of benthic nepheloid layers. SC is demonstrated to be a valuable tracer of the interflow process in these reservoirs. Distinct longitudinal structures are documented for T in spring, SC, Chl and c(660), along the major axes of Pepacton, Rondout, and one of the two (separated) basins of Ashokan. Substantial differences are demonstrated to prevail between the two basins of Ashokan; treatment as two basins in series is recommended for modeling purposes. Three-dimensional structures in SC and c(660), apparently imparted from interflows, are documented for one of the basins of this impoundment. The needs of mechanistic model frameworks to accommodate the observed spatial patterns and processes are considered.																			0018-8158					MAY	2001	450	1-3					197	208		10.1023/A:1017549011734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017549011734													WOS:000170963600017

Factors Affecting the Age-0 Resident Fish Community Along Shorelines of the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												The Hanford Reach is one of the few remaining unimpounded sections of the Columbia River. However, because of flow management at upstream dams, there are often large fluctuations in water level. To determine how environmental conditions might affect age-0 resident fishes in the Hanford Reach, we evaluated species composition, distribution, abundance, and standard lengths of larval and juvenile fishes along shoreline habitats during July and August 1998, 1999, and 2000. Catches in beach seine hauls during all three years were highly variable. The four most abundant taxa collected were three cyprinids, peamouth (Mylocheilus caurinus), northern pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus oregonensis), and redside shiner (Richardsonius balteatus); and suckers (Catostomus spp.). Highest overall catches were in sloughs of the Hanford Reach in 1999, a year with high flows, lower water level fluctuations, and more vegetation. Mean shoreline summer water temperatures were higher in 1998 than in 1999 and 2000, and mean lengths of the four most abundant taxa in late August were also greater in 1998, due presumably to enhanced growth or an earlier spawning season. In spite of flow fluctuations, overall catches of age-0 resident fishes were greater in the riverine Hanford Reach compared to past catches in a more lentic Columbia River reservoir. High abundances of age-0 resident fishes in the Hanford Reach could be due to more spawning and rearing habitat in this structurally complex area, and may mitigate for negative effects of variable flow regimes.																			0029-344X					SUM	2009	83	3					180	188		10.3955/046.083.0302	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.083.0302													WOS:000268078100002

As there is currently no complete landslide inventory map that covers the entire Jinsha River corridor, in this study the Sentinel-1 and ALOS/PALSAR-2 datasets were employed to detect and map active landslides along the entire Jinsha River corridor. Complex geomorphological conditions, such as the humid climate, dense vegetation, and steep terrain, pose great challenges to conventional InSAR-based landslide mapping methods, which can lead to a high probability of mis-judgements and omissions of landslides. Therefore, we propose a new InSAR-based procedure that can be used to conduct large-area landslide mapping through the integration of surface deformation and geomorphological features. More than 360 SAR images covering the Jinsha River corridor were processed and more than 900 active landslides were detected and mapped over the entire Jinsha River corridor for the first time. In particular, several large-scale landslides with a length and/or width of >1 km were found. Our results show that the landslides over the Jinsha River corridor are mainly located in three high earthquake-prone areas and reservoir areas, and that the landslides are mainly distributed at elevations of 1500-2000 m a.s.l. and have slope angles of 15-25 degrees. Moreover, the deformation time series results indicate that the heavy rainfall in the summer and the rapid decline of water level in the Jinsha River might be two significant factors that accelerate the deformation of active landslides and reactivate unstable slopes. The findings in this research can be directly applied to landslide hazard mitigation and prevention along the entire Jinsha River corridor. In particular, the proposed procedure can be used for the efficient and systematic mapping of active landslides in other regions with similarly complex geomorphological conditions.

Major changes in fish thermal habitat diversity in Canada's Arctic lakes due to climate change	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT												Climate warming is a major disruptor of fish community structure globally. We use large-scale geospatial analyses of 447,077 Canadian Arctic lakes to predict how climate change would impact lake thermal habitat diversity across the Arctic landscape. Increases in maximum surface temperature (+2.4-6.7 degrees C), ice-free period (+14-38 days), and thermal stratification presence (+4.2-18.9%) occur under all climate scenarios. Lakes, currently fishless due to deep winter ice, open up; many thermally uniform lakes become thermally diverse. Resilient coldwater habitat supply is predicted; however, thermally diverse lakes shift from providing almost exclusively coldwater habitat to providing substantial coolwater habitat and previously absent warmwater habitat. Across terrestrial ecozones, most lakes exhibit major shifts in thermal habitat. The prevalence of thermally diverse lakes more than doubles, providing refuge for coldwater taxa. Ecozone-specific differences in the distribution of thermally diverse and thermally uniform lakes require different management strategies for adapting fish resource use to climate change. Climate change will have varying impacts on native fishes in Arctic lakes, including productivity gains in the north, productivity losses to warmwater invaders in the south, and region-wide maintenance of cold water refuges, according to projected forecasts for 447,077 Arctic lakes.

Wave climatology in the Apostle Islands, Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The wave climate of the Apostle Islands in Lake Superior for 35 year (1979-2013) was hindcast and examined using a third-generation spectral wave model. Wave measurements within the Apostle Islands and offshore NOAA buoys were used to validate the model. Statistics of the significant wave height, peak wave period, and mean wave direction were computed to reveal the spatial variability of wave properties within the archipelago for average and extreme events. Extreme value analysis was performed to estimate the significant wave height at the 1, 10, and 100 year return periods. Significant wave heights in the interior areas of the islands vary spatially but are approximately half those immediately offshore of the islands. Due to reduced winter ice cover and a clockwise shift in wind direction over the hindcast period, long-term trend analysis indicates an increasing trend of significant wave heights statistics by as much as 2% per year, which is approximately an order of magnitude greater than similar analysis performed in the global ocean for areas unaffected by ice. Two scientific questions related to wave climate are addressed. First, the wave climate change due to the relative role of changing wind fields or ice covers over the past 35 years was revealed. Second, potential bluff erosion affected by the change of wave climate and the trend of lower water levels in the Apostle Islands, Lake Superior was examined.

J	Schlaffer, S; Chini, M; Dorigo, W; Plank, S				Schlaffer, Stefan; Chini, Marco; Dorigo, Wouter; Plank, Simon			Monitoring surface water dynamics in the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota using dual-polarised Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) represents a large system of wetlands with great importance for biodiversity, water storage and flood management. Knowledge of seasonal and inter-annual surface water dynamics in the PPR is important for understanding the functionality of these wetland ecosystems and the changing degree of hydrologic connectivity between them. Optical sensors that are widely used for retrieving such information are often limited by their temporal resolution and cloud cover, especially in the case of flood events. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can potentially overcome such limitations. However, water extent retrieval from SAR data is often impacted by environmental factors, such as wind on water surfaces. Hence, robust retrieval methods are required to reliably monitor water extent over longer time periods . The aim of this study was to develop a robust approach for classifying open water extent in the PPR and to analyse the obtained time series covering the entire available Sentinel-1 observation period from 2015 to 2020 in the hydrometeorological context. Open water in prairie potholes was classified by fusing dual-polarised Sentinel-1 data and high-resolution topographical information using a Bayesian framework. The approach was tested for a study area in North Dakota. The resulting surface water maps were validated using high-resolution airborne optical imagery. For the observation period, the total water area, the number of waterbodies and the median area per waterbody were computed. The validation of the retrieved water maps yielded producer's accuracies between 84 % and 95 % for calm days and between 74 % and 88 % for windy days. User's accuracies were above 98 % in all cases, indicating a very low occurrence of false positives due to the constraints introduced by topographical information. The observed dynamics of total water area displayed both intra-annual and inter-annual patterns. In addition to differences in seasonality between small (<1 ha) and large (>1 ha) waterbodies due to the effect of evaporation during summer, these size classes also responded differently to an extremely wet period from 2019 to 2020 in terms of the increase in the number of waterbodies and the total area covered. The results demonstrate the potential of Sentinel-1 data for high-resolution monitoring of prairie wetlands. Limitations of this method are related to wind inhibiting the correct water extent retrieval and to the rather long acquisition interval of 12 d over the PPR, which is a result of the observation strategy of Sentinel-1.

Crappie hybrids made up 22% of the population and were found in the 1988 to 1991 year-classes. First-generation (F-1) hybrids were seven times more abundant than second-generation and higher (F-x) hybrids. The F-1 hybrids expressed superior growth and survival, and they recruited into the fishery (254-mm total length minimum size limit) earlier than the parental species. Distributions of alleles among F-x hybrids indicated that F-1 hybrids were more likely to successfully mate and produce offspring with black crappies than with white crappies. Factors that may have contributed to hybridization between crappie species include failure to identify specific mates due to low water clarity during spring when these fish spawn, short and overlapping spawning times, and fluctuating water levels. In addition, Weiss Lake is located at the interface of sympatric and allopatric crappie populations and this has been associated with interspecific hybridization among other fish species.																			0002-8487					JAN	1994	123	1					71	79		10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0071:NHBBCA>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0071:NHBBCA>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1994MR75200009

After filtration the particulate fraction was incubated in unlabeled lake water for measuring respiratory production of DI14C [dissolved inorganic 14C]. Portions of the same particulate fraction were sterilized and incubated in unlabeled sample concentrate for measuring microbial breakdown of detritus. The seston respiration amounted to 19-30% loss of the particulate fraction over 15-45 h. Microbial breakdown of detritus amounted to 28-40% loss of the particulate fraction over 24-168 h. In both cases PO14C (particulate organic 14C) was transformed to mainly DI14C. Microbial assimilation-dissimilation of photosynthetically derived DOC could not be measured reliably.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	1982	95	1					181	190		10.1007/BF00044482	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00044482													WOS:A1982PP41900012

Surface channel samples and diamond drillhole results have identified total rare earth oxide ("TREO") concentrations exceeding >>20 wt% TREO within multiple zones at/near surface. In 2018, Appia Energy Corp. carried out a summer exploration program, comprising: 1) overburden stripping of seven REE surface-outcropping zones, 2) collection of 844 channel samples, 3) collection of 6 heavy mineral beach sand samples, and 4) completion of the first-ever property diamond drill program. The latter included 15 diamond drill holes within the Charles, Ivan, and Wilson zones. The Alces Lake REE mineralization is hosted within polyphase anatexites containing massive braided biotite schist and quartzofeldspathic pegmatite augen. The REEs are completely hosted within monazite (REE-Th-rich phosphate), as red, coarse grains (i.e., as individual grains, banded, or clustered masses exceeding 75% monazite within the Ivan and Dylan zones). Alces Lake monazites yielded a crystallization age of 1927.1 +/- 1.2 Ma, which places mineralization within the Taltson-Thelon Orogeny. Petrographic studies reveal that the monazite crystals are euhedral to rounded, suggesting undisturbed crystalline growth for the former and physically active "magmatic entrainment from source" for the latter.

Lynn; Zimmerman, Susan			Cultural implications of late Holocene climate change in the Cuenca Oriental, Mexico	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												There is currently no consensus on the importance of climate change in Mesoamerican prehistory. Some invoke drought as a causal factor in major cultural transitions, including the abandonment of many sites at 900 CE, while others conclude that cultural factors were more important. This lack of agreement reflects the fact that the history of climate change in many regions of Mesoamerica is poorly understood. We present paleolimnological evidence suggesting that climate change was important in the abandonment of Cantona between 900 CE and 1050 CE. At its peak, Cantona was one of the largest cities in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, with a population of 90,000 inhabitants. The site is located in the Cuenca Oriental, a semiarid basin east of Mexico City. We developed a subcentennial reconstruction of regional climate from a nearby maar lake, Aljojuca. The modern climatology of the region suggests that sediments record changes in summer monsoonal precipitation. Elemental geochemistry (X-ray fluorescence) and delta O-18 from authigenic calcite indicate a centennial-scale arid interval between 500 CE and 1150 CE, overlaid on a long-term drying trend. Comparison of this record to Cantona's chronology suggests that both the city's peak population and its abandonment occurred during this arid period. The human response to climate change most likely resulted from the interplay of environmental and political factors. During earlier periods of Cantona's history, increasing aridity and political unrest may have actually increased the city's importance. However, by 1050 CE, this extended arid period, possibly combined with regional political change, contributed to the city's abandonment.					; Zimmerman, Susan/A-3351-2013; Wogau, Kurt/IXX-0548-2023	Bhattacharya, Tripti/0000-0002-5528-3760; Bohnel, Harald/0000-0002-3833-225X; Zimmerman, Susan/0000-0002-1320-1878													0027-8424					FEB 10	2015	112	6					1693	1698		10.1073/pnas.1405653112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1405653112								25624470					WOS:000349204200031

Seasonal Variations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Muscle Tissue of Silurus triostegus Heckel, 1843 from Derbendikhan Reservoir	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC COMPOUNDS												Derbendikhan reservoir is located on the southeast of Sulaimani city 35 degrees 6' 35" N, 45 degrees 41' 20" E, it is the second largest reservoir in the Iraqi Kurdistan region at an altitude of 485 m above sea level. It was formed when the dam was constructed in1956-1961.The area is about 114.30 km(2) with the maximum depth of 75.0 m. Silurus triostegus is one of twenty genera of fish that are endemic to Derbendikhan reservoir, Seasonal sampling for 64 samples of fish for 11 sites was carried out from November 2018 to August 2019, Fishing was performed with gill nets of 18, 25, 33, 40, and 55 mm inner mesh sizes. The goal of this research is to determine the level of PAHs in, fish muscle of Silurus triostegus, because fish as an important food source for man and it's the primary indicator of the toxification of streams and lakes, on the other hand, PAH will cause many health problems including cancer, in addition, this information may be used as a database for any environmental modeling in the future, this study was carried out. Results indicate increasing in PAH in the spring season, although, as a result of fishing activities using old boats and ships at a high rate, in addition to the changes of water temperature in different season. PAH in the muscle of fish (0.098-1.271 mu g/g) were above the WHO maximum permissible limit of 0.001 mu g/g. The main conclusion is that the fish muscle contains high amounts of PAHs through bioaccumulation and biomagnifications. Finally, the lake needs immediate attention to reduce improper waste disposal and improve on measures against indiscriminate dumping of petroleum products and domestic waste in the water, which are the major sources of petrogenic and pyrogenic PAHs should be minimized, and the treatment of the sewage before its discharge into the reservoir.

Calibrating δ18O in Dromaius novaehollandiae (emu) eggshell calcite as a paleo-aridity proxy for the Quaternary of Australia	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The large, flightless Australian bird, Dromaius novaehollandiae (emu), breeds at about the same time of year throughout its range, and fragments of its eggshells are commonly preserved in geological and archaeological archives spanning the Late Quaternary. The delta O-18 of eggshell calcite is set primarily by the delta O-18 of body water in the days prior to egg calcification. Changes in the delta O-18 of body water are dominantly determined by the delta O-18 of ingested water. We provide a calibration dataset of 334 delta O-18 analyses on late Holocene Dromaius eggshell from 21 sites across a wide range of environmental conditions and climate states. In regions where interannual rainfall variability is high, the average of 20 samples from different years is required to derive a delta O-18 estimate within +/- 1 parts per thousand of the millennial mean; fewer than 10 different-year samples is sufficient for less variable rainfall regions. Many climate variables in Australia are highly correlated with delta O-18 in eggshell, but the strongest correlation is with the average site-specific point-potential evapotranspiration (PPET) for February plus March, two summer months prior to egg calcification, which explains 93% of the variance in the mean delta O-18 of our calibration dataset. Eggshell delta O-18 can be used as a PPET (paleo-aridity) proxy in older samples providing four assumptions are closely approximated: (1) no difference in season of breeding over time, (2) breeding in most years, (3) little change in delta O-18 of precipitation over time, and (4) the bird's source water is exposed to evaporative processes. The reconstructed PPET derived from 150 delta O-18 measurements in an 80 ka time-series of eggshell from south-central Australia where these assumptions are satisfied is consistent with independent estimates of environmental water balance derived from changes in lake level and dustiness. The tight correlation between eggshell delta O-18 and PPET indicates that the average delta O-18 in time-series of Dromaius eggshell is a robust proxy to reconstruct changes in moisture balance through the Late Quaternary of Australia.

Microcystin in Lake Erie fish: Risk to human health and relationship to cyanobacterial blooms	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Microcystin (MC) is a cyanobacteria-produced liver toxin that has been found in fish from Lake Erie, sometimes in excess of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for safe consumption. Even so, few studies have quantified MCs in Lake Erie fishes, and these studies have drawn different conclusions concerning the risk that fish consumption poses to public health. To address this gap in knowledge, we used Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (EUSA) to evaluate the MC concentration in muscle tissue from three commonly harvested fish in Lake Erie: walleye (Sander vitreus, n = 29); yellow perch (Perca flavescens, n = 52); and white perch (Morone americana, n = 55), collected during summer 2013. Satellite remote sensing was used to compare MC concentrations in fish tissue to bloom conditions in Lake Erie at the time of harvest. We found a significant difference among mean MC concentrations in walleye (71 ng MC/g wet weight), white perch (37 ng MC/g), and yellow perch (8.1 ng MC/g). In addition, MC levels in white perch appeared to depend on local bloom conditions. While few of the fish collected contained MC in excess of WHO guidelines, our results indicate that more toxic blooms could increase MC in fish to levels that pose a greater risk to public health.

The passing of the CWA and the adoption of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in the early 1970s contributed to the quick improvement of water quality in the two ensuing decades, but the 1990s saw the return of water quality problems, indicated by the return of algal blooms to Western Lake Erie. Algal blooms typically occur when excess nutrients are produced by mixture of agricultural and urban practices, and they may threaten ecological stability and public health for millions dependent on the lake for drinking water, tourism, and fisheries. In this case study, we explore the relationship between human behavior and water quality impairments that lead to harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB), and in particular, the Maumee River Watershed. The case is designed to be taught in eight class meetings to an audience of upper-level undergraduate students, and has been tested in the classroom in consecutive semesters starting in the fall of 2015.					formica, francesca/AAA-6043-2020	Singh, Ajay/0000-0002-5576-8178													2473-9510						2017	1	1								10.1525/cse.2017.sc.450561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/cse.2017.sc.450561													WOS:000467904500003

However, the foremost threat is the presence of non-native fish. One of the objectives of the LIFE + LIMNOPIRINEUS project (2014-2019) was the recovery of protected amphibian communities (including the endemic Calotriton asper) in eight naturally fishless Pyrenean high mountain lakes, by controlling or eradicating non-native trout or minnows. During the summer months of 2015 to 2019, we removed 95-100% of the fish present in these lakes, and monitored changes in their amphibian populations, as well as surveyed 56 nearby control lakes with or without fish. We found rapid natural recovery of amphibian communities as fish removal work progressed. The fish-removal lakes achieved typical richness figures for the area one year after fish removal began, and typical species abundances after three years (with the only exception of Rana temporaria). We documented a total of 16 colonisation events, all by amphibian species from the same valley. The two earliest colonisation events were observed in the year in which fish removal began, with eight events the following year. The lack of colonisation from nearby valleys in the study period highlights the crucial role of nearby residual populations not affected by human impacts. We show that whole amphibian communities from high mountain lakes recover rapidly after eliminating or reducing non-native fish, proving that this is a powerful tool to improve the conservation status of endangered amphibians.					; O'Brien, David/AGA-5052-2022; Ventura, Marc/A-5660-2008; Lucati, Federica/AAD-8575-2020; Miró, Alexandre/K-5758-2017; Buchaca, Teresa/L-1679-2014	Sabas, Ibor/0000-0002-4173-5332; O'Brien, David/0000-0001-7901-295X; Lucati, Federica/0000-0001-9925-7137; Osorio, Victor/0000-0002-2138-5056; Buchaca, Teresa/0000-0001-7933-8992													0006-3207	1873-2917				NOV	2020	251								108783	10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108783													WOS:000587339000018

EVALUATION OF SERA LAKE NATURE PARK (TRAEZON/TURKEY) IN RESPECT TO ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC STRUCTURE	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Nature parks are among the four protected areas declared with National Parks Law No 2873 in Turkey. As of 01.03.2016, 203 nature parks have been announced. These areas have outstanding natural phytogeographical structure, flora and wildlife, natural landscape areas and recreational potential. In particular, they allow for different utilisations in terms of outdoor recreation. Sera lake located in Akcaabat (Trabzon) has been become prominent thanks to its peculiar resource values. It was formed as a result of large rocks falling off the slope and blocking the valley floor in 1950. In 2010, it was declared as a Nature Park by Nature Conservation and National Parks General Directorate due to its natural vegetation, fish fauna and presence of water. Being within easy reach of people due to its location where water and waterfront recreation, trekking and passive recreational activities can be performed, It is unfortunately confronted with irreversible environmental risks caused by utilisation. In this paper, socio-demographic structure of the users has been measured and the link between utilization tendency and environmental problems has been set forth through observation and interviews. Based on the obtained results, suggestions have been made in terms of ecological and socio-economic structure for recovery the area.

Chinese scholars have analyzed the causes of water and soil loss, and pointed out that both natural factors and human activities are the root causes for these losses. The associated natural factors include the landscape, soil, groundwater and precipitation. Since the climate in this area is subtropical monsoon, heavy rainfall occurs during summer and as a result, the greatest water and soil loss mainly takes place in this season. Hubei province is divided into three regions according to the degree of water and soil loss. The first region is that of mountainous areas given its landscape, this area is characterized with serious water and soil loss. The second region features agriculture and industrial activities, the original land surface area in this region is greatly disturbed by the human activities that it is subjected to. The third division is that of the land around lakes, this division is based on the unique type of soil found in such areas. Human activities including the land use in the agriculture and urban expansion, is found especially in mountainous areas. Research has established that water and soil loss has since 1980, increased more and more with the passing of time. It can be concluded that this trend will continue if the human activities do not support the soil and water systems. Finally, the results from the prevention and treatment discussed showed that the control measures for the prevention of water and soil loss must be definitively enforced at the earliest convenience.																					978-0-7695-3682-8				2009							11	+		10.1109/ESIAT.2009.353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ESIAT.2009.353													WOS:000274009800003

A sediment core from Mezhgornoe Lake situated at the present-day alpine tree-line was studied for pollen, plant macrofossils, Cladocera and diatoms. A peat section from Vangyr Mire in the nearby mixed mountain taiga zone was analysed for pollen. The results suggest that the study area experienced a climatic optimum in the early Holocene and that summer temperatures were at least 2degreesC warmer than today. Tree birch immigrated to the Mezhgornoe Lake area at the onset of the Holocene. Mixed spruce forests followed at ca. 9500-9000 (14)C yr BP. Climate was moist and the water level of Mezhgornoe Lake rose rapidly. The hypsithermal phase lasted until ca. 5500-4500 (14)C yr BP, after which the mixed forest withdrew from the Mezhgornoe catchment as a result of the climate cooling. The gradual altitudinal downward shift of vegetation zones resulted in the present situation, with larch forming the tree-line.

Lake sediments are major sinks for organic matter and for all geochemical elements. In the present study, total organic matter (TOC), nitrogen (TN), and geochemical analysis of major oxides was carried out on Yercaud Lake surface sediments, located at a higher elevation in South India to infer sediment distribution pattern and source for organic matter. Particle size distribution of lake surface sediments suggests that the sediments are predominantly silty sand and sandy silt, poorly to very poorly sorted and symmetrically skewed. TOC/TN ratio (6.54-12.65) reveal that the organic matter (OM) is derived from the in situ lake sources particularly from the vascular plants and lake biota accumulation. Weathering indices that fall from [chemical index of alteration (CIA)] 88.59-93.08 values and A-CN-K plot reflects intense chemical weathering of the bedrock exposures in the source area, which was accelerated under warmer and humid climate conditions in the sub-tropical regions. Al2O3/TiO2 ratio (6.94-26.62) indicates weathering particularly of the exposed charnockite rocks around the lake basin.

B	Harrod, C		Craig, JF		Harrod, Chris			Climate change and freshwater fisheries	FRESHWATER FISHERIES ECOLOGY												Climate change is among the most serious environmental challenge facing humanity and the ecosystems that provide the goods and services on which it relies. Climate change has had a major historical influence on global biodiversity and will continue to impact the structure and function of natural ecosystems, including the provision of natural services such as fisheries. Freshwater fishery professionals (e.g. fishery managers, fish biologists, fishery scientists and fishers) need to be informed regarding the likely impacts of climate change. Written for such an audience, this chapter reviews the drivers of climatic change and the means by which its impacts are predicted. It details observed and future predicted effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems across Arctic, temperate and tropical climatic zones and highlights those areas where data are currently limiting our understanding of how and if climate change is affecting freshwater fisheries. Observed and predicted consequences of climatic change on the ecology of freshwater fishes are examined at different levels of biological organization, including individual, population, community and ecosystem levels, and future scenarios are discussed. The chapter examines the likely impacts of such changes on the exploitation and management of freshwater fishes across recreational, artisanal and commercial fishery sectors, including observations on the vulnerability of fishers themselves to climate change.

The lymphocyte and granulocytic composition of peripheral blood leukograms is characterized by the prevalence of agranulocytes (73.3-77.1%); the portion of granulocytes was 23.0-26.7%. The value of the integral leukocyte index (0.29-0.36) corresponds to the conditional norm of the physiological state of the organism and its adaptive potential. In spring, the integral leukocyte index is higher in males (0.36) than in females (0.29). The qualitative composition of the amino acid spectrum of blood plasma in amphibians is represented by 25 amino acids and their derivates. Lake frogs are characterized by a high content of metabolic groups in the peripheral blood: essential and glycogenic amino acids involved in the processes of detoxification, immunomodulation, and the formation of adaptive responses in amphibians.

A total of 108 samples of healthy adult honeybees from four differently located apiaries and samples of honeybees showing different clinical signs of viral infections from 89 apiaries were collected throughout Slovenia. The aim of this study was to discover correlations between viral loads and clinical signs in adult honeybees and confirm previously set threshold viral load levels between healthy and clinically affected honeybees. Within this study, two new RT-qPCR assays for quantification of LSV3 and SBV were developed. Statistically significant differences in viral loads of positive samples were identified between healthy and clinically affected honeybees for ABPV, CBPV, DWV, and SBV, while for BQCV and LSV3, no statistical differences were observed between both groups. Despite high detected LSV3 prevalence and viral loads around 6.00 log(10) viral copies/bee, this lineage probably has a limited impact on the health status of honeybee colonies. The determined viral loads between 3.94 log(10) and 13.17 log(10) in positive samples for six viruses, collected over 10 consecutive months, including winter, present additional information of high viral load variations in healthy honeybee colonies.					; Knific, Tanja/KAM-1310-2024; Simenc, Laura/MBG-1304-2025	Knific, Tanja/0000-0001-7200-6776; Toplak, Ivan/0000-0002-7900-3305; Simenc Kramar, Laura/0000-0002-4806-0745														1999-4915				JUL	2021	13	7							1340	10.3390/v13071340	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13071340								34372546					WOS:000677099400001
J	Trauth, MH; Deino, AL; Bergner, AGN; Strecker, MR				Trauth, MH; Deino, AL; Bergner, AGN; Strecker, MR			East African climate change and orbital forcing during the last 175 kyr BP	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Variations in the temporal and spatial distribution of solar radiation caused by orbital changes provide a partial explanation for the observed long-term fluctuations in African lake levels. The understanding of such relationships is essential for designing climate-prediction models for the tropics. Our assessment of the nature and timing of East African climate change is based on lake-level fluctuations of Lake Naivasha in the Central Kenya Rift (0degrees55'S 36degrees20'E), inferred from sediment characteristics, diatoms, authigenic mineral assemblages and 17 single-crystal 40Ar/ Ar-31 age determinations. Assuming that these fluctuations reflect climate changes, the Lake Naivasha record demonstrates that periods of increased humidity in East Africa mainly followed maximum equatorial solar radiation in March or September. Interestingly, the most dramatic change in the Naivasha Basin occurred as early as 146 kyr BP and the highest lake level was recorded at about 139-133 kyr BP. This is consistent with other well-dated low-latitude climate records, but does not correspond to peaks in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation as the trigger for the ice-age cycles. The Naivasha record therefore provides evidence for low-latitude forcing of the ice-age climate cycles. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The timely and accurate detection of algal blooms is critical for their control, management and forecasting. Optical satellite imagery with short revisit times has been widely used to monitor algal blooms in marine and large inland waters. However, such images typically are of coarse resolution, limiting their utility to map algal blooms in small inland waters. We developed a new method to map the spatial extent of algal blooms using sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and Landsat operational land imager (OLI) images with higher spatial resolution but lower temporal resolution based on the concept of local indicator of spatial association. The mapping results was applied to measure the duration and frequency of algal blooms in Lake Taihu from 2017 to 2020. Our results show that the developed methodology is able to extract the spatial distribution of moderate algal blooms using near-infrared and red-edge bands (bands 6, 7, 8, and 8a of sentinel-2 MSI images or band 5 of Landsat OLI images) by comparison with MODIS FAI data (R2 = 0.888 for sentinel-2 MSI and R2 = 0.85 for Landsat OLI, P < 0.05). However, the temporal resolution of combined Landsat OLI and sentinel-2 MSI images (i.e., up to 2-3 days) is insufficient to monitor algal blooms during the summer time in Lake Taihu due to cloud effects and rapid algal change. Our research has benefits for the management of small inland waters with complex water conditions.					; Xu, Dandan/H-7261-2019; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013; Pu, Yihan/ODL-2592-2025	Luan, Zhaoqing/0000-0002-7648-3657; YIHAN, PU/0000-0002-3922-3784; Xu, Dandan/0000-0002-0033-2262													1939-1404	2151-1535					2021	14						8497	8511		10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3105746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3105746													WOS:000693758000007
J	Davis, K; Anderson, MA; Yates, MV				Davis, K; Anderson, MA; Yates, MV			Distribution of indicator bacteria in Canyon Lake, California	WATER RESEARCH												The spatial and temporal distributions of indicator bacteria in a small, multiple-use source drinking water reservoir in Southern California, USA were quantified over the period August 2001-July 2002. High levels of total and fecal coliform bacteria were present in Canyon Lake (annual geometric mean concentrations +/- SEM of 3.93 +/- 0.02 and 3.02 +/- 0.03 log cfu/100 mL, respectively), while comparatively low levels of enterococci and E. coli were found (1.16 +/- 0.02 log cfu/100 mL and 0.30 +/- 0.03 log MPN/100 mL, respectively). As a result, these different indicator bacteria yielded quite divergent indices of water quality, with 72.1 % of all surface samples (n = 294) exceeding the USEPA single-sample limit of 400 cfu/ 100 mL fecal coliform bacteria, while none (0%) of the samples exceeded the single-sample limit for E. coli (n = 194). Regression analyses found a positive correlation between total and fecal coliform bacteria (R = 0.50, significant at p < 0.001) and between enterococci and E. coli (R = 0.51, significant at p < 0.001), but no correlation or inverse correlations were found between coliform concentrations and enterococci and E. coli levels. External sources responsible for the high total and fecal coliform bacteria were not identified, although laboratory studies demonstrated growth of the coliform bacteria in lake water samples. Enterococci and E. coli were not observed to grow, however. Bacteria concentrations varied relatively little laterally across the lake, although strong vertical gradients in fecal coliform and enterococcus bacteria concentrations were present during summer stratification, with concentrations about 10 x higher above the thermocline when compared with surface concentrations. In contrast, total bacteria, total virus and total coliform bacteria levels were unchanged with depth. Seasonal trends in bacteria concentrations were also present. This study shows that the choice of indicator bacteria and sampling depth can both strongly affect the apparent microbial water quality of a lake or reservoir. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The initial spacing was 1.5 .times. 1.5 m (5 .times. 5 ft). Total biomass and mean annual biomass production (MAB) were negatively related to location latitude. The overall range of MAB was 2.6-5.8 t.cntdot.ha/yr (.apprx. 1.2-2.6 tons/acre per year). The highest MAB was 58% higher than the maximum reported in the literature. Stems accounted for 64-75% and branches with needles for the rest of the aboveground biomass. Stem percentages decreased at the northernmost location. Stems of all harvested trees had a significantly higher water content (127-141% on a dry weight basis) than their branches with needles (100-115%). Water content was the lowest in late winter (March).

Assessing element-specific patterns of bioaccumulation across New England lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Little is known about differences among trace elements in patterns of bioaccumulation in freshwater food webs. Our goal was to identify patterns in bioaccumulation of different elements that are large and consistent enough to discern despite variation across lakes. We measured methylmercury (MeHg) and trace element (As, Cd, Hg, Pb, and Zn) concentrations in food web components of seven New England lakes on 3-5 dates per lake, and contrasted patterns of bioaccumulation across lakes, metals and seasons. In each lake, trace element concentrations were compared across trophic levels, including three size fractions of zooplankton, planktivorous fish, and piscivorous fish. The trophic position of each food web component was estimated from N isotope analysis. Trace element concentrations varied widely among taxa, lakes and sampling dates. Yet, we identified four consistent patterns of bioaccumulation that were consistent across lakes: (1) MeHg concentration increased (i.e., was biomagnified) and Pb concentration decreased (i.e., was biodiminished) with increased trophic position. (2) Zinc concentration (as with MeHg) was higher in fish than in zooplankton, but overall variation in Zn concentration (unlike MeHg) was low. (3) Arsenic and Cd concentrations (as with Pb) were lower in fish than in zooplankton, but (unlike Pb) were not significantly correlated with trophic position within zooplankton or fish groups. (4) Average summer concentrations of As, Pb, Hg, and MeHg in zooplankton significantly predicted their concentrations in either planktivorous or piscivorous fish. Our secondary goal was to review sampling approaches in forty-five published studies to determine the extent to which current sampling programs facilitate cross-lake and cross-study comparisons of bioaccumulation. We found that studies include different components of the food web and sample too infrequently to enable strong cross-lake and cross-study comparisons. We discuss sampling strategies that would improve our capacity to identify consistent patterns of bioaccumulation and drivers of elevated trace element concentrations under naturally high levels of variability.

J	Atasoy, M				Atasoy, Mustafa			Monitoring land use changes in tourism centers with GIS: Uzungol case study	SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ESSAYS												In Turkey, highlands have been used as venues for livestock and summer recreation for many years. Today, however, they are subject to alternative tourism and recreation activities, which dramatically change the nature in these regions. Because of natural beauties, "Touristic Centers" for eco-tourism have started rapidly in these places for the last three decades. Uzungol, which belongs to Caykara district of the Trabzon province, is one of the first of these tourism centers. In this study, temporal and spatial land use changes of the Uzungol tourism center that has a national and international importance were analyzed using aerial photographs and GIS. For this purpose, aerial photographs of 1973 - 2002, and base map of 2008 were examined to determine the dimensions of the construction in the region. The results of the analysis have shown that, the region has undergone a heavy construction in the last 35 years. A very significant increase in the number of buildings (91%), which is especially concentrated in a particular watershed protection area around the lake, has been identified. Results indicate that, Uzungol is under an unplanned development period, which is away from the scope of eco-tourism wonderland sustainability and/or intervention with the general plan of construction work.																			1992-2248					APR 18	2010	5	8					790	798																WOS:000277845100011
J	PADMAN, L				PADMAN, L			NEAR-SURFACE MIXING IN A FRESH-WATER LAKE	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Mixing rates in the upper 10 m of a freshwater lake during the spring heating season are examined by means of fine-structure temperature profiles. Dissipation rate, eddy diffusivity, and vertical heat flux are estimated from 'Thorpe reordering' of measured temperature profiles, a technique that allows these parameters to be obtained from the energy-containing scales of the turbulence rather than from the much smaller scales at which kinetic energy dissipation and scalar diffusion actually occur. The estimated vertical heat fluxes agree reasonably well with the seasonal variability of the lake's total heat content and with the observed short-term variability in mixed-layer temperature. These results suggest that satisfactory estimates of turbulent vertical diffusivities in the surface mixing layer can be obtained from Thorpe reordering. This technique can be applied to data that are considerably simpler and cheaper to obtain than are the measurements of microscale shear required for the more usual 'dissipation' method. Concurrent measurements of vertically averaged shear from a nearby surface mooring are used to study the use of Richardson numbers as a parameter in diffusion models. It is shown that considerable mixing can occur even when the Richardson number based on vertical and temporal averages of shear and density gradient is much larger than the assumed critical value of O(1). Therefore, in regions where the shear and strain variances evaluated over a fixed vertical scale cannot be related either observationally or by means of modelled spectra to the unresolved high wave-number variances, the use of diffusivity parametrizations based on measured, averaged Richardson numbers cannot be justified.

J	Euclide, P; Marsden, JE				Euclide, Peter; Marsden, J. Ellen			Role of drainage and barriers in the genetic structuring of a tessellated darter population	CONSERVATION GENETICS												While population genetic structuring is easily identified, the causes of the structure can be difficult to determine. Habitat fragmentation in aquatic systems has often been identified as a major source of increased population structure and decreased genetic diversity in fish, including benthic resident species such as darters. However, these findings are often not replicated across natural and manmade barriers and come from endangered or threatened populations where the genetic structure is likely already compromised due to small population size. To evaluate the factors involved in structuring a healthy darter population, we genotyped 506 tessellated darters from 18 sites in three different river drainages and one large lake. Sites were all in the same watershed but separated from one another by one or more of three different types of barriers: dams, natural fall lines and causeways. We found that while diversity and allele frequency varied largely by drainage, within drainage variation was minimal even across multiple barriers. No single barrier type appeared to be more formidable than any other. Our results indicate that healthy populations of darters may naturally be structured by drainage, but likely disperse across barriers enough to retain drainage-wide homogeneity.

Lagged atmospheric circulation response in the Black Sea region to Greenland Interstadial 10	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Northern Hemispheric high-latitude climate variations during the last glacial are expected to propagate globally in a complex way. Investigating the evolution of these variations requires a precise synchronization of the considered environmental archives. Align-ing the globally common production rate variations of the cosmogenic radionuclide Be-10 in different archives provides a tool for such synchronizations. Here, we present a Be-10 record at <40-y resolution along with subdecadal proxy records from one Black Sea sediment core around Greenland Interstadial 10 (GI-10) similar to 41 ka BP and the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion. We synchronized our Be-10 record to that from Greenland ice cores based on its globally common production rate variations. The synchronized environmental proxy records reveal a bipartite climate response in the Black Sea region at the onset of GI-10. First, in phase with Greenland warming, reduced sedimentary coastal ice rafted detritus contents indicate less severe winters. Second, and with a lag of 190 (+/- 44) y, an increase in the detrital K/Ti ratio and authigenic Ca precipitation point to enhanced regional precipitation and warmer lake surface temperatures. We explain the lagged climatic response by a shift in the dominant mode of atmospheric circulation, likely connected with a time-transgressive adjustment of the regional thermal ocean interior to interstadial conditions.					; Arz, Helge/A-6659-2013; Christl, Marcus/J-4769-2016	Muscheler, Raimund/0000-0003-2772-3631; Dellwig, Olaf/0000-0002-0028-8812; Arz, Helge Wolfgang/0000-0002-1997-1718; Christl, Marcus/0000-0002-3131-6652; Wegwerth, Antje/0000-0002-5104-9408													0027-8424	1091-6490				NOV 17	2020	117	46					28649	28654		10.1073/pnas.2005520117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2005520117								33139546					WOS:000595339600022

Eric			Adult Blow Fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) Community Structure Across Urban-Rural Landscapes in Michigan, United States	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Necrophagous insects play an important role in the decomposition of vertebrate carrion. The documented colonization, development, and succession of blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and other arthropods on decomposing carcasses make their communities relevant for use in decomposition ecology and forensic investigations. This relevance relies on the local pool of species available to colonize a carcass, but such community level survey data are not always available. The objective of this research was to conduct a baseline survey of adult Calliphoridae communities from urban-rural land use types in the Great Lakes region. To test how adult blow fly distribution varies with changing landscape in Mid-Michigan, sampling with baited jars and hanging traps was implemented over the summer months of June, July, and August 2017. To determine how blow fly communities differed in urban to rural land cover, seven cities were selected with site locations ranging from high intensity developed areas to cultivated crop fields. Over 97,000 individual flies were captured represented by 11 Calliphoridae species. The adult Calliphoridae communities were primarily structured by land use type and month of collection, with these two factors interacting, suggesting that the effect of location varied by time of year. The two most abundant species, Phormia regina (Meigen) and Lucilia sericata (Meigen), cumulatively comprised 88.5% adult flies from Mid-Michigan. These findings provide a baseline database of Great Lakes Calliphoridae, with potential use in forensic research and casework.

J	Solanki, VR; Hussain, MM; Raja, SS				Solanki, Venkata Ramanaiah; Hussain, Mohd Masood; Raja, S. Sabita			Water quality assessment of Lake Pandu Bodhan, Andhra Pradesh State, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A systematic investigation of variations in some nutrient levels at Pandu Lake from August 2002 to July 2004 was carried out. The untreated domestic wastes from various parts of Bodhan town are directly discharged into Pandu Lake leading to gross pollution. Therefore present investigation was under taken to assess the magnitude of sewage pollution by monitoring key water quality parameters dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, alkalinity, calcium, nitrates and phosphates etc. Monthly water samples were collected from three different sampling stations. Low Dissolved oxygen and high biological oxygen demand, elevated Nitrates and Phosphates levels were found, which gives the information about conversion of this water body from oligotrophic to eutrophic nature. Phosphates were found to be in the range of 0.9 to 4.0 mg/L. Nitrates were found to be higher in Pandu Lake and their number is more in summer, and suitable explanation was given. Nitrates were found to be in range between 24.8mg/L to 71.2mg/L. Data on various chemical characteristics vary at different sites in different months in Pandu Lake. Some of the characteristics like Dissolved Oxygen, Biological Oxygen Demand, Nitrates, Phosphates and nutrient loading are contributing to eutrophication process in this lake and the lake seems to be eutrophic through out the year.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2010	163	1-4					411	419		10.1007/s10661-009-0844-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0844-6								19319483					WOS:000275428200034

This necessitates appropriate monitoring, followed by informed management, control and mitigation actions. In this study, we explored the long-term dynamics of macrophyte stands in a fluvial-wetland system and the influence of mechanical removal alongside environmental drivers. The Landsat imagery archive was used to analyze the areal coverage and canopy density of both autochthonous and allochthonous macrophytes in the Mantua lakes system (Northern Italy). Satellite derived data showed a substantial increase in the extent of the alien Nelumbo nucifera, and Ludwigia hexapetala, and the native Trapa natans over a timescale of decades, possibly caused by the temporary absence of macrophyte removal and altered hydrology. According to spectral proxies, N. nucifera recorded consistently the highest density in the system. T. natans density was found to respond to the maximum summer temperature and Eastern Atlantic climatic index, reflecting the role of regional climatic controls. This approach may be transferred to inland waters from regional to global scale exploiting satellite archives to obtain a time series on changing species dynamics essential for the conservation and management of aquatic habitats.					; Free, Gary/IUO-8431-2023; Villa, Paolo/M-6015-2014; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015	Pinardi, Monica/0000-0001-5289-8842; Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB 4	2021	41	1							16	10.1007/s13157-021-01395-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01395-9													WOS:000617318900002

Growth and reproduction of a stream population of Cobitis turcica in central Anatolia ( Turkey)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Cobitis turcica is endemic to Anatolia, and being of a bottom-dwelling nature is highly influenced by habitat degradation. Due to drought and water pollution, in 2006 this species was included in the IUCN Red List as endangered. Therefore in order to develop conservation strategies, knowledge of its life history traits is important. The study presents first time data on the basic life history traits of C.turcica captured in a small stream flowing from Pnarba Springs to Kozanl Gok Lake in central Anatolia. In total, 1356 specimens were caught between March 2003 and August 2004. The overall sex ratio (M:F) was 1:0.62. Longevity in females, which reaches a maximum age of 6+, is 1year longer than for males. Females are longer and heavier than males of the same age group. Maximum observed total lengths were 103.6mm in a 5+ year-old male and 126.75mm in a 6+ year-old female. Length-weight relationships were calculated for males, females, and juveniles, with the b exponent of the relationships as 2.9068, 2.8326, and 3.6859, respectively. Spawning was fractional, beginning in April and continuing until the end of July. Mean total fecundity was 2238 at age 5+.

Sedimentology, isotopes and palynology of late Holocene cores from Lake Sibaya and the Kosi Bay system (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa)	SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												This study documents a multi-proxy palaeoecological record spanning 2000 years for the northern KwaZulu-Natal coastal plain. Data are presented from cores recovered from Lake Sibaya and the northernmost coastal flats of the Kosi lake system. Sedimentation rates are higher in the dated Sibaya core than in the Kosi core. Carbon isotopic values from all three cores suggest that C-3 plants have been the dominant biomass, with some C-4 plant input at certain depths/ times in the cores. Low nitrogen isotopic data in the cores suggest that nitrogen fixation processes occur in both systems. Due to high sample distance and often low pollen concentration, palynological data are restricted to a single core at Lake Sibaya. The pollen assemblages reflecting changes from greater forest abundances to greater savanna grassland abundances support results from a previous palynological study at the lake. The relative proportion of carbon in the samples decreases during the same time frame, potentially reflecting a decline in biomass volumes at the two ecosystems. Human impact is evidenced by the appearance of pine and probable maize pollen in the upper section of the core.

This leads to the formulation of a stocking strategy based on techniques known to be successful in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in Europe. Its aim is to increase the yield of wild-caught eel in the Republic of Ireland by a factor of four, from 250 to 1,000 metric tons per annum. A co-operative fishery operated in Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland has an annual yield, sustained since 1962, of 700 metric tons, providing seasonal employment for 370 fishers. The lake is stocked with glass eel at a rate of 250 elver (0.1 kg) per hectare and yields 20 kg per hectare. The fishery is strictly regulated, with a fixed daily quota per fisher. Extensive sampling of eel throughout the Republic of Ireland has indicated the existence of 500 km(2) of surface area of lake in which eel growth is equal to or greater than that observed in Lough Neagh. The development theory is that, if stocked at the same rate as Lough Neagh, the same yield could be obtained. Management and investment problems will be considerable and entail the commitment of substantial state funding over an initial period of ten years. Although such factors as currently falling prices for eel make it impossible to forecast the economic return, the fact remains that no development of the wild eel fishery is possible in the absence of a stocking program. The best advice to the authorities, therefore, is to develop such a scheme without delay. It is concluded that a similar strategic approach could be applied to eel-bearing catchments in North America.																			0892-2284		1-888569-42-5				2002	33						217	224																WOS:000185058900018
J	BRINKMANN, WAR				BRINKMANN, WAR			COMPARISON OF 2 INDICATORS OF CLIMATIC-CHANGE - TREE GROWTH AND LAKE-SUPERIOR WATER-SUPPLIES	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Many proxy indicators of past climate integrate the effects of temperature and precipitation, and not all indicators integrate these effects in the same way. This poses a problem in the reconstruction of past climate.

Tree growth is positively correlated with precipitation.sbd.although the response is reduced when conditions are very wet.sbd. and negatively correlated with temperature. In contrast, the water supplies to the lake are positively correlated with both precipitation and temperature; the correlation with temperature is, however, not very strong. Multiple regression models developed to assess the relative magnitudes of the similarities and differences show that the similarity in response to precipitation accounts for about 30% of the variance in water supplies, the nonlinear response of trees.sbd.represented by a log transformation.sbd.accounts for an additional 15%, and the difference in response to temperature is equivalent to about 30% of the variance in water supplies.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				JUL	1989	32	1					51	59		10.1016/0033-5894(89)90031-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(89)90031-8													WOS:A1989AD67100005
J	Shokr, M; Dabboor, M				Shokr, Mohammed; Dabboor, Mohammed			Observations of SAR polarimetric parameters of lake and fast sea ice during the early growth phase	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This study examines links between two sets of parameters obtained from Radarsat-2 Quad-pol data and geophysical information of lake ice and landfast sea ice in the Resolute Bay area, Nunavut, Canada. The first set includes the three orthogonal backscatter coefficients (sigma(0)(hh), sigma(0)(vv), sigma(0)(vh)) in addition to the total backscatter power (SPAN). The second set includes polarimetric decomposition parameters obtained using Cloude-Pottier and Yamaguchi decomposition methods. Data were collected during the early freezing period from 20 September until 28 December 2017. Meteorological and ice climatological data from the weather station of Resolute Bay were used to facilitate this task. Ice thickness and salinity were obtained from established empirical models. Results show that single-bounce and multiple-bounce scattering mechanisms are active in lake ice during the entire freezing period while multiple-bounce scattering is active in sea ice only during the initial freezing. Backscatter parameters can be used to determine the thickness of lake ice up to any depth, while both backscatter and the tested decomposition parameters are related to the thickness of young sea ice (<30 cm thick). Physical explanations are offered in each case. Spatial maps of ice thickness are produced. Polarimetric decomposition parameters demonstrate erratic behavior throughout the development of lake ice. High entropy (>0.6) is found to be associated with comparable single- and multiple-bounce scattering mechanisms, hence can be used to identify new ice. Orthogonal backscatter coefficients and polarimetric decomposition parameters provide different information, yet their combination offers clues to better identify ice conditions and investigate questions about scattering mechanisms.

This area is the largest basalt landform of extinct volcanoes in Asia. The water source of the Stone Ponds is derived mainly from underground springs, and has great transparency. Water pH values range from 6.4 to 8.4 and temperature of most ponds is lower than 10 degrees C. A total of 20 stomatocyst morphotypes were observed with scanning electron microscopy, of which 13 of these morphotypes are new to science. This is the first report of chrysophycean stomatocysts from such a unique habitat. The relationships between the stomatocyst assemblages and physical, chemical and biological parameters such as diatoms and other filamentous algae are discussed. Most of the stomatocysts in the Stone Ponds prefer the cool and neutral to weakly acidic water. Stomatocyst 19, Pang, W. & Q. Wang, Stomatocyst 22, Pang, W. & Q.

J	Gurung, TB; Nakanishi, M; Urabe, J				Gurung, TB; Nakanishi, M; Urabe, J			Seasonal and vertical difference in negative and positive effects of grazers on heterotrophic bacteria in Lake Biwa	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Grazers affect prey abundance negatively through grazing and positively through releasing nutrients and substrates. In the present study, the relative importance of these positive and negative effects of grazers on bacterial abundance was examined seasonally at 2.5 m and 30 m depths in Lake Biwa. We used a method by Elser and Goldman to estimate in situ growth rate, grazing rate, and the fraction of growth rate that was stimulated by grazers smaller than 100 mum. At 2.5 m, the bacterial grazing rate showed clear seasonal changes with higher values in summer. At 30 m, bacterial grazing was significant but consistently low throughout the year. The fraction of the growth rate stimulated by grazers was changed with season and depth. At 2.5 m, bacteria compensated 30-40% of grazing loss by using deficient nutrients released by the grazers from May to October. During that period, bacterial growth rate was severely limited by phosphorus, and it is most likely that phosphorus release by grazers was stimulating bacteria. At 30 m, however, the bacterial growth rate was not stimulated by the grazers' in the majority of the cases. Bacterial growth rate was limited by low temperature at this depth, so nutrient return from grazers does not have a beneficial. effect on bacterial growth. These results indicate that the relative importance of positive and negative effects of grazers on bacterial abundance differs seasonally and vertically; and that positive effect becomes important when bacterial growth is limited by nutrients. In a given habitat, bacterial abundance changes less than one order of magnitude in spite of high growth rates. The present study suggests that grazers contribute to numerical stability of bacterial assemblages not only through grazing but also by regenerating deficient nutrients.

Short- and long-term patterns of 137Cs in fish and other aquatic organisms of small forest lakes in southern Finland since the Chernobyl accident	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												We summarize the patterns of Cs-137 activity concentrations and transfer into fish and other biota in four small forest lakes in southern Finland during a twenty-year period following the Chernobyl accident in April 1986. The results from summer 1986 showed fastest accumulation of Cs-137 into planktivorous fishes, i.e. along the shortest food chains. Since 1987, the highest annual mean values of Cs-137 have been recorded in fish occupying the highest trophic levels, for perch (Perca fluviatilis) 13,600 Bq/kg (ww) and for pike (Esox lucius) 20,700 Bq/kg (ww). At the same time, activity concentrations of Cs-137 in crustacean zooplankton and Asellus aquaticus have ranged between 1000 and 19,500 Bq/kg (dw). In 2006, 5-28% of the 1987 Cs-137 activity concentration levels were still present in perch and pike. Since 1989 their Cs-137 activity concentrations in oligohumic seepage lakes have remained significantly higher than in polyhumic drainage lakes due to the increased transfer of Cs-137 into fish in the seepage lakes with lower electrolyte concentrations, longer water retention times and lower sedimentation rate.

J	Cross, TK; Jacobson, PC				Cross, Timothy K.; Jacobson, Peter C.			Landscape factors influencing lake phosphorus concentrations across Minnesota	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations are known to be a significant factor influencing fish populations in Minnesota lakes. Consequently, a primary focus of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to address fish habitat in lakes across the state has been to determine relationships between TP concentrations and watershed conditions in Minnesota lakes. Because phosphorus concentrations in Minnesota lakes vary widely corresponding to differences in geomorphology, nutrient criteria were established by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for specific ecoregions. To refine these relationships in Minnesota lakes managed for fishing, we gathered mean summer epilimnetic TP concentrations on 1330 natural lakes to identify where agricultural and urban development have elevated phosphorus levels. Random forest, regression tree, and generalized additive models were used to model spatial variation in lake phosphorus concentrations across Minnesota. Key landscape variables known to influence TP concentrations in lakes, including lake depth and watershed size, were used as explanatory variables in these models, along with agricultural and urban development quantified for lake watersheds from the National Land Cover Dataset. These models explained up to 60% of the variation in TP in lakes across the state and showed a critical benchmark of anthropogenic land use disturbance at 40%, that once exceeded could significantly alter TP levels and consequently fish populations. This information should be useful for fish managers to prioritize conservation efforts and to set appropriate fish population goals.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR 1	2013	29	1					1	12		10.1080/10402381.2012.754808	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2012.754808													WOS:000316910100001
J	Zhang, DD; Shi, N; Tajie, S				Zhang, Dongdong; Shi, Ning; Tajie, Suolang			Mechanisms of the subseasonal influences of Scandinavian events on winter surface air temperature over Eastern China	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Based on the daily Japanese 55-year Reanalysis dataset from 1958 to 2020, this study reveals that positive-phase Scandinavian (SCA) teleconnection events can cause significant negative surface air temperature (SAT) anomaly over the whole eastern China from 6 to 12 days after the peak day of SCA events. Clearly, the timing of this significant impact exceeds the e-folding timescale of approximately 6 days of SCA events by approximately one week. During the first stage (from peak day to 6 days after peak day), the vertical coupling between the upper and lower tropospheric circulation anomalies over Eurasian continent facilitates the accumulation of cold air masses from the higher latitude to the north of the Tibetan Plateau, which becomes a precursory signal of persistent negative SAT anomaly affecting eastern China. During the second stage (from 7 to 12 days after peak day), the diabatic heating anomaly caused by precipitation anomaly becomes an important factor in the persistence of the negative SAT anomaly over eastern China. Firstly, the persistent negative diabatic heating anomaly near Lake Baikal before day 12 is conducive to the maintenance of anomalously enhanced Siberian High over eastern China. Secondly, corresponding to the gradually southward movement of the positive precipitation anomaly over East Asia, significant negative diabatic heating anomaly gradually substitutes the positive diabatic heating anomaly over East Asia, which is also favorable for the maintenance of the local anticyclonic anomaly. Eventually, the sustained anticyclonic anomaly can induce the persistent negative SAT anomaly over eastern China.

Identification of surfactants and its correlation with physicochemical parameters at the confluence region of Vembanad Lake in India	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The present study describes the monitoring of some of the major classes of surfactants in water. The separation, identification, and the quantitative estimation of the compounds were achieved using LC-Q-ToF-MS. The analyses revealed the presence of variety of surfactants including linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), alcohol ethoxysulfates (AES), and alcohol ethoxylates (AE). Further, emphasis was given to AES as they are one of the most produced and consumed surfactants in the world. And as far as India is concerned, the present study is one of the most significant attempt regarding the identification and quantification of AES. The data obtained during the analysis revealed that the average concentration of AES C12Ex varied from 0.7 to 13.6 mu g L-1 while that of C14Ex ranged between 1.3 and 10.4 mu g L-1. The risk assessment revealed that higher chain AES are capable of posing medium level risk to the aquatic compartment. In addition, the study also included the physicochemical analysis of water from the selected area. Water was found to be acidic in nature and the salinity, TDS, and EC values were found to be high during the pre-monsoon season. The order of the levels of anionic constituents was of Cl-> SO4 2-SO4 (2-)> F-> NO3 (2-) ae... PO4 (2-) while that of cations were Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ > Ca2+. Results of correlation analysis showed that statistically negative correlation exists between AES homologs and pH while slight positive correlations were found between AES and other parameters including TDS and EC. The suitability of this water for domestic and agricultural purposes has been examined on the ground of basic quality indices such as the water quality index (WQI) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). The WQI measurements also revealed that the water quality of the region falls under the "very poor" category especially during the pre-monsoon season. The study could explore the cumulative share of these canals in the quality impairment of the receiving Vembanad Lake.

To better understand water and salt variation regularity in the KRID, this study established a watershed-scale distributed water and salt transport model for the KRID based on the new Soil and Water Assessment Tool with a salinity module (SWAT-Salt). Its point source salt module and irrigation water salt module were modified in the study to obtain more accurate simulation results. Based on evaluation indices, the simulation results of streamflow, salt loading, and crop yield showed that the modified model can more accurately depict water and salt transport processes in the KRID and has good applicability. According to the simulation results, the average annual amount of water and salt entering Bosten Lake through the drainage canal accounted for 15 % and 51 %, reaching 4.29 x 108 m3 and 57.87 x 104 t respectively. The drainage and salt discharge during winter irrigation accounted for 69 % and 74 %, reaching 2.95 x 108 m3 and 42.47 x 104 t, respectively. However, the regions along Bosten Lake had high groundwater and soil salinity, facing a risk of increased salinization and necessitating land or water management to decrease salinization. In conclusion, the modified SWAT-Salt can be applied in agricultural irrigation areas with more diverse irrigation sources and is a useful tool for investigating and assessing watershed-scale salinization, as well as implementing targeted management strategies to reduce salinization.

Migration, Size, and Age Structure of Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from Two Lake Superior Tributaries	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from Lake Superior and its tributaries exhibit a variety of life histories and different growth characteristics; however, life history-specific effects on population dynamics are not well understood. The goal of this study was to characterize the movement patterns of brook trout in two streams with access to Lake Superior and compare age and growth metrics between fish that moved into Lake Superior (coasters) and resident brook trout that remained within the streams (residents). There were no significant differences in length, condition factor, or relative weight between coasters and residents from a given stream. Less than 5% of PIT tagged fish were detected emigrating from the study streams, although there was a peak in migration during the fall. The length distribution of fish differed among years for both streams. The data demonstrate that migratory brook trout are likely present, though rare, in the study streams and multiple life histories are present in sympatry. The lack of differences in growth metrics among the different life history groups has implications for the management and restoration of migratory brook trout populations and demonstrates that identification of migratory brook trout within Lake Superior tributaries may not be straightforward.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JUL	2014	172	1					119	130		10.1674/0003-0031-172.1.119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-172.1.119													WOS:000338948300009

However, studies of climate warming effects on lentic waters usually do not sufficiently account for a change in heat flux from the catchment through altered inflow temperature and discharge under climate change. This is particularly relevant for reservoirs, which are highly impacted by catchment hydrology and may be affected by upstream reservoirs or pre-dams. This study explicitly quantified how the catchment and pre-dams modify the thermal response of Rappbode Reservoir, Germany's largest drinking water reservoir system, to climate change. We established a catchment-lake modeling chain in the main reservoir and its two pre-dams utilizing the lake model GOTM, the catchment model mHM, and the stream temperature model Air2stream, forced by an ensemble of climate projections under RCP2.6 and 8.5 warming scenarios. Results exhibited a warming of 0.27/0.15 degrees C decade-1 for the surface/bottom temperatures of the main reservoir, with approximately 8%/24% of this warming attributed to the catchment warming, respectively. The catchment warming amplified the deep water warming more than at the surface, contrary to the atmospheric warming effect, and advanced stratification by about 1 week, while having a minor impact on stratification intensity. On the other hand, pre-dams reduced the inflow temperature into the main reservoir in spring, and consequently lowered the hypolimnetic temperature and postponed stratification onset. This shielded the main reservoir from climate warming, although overall the contribution of pre-dams was minimal. Altogether, our study highlights the importance of catchment alterations and seasonality when projecting reservoir warming, and provides insights into catchment-reservoir coupling under climate change.

Each month, we characterized the structure, richness, and abundance of AOA populations in the epi- and hypolimnion using DGGE and qPCR of the archaea-specific amoA gene. Clear vertical patterns were observed in both lakes, with greater values for AOA richness and amoA gene abundance in the hypolimnetic layers. AOA community composition and structure was much more stable throughout the year in Lake Bourget than in Lake Annecy. In the upper layers, AOA communities displayed seasonal succession patterns and had greater abundance in winter. The temporal structure showed more pronounced seasonal patterns in Lake Annecy than in Lake Bourget. In the deeper layers of both lakes, the relative abundance of AOA showed no clear temporal pattern. Temporal changes in amoA gene composition were correlated with changes in the archaeal 16S rRNA gene in surface waters. Changes in the structure of both genes were not significantly correlated in the hypolimnion, suggesting that the temporal changes in the structure of archaeal communities in the deeper waters might be globally driven by the dynamics of heterotrophic archaea and not archaeal ammonia oxidizers. None of the many environmental variables we measured explained significant amounts of variation in AOA community structure and richness; thus, other factors and processes may exert selective pressures on the structure of these communities. Nevertheless, archaeal amoA gene abundance varied with water temperature (negative correlation) and with nitrate concentration (positive correlation). Our study is the first to show that archaeal amoA gene abundance is correlated positively with silica and negatively with total nanoflagellate abundance. This suggests that AOA could play a significant role in silica dissolution and regeneration, and points to the possible influence of predation on AOA abundance.					; Pollet, Thomas/AAZ-2141-2021; Jacquet, Stéphan/AAJ-7846-2021	JACQUET, Stephan/0000-0001-6017-3892; Pollet, Thomas/0000-0002-3427-7695; 													0948-3055	1616-1564					2018	81	2					95	108		10.3354/ame01861	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01861													WOS:000431074800001

Both species had highest root length densities close to the surface and have large tap roots that probably reach ground water at 3.4-5.0 m on the study site. The species differed greatly in leaf water relations and leaf chemistry. Sarcobatus vermiculatus had a seasonal minimum predawn xylem pressure potential (psi(pd)) of -2.7 MPa and a midday potential (psi(md)) of -4.1 MPa. These were significantly lower than for Chrysothamnus nauseosus, which had a minimum psi(pd) of -1.0 MPa and psi(md) of -2.2 MPa. Sarcobatus had leaf Na of up to 9.1 % and K up to 2.7 % of dry mass, and these were significantly higher than for Chrysothamnus which had seasonal maxima of 0.4 % leaf Na and 2.4 % leaf K. The molar ratios of leaf K/Na, Ca/Na, and Mg/Na were substantially lower for Sarcobatus than for Chrysothamnus. Xylem ionic contents indicated that both species excluded some Na at the root, but that Chrysothamnus was excluding much more than Sarcobatus. The higher Na content of Sarcobatus leaves was associated with greater leaf succulence, lower calculated osmotic potential, and lower xylem pressure potentials. Despite large differences in water relations and leaf chemistry, these species maintained similar diurnal patterns and rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to water vapor diffusion. Sarcobatus psi(pd) may not reflect soil moisture availability due to root osmotic and hydraulic properties.

Deciphering the Past Climate and Monsoon Variability from Lake Sediment Archives of India: A Review	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE												With a view to get a broader picture of paleoclimate/paleomonsoon variability we have selected 30 lakes with reliable chronologies from the climatically sensitive regions of India. An integrated review of different climate proxies i.e. grain size, C/N ratio, pollen, delta C-13 and delta O-18 and mineral magnetism on a radiocarbon dated sediment cores is carried out for present study. Here we present a climate-proxy record of monsoon variability over the past similar to 0,000 yr from monsoon and non-monsoon dominated regions. Our results based on multiproxy sediment records of lakes reveal that India experienced different climate and monsoon variability throughout geological past. Paleorecords give an insight of two climatically significant periods in this study area. A high monsoon activity has been noticed during the time resolution of 13 ka to 8 ka while a short dry period has prevailed during 5 ka-4 ka that is concurrent to the offset of Harappa civilization. Importantly, majority of paleoclimate records demonstrate that a Younger Dryas (12.9 ka-11.5 ka) records are not well preserved in lacustrine archives.

J	Howell, ET				Howell, E. Todd			Cladophora (green algae) and dreissenid mussels over a nutrient loading gradient on the north shore of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Benthic algae, much of it the green alga Cladophora, blanket the nearshore lakebed of the north shore of Lake Ontario. Nearshore field studies in Toronto, Ajax, Oshawa and Cobourg in 2012 and 2013, and Toronto in 2015 examined the distribution of Cladophora over a nutrient gradient on the north shore of the lake. Concentrations of total phosphorus, dissolved phosphorus and total inorganic nitrogen in the water column decreased from west to east over the gradient corresponding with decreasing watershed development and size. However, high surface cover and nuisance levels of Cladophora biomass were found across the gradient, including the least developed study area where total phosphorus concentrations were similar to those in the open lake. The abundance of Dreissena, high in all areas, was measured concurrently with Cladophora biomass and correlated positively at depths of 6 to 10 m. External loading of phosphorus provides a basis for abatement of Cladophora; however, the influences of enrichment along the shoreline, internal loading at the lakebed and lake trophic status in sustaining growth remain obscure. Nuisance levels of Cladophora are not isolated to locations experiencing elevated external loading and should be viewed in the context of interacting area-specific and lake-wide nutrient supplies.

K.			Unusual nonterrestrial L-proteinogenic amino acid excesses in the Tagish Lake meteorite	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												The distribution and isotopic and enantiomeric compositions of amino acids found in three distinct fragments of the Tagish Lake C2-type carbonaceous chondrite were investigated via liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Large l-enantiomeric excesses (lee similar to 4359%) of the a-hydrogen aspartic and glutamic amino acids were measured in Tagish Lake, whereas alanine, another a-hydrogen protein amino acid, was found to be nearly racemic (d l) using both techniques. Carbon isotope measurements of d- and l-aspartic acid and d- and l-alanine in Tagish Lake fall well outside of the terrestrial range and indicate that the measured aspartic acid enantioenrichment is indigenous to the meteorite. Alternate explanations for the l-excesses of aspartic acid such as interference from other compounds present in the sample, analytical biases, or terrestrial amino acid contamination were investigated and rejected. These results can be explained by differences in the solidsolution phase behavior of aspartic acid, which can form conglomerate enantiopure solids during crystallization, and alanine, which can only form racemic crystals. Amplification of a small initial l-enantiomer excess during aqueous alteration on the meteorite parent body could have led to the large l-enrichments observed for aspartic acid and other conglomerate amino acids in Tagish Lake. The detection of nonterrestrial l-proteinogenic amino acid excesses in the Tagish Lake meteorite provides support for the hypothesis that significant enantiomeric enrichments for some amino acids could form by abiotic processes prior to the emergence of life.

Average total phosphorus concentrations in pond soil were not significantly different between treatments but available phosphorus (P > 0.05) in pond soil, total phosphorus (P > 0.001), and filterable orthophosphate (P > 0.0001) concentrations in pond water, chlorophyll a (P > 0.0001), and net fish production (P > 0.01) were significantly higher in fertilized ponds than in controls. Overall, fish yield did not significantly differ among treatments, suggesting that a very high dose of P2O5 may not be necessary for high yields. Reducing the dose of P2O5 could reduce cost without reducing fish production.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Between January 1993 and January 1995, the number of Great Cormorants ( Phalacrocorax carbo) using Lake Naivasha, Kenya ( 00degrees 45' S, 36degrees 20' E) for foraging and resting increased 56%, while the number of sympatric Long- tailed Cormorants ( Phalacrocorax africanus) decreased 64%. In 1995 and 1996, we documented habitat changes and conducted monthly population and resource- use surveys of the two species in an attempt to discover the most likely reasons for these changes. The increase in Great Cormorants was probably the result of immigration from nearby Lake Nakuru due to extreme water level reductions there. Lake Naivasha also experienced falling water levels and transparency during this period, but these changes were not as severe and are not considered likely reasons for the decline in Long- tailed Cormorant numbers. Despite some probable dietary overlap, the two species were well separated in terms of foraging locations, foraging methods, resting habitats and breeding timing. The decline in Long- tailed Cormorant numbers may be connected with increased disturbance by fishermen along the lake littoral, this species' primary feeding location.																			0018-8158					NOV	2002	488	1-3					163	170		10.1023/A:1023338816801	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023338816801													WOS:000182300700016

Is an Epic Pluvial Masking the Water Insecurity of the Greater New York City Region?	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Six water emergencies have occurred since 1981 for the New York City (NYC) region despite the following: 1) its perhumid climate, 2) substantial conservation of water since 1979, and 3) meteorological data showing little severe or extreme drought since 1970. This study reconstructs 472 years of moisture availability for the NYC watershed to place these emergencies in long-term hydroclimatic context. Using nested reconstruction techniques, 32 tree-ring chronologies comprised of 12 species account for up to 66.2% of the average May-August Palmer drought severity index. Verification statistics indicate good statistical skill from 1531 to 2003. The use of multiple tree species, including rarely used species that can sometimes occur on mesic sites like Liriodendron tulipifera, Betula lenta, and Carya spp., seems to aid reconstruction skill. Importantly, the reconstruction captures pluvial events in the instrumental record nearly as well as drought events and is significantly correlated to precipitation over much of the northeastern United States. While the mid-1960s drought is a severe drought in the context of the new reconstruction, the region experienced repeated droughts of similar intensity, but greater duration during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The full record reveals a trend toward more pluvial conditions since ca. 1800 that is accentuated by an unprecedented 43-yr pluvial event that continues through 2011. In the context of the current pluvial, decreasing water usage, but increasing extra-urban pressures, it appears that the water supply system for the greater NYC region could be severely stressed if the current water boom shifts toward hydroclimatic regimes like the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.					; Lall, Upmanu/B-7992-2009; Seager, Richard/GLW-9200-2022; Cook, Edward/ABV-5232-2022; Devineni, Naresh/T-4361-2019	Bell, Andrew/0000-0002-1164-312X; Lall, Upmanu/0000-0003-0529-8128; Devineni, Naresh/0000-0003-0311-8752; Seager, Richard/0000-0003-4772-9707; 													0894-8755	1520-0442				FEB	2013	26	4					1339	1354		10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00723.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00723.1													WOS:000315466700014

Green Roof Mitigation Potential for a Proxy Future Climate Scenario in Chicago, Illinois	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (ARW) coupled with an urban canopy model is used to investigate the potential of vegetative (green) roof technology to mitigate against ongoing climate warming and continued urban sprawl for a day representing average summer conditions in late-twenty-first-century Chicago, Illinois. Effects related particularly to human health hazards resulting from excessive heat and high pollution concentrations are emphasized. Continued expansion of the urban environment over the next century is shown to lead to an expansion of the warming signal across the metropolitan region. Widespread adoption of vegetative rooftops, through increased albedo and evapotranspiration, reduces temperatures in the urban environment by as much as 3 degrees C, an effect similar to the simpler but less appealing alternative of employing painted or other reflective rooftop structures (e. g., white roofs). A significant limitation to the green roof approach for the case studied is that the increase in moisture resulting from transpiration leads to only marginal cooling when apparent temperatures are considered. An additional complication arises in that the reduced temperatures alter the lake-breeze circulation, potentially reducing circulation of pollutants into the city core, but also reducing natural cooling in the most urbanized areas during the climatologically warmest hours. Future work that evaluates these impacts over a broader range of synoptic settings, documents changes in the planetary boundary layer structure and attendant pollution, and considers the multiple-day dependence of these effects is needed.

Observations of cocooned Hydrobaenus (Diptera: Chironomidae) larvae in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Larvae of the family Chironomidae have developed a variety of ways to tolerate environmental stress, including the formation of cocoons, which allows larvae to avoid unfavorable temperature conditions, drought, or competition with other chironomids. Summer cocoon formation by younger instars of the genus Hydrobaenus Fries allows persistence through increased temperatures and/or intermittent dry periods in arid regions or temporary habitats, but this behavior was not observed in the Great Lakes until the current study. Cocoon-aestivating Hydrobaenus sp. larvae were found in benthic grab samples collected in 2010-2013 near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in northern Lake Michigan with densities up to 7329/m(2). The aestivating species was identified as Hydrobaenus johannseni (Sublette, 1967), and the associated chironomid community was typical for an oligotrophic nearshore system.

One year after stocking, Pike River walleye were more abundant than their original proportion of 46.5% of the stocked fish, but by the end of their second summer, neither population had a clear survival advantage. In the three lakes where walleye were consistently sampled, natural-origin walleye that descended from previous stockings significantly increased in percent of all sampled walleye over the study (P = 0.001). The unmarked and untagged stocked fish (N = 566) were assigned to their source population by comparing their genotypes at nine microsatellite DNA loci to the known genotypes of the parent pairs crossed in a hatchery (parentage assignment). Fish not assigned to a parent pair were considered to be the product of natural reproduction (N = 177) by previously stocked fish. Simulations indicated that natural-origin walleye were sufficiently excluded from assignment to stocked fish parent pairs so as not to bias the comparison. Parentage assignment is a powerful population discrimination tool if genotypes are known for all parent pairs from all but one putative source.					; Bacigalupi, Marc/LFT-9585-2024	Miller, Loren/0000-0002-5482-2152; 													0706-652X					FEB	2002	59	2					282	290		10.1139/F02-007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F02-007													WOS:000174334300009

Wave forces limit the establishment of submerged macrophytes in large shallow lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the effect of waves on submerged macrophytes and hypothesized that exposure to large wave forces can hamper seedling establishment. In an indoor experiment in cylindrical mesocosms we tested whether large wave forces indeed inhibited the establishment of Chara globularis and Potamogeton pusillus from the propagule bank. We mimicked the effect of wave forces by generating a circular flow that caused resuspension of the sediment. Four treatments were applied, consisting of different repetition frequencies of resuspension events. Emergence and early growth of both species were monitored over 8 weeks. The resuspension treatments significantly reduced the emergence of both species, by 91% and 45% on average for Chara sp. and P. pusillus, respectively. We analysed field observations on the two species in the lakes of the IJsselmeer area in the Netherlands to evaluate whether wave forces may also inhibit establishment of macrophytes in the field. The field data seemed to support the hypothesis as both species hardly occurred in areas where a large bottom shear stress had occurred in spring, according to simulations with the SWAN wave model. The calculated maximum bottom shear stress correlated well with the occurrence of both Chara sp. and P. pusillus in the field. Regressions showed that this effect of wave forces was additional to the effect of light availability. Our study indicates that large wave forces may inhibit the establishment of macrophytes in large lakes. Reducing large wave forces can therefore potentially promote macrophyte development in these large lakes.					; Peeters, Edwin/ABC-6307-2022	Peeters, Edwin T.H.M./0000-0003-2541-1829; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2015	60	5					1536	1549		10.1002/lno.10115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10115													WOS:000362227500005
J	Zeng, HA; Wu, JL				Zeng, Haiao; Wu, Jinglu			Tracing the Nitrate Sources of the Yili River in the Taihu Lake Watershed: A Dual Isotope Approach	WATER												As the third largest freshwater lake in China, Taihu Lake has experienced severe cyanobacterial blooms and associated water quality degradation in recent decades, threatening the human health and sustainable development of cities in the watershed. The Yili River is a main river of Taihu Lake, contributing about 30% of the total nitrogen load entering the lake. Tracing the nitrate sources of Yili River can inform the origin of eutrophication in Taihu Lake and provide hints for effective control measures. This paper explored the nitrate sources and cycling of the Yili River based on dual nitrogen (delta N-15) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotopic compositions. Water samples collected during both the wet and dry seasons from different parts of the Yili River permitted the analysis of the seasonal and spatial variations of nitrate concentrations and sources. Results indicated that the wet season has higher nitrate concentrations than the dry season despite the stronger dilution effects, suggesting a greater potential of cyanobacterial blooms in summer. The delta N-15-NO3- values were in the range of 4.0 parts per thousand-14.0 parts per thousand in the wet season and 4.8 parts per thousand-16.9 parts per thousand in dry, while the equivalent values of delta O-18 were 0.5 parts per thousand-17.8 parts per thousand and 3.5 parts per thousand-15.6 parts per thousand, respectively. The distribution of delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- indicated that sewage and manure as well as fertilizer and soil organic matter were the major nitrate sources of the Yili River. Atmospheric deposition was an important nitrate source in the upper part of Yili River but less so in the middle and lower reaches due to increasing anthropogenic contamination. Moreover, there was a positive relationship between delta O-18-NO3- and delta N-15-NO3- in the wet season, indicating a certain extent of denitrification. In contrast, the delta O-18-delta N-15 relationship in the dry season was significantly negative, suggesting that the delta N-15 and delta O-18 values were determined by a mixing of different nitrate sources.																				2073-4441				JAN	2015	7	1					188	201		10.3390/w7010188	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w7010188													WOS:000348401300012

During this interval, Mono Lake experienced four lowstands each lasting from 1000 to 2000 yr, The youngest lowstand, which occurred between 15,500 and 14,000 C-14 yr B.P., was nearly synchronous with a desiccation of Owens Lake, California. Paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) data indicate that three of four persistent lowstands occurred at the same times as Heinrich events H1, H2, and H4, (18)0 data indicate the two highest lake levels occurred similar to 18,000 and similar to 13,100 C-14 yr B.P., corresponding to passages of the mean position of the polar jet stream over the Mono Basin.

Ebullition (bubbling) is often the dominant mode of lake CH4 emission. Because extrapolating spatially limited field measurements of CH4 ebullition induces large uncertainties in regional emission estimates, there is a need for remote sensing based approaches to detect and quantify CH4 ebullition at larger spatial scales in lakes. We examined the relationship between spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) pixel values of lake ice and biogeochemical field measurements of CH4 ebullition on ten lakes on the northern Seward Peninsula. Among lakes, ebullition ranged from low to high. We found that both the area of ice-bound ebullition-bubble clusters and the bubbling rates that generated the clusters were correlated with L-band single-polarized (HH) SAR (R-2 = 0.70, p = 0.002, n = 10) and with the "roughness" component of a Pauli decomposition of L-band quad-polarized SAR (R-2 = 0.77, p = 0.001, n = 10). No relationship was found between ERS-2 C-band single-polarized (VV) SAR and ice-trapped CH4 bubbles. Results of this study indicate that analysis of L-band SAR backscatter intensity from winter lake ice could be a valuable new tool for constraining estimates of regional ebullition in lakes.

EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL LAND USE ON CHIRONOMID COMMUNITIES: COMPARISONS AMONG NATURAL WETLANDS AND FARM PONDS	WETLANDS												Constructed farm ponds represent a major wetland habitat type in southeastern Minnesota. Farm ponds are subject to a variety of disturbances associated with agricultural land use, especially sedimentation and eutrophication. Chironomid community structure often reflects environmental changes in aquatic ecosystems. However, chironomid communities in farm ponds are poorly understood and their response to short-term increases in sedimentation and eutrophication remains undetermined. We studied relationships between pond-land cover condition and chironomid community structure. Of the 40 ponds selected for the study, 10 were natural, permanent palustrine wetlands. The remaining ponds were constructed habitats (i.e., farm ponds) with 10 in each of the following categories: non-grazed grassland, grazed grassland, and row crop agriculture. Larval chironomids and water quality parameters were collected during early, mid-, and late summer 2001. Total nitrogen concentrations were significantly greater and turbidity was generally greater in grazed grassland ponds as compared to all other pond types. Chironomid communities of grazed grassland ponds were characterized by lower taxonomic richness and abundant chironomids tolerant of increased sedimentation and nutrient enrichment (i.e., Chironomus and Glyptotendipes). This study determined that agricultural land use, particularly cattle grazing, can markedly affect pond water quality, thereby influencing the chironomid community structure in farm ponds.

J	Hessen, DO; Hindar, A; Holtan, G				Hessen, DO; Hindar, A; Holtan, G			The significance of nitrogen runoff for eutrophication of freshwater and marine recipients	AMBIO												This article explores the effects of nitrogen loadings to freshwater and marine recipients in two large watersheds of southern Norway. Changes in nitrogen retention over larger areas would severely affect nitrogen concentrations in freshwaters, and subsequently increase the N load to marine recipients. Increased atmospheric deposition, changed hydrology, reduced nitrogen uptake by vegetation due to nitrogen ''saturation'' and/or root damage caused by acidification, could contribute to this leakage. Climatic fluctuations strongly affect the seasonal runoff patterns, and a more long-term climate change could mobilize the huge stores of organic N following increased mineralization. The bioavailability and seasonal patterns combined will be major determinants to responses in the recipients, as will the nutrient ratios. For the sparsely populated heathland dominated Bjerkreim watershed, the stoichiometry of nutrient elements are strongly skewed towards high N:P ratios. P concentrations are far too low to support freshwater eutrophication, and a further increase in N would only strengthen the prevailing P limitation. This would also hold for the marine recipient where excess of N relative to P or Si in riverine runoff could drive the nearshore areas towards temporal P or Si limitation. In the Auli watershed, intense agricultural activity yields high outputs of both N and P, but very scattered and unpredictable runoff peaks with variable N:P ratio. The low concentrations of mineral nutrients in the Bjerkreim river imply a diluting effect relative to seawater concentrations of N and P, while the Auli river may support eutrophication both in the freshwaters and the inner fjord recipient. Due to a pronounced seasonality in nutrient concentrations and fluxes in the coastal current, the relative contribution of riverine sources would peak during summer. Data from both watersheds with their subcatchments underline the overall importance of agricultural activity for nitrogen runoff.

Quantitative model-data comparison of mid-Holocene lake-level change in the central Rocky Mountains	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Recently-developed Holocene lake-level reconstructions from the Rocky Mountains offer a quantitative target for testing the skill of state-of-the-art climate system models in simulating hydroclimate change. Here, we use a combination of hydrologic models of catchment streamflow, lake energy balance, and lake water balance to simulate lake level at Little Windy Hill Pond (LWH) in the Medicine Bow Range of Wyoming for a period of severe drought during the mid-Holocene (MH; approximately 6000years ago). Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) output to drive our hydrologic models, we find that none of our simulations reproduce the significantly lowered lake levels at LWH during the MH. Rather, simulated hydroclimate changes for the MH are modest (<10% reductions in precipitation and streamflow and generally 10-30% increases in lake evaporation), and LWH lake-level changes are buffered by the large volume of snowmelt runoff that the lake receives. Only when winter precipitation is approximately halved in sensitivity experiments do water inputs to the lake become small enough that lake level can be significantly drawn down by year-over-year negative water balances. Possible explanations for the model-data mismatch could lie in the realism of our hydrological modeling framework or in the accuracy of the CMIP5 output, the latter having important implications for projections of future drying in western North America.					; Livneh, Ben/I-2939-2015	Morrill, Carrie/0000-0002-1635-5469; LIVNEH, BEN/0000-0001-5445-2473; Shuman, Bryan/0000-0002-8149-8925													0930-7575	1432-0894				JUL	2019	53	1-2					1077	1094		10.1007/s00382-019-04633-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04633-3													WOS:000471722400062
J	Pauli, BJ				Pauli, Benjamin J.			The Flint water crisis	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												The Flint water crisis is one of the most significant environmental contamination events in recent American history. In April 2014, the city of Flint, Michigan, while under the control of an emergency manager appointed by the governor, switched its drinking water supply from Lake Huron water treated and distributed by the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the Flint River. Failure to treat the water properly at the Flint Water Treatment Plant led to a variety of problems with water quality and public health. Low chlorine in parts of the water system fostered bacterial growth and contributed to an historic outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in 2014-2015. High levels of trihalomethanes brought the city into violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act in late 2014. Finally, systemic lead contamination-revealed through a collaborative sampling effort by local activists and engineers in the summer of 2015-resulted from corrosive water eating into lead pipes and other lead-bearing components of Flint's water infrastructure. In October 2015, after considerable public pressure, the city switched back to Lake Huron water. Efforts by federal, state, and local officials to respond to the crisis have focused on restoring water quality, repairing and replacing dangerous and damaged pipes, and addressing public health needs. At the popular level, residents and activists have continued to fight for accountability, reparations, and restoration. A variety of causal explanations for the crisis have been put forward, some focusing on water treatment, regulation, and infrastructure, others on the political context created by state takeover of the city, and others on historical factors like structural racism, deindustrialization, and depopulation.

In this study, we used a multi-proxy method, including pollen, grain size, and the ratios of Sr/Ti and Rb/Ti from XRF-scanning measurements, on a sediment core from Tunlumei Pond (TLM) to reconstruct vegetation dynamics and the records of natural disturbances, such as heavy rainfalls, earthquakes, or typhoons, in central alpine Taiwan during the past 2400 calibrated years before the present (cal yr BP, where "present" refers to 1950 AD). The trend in variation between the percentages of upper montane forests and PC1 value indicates that the cold/dry climate changed to a warm/humid climate from 1800 cal yr BP upward, corresponding to the Roman Warm Period. This local change might be corresponded to regional trend and relative to the East Asian summer monsoon fluctuation. Coarse grain particles associated with the transition of the pollen zone indicate frequent and/or strong natural disturbances at 1510 cal yr BP and the impacts of the early Little Ice Age (LIA) during 530-480 cal yr BP. The palaeoecological record of TLM provides very useful information for both decision making and policy planning in present and future subtropical forest management, as well as restoration after a catastrophic event.

A sediment core taken from Barkol Lake in the northern Xinjiang of Northwest China was analyzed at 1cm interval for grain-size distribution. Abrupt climate shifts revealed by the grain-size proxy occurred at ca 1.4, 3.0, 4.3, 5.6, 8.0 cal kyr B.P., which were well correlated to both the abrupt shifts recorded in the North Atlantic Ocean (NAO) and the Holocene sea surface temperature (SST) cooling events in the Arabian Ocean. The correlation indicated that the climatic changes in the extreme and Northwest China were associated with the NAO, probably via the North Atlantic Oscillation-affected westerly winds. The strength and position of westerly winds probably modulated the Siberian-Mongolian high-pressure system (winter monsoon), and played an important role in climate change of Northwest China. Moreover, an evident drought interval during the middle Holocene was also revealed by grain-size proxy.

Production of poly-β-hydroxyalkanoates from soy molasses oligosaccharides by new, rapidly growing Bacillus species	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aims: To isolate and characterize bacteria from nature capable of producing poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoates in high yields from soy molasses oligosaccharides. Methods and Results: Several strains of bacteria were obtained from enrichment cultures employing raffinose as major carbon source and inoculated with soybean field soil, lake sediment, or lake water. Many of the isolates were Bacillus species and produced polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) to high yield. The raffinose-degrading isolates produced endospores, were highly saccharolytic, and both respired and fermented a variety of mono-, di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides. Strain CL1 produced 90% of cell dry mass as PHA from various sugars, including raffinose, and did so without requiring a nutrient limitation. Conclusions: Strain CL1 could be the catalyst for an industrial fermentation converting soy molasses and other waste carbohydrates to PHAs. The properties of this organism that make it ideally suited for such a fermentation include (i) its ability to use a wide variety of plant-associated carbohydrates as PHA feedstocks; (ii) its rapid growth; (iii) its ability to grow under anoxic conditions; and (iv) its ability to produce spores. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first report of bacteria capable of making biodegradable plastics to high yield from soy molasses oligosaccharides.

Colored organic matter increases CO2 in meso-eutrophic lake water through altered light climate and acidity	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Many surface waters across the boreal region are browning due to increased concentrations of colored allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Browning may stimulate heterotrophic metabolism, may have a shading effect constraining primary production, and may acidify the water leading to decreased pH with a subsequent shift in the carbonate system. All these effects are expected to result in increased lake water carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. We tested here these expectations by assessing the effects of both altered allochthonous DOC input and light conditions through shading on lake water CO2 concentrations. We used two mesocosm experiments with water from the meso-eutrophic Lake Erken, Sweden, to determine the relative importance of bacterial activities, primary production, and shifts in the carbonate system on CO2 concentrations. We found that DOC addition and shading resulted in a significant increase in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in all mesocosms. Surprisingly, there was no relationship between bacterial activities and pCO(2). Instead the experimental reduction of light by DOC and/or shading decreased the photosynthesis to respiration ratio leading to increased pCO(2). Another driving force behind the observed pCO(2) increase was a significant decrease in pH, caused by a decline in photosynthesis and the input of acidic DOC. Considering that colored allochthonous DOC may increase in a warmer and wetter climate, our results could also apply for whole lake ecosystems and pCO(2) may increase in many lakes through a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis and decreased pH.					; Scharnweber, Kristin/AER-8695-2022; chaguaceda, fernando/AAO-2991-2020; Tranvik, Lars/H-2222-2011; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019	Garrison, Julie/0000-0001-7279-4098; Chaguaceda, Fernando/0000-0002-0827-2110; Attermeyer, Katrin/0000-0002-6503-9497; Nydahl, Anna/0000-0002-0078-2810; Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281; Wallin, Marcus/0000-0002-3082-8728													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2019	64	2					744	756		10.1002/lno.11072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11072													WOS:000461865500022

Eleven freshwater stations were placed along the three meltwater streams near Artigas Base (S0-S10), and two in Uruguay Lake (L1 and L2). Finally, three marine stations in Maxwell Bay were placed one near the Artigas Base (AB) and two far from it in North Cove (NC1, NC2). Some of the terrestrial stations (T2, T10, T11 and T13) presented the highest concentration of metals and Igeo values, which was associated to anthropic activities. Highest metal levels were related to fuel storage and handling, but also, with sewage release and the presence of old leaded paint residues. These polluted sites were limited to a restricted area of Artigas Base, not affecting surrounding environments. Concentrations of the analysed metals in unpolluted sites had the same order of magnitude recorded in other unpolluted areas of the Fildes Peninsula and other Antarctic regions.

Jake			Divergent life histories of invasive round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) in Lake Michigan and its tributaries	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) have invaded benthic habitats of the Laurentian Great Lakes and connected tributary streams. Although connected, these two systems generally differ in temperature (Great Lakes are typically colder), food availability (Dreissenid mussels are more prevalent in Great Lakes), and system size and openness. Here, we compare round goby life histories from inshore Lake Michigan and adjacent tributary systemsan uncommon case study of life-history differences between connected systems. Tributary round gobies grew much faster (average length-at-age of 122.3 vs. 65.7mm for Age 2+ round gobies), appeared to have shorter life spans (maximum observed age of 2 vs. 5) and had lower age-at-50% maturity (1.6 vs. 2.4years; females only) compared to gobies from Lake Michigan. In addition, tributary gobies had greater fecundity at Ages 1-2 than lake gobies, but had fewer eggs for a given body size prior to the first spawning event of the summer. We were not able to determine the cause of the observed life-history differences. Nonetheless, the observed differences in growth, maturation and longevity were consistent with known effects of water temperature, as well as predictions of life-history theory for animals at invasion fronts exposed to novel environmental conditions. The high degree of phenotypic plasticity in connected populations of this invasive species has implications for our understanding of invasive species impacts in different habitats.

Fire and post-fire erosion caused large and statistically significant (P <= 0.05) losses of C, N, P, S, Ca, and Mg from the forest floor. There were no statistically significant effects on mineral soils aside from a decrease in total N in the surface (All) horizon, an increase in pH in the All horizon, and increases in water-extractable SO42- in the All and A12 horizons. Burning caused consistent but nonsignificant increases in exchangeable Ca 21 in most horizons, but no consistent or statistically significant effects on exchangeable K+ or Mg2+, or on Bray-, bicarbonate-, or water-extractable P concentrations. Before the burn, there were no significant differences in leaching, but during the first winter after the fire, soil solution concentrations of NH4+, NO3-, ortho-P, and (especially) SO42- were elevated in the burned area, and resin lysimeters showed significant increases in the leaching of NH4+ and mineral N. The leaching losses of mineral N were much smaller than the losses from the forest floor and All horizons, however. We conclude that the major short-term effects of wildfire were on leaching whereas the major long-term effect was the loss of N from the forest floor and soil during the fire.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2006	35	2					479	489		10.2134/jeq2005.0144	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2005.0144								16455848					WOS:000235942300009

Visualization and analysis of demand markets are significantly enhanced by the capabilities of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and help to support management objectives. This study implements traditional desktop GIS as well as a free, web-delivered decision-support tool for tourism planning and marketing to assess 7.5 million overnight accommodation reservations made for federal recreational facilities between 1999 and 2007. Visitor origin frequency and median travel distance for overnight accommodations are summarized by visitor zip code and by facility. National results indicate: (1) facilities in the west, the Great Lakes and the southern Appalachians regions draw overnight visitors from the greatest median distances; (2) residents in the Northeast have the lowest per-capita utilization; (3) residents within the south-central Midwest and central-west Southern States have the highest percapita utilization and tend strongly toward local overnight reservations. Three selected national park regions are used to illustrate destinations characterized by highly localized utilization (Hot Springs National Park, AR), both local and regional utilization (Yosemite National Park, CA) and regionally to nationally dispersed utilization with few local residents reserving overnight accommodations (Canyonlands National Park, UT). Market profiling derived from local, regional and national customer origin markets can help any tourism destination, including national parks and their gateway communities, make smarter management and marketing decisions.

Here, we surveyed the diversity of the Brachionus plicatilis Muller, 1786 species complex from inland saline waters across China. We compared morphometrics with DNA taxonomy (using two genetic markers: the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1)). Our phylogenies based on the sequences of ITS-1 recognized two distinct clades (i.e. two species: B. plicatilis sensu stricto (s.s.) and B. asplanchnoidis) in China. We detected two mitochondrial clades within B. plicatilis s.s and one within B. asplanchnoidis across China, consistent with the three morphogroups present. One of these three clades was novel and restricted to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, where it exhibited evidence of recent expansion across the region. The new mitochondrial clade fell within B. plicatilis s.s. but was sister to all other mitochondrial sequences of that species, suggesting a period of isolation from other populations. Moreover, significant morphological differences were identified: B. plicatilis s.s. from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau had a larger lorica length and width than did members of this species from lowland China. Our data demonstrate the successful adaptation of this species complex to the harsh environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

The retrieved ca. 1.65 m long well dated sediments from the lake Ennamangalam span the past ca. 4800 cal BP. The n-alkane indices such as P-aq, carbon preference index (CPI), terrestrial vs. aquatic ratio (TAR) have been used to infer the changes in source of organic matter and to reconstruct past environmental changes. The end-member delta C-13 value based calculation on abundances of C-3 and C-4 vegetation using delta C-13(OM) value provided an erroneous estimation of past vegetation due to lake eutrophication or organic matter alteration by microbial degradation. On the other hand, long-chain n-alkane was not affected by bacterial activity and can be used to infer terrestrial vs. aquatic productivity through the modified n-alkane indices. Symbiotic contribution from aquatic productivity was inferred as the P'(aq) value always exceeds 0.2. Higher TAR' value observed after ca. 3000 cal BP indicate increased precipitation in the region.

This water body makes up the main resource of drinking water supply for the district of Ploermel. For several years, it has been the site of algal proliferation during the growing season (summer months), particularly involving the cyanobacteria. Several solutions have been employed, such as destratification of the water column by means of aeration equipment as well as specific treatment with an algicide, but without stopping the process. In collaboration with government departments and the University of Rennes 1, local communities have now agreed on an arrangement for monitoring the water body in an attempt to determine the causes and periodicity of the phenomenon and especially to implement solutions to limit algal blooms. Farther upstream, the river Yvel has been managed under a catchment area contract for more than 10 years, and many environmental measures have been taken to limit inputs to the reservoir. The water body itself has been the subject of detailed study in preparation for eventual cleaning-out operations. Because of this, we now have a thorough knowledge of its morphology as well as the mud deposits that are present. To address the problem of algal proliferation, it is necessary to quantify the sources of pollution on the catchment as well as undertake regular measurements of various physicochemical parameters on the reservoir Although phosphate is clearly a dominating factor, it is not easy to analyse the relations between causes and effects of the phenomenon.																			0182-0745		978-2-903581-54-1				2009	33	1-2					275	284																WOS:000266370800016

Testing a jokulhlaup model against flow speeds inferred from measurements	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Observational data allowing the validation of jokulhlaup models are sparse. We were able to inject dye tracer directly into the drainage channel of a glacial lake during the onset of its outburst. This made it possible to test an established jokulhlaup model, not only against discharge measurements, but for the first time also against water flow speeds inferred from measurements. We drive the jokulhlaup model, based on the Spring-Hutter equations, with measured subglacial water pressure, lake water temperature and lake level. The model is fitted to the measured lake discharge and inferred flow speeds using the initial channel size, the channel roughness and sinuosity. Our calculations show that an ingenuous application of the model, fitting it to the lake discharge only, overestimates water flow speeds. For the second day of the outburst, this can be remedied by fitting the model to the inferred flow speeds as well, requiring that either the heat transfer or the sinuosity of the channel be increased. However, the low inferred flow speeds on the first day of the outburst cannot be fitted with any parameter combination, showing that, initially, the water does not flow through an R channel. Hence, the early stages of this jokulhlaup cannot be simulated by an R-channel model.

J	Regenauer-Lieb, K				Regenauer-Lieb, K			Dilatant plasticity applied 10 Alpine collision: ductile void growth in the intraplate area beneath the Eifel volcanic field	JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS												The Eifel is located in the middle of the European plate far away from any active plate boundary, yet it appears to be a maximum of intraplate tectonic activity. A map of intraplate seismic energy flow shows that the Eifel is linked to the Alpine collisional belt via a narrow seismoactive shear zone. Two parallel Quaternary volcanic zones (the East Eifel Volcanic Zone EEVZ and the West Eifel Volcanic Zone WEVZ) line up with the seismogenic shear zone. Xenoliths ejected from these volcanic lineaments indicate upper mantle shearing by dynamic recrystallization textures and metasomatized chemistry. Important CO2-dominated mantle degassing observed in mineral springs, lakes or dry degassing suggests a presently ongoing flushing of brines. Here, the hypothesis of intraplate ductile void growth as a consequence of the Alpine collision is tested by finite element models. It is shown that in the tensile domain of Alpine collision, a small amount of dilatancy along shear bands in the upper mantle and lower crust can open pathways for fluids, thus transfer of melts and gases through the lithosphere and thereby controls mantle metasomatism along highly oriented mantle shear zones.

Yangcheng Lake serves as a storage pool for flood control and water diversion; as well as a potable water source for Suzhou City. In recent years, summer cyanobacterial blooms began appearing in Yangcheng Lake, which urgently re-quires a health evaluation.Study Focus: Currently, there is a three-tier analysis system consisting of national, provincial, and local assessments in China. However, each tier has a unique set of standards, meaning that: 1) evaluations between tiers are not comparable and 2) conducting a unified survey and analyzing the results is exceedingly difficult. How to develop ways to standardize existing river and lake health evaluation systems in China become a global concern.New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Although the evaluation index system and assessment techniques are consistent throughout all three methods, they differ in their handling of index weights and assignment criteria. The health evaluation scores of Yangcheng Lake are in the Healthy to Sub-healthy range, with gradually decreasing health from east to west. This work synthesized the existing Chinese national-provincial-local health evaluation system and suggested standardizing the index system, index weights, and evaluation process to provide theoretical support for water resources management and water ecology restoration in freshwater water bodies in China.

Assessment of the anthropogenic fluoride export in Addis Ababa urban environment (Ethiopia)	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Protection of natural waters against excess of fluoride is a priority in the Middle Ethiopian Rift where high concentrations of fluoride occur in groundwater, lakes and hot springs. In recent years, a growing attention has been paid to geogenic sources of fluoride, while anthropogenic sources have been completely disregarded. Ethiopian people are subject to high levels of fluoride intake via food or drinks, resulting in elevated concentrations of fluoride in urine and subsequently in the human slurry waste. In Addis Ababa, 3 millions of people live without a suitable sewage waste collection/treatment facility and the superficial water system of the city often receives untreated domestic and municipal effluents. In this study, the impact of fluoride-rich human slurry on surface waters quality in Addis Ababa was evaluated. Physical-chemical and bacteriological assessments of rivers and shallow groundwater samples were performed. Several samples displayed critical levels of fluoride and faecal coliforms bacteria in the north-western part of the city. When uncontaminated fresh water flowing from the highland travels through the city, it experiences a rapid deterioration because of the interaction with untreated sewage outlets. This was clearly inferred by the combined analysis of water stable isotopes, fluoride and faecal coliforms bacteria. The methodological results of this study could be used to distinguish anthropogenic from geogenic sources of fluoride in urban environments of developing countries, which are often affected by multiple sources of fluoride.					colombani, nicolo/J-2336-2015; mastrocicco, micol/J-2291-2015; Di Giuseppe, Dario/AAH-8885-2019; colombani, nicolò/J-2336-2015	colombani, nicolo/0000-0002-6593-8505; mastrocicco, micol/0000-0003-3251-9117; DI GIUSEPPE, Dario/0000-0003-1726-4531; Kebede Gurmessa, Seifu/0000-0003-0283-2014; 													0375-6742	1879-1689				JUL	2018	190						390	399		10.1016/j.gexplo.2018.04.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gexplo.2018.04.008													WOS:000432601600030

With goal programming, additional benefits can be the inclusion of subjective estimates or desires as decision criteria, portrayal of several alternative potential solutions and tradeoff relationships, and identification of severe conflicts between certain goals that have an overriding influence on solutions. In this study, goal programming was used for multiple land use planning on 16,000 acres in the southern Sierra Nevada of California. The mountainous terrain contained coniferous forests, brushfield, and meadows interspersed with streams, lakes, and rocky barrens. Land uses evaluated were outdoor recreation, timber and livestock production, and deer population management in conjunction with three alternative proposals for development of a winter-sports facility. The goal model assessed production tradeoffs for the various land uses associated with changing managerial priorities and indicated an optimal development strategy. Goal programming proved to be an effective, flexible technique for multiple land use planning.																			0022-4561					SEP-OCT	1991	46	5					373	376																WOS:A1991GJ34300015

Those findings which cannot be obtained from visual observations alone are emphasized. The birds used 3 major marsh roosts on 38 of 40 bird-nights that they roosted in that area, but they switched roosts 10 times. Three grackles were located in 5 different roosts after they migrated. The distance between the 5 roosts and the previous night''s roost varied from 9.3-52.8 km. The distance of center of activity of the major diurnal activity range (MDAR) from the previous night''s roost averaged 23.5 km for birds that remained in the refuge area. Distances between centers of activity on successive days averaged 11.9 km, but these centers tended to be clustered. The mean activity radius of MDARs averaged 1.9 km. Home ranges averaged 325.4 km2. The minimum area used by the roosting population was calculated to be 1990 km2. While in their MDARs, instrumented grackles spent most of their time in oak forests, peanut fields (29% in harvested fields and 6% in unharvested) and pastures. They used 58 peanut fields (55 harvested and 3 unharvested), but individuals rarely revisited a field they had used on a previous day. The daily and day-to-day composition of large flocks of grackles was unstable. Of 6 grackles that migrated, 5 moved out ahead of or during cold fronts. Three migrated in the morning after leaving the roost and 3 migrated from their MDAR in the late afternoon. Migration thrusts ranged from 35-53 km.																			0043-5643						1979	91	1					78	87																WOS:A1979GU52800008

However, the environmental evolution of these lakes (especially in ancient times) temporally and spatially is still poorly understood due to the unavailability of suitable samples. Here we present a case study of the Late Paleozoic Fengcheng Formation in the Junggar Basin, NW China, based on organic (biomarker) as well as inorganic (elemental) geochemical approaches. Results show that the Fengcheng Formation was deposited in a non-marine environment, as illustrated by the absence of 24-n-propylcholestanes and 24-isopropylcholestanes combined with the established fossil and sodium-carbonate evaporite records (wegscheiderite and trona). In detail, based on the biomarker assemblages in general, the Fengcheng Formation formed in an anoxic, hypersaline, stratified lacustrine environment. Temporally, the lower part of the formation (the lower two members F-1 and F-2) was formed under stable anoxic and stratified conditions with higher salinity, while the upper part (the third member F-3) had higher freshwater influx, which reduced the salinity and resulted in relatively higher terrestrial organic matter input. Spatially, the central region of the alkaline lake was influenced by hydrothermal springs, while the marginal region was more affected by volcanic activities resulting in clay-rich and suboxic environments during F-3. Our work suggests that the spatiotemporal evolution of alkaline lakes is multi-stage and heterogeneous, with hydrothermal and volcanic influence under restricted conditions and a dry climate.

East Dongting Lake, which is an important wintering habitat and pathway for migratory birds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, was taken as a case study. The aims of this study were to identify: (1) whether there were any relationships between environmental variables and bird species in East Dongting Lake wetland; (2) which variable(s) could be the critical one(s) markedly correlating with the birds. We applied direct multivariate analysis combined with partial analysis to quantify the effects of environmental variables on bird species in this study. The results indicated that landscape structure (explaining 40.95% of the variation), habitat index and human disturbance (75.58%, 51.97%, respectively) were significantly associated with the bird abundance while the individual effect of habitat-level variables was more evident than the others. Among the seven chosen environmental variables, five critical variables markedly related to the richness of birds (P<0.05) with the impact intensity in the order of sedge area >water area >reed area >patch density >distance to residents. No obvious indication was found in our study to prove that landscape diversity and distance to road had significant correlations with the bird species abundance. The results would provide potential insights into protecting the bird diversity and the restoration of the bird habitat in East Dongting Lake wetland. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, HD; Rose, NL				Yang, HD; Rose, NL			Distribution of mercury in six lake sediment cores across the UK	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					6th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant	OCT 15-19, 2001	MINAMATA, JAPAN					Six sediment cores, from Lochnagar, Loch Chon and Loch Grannoch in Scotland, Burnmoor Tarn in the English Lake District, Llyn Llagi in the Snowdonia region of Wales and Banbury Reservoir in London, were taken in order to study the distribution of Hg temporally and historically in lake sediments across the UK. These cores were dated using the spheroidal carbonaceous particle technique. The cores show that all sites across the UK have been contaminated by Hg. There is a rapid increase in Hg concentration during the last approximately 200 years at all rural sites. In the 95 year record from Banbury Reservoir in London the sediments show high Hg concentrations (380-840 ng g(-1)) throughout. Inter-site differences in Hg concentrations and profiles may be explained by impacts of afforestation, composition of the sediments and the provenance of the Hg including catchment in-wash influences. For example, catchment contributions result in a sharp peak (1606 ng g(-1)) in the Hg concentration profile in the core taken from Loch Chon in the Trossachs region of Scotland. Mercury fluxes were calculated for the sediment cores and show that over the last few decades these UK sites, except Lochnagar, would fall into the upper range for European rural areas.

J	Magny, M; Miramont, C; Sivan, O				Magny, M; Miramont, C; Sivan, O			Assessment of the impact of climate and anthropogenic factors on Holocene Mediterranean vegetation in Europe on the basis of palaeohydrological records	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Correlations between lake-level and river-activity records from the western Mediterranean and palaeohydrological records from northern Africa and central Europe suggest a distinction, in the western Mediterranean region, between an early Holocene period characterised by cooler and moister conditions than at present, favourable to temperate deciduous trees, and, after 5000 yr BP, a later Holocene period with a warmer and drier climate. The second phase was favourable to the extension of evergreen sclerophyllous trees possibly reinforced by human activities. These two successive Holocene periods reflect orbitally induced changes in summer insolation. Furthermore, superimposed on this general climatic trend, century-scale climatic oscillations punctuated the whole Holocene period. Decreases in river activity in the western Mediterranean region occurred at ca. 11 500, 10 500, 9000, 7000, 4000, 3000, 2000 and 800 cal yr BP. These decreases coincided with lake-level lowering in Jura, eastern France, and glacier retreat in the northern Alps and could be associated with a temporary expansion of sclerophyllous trees. This general pattern could have resulted from an alternatingly southward/northward displacement of the Atlantic Westerly Jet. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Prairie, YT; Bird, DF; Cole, JJ				Prairie, YT; Bird, DF; Cole, JJ			The summer metabolic balance in the epilimnion of southeastern Quebec lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												On the basis of data collected in Quebec lakes, del Giorgio and Peters (1994) and Carignan et al. (2000) have come to opposite conclusions regarding the metabolic balance between heterotrophy and autotrophy in lakes in general. In the present study, epilimnetic oxygen and carbon dioxide saturation was measured in 33 lakes front the St. Lawrence Lowlands region of Quebec to examine the extent of epilimnetic net heterotrophy (i.e.. O-2:CO2 balance) in lakes of different characteristics. We found that similar to75% of the lakes were under-saturated with oxygen and supersaturated with CO2. There was a strong negative relationship between the departures of O-2 and CO2 from saturation. What has not been noted elsewhere is that oxygen concentrations were negatively related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and, therefore, metabolic gas balances could be predicted from DOC; a value between 4 and 6 mg L-1 DOC corresponds to metabolic equilibrium. Because most of the lakes in del Giorgio and Peters (1994) had DOC concentrations above this threshold and most lakes in Carignan et al. (2000) were below, their apparently contradictory conclusions can be reconciled within a larger general theory. Contrary to studies elsewhere, however, we found that the degree of oxygen undersaturation increased with lake trophic status. expressed either as total phosphorus or nitrogen concentrations.

We have analysed the changes in the chlorophyll-a concentration in 21 high-mountain lakes from Sierra Nevada. Eleven lakes proved to have superficial diffuse inlets and outlets (open lakes) while the other 10 have no outlets, or no permanent outlets (closed lakes), where the plankton losses by washout are not possible. The lakes were sampled on two occasions during the ice-free season: just after the spring thaw (July) and by late August, after plankton development. In July, chlorophyll-a was quite similar between the closed and open lakes while in August the open lakes had about three-fold more chlorophyll-a than did closed ones. Model selection analysis made with 12 variables than can affect chlorophyll-a indicated that, in July, chlorophyll-a was related mainly to the maximum depth of closed lakes although the type of lake (closed or open) had no effect. However, in August, the type of lake (more chlorophyll-a in open than in closed lakes) and the ratio between dissolved inorganic nitrogen and total phosphorus (DIN:TP ratio) (higher values, lower chlorophyll-a), was related to chlorophyll-a concentration. The results of DIN, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and nutrient ratios did not indicate a different nutrient availability between open and closed lakes in either of the two periods considered. Nevertheless, the data available showed that the zooplankton was, on average, about two-fold more abundant in the closed lakes than in the open ones during the entire ice-free season. These results indicate that the advective losses caused by the water flow could be greater for the zooplankton than for the phytoplankton, interfering with the coupling of trophic chains. Thus, part of primary production in the open lakes could not be transferred to higher trophic levels because of the zooplankton losses.

Different approaches for obtaining cumulative distributions of potentially detachable block volumes are compared. A highly fractured rock mass outcropping along the western Lake Garda (Italy), consisting of prevailing limestone and interbedded marls, is studied in detail from geological and geostructural points of view. Then, a representative rock face has been selected and analyzed with traditional and non-contact survey methods to identify the main discontinuity sets and to collect spacing samples. Based on these data, in situ block size distributions for different combinations of sets are built following statistically-based approaches, without the use of a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) generator. The validation of the obtained distributions is attempted based on the detached block surveyed at the foot of the slope. However, in this particular case study, the detached blocks cover only a minimal volume range compared to both theoretical values and visible rockfall scars. The fallen rock blocks have a marginal role in design block determination, since their volume depends on geological discontinuities (bedding and fractures) and could be affected by other processes after the detachment (e.g., fragmentation). The procedure here described should be standard practice in the study of rockfall events, and it should be uniform in European standards such as Eurocodes. Future developments should involve the scientific community for setting the percentiles of the probability distribution to be considered for block design definition.

J	Alcott, TI; Steenburgh, WJ				Alcott, Trevor I.; Steenburgh, W. James			Orographic Influences on a Great Salt Lake-Effect Snowstorm	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Although several mountain ranges surround the Great Salt Lake (GSL) of northern Utah, the extent to which orography modifies GSL-effect precipitation remains largely unknown. Here the authors use observational and numerical modeling approaches to examine the influence of orography on the GSL-effect snowstorm of 27 October 2010, which generated 6-10 mm of precipitation (snow-water equivalent) in the Salt Lake Valley and up to 30 cm of snow in the Wasatch Mountains. The authors find that the primary orographic influences on the event are 1) foehnlike flow over the upstream orography that warms and dries the incipient low-level air mass and reduces precipitation coverage and intensity; 2) orographically forced convergence that extends downstream from the upstream orography, is enhanced by blocking windward of the Promontory Mountains, and affects the structure and evolution of the lake-effect precipitation band; and 3) blocking by the Wasatch and Oquirrh Mountains, which funnels the flow into the Salt Lake Valley, reinforces the thermally driven convergence generated by the GSL, and strongly enhances precipitation. The latter represents a synergistic interaction between lake and downstream orographic processes that is crucial for precipitation development, with a dramatic decrease in precipitation intensity and coverage evident in simulations in which either the lake or the orography are removed. These results help elucidate the spectrum of lake-orographic processes that contribute to lake-effect events and may be broadly applicable to other regions where lake effect precipitation occurs in proximity to complex terrain.

In this period, the extraction of hypolimnetic water, due to summer irrigation, brought the surface level down by 6 m in one month and the epilimnetic water progressively occupied the whole water column. The temperature profile, with the exception of a few meters at the surface layer. presented an almost constant temperature gradient of about 0.7degreesC/m. The period of the main vertical mode is 24 h with an amplitude of around 1 m. Thermistor chain records and meteorological data allow us to deduce that this mode is, at least, a third vertical mode forced by the wind, which normally has a typical periodicity of 24 It. However, when the wind changes direction from south to north. the circulation cells developed due to this forced nonstationary oscillation are destroyed. When this occurs, the Bulk Richardson number is Ri(b) similar to 1. Similar vertical structures as a response to wind forcing should be expected in similar systems. although this has not been reported in the literature.					; Roget, Elena/C-3689-2009; Pérez-Losada, Joaquim/G-8701-2015	casamitjana, xavier/0000-0003-1662-9076; Roget, Elena/0000-0002-4950-0204; Perez-Losada, Joaquim/0000-0002-8590-2155													0733-9429	1943-7900				SEP	2003	129	9					734	737		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2003)129:9(734)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2003)129:9(734)													WOS:000184782800009
J	Li, R; Chi, XL				Li, Rui; Chi, Xiaoli			Thermal comfort and tourism climate changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the last 50 years	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												In this paper, the thermal comfort and its changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau over the last 50 years have been evaluated by using the physiological equivalent temperature (PET), and a more complete tourism climate picture is presented by the Climate-Tourism-Information Scheme (CTIS). The results show that PET classes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau cover six out of the nine-point thermal sensation scale - very cold, cold, cool, slightly cool, neutral and slightly warm - and cold stress is prevailing throughout the year. A small number of slightly cool/warm and neutral days occur in summer months. There occur no warm, hot and very hot days. The frequency of PET classes varies among regions, depending on their altitude/latitude conditions. Xining, Lhasa and Yushu are the top three cities in terms of thermal favorability. With global warming, annual cumulative number of thermally favorable days has been increasing, and that of cold stress has been reducing. The change is more obvious in lower elevation than that in higher elevation regions. The improving thermal comfort in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau might be a glad tiding for local communities and tourists. Besides PET, CTIS can provide a number of additional bioclimatic information related to tourism and recreational activities. CTIS for Lhasa and Xining shows that sunshine is plentiful all the year round, and windy days occur frequently from late January to early May. This is a useful bioclimatic information for tourism authorities, travel agencies, resorts and tourists.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				AUG	2014	117	3-4					613	624		10.1007/s00704-013-1027-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-1027-5													WOS:000339905000023

The meromictic period was characterised by anoxic conditions in the bottom layer with high sulphide and nutrient concentrations. The depth of the nutricline varied as affected by thermohaline conditions in the water column. In late summer 1997, holomictic conditions replaced ordinary meromitic conditions in the lake. This transformation caused anoxia to spread throughout the water column and mass mortality of almost all the organisms occured. Thereafter, oxic conditions were re-established slowly as the new phytoplankton population developed. As a consequence of the particulate organic matter decay, inorganic N and P concentrations increased and had doubled approximately six weeks after the mass mortality. The revitalisation of the phytoplankton population was initiated immediately after the mass mortality by the development of "microflagellate" species, which were favoured by the high ammonia concentrations. The larger phytoplankton species (diatoms and dinoflagellatae) developed at the expense of smaller ones when nitrate became the dominant nutrient in the water column. A year after the mass mortality the composition of the phytoplankton population was the same as before.																			0214-8358	1886-8134				JUN	2003	67	2					129	141		10.3989/scimar.2003.67n2129	http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/scimar.2003.67n2129													WOS:000183987100002

Detection of Biomarkers of Pathogenic Naegleria fowleri Through Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics	JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY												Emerging methods based on mass spectrometry (MS) can be used in the rapid identification of microorganisms. Thus far, these practical and rapidly evolving methods have mainly been applied to characterize prokaryotes. We applied matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF MS in the analysis of whole cells of 18 N. fowleri isolates belonging to three genotypes. Fourteen originated from the cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis patients and four originated from water samples of hot springs, rivers, lakes or municipal water supplies. Whole Naegleria trophozoites grown in axenic cultures were washed and mixed with MALDI matrix. Mass spectra were acquired with a 4700 TOF-TOF instrument. MALDI-TOF MS yielded consistent patterns for all isolates examined. Using a combination of novel data processing methods for visual peak comparison, statistical analysis and proteomics database searching we were able to detect several biomarkers that can differentiate all species and isolates studied, along with common biomarkers for all N. fowleri isolates. Naegleria fowleri could be easily separated from other species within the genus Naegleria. A number of peaks detected were tentatively identified. MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting is a rapid, reproducible, high-throughput alternative method for identifying Naegleria isolates. This method has potential for studying eukaryotic agents.					del Aguila, Carmen/A-6063-2016; Pinto, Tatiana/O-1265-2015; Izquierdo Arias, Fernando/AAE-3073-2019; Wagner, Glauber/B-2369-2013; Izquierdo, Fernando/AAE-3073-2019	del Aguila, Carmen/0000-0003-0063-7899; Izquierdo Arias, Fernando/0000-0003-0367-007X; Wagner, Glauber/0000-0001-5003-6595; Pinto, Tatiana/0000-0002-7878-9377													1066-5234	1550-7408				JAN-FEB	2015	62	1					12	20		10.1111/jeu.12178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeu.12178								25231600					WOS:000348718000003

Indicators of organic loading, phosphate, percentage of organic matter, and nitrate were high for C. variipennis and C. sonorensis, reflecting the common occurrence of larvae in sediments contaminated with livestock waste; these factors were low in western playa lake habitats with immature C. occidentalis. Levels of salt-forming ions and indicators of salinity, notably sodium, chloride, magnesium, sulfate, boron, and conductivity, were elevated in substrates supporting all 3 species, with values that declined from very high to high across the arid west to moderate east of the Mississippi river, and differed significantly among species. Concentrations of boron differed most strongly among habitats of the respective species, ranging from exceptionally high values in playa lake substrates with C. occidentalis, to high and moderate levels in western and southeastern sites with C. sonorensis, to moderate levels for substrates in the east with C. variipennis. The presence of C. sonorensis in dairy wastewater lagoons and saline springs in geographic regions that are otherwise inhabited by C. variipennis may reflect salinity factors that regulate the distribution of the C. variipennis complex.																			0022-2585	1938-2928				JAN	2000	37	1					58	64		10.1603/0022-2585-37.1.58	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585-37.1.58								15218908					WOS:000089624900011

A strong latitudinal dependence of surface temperature, annual mean and annual range was found. Except for Tucurui Reservoir, a reservoir of the Equatorial zone, the lowest surface temperature of the year in the other compared reservoirs was observed from June to August while the highest extended from October to February. The decreasing trend of annual mean temperatures and thermal ranges was due to the increasing seasonal variability of insolation with the latitude. A positive relationship between the increase on thermal surface-bottom differences and the depth of water column was found for reservoirs of similar latitudes. A long thermal stratification (around four months) was evidenced in the lacustrine zone of reservoirs with a residence time higher than 40 days. Low fluctuation (<2%) of the annual variability of heat contents was observed for the Tucurui Reservoir, while in das Garcas Reservoir a manmade lake located in the frontier between tropical and temperate regions, the annual coefficient of variation attained 13%. Concerning the heat budgets, the value for the Tucurui Reservoir was two times higher than in das Garcas Reservoir. Both the morphometric and climatological factors affected the heat contents of the two compared reservoirs. In deep eutrophic reservoirs, a significant reduction on the oxygen concentrations in the hypolimnetic zone was frequently observed. In some oligotrophic stratified reservoirs, a decrease on oxygen with depth occurred when the temperature of the hypolimnion was higher than 20 degrees C and caused a biochemical oxygen demand. In das Garcas Reservoir, the actual oxygen deficits ranged from 0.40 to 1.52 mg.O-2.cm(-2) and appear to be linked to oxygen consumption after the senescence of Microcystis aeruginosa populations in the spring. But, other factors such as the allochthonous loads of organic matter also had an important role on the oxygen balance of das Garcas Reservoir.																					85-87418-02-5				1999							125	151																WOS:000086563300007

Efficacy was measured by the changes in catch rates, age composition, and origin of adult lake trout returning to the shoal in the fall in subsequent years. The abundance of lake trout spawners without fin clips, which implies that these fish hatched in the lake. increased throughout the sampling period. whereas the abundance of hatchery-reared fish (indicated by one or more fin clips) stocked for restoration purposes remained low. Year-class-specific stock-recruitment analysis suggested that the recruitment of unclipped spawners was related to the number of eggs planted in previous years rather than to spawning by the few adult lake trout visiting the reef. Increases in adult fish at Devils island Shoal Acre independent of trends at adjacent sites, where unclipped spawner abundances remained low.

To reduce this land-use conflict and to promote the current level of biodiversity of colonial nesters in the area, artificial islands were built in the winter of 1995-1996 with different areas designated for a variety of nesting waterbirds including Caspian terns. In 1994, prior to island construction, we tested three substrate types for tern nesting preferences so that an appropriate substrate could be placed on the Caspian tern designated portion of the new islands. We found a preference for sand over pea-gravel and crushed stent:, and indirect evidence for a preference favouring the experimental substrates over the pre-existing substrate of hard-packed ground. Based on these results, the small area of the island designed for Caspian tern nesting was surfaced with sand and was subsequently colonised successfully. The colony established and reproduced successfully on the designated site in 1996 and grew in numbers of nesting pairs in 1997. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	ROBERTS, DA; BOYLEN, CW				ROBERTS, DA; BOYLEN, CW			EFFECTS OF LIMING ON THE EPIPELIC ALGAL COMMUNITY OF WOODS LAKE, NEW YORK	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The biovolume and species composition of algae on the sediment along a depth gradient were determined before and after liming of acidic (pH 4.9), oligotrophic Woods Lake in the Adirondack Park in New York State (Herkimer Co., NY, USA). The epipelic algal community was dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria prior to and following liming. Distinct depth zonation patterns of community composition were evident and unaffected by CaCO3 addition. Treatment with calcite increased pH from 4.9 to above 9.0, caused ANC to rise from 0 to > 400 .mu.q .cntdot. L-1, and immediately reduced overall water clarity which subsequently improved during the summer. There was a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in total algal biovolume after limiting corresponding to a significant reduction in biovolume of Hapalosiphon pumilus at the deepest sites. Total diatom biovolume was not significantly changed as a result of the addition of calcite; however, a shift in community composition from dominance by Navicula tenuicephala and Fragilaria acidobiontica to dominance by Achnanthes microcephala and Anomoeoneis vitrea was observed following liming.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1989	46	2					287	294		10.1139/f89-039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-039													WOS:A1989T286700016

Rare cyanobacteria drive nitrogen-fixation and cyanotoxin production in an Aphanizomenon-dominated bloom	HARMFUL ALGAE												Late summer, recurring cyanobacterial blooms in Lake of the Woods (LOW) are polycyanobacterial and typically dominated by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. LOW waters are typically nitrogen limited, relative to phosphorus. As such, the dominance of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, a putative nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, suggests that its ability to fix nitrogen may be advantageous and aid in its ability to bloom. This study sought to quantify nitrogen fixation rates and identify cyanotoxin-producing species during the blooms. Throughout the 2021 season, we quantified nutrients, N-fixation rates, microbial community composition, and gene expression to determine who is responsible for cyanotoxin synthesis and nitrogen fixation. We found nitrogen fixation rates increased throughout the season, coincided with the bloom, but likely cannot fully support the bloom's nitrogen demand. However, the transcription of nitrogenase genes was solely done by less abundant Dolichospermum spp. and not by A. flos-aquae. Genome analysis suggests this population of A. flos-aquae cannot create a functioning nitrogenase, but they do still express the genes to initiate heterocyst differentiation. Microcystin gene transcripts were primarily from Microcystis spp. and Planktothrix spp. and coincided with microcystin concentrations. Interestingly, Planktothrix highly expressed anabaenopeptin genes, suggesting the presence of additional bioactive compounds in LOW. This work suggests that rare cyanobacterial members drive nitrogen fixation, and may be necessary for the seasonal bloom's function, toxicity, and longevity.

The results show that patterns of climate change in Tengchong during the Last Glaciation were different from those in eastern China, and suggest that, compared with modern climates, SW China was cool and semi-humid during MIS 4, cold and semi-humid in the early and middle stages of MIS 3, and cool and humid in the late stage of MIS 3. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), it was cool and dry, whereas after the LGM the climate remained dry but became warmer. Down-core changes in Abies and Picea pollen amongst the woody plants broadly match records of geochemical indices in parallel peat/lake-sediment cores and stalagmite oxygen isotope records from monsoonal Asia. Heinrich events 1-5 and volcanic eruption events are recognized in the Abies + Picea curve. As inferred from the microfossil assemblages in the Tengchong cores, the coldest interval in SW China during the Last Glaciation might not have been the LGM.

Autonomous temperature sensors, data loggers, were placed in this lake so that hourly measurements could be obtained from the snow-covered ice and water. The sensors that became frozen measured damped and delayed thermal response from the air-temperature fluctuation. Those sensors that were deeper within the snow-covered ice measured continuous, almost constant, temperature values near freezing. Several of them were within the liquid water and responded with a fluctuation of 24 h periods of amplitudes up to 0.2 degrees C. Our analysis of the vertical temperature profiles suggested that the source of periodic water heating comes from the lake bottom. Because of the absence of daily temperature variations of the snow-covered ice, the influence of the air-temperature fluctuation can be ruled out. We attribute the heating process to the periodic inflow of groundwater to the lake and the cooling to the heat diffusion to the overlying ice cover. The periodic groundwater inflow is interpreted due to solid Earth tides, which cause periodic fluctuations of the groundwater pressure head.

Evaluating short-term effects of omnivorous fish removal on water quality and zooplankton at a subtropical lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We evaluated a biomanipulation program to test for short-term changes in water quality (chlorophyll a, Secchi depth, total phosphorus) and macrozooplankton biomass following partial removal of omnivorous gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum. The removal occurred at a eutrophic subtropical lake, and responses were compared to an unmanipulated control lake using a before-after-control-impact paired series analysis. The removal reduced the biomass of large (> 300 mm) gizzard shad by 75% over 2 years via a subsidized commercial gill net fishery. However, the total population biomass of gizzard shad was reduced by approximately 32% from an average pre-manipulation biomass of 224 kg ha(-1) due to the size selectivity of the gear, which did not effectively capture small fish (< 300 mm). No significant short-term changes in chlorophyll a concentration, Secchi depth, total phosphorus concentration or macrozooplankton biomass were detected following biomanipulation. The partial removal may have fallen short of the biomass reduction required to cause ecosystem responses. Our results suggest that moderate omnivore removals (i.e., < 40% biomass reduction) will have little short-term benefits to these lakes, and future manipulations should use a less size-selective gear to achieve a larger total biomass reduction.

This survey overlaps with and expands upon an earlier survey of the Drygalski Ice Tongue and the David Glacier grounding zone from 2011 and 2012 to create a 5 km resolution survey extending 200 km upstream from the grounding zone. The surveyed region covers two active subglacial lakes and includes reflights of ICESat ground tracks that extend the surface elevation record in the region. This is one of the most extensive aerogeophysical surveys of an active lake system and provides higher-resolution boundary conditions and basal characterizations that will enable process studies of these features. This paper introduces a new helicopter-mounted ice-penetrating radar and laser altimetry system, notes a discrepancy between the original surface-elevation-derived lake outlines and locations of possible water collection based on basal geometry and hydraulic potential, and presents radar-based observations of basal conditions that are inconsistent with large collections of ponded water despite laser altimetry showing that the hypothesized active lakes are at a highstand.

Red Lake (Croatia) is a cryptodepression in the karst massif rich in well-developed extreme surface karst forms and underground conduit system. It is interconnected with other close water bodies and offers information on groundwater movement and characteristics. The article analyses hourly data on precipitation and water levels in Red Lake and compares them with data on discharges from near Opacac Spring for a period of five years. Data gaps in the record caused by operational interruptions of the measuring equipment were compensated by the use of neural networks. The study of the hydrodynamics of karst surroundings under recession was conducted by observing the receding water levels and corresponding lake's volumetry. By isolating recession periods from the record of integral water volume change, some of the common techniques in recession analysis were performed aiming to acquire new knowledge on the hydrogeological regime of the karst system at the field scale. Additionally, spectral analysis was used as another tool of karst system characterisation since it enables the signal decomposition in the frequency domain and detection of dominant flow processes.

Millennial-scale abrupt climate changes during the last glacial and Holocene periods occurred in the region. However, these records remain poorly understood because dating eolian, lacustrine, and fluvial sediments and establishing reliable environmental proxies are challenging in this setting. Here, we use accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), grain size, and Rb/Sr ratios of bulk sediments from an oasis sequence in the Taklimakan Desert. While some C-14 dates results are not in the stratigraphic order, most of them can be grouped in four age groups during the Last Glacial. We infer that reversals of radiocarbon age based on total organic carbon (TOC) was controlled by organic carbon (OC) input from the regional carbon pool. We selected C-14 dates from the four age groups, to develop an age-depth model for a basin-wide chronology. Peaks in a cumulative probability curve of radiocarbon dates, with high Rb/Sr ratios and fine mean grain sizes, reveal four wet periods during the Last Glaciation, and one wetter/warmer period during the Holocene. The regional moisture variability appears to be influenced by the Asian summer monsoon and mid-latitude Westerlies. The Holocene wetter/warmer period facilitated human occupation of the oasis.

We provide an overview of the cyanobacterial and algal flora and characterise the taxa observed in these habitats. East African soda lakes (EASL) are listed amongst the most productive ecosystems worldwide. The main driving force of these systems is phytoplankton; extremely high light attenuation minimises growth of phytobenthos, and larger plants occur only sporadically along shores. Some EASL are home to Arthrospira fusiformis, formerly called Spirulina platensis, which is the main food of Lesser Flamingos. This species and other Cyanobacteria are, however, also discussed as a possible cause for sporadic flamingo die-offs. We summarise the somewhat confused taxonomy of Arthrospira and Spirulina and also show that-contrary to common opinion-Arthrospira blooms are not persistent. Under unfavourable growth conditions, Arthrospira is replaced by other taxa such as the prasinophyte Picocystis salinarum at increased ion concentrations. Besides Cyanobacteria, some of them diazotrophic, the algal community comprises mainly diatoms, coccoid green algae and flagellates of various algal groups. These extreme biotopes are usually treated as systems of low diversity, but, very recently, studies applying molecular tools revealed an unexpected hidden diversity. We demonstrate shifts of the phytoplankton community in these saline alkaline waters and discuss approaches to interpret this phenomenon based on biotic interactions and abiotic factors. Special attention is given to effects of changing salinity on the food web.

Here we have studied the variations in surface water CO2 during the ice-free period in the humic Lake Merasjarvi in northern Sweden. Meteorological, hydrological, and limnological data were collected using data logging equipment permitting high time resolution. The surface water of the lake was supersaturated with respect to CO2 throughout the study period. There were, however, considerable diurnal and longer-term temporal variations of the surface water CO2 concentrations. Partial least squares models were used to link the logged CO2 data to the multivariate data set. On the longer-term timescale (analyzed with 24 h means of the logged data), high concentrations of surface water CO2 were best related to the depth and temperature of the upper warmer layer (epilimnion), and to erosion of the underlying colder layer (hypolimnion). The diurnal variation (analyzed with 30 min means of the logged data) was best related to the thermal dynamics within the epilimnion, which regulated the surface water access to CO2 stores within this layer. Variables related to CO2 emission and photosynthesis (wind and photosynthetically active radiation) showed only weak correlations to variations of the surface water CO2 concentration. Accordingly, the CO2 flux, measured with the eddy-covariance technique, was not correlated to the surface water CO2 concentration.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN 24	2010	115								G02024	10.1029/2009JG001085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JG001085													WOS:000279310300001

Rarely did the population cross the thermocline. Estimates of the migrational velocity determined by in vivo fluorometry were higher (maximum rate of 10.8 m/day) than estimates obtained with in situ settling chambers (maximum rate of 0.43 m/day); however, the pattern of migration obtained by both methods was similar. The migratory ability of this alga apparently provided little advantage in nutrient uptake. Oscillatoria agardhii Gomont, which comprised only 5%.

J	Winstead, NS; Schaaf, RM; Mourad, PD				Winstead, NS; Schaaf, RM; Mourad, PD			Synthetic aperture radar observations of the surface signatures of cold-season bands over the Great Lakes	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												An important aspect of operational meteorology in and around the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada in the winter months is the forecasting of lake-effect precipitation. While the synoptic- and mesoscale processes that govern the development of lake-effect precipitation have been well understood for many years, problems observing these bands remain because of the limited boundary layer coverage provided by the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) network. While traditional visible and infrared satellite imagery helps alleviate these coverage limitations, overcast conditions often negate this advantage. Here, a new method for observing lake-effect bands by using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to identify and characterize their surface signatures is presented. SAR is a remote sensing tool that images surface roughness. Over water, this roughness is related to the surface wind stress and, hence, surface wind field. Here, three cases are documented where the SAR aboard the Canadian Radar Satellite-1 imaged the footprints of precipitating bands over the Great Lakes: one case with multiple snowbands west of one main band over Lake Superior, and two cases with shore-parallel bands over each of Lakes Ontario and Michigan. These cases are first documented using traditional observing methods: infrared satellite imagery, WSR-88D, and surface observations. Then, each SAR image is interpreted based upon the traditional observations. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate that SAR is capable of detecting the surface signatures associated with Great Lakes precipitation bands that could be of value to forecasters when data from traditional observation platforms are unavailable.																			0882-8156	1520-0434					2001	16	3					315	328		10.1175/1520-0434(2001)016<0315:SAROOT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(2001)016<0315:SAROOT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000169160000003
J	Reinl, KL; Sterner, RW; Lafrancois, BM; Brovold, S				Reinl, Kaitlin L.; Sterner, Robert W.; Lafrancois, Brenda Moraska; Brovold, Sandra			Fluvial seeding of cyanobacterial blooms in oligotrophic Lake Superior	HARMFUL ALGAE												Lake Superior has recently begun experiencing cyanobacterial blooms comprised of Dolichospermum lemmermannii near the Apostle Islands and along the southern shore of the western arm. Little is known about the origin of these blooms. Experiments were conducted during the summers of 2017 and 2018 to identify sources of propagules and characteristics of sites that were potential sources. The 2017 experiments were conducted using a factorial design with three source zones ('River', 'Lake', and 'Harbor'), two nutrient conditions (high and low N:P), and three temperatures (15, 20, and 25 degrees C). At the end of the experiment, cyanobacteria were most abundant from the 'River' and 'Harbor' zones at low N:P and 20 and 25 degrees C, with D. lemmermannii most abundant at 20 degrees C. Subsequently, in 2018 we evaluated 26 specific inland locations from three waterbody types ('River', 'Lake/Pond', and 'Coastal') and explored similarities among those sites that produced cyanobacteria in high abundance when samples were incubated under optimal conditions (low N:P and 25 degrees C). Under these growing conditions, we found high cyanobacteria abundance developed in samples from river sites with low ambient temperatures and high conductivity. Field monitoring showed that Lake Superior nearshore temperatures were higher than rivers. These observations suggest that blooms of D. lemmermannii in Lake Superior are initiated by fluvial seeding of propagules and highlight the importance of warmer temperatures and favorable nutrient and light conditions for subsequent extensive cyanobacterial growth. We argue that the watershed is an important source of biological loading of D. lemmermannii to Lake Superior and that when those cells reach the nearshore where there are warmer water temperatures and increased light, they can grow in abundance to produce blooms.

Geomorphology and event-stratigraphy of recent mass-movement processes in Lake Hallstatt (UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Landscape, Austria)	SUBAQUEOUS MASS MOVEMENTS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES: ADVANCES IN PROCESS UNDERSTANDING, MONITORING AND HAZARD ASSESSMENTS	Geological Society Special Publication											We report the first-ever basin-wide geomorphological characterization of a high-resolution bathymetry map in a steeply incised valley-occupying intra-mountainous lake in the Eastern Alps. The resulting new geomorphological map of Lake Hallstatt is then combined with high-resolution reflection seismic and sedimentary core analyses to document, characterize and date recent (<200 years) subaquatic landslides. The area is located in the UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Landscape of the Hallstatt-Dachstein area, famous for its well-documented medieval and prehistoric human settlement history. This allows us to calibrate observed mass-transport deposits (MTDs) in the high-resolution sedimentary archive (sedimentation rates c. 0.5 cm a(-1)) of this deep lake dominated by clastic sedimentation. The hydro-acoustic data document a multitude of different MTDs linked to rock falls, subaqueous slope failures and shore collapses. Sediment cores document laminated background sediments intercalated with distinct event deposits that can be linked to historically documented major flood events and moderately strong earthquakes. Our study suggests that the larger MTDs result from earthquake-triggered subaquatic delta slope instabilities and that the deeper subsurface provides evidence of even larger mass-movement processes, yet to be validated by longer cores. Thus, Lake Hallstatt is a potential natural laboratory for studying causes and consequences of subaquatic landslides in steeply incised intra-mountainous lakes and comparable fjord settings.					; Fabbri, Stefano Claudio/E-1034-2019; Strasser, Michael/A-2424-2009	Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Huang, Jyh-Jaan/0000-0001-8815-3957; Kowarik, Kerstin/0000-0003-0497-3419; Fabbri, Stefano Claudio/0000-0002-0015-0442; Lauterbach, Stefan/0000-0003-4131-0366; Ortler, Marcel-Luciano/0000-0002-2732-9514; Strasser, Michael/0000-0003-3991-2405													0305-8719						2020	500						405	426		10.1144/SP500-2019-178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP500-2019-178	10.1144/SP500												WOS:000566145300026

Because diatom-based monitoring of water quality is required by European legislation, molecular-based methods had emerged as useful alternatives to classical methods based on morphological identification using light microscopy. The aim of this study was to test the reliability of DNA metabarcoding combined with High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) techniques in the bioassessment of the trophic status of 22 Mediterranean shallow ponds in NW Spain. For each pond, the Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) was calculated from inventories obtained by identification using light microscopy (LM) followed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) at the molecular level. Ponds were subsequently classified into five water quality classes. The results showed a good correspondence between both methods, especially after applying a correction factor that depended on the biovolume of the cells. This correspondence led to the assignment to the same quality class in 59% of the ponds. The determination and quantification of valves or DNA sequences was one of the main pitfalls, which mainly included those related to the variability in the relative abundances of some species. Accordingly, ponds with similar relative abundances for the dominant species were assigned to the same quality class. Moreover, other difficulties leading the discrepancies were the misidentification of some species due to the presence of semi-cryptic taxa, the incompleteness of the reference database and the bioinformatic protocol. Thus, the validation of DNA-based methods for the identification of freshwater diatoms represents an important goal, as an alternative to using traditional methods in Mediterranean shallow ponds.

J	Smith, K; Strong, C; Wang, SY				Smith, Kimberly; Strong, Courtenay; Wang, Shih-Yu			Connectivity between Historical Great Basin Precipitation and Pacific Ocean Variability: A CMIP5 Model Evaluation	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The eastern Great Basin (GB) in the western United States is strongly affected by droughts that influence water management decisions. Precipitation that falls in the GB, particularly in the Great Salt Lake (GSL) basin encompassed by the GB, provides water for millions of people living along the Wasatch Front Range. Western U.S. precipitation is known to be influenced by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as well as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) in the North Pacific. Historical connectivity between GB precipitation and Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on interannual to multidecadal time scales is evaluated for 20 models that participated in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). While the majority of the models had realistic ENSO and PDO spatial patterns in the SSTs, the simulated influence of these two modes on GB precipitation tended to be too strong for ENSO and too weak for PDO. Few models captured the connectivity at a quasi-decadal period influenced by the transition phase of the Pacific quasi-decadal oscillation (QDO; a recently identified climate mode that influences GB precipitation). Some of the discrepancies appear to stem from models not capturing the observed tendency for the PDO to modulate the sign of the ENSO-GB precipitation teleconnection. Of all of the models, CCSM4 most consistently captured observed connections between Pacific SST variability and GB precipitation on the examined time scales.

J	Doherty, R; Kutzbach, J; Foley, J; Pollard, D				Doherty, R; Kutzbach, J; Foley, J; Pollard, D			Fully coupled climate/dynamical vegetation model simulations over Northern Africa during the mid-Holocene	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The climate and vegetation patterns of the middle Holocene (6000 years ago; 6 ka) over Northern Africa are simulated using a fully-synchronous climate and dynamical vegetation model. The coupled model predicts a northward shift in tropical rainforest and tropical deciduous forest vegetation by about 5 degrees of latitude, and an increase in grassland at the present-day simulated Saharan boundaries. The northward expansion of vegetation over North Africa at 6 ka is initiated by an orbitally-induced amplification of the summer monsoon: and enhanced by feedback effects induced by the vegetation. These combined processes lead to a major reduction in Saharan desert area at 6 ka relative to present-day of about 50%. However, as shown in previous asynchronous modelling studies, the coupled climate/vegetation model does not fully reproduce the vegetation patterns inferred from palaeoenvironmental records, which suggest that steppe vegetation may have existed across most of Northern Africa. Orbital changes produce an intensification of monsoonal precipitation during the peak rainy season (July to September), whilst vegetation feedbacks, in addition to producing further increases in the peak intensity, play an important role in extending the rainy season from May/June through to November. The orbitally induced increases in precipitation are relatively uniform from west to east, in contrast to vegetation feedback-induced increases in precipitation which are concentrated in western North Africa. Annual-average precipitation increases caused by vegetation feedbacks are simulated to be of similar importance to orbital effects in the west, whilst they are relatively unimportant farther to the east. The orbital, vegetation and combined orbital and vegetation-induced changes in climate, from the simulations presented in this study, have been compared with results from previous modelling studies over the appropriate North African domain. Consequently, the important role of vegetation parametrizations in determining the magnitude of vegetation feedbacks has been illustrated. Further modelling studies which include the effects of changes in ocean temperature and changes in soil properties may be needed, along with additional observational to resolve the discrepancy between model predictions of vegetation and palaeorecords for North Africa.

During the past 60 years, irrigation has greatly changed the water distribution and caused severe environmental issues in the ASB. Using remote sensing data, this study investigated the environmental changes induced by irrigation activities in this region. The results show that, in the past decade, land water storage has significantly increased in the irrigated upstream regions (13 km(3) year(-1)) but decreased in the downstream regions (-27 km(3) year(-1)) of the Amu Darya River basin, causing a water storage decrease in the whole basin (-20 km(3) year(-1)). As a result, the water surface area of the Aral Sea has decreased from 32,000 in 2000 to 10,000 km(2) in 2015. The shrinking Aral Sea exposed a large portion of the lake bottom to the air, increasing (decreasing) the daytime (nighttime) temperatures by about 1 degrees C year(-1) (0.5 degrees C year(-1)). Moreover, there were other potential environmental changes, including drier soil, less vegetation, decreasing cloud and precipitation, and more severe and frequent dust storms. Possible biases in the remote sensing data due to the neglect of the shrinking water surface area of the Aral Sea were identified. These findings highlight the severe environmental threats caused by irrigation in Central Asia and call attention to sustainable water use in such dryland regions.

J	Lozhkin, A; Anderson, P				Lozhkin, Anatoly; Anderson, Patricia			The influence of permafrost processes and paludification on landscapes in mountain settings of the Upper Kolyma basin (Western Beringia)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Lithological and paleovegetation data from sites in the Elikchan region of the Upper Kolyma basin provide insights into the permafrost history of the mountain valleys of interior Western Beringia. The Elikchan records show a period of peat accumulation between-12,000 and 9500 cal BP, which parallels trends in the northern coastal lowlands. This interval corresponds to a time when summers were warmer and drier than present and the previously established Betula-Alnus shrub tundra was replaced by Larix-Betula-Populus forest in both the interior valleys and northern lowlands. The Elikchan sites indicate that thermokarst processes continued throughout the Middle and Late Holocene, with the development of small ponds in the middle of ice-wedge polygons, their subsequent expansion to form thermokarst lakes, the periodic drainage or migration of these lakes, and the intermittent formation of stable surfaces as indicated by soil development. The arrival of Pinus pumila in the region-10,000 cal BP suggests an increase in snow cover, a change that would enhance ground insulation, deepen the active layer, and increase permafrost thaw. Although such conditions might favor another interval of peat growth, peat accumulation apparently occurred only during the Early Holocene in the Elikchan region. Modern permafrost-vegetation-climate studies and sensitivity experiments using a Beringian paleoclimate model underscore the importance of seasonality when trying to unravel the complex climate and vegetation feedbacks that have influenced and will continue to affect permafrost landscapes.																			1040-6182	1873-4553				APR 10	2022	616						87	98		10.1016/j.quaint.2021.12.011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.12.011		MAR 2022											WOS:000766574900002

Algal contamination of Victorian waterways is now a widespread annual occurrence and, in some regions, the intersection of blooms and commercial fishing threatens the food safety of large numbers of people. Toxin levels which produce no observed adverse effect in animal studies were used to derive safe tolerable daily intake levels. These 'acceptable levels' were then modified to protect against potential acute health risks associated with short-term exposures. National food surveys were used to derive likely seafood intakes and thus, in combination with 'safe toxin levels', health alert levels for seafood were formulated. During the summer of 2001 a bloom of Nodularia spumigena occurred in the Gippsland Lakes area of Southern Victoria. During the bloom, seafood samples were collected and nodularin concentrations were estimated. Nodularin concentrations reached levels of concern in mussels and in prawn viscera at cell counts as low as 30,000 cells/ml. Nodularin concentrations in the flesh of finfish remained low. Boiling the seafood redistributed toxin between viscera and flesh. The results were used to restrict some seafood harvesting. (C) 2001 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The framework uses empirical orthogonal functions and Bayesian kriging to identify the spatially varying temporal pattern and estimate the distribution of hypoxia, including estimation uncertainty. A prototype web application is also developed in R. The framework is applied to analyze spatio-temporal dynamics of DO in the central basin of Lake Erie in North America using data sampled from a logger network placed on the lake bottom during the summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Cross-validation results demonstrate that the framework is capable of capturing the dynamic nature of bottom hypoxia over offshore areas, but nearshore areas have poor interpolation performance due to the impacts of complex physical processes such as seiche events. The findings showed that in the central basin, hypoxia started to emerge in early August of 2014, while in 2015 and 2016 hypoxia began in July. The peak hypoxia extent occurred in late September 2014, mid-August 2015, and early September 2016. The prediction error of the overall spatial extent of hypoxia was as large as 25% of the interpolation area based on current logger deployment. Based on the cross-validation and interpolation error, we suggest placing more loggers in nearshore areas to reduce prediction error near the margins of the hypoxic zone.

The greatest change in bacterioplankton abundance was between 1989 (1.48 x 10(9)/L 0.06 SE) and 1990 (1.14 X 10(9)/L +/- 0.06 SE). The majority of bacterial cells (65%) were cocci. Individual cells were larger during 1989 (0.067 mu m(3) +/- 0.007 SE) than 1990 (0.025um(3) +/- 0.002 SE). Although the rate of thymidine incorporation varied from 0.2 to 47.0 pmol/Uh over both years (mean = 12.1 pmol/L/h +/- 1.3 SE), no consistent temporal or spatial changes were detected. Bacteria were more abundant (similar to 2x) and productive (similar to Ox) at the mouth of the Lester River than offshore of this site. During July and August, a benthic nepheloid layer (BNL) formed at shallow offshore sites but bacterioplankton abundance and production in this BNL were usually similar to values measured in the hypolimnion. Three additional sites from the Duluth basin northeast to the Chefswet basin were sampled during late summer (Aug-Sept) 1990 to identify. spatial differences in bacterioplankton communities. Although the number of bacteria was often greater at shallower sites compared to deeper sites further offshore, a strong gradient was not found and bacterial production was similar at all sites. These results may be due in part to the lake basin morphology in this region of Lake Superior, as well as the time when these additional offshore sites were investigated.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			196	213		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70386-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70386-X													WOS:000227991500014
J	Wauer, G; Teien, HC				Wauer, Gerlinde; Teien, Hans-Christian			Risk of acute toxicity for fish during aluminium application to hardwater lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												To assess the risk of aluminium (Al) toxicity during the restoration of the eutrophic lake Tiefwarensee by hypolimnetic addition of NaAl(OH)(4)-solution (aluminate) the generally limnological monitoring was accompanied by fractionation of Al in water and using Al accumulation on fish gills as bioindicator. The concentration of reactive Al species in the alkaline water (pH 8) peaked at 2 mg L(-1) in parts of the anoxic hypolimnion and was 0.088 +/- 0.053 mg L(-1) (n = 70) in the epilimnion during the five years of treatment. During an Al treatment cycle in summer 2003, perches showed significant Al accumulation on gills (100 mu g Al g(-1) dw) whereas roaches, breams and silver carps remained unaffected. Thus, the Al toxicity towards several fish species seems to be low, although the concentration of reactive Al in the lake water increased by a factor of 2. However, high Al toxicity due to lake treatment with aluminate could not be excluded, as high Al-gill concentration was observed. An Al balance two years after the treatment indicates complete export of the added Al into the sediment. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Peipsi) in north-eastern Europe, detailed surface-sediment mapping was conducted. On the basis of grain size the surface sediments fall into three groups: coarse-grained sediments (prevailingly sands in the lake's southern part), fine-grained sediments (mainly silts) and silty sands, both in the central deeper part within the 8-m depth contour. The groups of deposits have a distinct spatial distribution, determined mainly by the current system in the lake. The main source of bottom sediments is the erosion of the lake floor and shores, the role of the river input seems to be limited. Fine-grained organic-rich sediments are very cohesive, playing the main role in the circulation of various inorganic and organic pollutants like nutrients and xenobiotics. Due to the cohesive character of the sediments their physical and chemical properties are extremely diverse and if the near-bottom shear stress increases (extreme meteorological events, changes in the water level, etc.), the lake floor may be subjected to episodic erosion and resuspension, which may cause remobilisation of impurities in muddy sediments and their return to the food chain.					; Vaasma, Tiit/LIF-3190-2024; Terasmaa, Jaanus/E-7077-2018	Vaasma, Tiit/0009-0003-4483-1471; Terasmaa, Jaanus/0000-0002-1346-6411													0943-0105					APR	2009	57	4					943	951		10.1007/s00254-008-1378-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-008-1378-x													WOS:000264174100019

Here, we present palynological results of a 4.30-m-long sediment record collected from Koucha Lake in the Bayan Har Mountains, northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Vegetation change has been traced by biomisation, ordination of pollen data, and calculation of pollen ratios. The application of a pollen-climate calibration set from the eastern Tibetan Plateau to Koucha Lake pollen spectra yielded quantitative climate information. The area was covered by alpine desert/steppe, characteristic of a cold and dry climate (with 50% less precipitation than today) between 16,700 and 14,600 cal yr BP. Steppe vegetation, warm (similar to 1 degrees C higher than today) and wet conditions prevailed between 14,600 and 6600 cal yr BR These findings contradict evidence from other monsoon-influenced areas of Asia, where the early Holocene is thought to have been moist. Low effective moisture on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau was likely due to high temperature and evaporation, even though precipitation levels may have been similar to present-day values. The vegetation changed to tundra around 6600 cal yr BP, indicating that wet and cool climate conditions occurred on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the second half of the Holocene.

J	McKinnell, S				McKinnell, Skip			Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity and climate: A re-analysis that avoids an undesirable property of Ricker's curve	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY					Symposium on Climate Variability and Ecosystem Impacts on the North Pacific - A Basin-Scale Synthesis	APR 19-21, 2006	Honolulu, HI	PICES, GLOBEC Int				In descending order of importance, artificial spawning channels, density-dependent mortality, carryover mortality, and climate have significant influences on the average productivity of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). When factors that are known or have been hypothesized to affect Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity are included in a single analytical framework, no significant change in average productivity occurred in 1976/1977, however, beginning in 1989 average productivity was significantly lower. In the one lake (Chilko) in the Fraser River basin where pre-smolt survival can be distinguished from post-smolt survival, this decline arose from freshwater causes. After accounting for other factors that have a greater influence, Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity tends to be slightly lower in years when the intensity of the Aleutian low pressure region is stormier in winter, although the effect is not strongly expressed in any particular population. A footnote to the study was the realization that estimates of Ricker's density-dependent mortality parameter, beta, are influenced by both the numerical properties of the equation and by population biology: density-dependent and density-independent influences on the estimates of the parameter are confounded.

J	Hämäläinen, H; Luotonen, H; Koskenniemi, E; Liljaniemi, P				Hämäläinen, H; Luotonen, H; Koskenniemi, E; Liljaniemi, P			Inter-annual variation in macroinvertebrate communities in a shallow forest lake in eastern Finland during 1990-2001	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limnol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian				As a part of the Integrated Monitoring (IM) Programme of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems, the macroinvertebrate community of a pristine forest lake was monitored from 1990 up to the present. Lake Iso Hietajarvi is a small and shallow, weakly stratified oligotrophic headwater lake situated in Patvinsuo National Park, eastern Finland. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled annually, once in autumn at depths of 3 - 4 m (sublittoral zone) and at 7 in (profundal zone). The water quality of the lake and meteorological characteristics in the area were monitored during the same period. The inter-annual variation in macroinvertebrate abundance and taxonomic composition in the lake unaffected by human activities is described, compared across depth zones and related to environmental variation. The annual variation in density and taxa richness was relatively small, being proportionately greater in the profundal zone. There was a considerable year-to-year variation in the abundance of common and dominant taxa. Most taxa were always few in number and occurred only occasionally - in 1 or 2 years - in both depth zones. The inter-annual community persistence (constancy of taxa occurrences) and stability (consistency of relative abundance of taxa) as measured by the Sorensen distance, were however, relatively high and generally greater in the sublittoral zone. The patterns of variation in density, taxa richness, abundance of dominant taxa and community persistence and stability were generally different in the two zones compared, and few correlations with the measured environmental variables were found. Inter-annual stability and persistence, however, closely traced the course of wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation index, suggesting that the rate of local community change may be linked with large-scale climatic variation in a subtle way. The implications of the results are discussed in the context of biomonitoring.

Combining records from lake sediments and ancient shorelines is effective for investigating paleolake evolution and predicating the lake life trend. This study explored the lake area evolution of Dali Lake using remote sensing images and optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. The results suggest the following: 1) on the century time scale, there has been a significant linear relationship between age and elevation from ca. 1.8 cal ka BP to the present (R2 = 0.99) and a potential quadratic polynomial relationship since ca. 4.2 cal ka BP (R2 = 0.99). 2) According to the 82H and 818O composition, monthly changes in the lake area, and water balance analysis, the groundwater was the main water source to recharge Dali Lake which originated from an external source, whereby the water may be from the Xar Moron Fault or has been transported by a volcanic conduit. 3) Since ca. 1.3 cal ka BP, the clear differences between lake levels and local precipitation indicated that the changes of the lake level are predominantly determined by groundwater. We conclude that the East Asian summer monsoon intensity and groundwater table variations in this area have jointly controlled the lake level evolution since the late Holocene.

S.; Markager, Stiig			Patterns of dark respiration in aquatic systems	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												We used continuous measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) in dark bottles to characterise patterns of the dark respiration rate (R-dark) for three marine phytoplankton monocultures and in natural-water samples from two marine coastal systems. Furthermore, patterns of ecosystem community respiration rate were determined from open-water changes in DO in a fjord and in a lake. We considered two models of R-dark to describe temporal changes in DO: constant R-dark and decreasing R-dark; increasing R-dark. In addition, the effect of incubation time on R-dark was investigated in bottle incubations. Constant R-dark was observed in short-term (12-h) bottle incubations in natural-water samples from two marine coastal systems. Declining R-dark was observed in marine phytoplankton cultures and open-water measurements in a lake. Increasing R-dark was observed in open-water measurements in a fjord, particularly during summer. Long-term (120-h) bottle incubations in natural-water samples showed an increase in R-dark after 48 and 72 h. We show that the conventional expectation of constant rates of respiration in darkness is far from typical, because non-linear changes are common under both controlled experimental conditions, as well as for open-water measurements of ecosystem respiration.					; Staehr, Peter Anton Upadhyay/S-6110-2018; Markager, Stiig/I-7587-2013; MANTIKCI, Mustafa/AAG-4535-2019; Staehr, Peter/S-6110-2018	MANTIKCI, Mustafa/0000-0002-9492-2166; Staehr, Peter Anton Upadhyay/0000-0002-1580-4875; Markager, Stiig/0000-0001-5427-2026; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2020	71	4					432	442		10.1071/MF18221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF18221													WOS:000526573200002

Toward more accurate temperature reconstructions based on oxygen isotopes of subfossil chironomid head-capsules in Australia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This study investigates the potential of applying stable oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) from head capsules (HCs) of subfossil chironomids (subfamily Tanypodinae) to reconstruct past temperature changes from south-eastern Australia. The study reports delta O-18 results from Tanypodinae HCs in nine lakes. The relationship between delta O-18 values of Tanypodinae HCs in lakes and summer (February) air temperature is robust (r=0.84) supporting its potential to be applied as a temperature proxy in the Australian region. The comparison of these results with the delta O-18 values measured on Chironomus spp. HCs from the same lakes reveals differences between the two groups. delta O-18 values of Tanypodinae HCs have a stronger correlation with the delta O-18 of lake water, delta O-18 of precipitation and air temperature as compared with Chironomus delta O-18 values. This suggests that Tanypodinae HCs are superior targets to Chironomus spp. for temperature reconstructions. Our data indicate that the delta O-18 of Tanypodinae HCs could perform as well as the assemblage based chironomid transfer function from the Australian mainland. We recommend analysis of HCs from additional lakes to develop a more robust calibration curve relating Tanypodinae HC delta O-18 to temperature.					; Chang, Jie/R-2763-2016; Grocke, Darren R./F-4799-2015; Shulmeister, James/J-2859-2015; shulmeister, james/J-2859-2015; Grocke, Darren/F-4799-2015	Woodward, Craig/0000-0003-1197-820X; Grocke, Darren R./0000-0003-2296-7530; shulmeister, james/0000-0001-5863-9462; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2018	63	1					295	307		10.1002/lno.10630	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10630													WOS:000423029300018

The two lakes represented the regional extremes: while Lake Laka (LA) was the least acidified among the Bohemian Forest lakes, Lake Certovo (CT) was the most acidified. Water chemistry improved downstream in either outlet due to mixing with less acidic water from tributaries. While pH of the LA stream was circumneutral and concentrations of ionic aluminium (Al-i) were low (< 50 mu g.l(-1)) except for temporary acidic episodes during snowmelt, the CT stream remained permanently acidified with Al-i concentrations (> 200 mu g.l(-1)) throughout the year and was considered as a reference site. Brown trout (Salmo trutta s.l.) survived in the LA stream already at 0.7 km from the lake. A stable trout population, including young-of-the-year fish increasing in numbers, was found in the LA stream between 2005 and 2010 despite the spring short-term acid episodes. Any recovery of the CT stream is unlikely as the outflow continued to be acidic at 1.5 km from the lake and Al-i concentrations were still by one order of magnitude higher than the limit acceptable by trout.					; Sorf, Michal/H-1330-2014; Blabolil, Petr/K-9548-2015; Vrba, Jaroslav/M-3780-2013; Šorf, Michal/H-1330-2014; Kopacek, Jiri/A-7373-2014	Blabolil, Petr/0000-0003-1344-9627; Sorf, Michal/0000-0002-9368-6421; Vrba, Jaroslav/0000-0003-2145-9024; Kopacek, Jiri/0000-0002-4409-4032; 													0139-7893	1573-1189				APR	2017	66	1					1	10																WOS:000402224100001

Evidence of global pollution and recent environmental change in Kamchatka, Russia	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Kamchatka is a remote, isolated and understudied area and is presumed to be pristine. Here we present the first high-resolution palaeolimnological investigation of the recent past. A short core representing the last 250 years was taken from Olive-backed Lake situated in central Kamchatka. Lead-210 dating revealed that sediment accumulation has increased at the site since the 1960s and may be related to greater rates of catchment erosion associated with wetter winters in the region. Mercury and spheroidal carbonaceous particle (an unambiguous indicator of fossil fuel combustion) concentrations are low but clearly detectable indicating that both regional and global pollution sources are observed at this site. The recent increase in the flux of mercury is more related to catchment sources and catchment erosion than increases from regional or global sources. The diatom and chironomid populations are stable and do not show any statistically significant changes related to either the low levels of pollution, or to temperature and precipitation changes. The lake is not pristine since anthropogenic contamination has occurred but since there have been no significant effects on the flora and fauna the lake can be considered to be unimpacted. Olive-backed Lake may be a suitable reference site to benchmark the natural variability of a lake ecosystem. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the tree-line, consisting of mountain birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. ssp. tortuosa (Ledeb.) Nyman), was 300-400 m above the present during the early and mid-Holocene. When the isostatic land up-lift is taken into account this reflects summer temperatures 1.5-2 degreesC higher than today. Expansion of mixed pine-birch forest took place 8300 cal BP in the eastern part of the Tornestrask area and about 700 years later in the western part at low altitudes. Optimal conditions for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) occurred during the mid-Holocene (6300-4500 cal BP) when mixed pine-birch forest reached 110 m and single pines reached 175 m above the present pine limit. The Holocene climate is interpreted as warm and moist during the early Holocene, warm and dry during the mid-Holocene, and finally cold and moist during the late Holocene.

To obtain a high-precision digital elevation model (DEM), calibration of the interferometric system parameters is necessary. Because InIRA utilizes the small-incidence interference system design, serious coupling occurs between the interferometric parameters. Commonly used interferometric calibration methods tend to fall into the local optimal solution for InIRA. Because evolutionary algorithms have a stronger robustness and global search ability, they are better suited to handling the solution space structure under the coupling of complex interferometric parameters. This article establishes an interferometric calibration optimization model for InIRA by utilizing the relative flatness of the lake surface as an inequality constraint. Furthermore, an adaptive penalty coefficient constraint evolutionary algorithm is designed to solve the model. The proposed method was tested on actual InIRA data, and the results indicate that it efficiently adjusts interferometric parameters, enhancing the precision of measurements for Qinghai Lake elevation.					; Wang, Yachao/ABU-7666-2022; li, lanyu/GSN-6045-2022; Tan, Hong/AAG-2065-2021	Li, Lanyu/0000-0003-1189-3820; Tan, Hong/0000-0002-5191-1731; Wang, Bingnan/0000-0002-7385-6171; Li, Lanyu/0000-0002-1596-2267														2072-4292				OCT	2023	15	19							4789	10.3390/rs15194789	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15194789													WOS:001081814000001

In coastal waters, it may occur in high abundances, is a potent predator on eggs and larvae of fish, and has been shown to induce trophic cascades with resulting eutrophication symptoms through regulation of invertebrate grazers. Despite its potential significance for the coastal food web, little is known about its life history and population ecology. This paper provides a description of life history traits, migration patterns and spatiotemporal development of the species in the Baltic Sea during the past decades, and tests the hypothesis that stickleback may have a negative impact on populations of coastal predatory fish. Offshore and coastal data during the last 30 years show that stickleback has increased fourfold in the Bothnian Sea, 45-fold in the Central Baltic Sea and sevenfold in the Southern Baltic Sea. The abundances are similar in the two northern basins, and two orders of magnitude lower in the Southern Baltic Sea. The coastward spawning migration of sticklebacks from offshore areas peaks in early May, with most spawners being two years of age at a mean length of 65 mm. The early juvenile stage is spent at the coast, whereafter sticklebacks perform a seaward feeding migration in early autumn at a size of around 35 mm. A negative spatial relation between the abundance of stickleback and early life stages of perch and pike at coastal spawning areas was observed in spatial survey data, indicating strong interactions between the species. A negative temporal relationship was observed also between adult perch and stickleback in coastal fish monitoring programmes supporting the hypothesis that stickleback may have negative population level effects on coastal fish predators. The recent increase in stickleback populations in different basins of the Baltic Sea in combination with negative spatiotemporal patterns and previously observed interactions between stickleback and coastal predatory fish suggests that this species may have gained a key role in the coastal food webs of the Baltic Sea. Through its migrations, stickleback may also constitute an important vector linking coastal and open sea ecosystem dynamics. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Over its geographic range, 4 VHSV genotypes and multiple subtypes exist. Here, we describe the development and validation of a rapid, sensitive and specific real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR assay (RT-qPCR) that amplifies sequence from representative isolates of all VHSV genotypes (I, II, III and IV). The pan-specific VHSV RT-qPCR assay reliably detects 100 copies of VHSV nucleoprotein RNA without cross-reacting with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, spring viremia of carp virus or aquatic birnavirus. Test performance characteristics evaluated on experimentally infected Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. revealed a diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) >= 93% and specificity (DSp) = 100%. The repeatability and reproducibility of the procedure was exceptionally high, with 93% agreement among test results within and between 2 laboratories. Furthermore, proficiency testing demonstrated the VHSV RT-qPCR assay to be easily transferred to and performed by a total of 9 technicians representing 4 laboratories in 2 countries. The assay performed equivalent to the traditional detection method of virus isolation via cell culture with the advantage of faster turnaround times and high throughput capacity, further suggesting the suitability of the use of this VHSV RT-qPCR in a diagnostic setting.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				JUN 16	2011	95	2					97	+		10.3354/dao02344	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao02344								21848118					WOS:000291820300002

Climate change modulates structural and functional lake ecosystem responses to introduced anadromous salmon	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We integrated limnological, paleolimnological, and fisheries analyses in Tuya Lake, British Columbia, Canada, to explore the effects and interactions of climate warming and sockeye salmon introductions on northern lake ecology. We tracked millennially unprecedented, climate-correlated changes in inferred lake production, stratification, and trophic structure since the mid-1800s, most likely resulting from declining ice cover and enhanced stratification. Post-1970s algal (diatom) species turnover, coeval across several remote northern Cordilleran lakes, marked an apparent increase in warming and the induction of inferred nitrogen deficiencies in Tuya Lake. Lower post-stocking phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and a strong P-modeled salmon biomass correlation (r(2) = 0.87) indicated salmon production reduced epilimnetic nutrient availability. Post-stocking chlorophyll reductions, late-summer algal dominance by heterocystous cyanobacteria and low-N-tolerant diatoms, and a strong chlorophyll-modeled salmon biomass correlation (r(2) = 0.87) indicated that salmon influenced lake productivity, most likely by enhancing climate-induced N-deficiencies. Predicted smolt-biomass nutrient exports were minimal, with post-introduction nutrient reductions likely related to planktivory and enhanced sedimentation losses. Our study highlights how climate warming changes northern lake ecosystem structure and functioning, influencing responses to subsequent stresses.

The relationship between principal macroinvertebrate species and environmental variables was analysed in order to explore factors that dominantly affect community distribution pattern. Unlike the most reservoirs, strong longitudinal gradient for suspended organic matter and nutrients (total phosphorous, nitrates and nitrites) along the reservoir doesn't exist. However, the process of thermal stratification has a strong influence on the metabolism and structure of the Mantovo ecosystem, which can be demonstrated by the vertical and longitudinal distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO), CO2, pH and metals concentrations. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicated that the main factors controlling spatial distribution of Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Chironomus plumosus group were temperature, dissolved oxygen and manganese, including sulphates for C. plumous group. Chaoborus crystallinus showed opposite distribution pattern. Cladotanytarsus mancus group was strongly associated with shallower part (littoral and sublittoral) of Mantovo Reservoir characterized by favourable oxygen condition.

Biodiversity in eutrophicated shallow lakes: determination of tipping points and tools for monitoring	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nutrient-rich freshwater ecosystems are generally considered as having low ecological quality and low associated biodiversity. In such systems we analysed the effects of water quality on biodiversity of several species groups, to determine tipping points and tools for monitoring. We investigated the water quality of 99 eutrophic and hypertrophic shallow lakes with extensive fish culture during a 3-year study, through the measures of physico-chemical parameters, phytoplankton biomass and structure. In a second step, we related the water quality with richness of aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates and dragonflies. With concentrations of chlorophyll-a above 30 or 70 mu g l(-1), shallow lakes are normally classified, respectively, in a poor or bad ecological state. However, our results show that chlorophyll-a concentrations up to 78 mu g l(-1) could be found together with relatively high species or family richness of aquatic plants, invertebrates and dragonflies. We identified most tipping points with 50-60 mu g l(-1) of chlorophyll-a, values above which a significant decrease of species diversity was found. For monitoring of these shallow lakes we propose to use chlorophyll-a concentrations in combination with water transparency during spring. These parameters are easily applicable and cheap and they yield a good forecast of the biodiversity for the species groups studied.					; bornette, gudrun/J-6404-2017; Oertli, Beat/GXV-4967-2022; Rosset, Veronique/J-6306-2012	Oertli, Beat/0000-0002-8372-9045; bornette, gudrun/0000-0002-2242-0060; Wezel, Alexander/0000-0001-5088-5087													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2014	723	1					63	75		10.1007/s10750-013-1678-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1678-3													WOS:000327896400006

Wastewater treatment at the Houghton Lake wetland: Temperatures and the energy balance	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This paper describes the temperatures in surface water and soils in a very long-running study of the capacity of a natural peatland to remove nutrients from treated wastewater. Two zones were found, an adaptation zone near the discharge to the wetland, and a background zone comprised of areas more than about 100 m from the discharge. The discharge zone was transformed to a floating mat during the 30-year course of the project. Strong diurnal cycles in surface water temperatures were measured, with a median daily swing of about 6-10 degrees C. Pumped waterwas a few degrees warmer than the wetland background, and was reduced in temperature by passage through the adaptation zone. The time constants for adaptation (63% of change) were approximately one-half to 1 day. Soil temperatures followed a cyclic pattern, with decreasing amplitude with depth, and a time delay increasing with depth. The seasonal surface maximum was about 18 degrees C. The irrigation season started on May 1, with water at 10 degrees C, and ended in early October, with water at 10 degrees C. The soil conduction model was used to infer cyclic surface temperatures, with a smoothed result compared to synoptic temperature measurements in surface water. Background zone fitting parameters were the Julian day of surface maximum temperature (196), mean temperature (7.9 degrees C), surface amplitude (10.3 degrees C), and penetration depth (1.0 m). Soil heat fluxes were vertically downward during the warm season, and backup toward the surface with maxima of 1.4 MJ/m(2) din the discharge zone. This vertical soil heat flux was of small importance to the summer energy budget, which was dominated by solar radiation and evaporative cooling. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Phosphorus loss potential and phosphatase activities in paddy soils	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT												The effects of phosphorus (P) fertilizer on P loss potential, soil Olsen-P and neutral phosphatase activities in paddy soils fertilized with superphosphate or pig manure (PM) were evaluated in this paper. Data were collected from a field experiment in the Tai Lake Basin, China. Superphosphate rates were 0, 17.5, 26.7, and 35.0 kg P/ha, and PM rates were 0, 1.4, 2.1, and 2.8 t/ha for each crop, respectively. Soil Olsen-P in the plow layer increased to a greater extent with PM than with superphosphate. Pig manure increased neutral phosphatase activities in the plow layer compared with PM-free treatment. In contrast, superphosphate inhibited neutral phosphatase activities compared with superphosphate-free treatment. Spring application of P fertilizer markedly increased the total P of surface water in November (< 0.01 vs. 0.10 mg/L) compared with P-free treatment. The total P of shallow groundwater at a 75 cm depth was similar to 0.01 mg/L. Phosphorus fertilizer did not influence Olsen-P or neutral phosphatase activities under the plow layer. Downward movement of P did not occur. Appropriate rate of P application of 26.2 kg P/ha for each crop in this soil reduced the risk of P loss in the paddy wetland ecosystem.

Impact of Lake Breezes on Summer Ozone Concentrations in the Salt Lake Valley	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												During the late afternoon of 18 June 2015, ozone concentrations in advance of a strong lake-breeze front arising from the Great Salt Lake in northern Utah were; 20 ppb lower than those in its wake. The lake-breeze progression and ozone concentrations in the valley were monitored by an enhanced observation network that included automated weather stations, a nearby Terminal Doppler Weather Radar, state air quality measurement sites, and mobile platforms, including a news helicopter. Southerly flow opposing the lake breeze increased convergent frontogenesis and delayed the onset of its passage through the Salt Lake valley. Ozone concentrations were exceptionally high aloft at the lake-breeze frontal boundary. The progression of this lake breeze was simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model at 1-km horizontal grid spacing over northern Utah. The model was initialized using hourly analyses from the High Resolution Rapid Refresh model. Errors in the underlying surface initialization were improved by adjusting the areal extent and surface temperature of the lake to observed lake conditions. An urban canopy parameterization is also included. The opposing southerly flow was weaker in the simulation than that observed such that the simulated lake-breeze front occurred too early. Continuous passive tracers initialized within and ahead of the lake breeze highlight the dispersion and transport of pollutants arising from the lake-breeze front. Tracers within the lake breeze are confined near the surface while tracers in advance of the front are lofted over it.

Orbital- and millennial-scale vegetation and climate changes of the past 225 ka from Bear Lake, Utah-Idaho (USA)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Continuous high-resolution pollen data for the past 225 ka from sediments in Bear Lake, Utah-Idaho reflect changes in vegetation and climate that correlate well with variations in summer insolation and global ice-volume during MIS 1 through 7. Spectral analysis of the pollen data identified peaks at 21-22 and 100 ka corresponding to periodicities in Earth's precession and eccentricity orbital cycles. Suborbital climatic fluctuations recorded in the pollen data, denoted by 6 and 5 ka cyclicities, are similar to Greenland atmospheric temperatures and North Atlantic ice-rafting Heinrich events. Our results show that millennial-scale climate variability is also evident during MIS 5 6 and 7, including the occurrence of Heinrich-like events in MIS 6, showing the long-term feature of such climate variability. This study provides clear evidence of a highly interconnected ocean-atmosphere system during the last two glacial/interglacial cycles that extended its influence as far as continental western North America. Our study also contributes to a greater understanding of the impact of long-term climate change on vegetation of western North America. Such high-resolution studies are particularly important in efforts of the scientific community to predict the consequences of future climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study was based on more than 3000 archived temperature profiles amassed over a 25-year period for lakes ranging from 2 ha to 8 million ha in surface area. The incidence of transient thermoclines decreased with increasing lake size from 90% of all summer days in small lakes (less than 4 ha) to 40% or less in the larger NOLSS lakes (up to 34,700 ha). No transient near-surface thermoclines were detected in Lake Superior. Forest fires and climatic variability were also found to affect the frequency of nearsurface thermoclines. Long-term trends indicate an increase in average annual wind velocity in the area, possibly as the result of extensive forest fires and clearcutting. The subsequent decrease in the frequency of shallow secondary thermoclines in aquatic ecosystems has possible consequences for the lake biota, as the result of changes in radiation, turbulence, and the nutrient regime.

Cheumatopsyche pettiti, Hydropsyche betteni, and Hydropsyche sparna (Hydropsychidae) are univoltine, whereas Chimarra aterrima (Philopotamidae) is generally bivoltine. The emergence patterns of C. pettiti and C. aterrima are influenced by the regime of precipitations and the water temperature in early summer. Emergence collections reflect the distribution of larvae of the last instar. The microdistribution of the larvae changes during their growth. The four species partition the available space: the larvae of Chimarra aterrima live in a particular microhabitat (the underpart of rocks and artificial substrates), Hydropsyche sparna inhabits the downstream portion of the outlet, whereas the two other species of Hydropsychidae prefer the area immediately below the lake. Cheumatopsyche pettiti and Hydropsyche betteni inhabit similar microhabitats but their period of maximum production is temporally offset.

In Trondheim municipality, in the middle part of Norway, roach was introduced into the Ila watercourse in 1881. Roach has a great potential to alter the ecosystem when introduced to new locations. The potential negative impact on potable water source quality and the prospect of permanently eradicating an alien species resulted in rotenone treatment of six lakes in Trondheim municipality. The rotenone concentration in the lakes was surveyed by water sampling until it could no longer be detected. A lethal concentration of rotenone at all test points was measured in all lakes during the survey period. Fourteen days after treatment, a near homogenous concentration was reached. The concentration reduction was similar in the lakes and relatively quicker during the first weeks after treatment. It was also consistent between depths except for the surface, where the concentration degraded more quickly. Rotenone degradation is a key factor when planning eradication efforts, and reports on this varies considerably between different locations. Despite application of rotenone in different depth strata, it took several days to reach homogenous concentration and several months and a fall turnover for the rotenone to break down and dilute below the detection limit in the lakes described.																			1989-8649					MAR	2022	13	1					233	245		10.3391/mbi.2022.13.1.14	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2022.13.1.14													WOS:000755785800013
J	Stiller, M; Rosenbaum, JM; Nishri, A				Stiller, M.; Rosenbaum, J. M.; Nishri, A.			The origin of brines underlying Lake Kinneret	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Lake Kinneret (LK) is a relatively fresh water take situated in the Dead Sea Rift (DSR) Valley. The pore water (PW) in the sediments underlying LK pelagic zone have significantly higher salinity than that of the lake. The concentrations of major ion solutes (Cl, Br, Na, K, Mg) in PW from six 2.4 m to 5.1 m long sediment cores increase linearly with depth, indicating the occurrence of saline, deep seated brines. The upper part of the PW column is affected by the much fresher boundary with LK water and in most cores is characterized by gradually increasing Br/Cl and decreasing Na, Mg, K/Cl molar ratios, which tend to stabilize at about 2.0 m below the sediment surface. The 'stable' molar ratios in the deeper PW vary spatially and are supposed to represent the ratios in the deep underlying brines at each site. When plotted as Na/Cl vs. Br/Cl, the stable ratios of the northern and central part of the lake fall close to a straight line which characterizes many of the brines in the DSR Valley. However, the respective ratios in the southern part of the lake fall markedly off the DSR line. Moreover, Na/Cl and K/Cl molar ratios in the south are significantly higher than in the central and northern parts. delta Cl-37 measured in present LK water is ca. 0.0 parts per thousand. Along the PW column at the lake center, delta Cl-37 is becoming more positive with depth, reaching values of about +0.5 parts per thousand to +0.6 parts per thousand at 3 m depth. Even more positive values (+0.7 parts per thousand to +0.8 parts per thousand) are detected further north, in PW from deeper sediment layers. In contrast, in PW from the southeastern part of the lake, delta Cl-37 is becoming more negative with depth (-1.0 parts per thousand at similar to 2.6 m). It is suggested that these isotopic differences are also indicative of spatial variability in the PW brine sources. O-18 and D values in the PW of all 3 m long cores are similar and resemble the respective levels in LK. The source of H2O in 3 m deep, bed sediments is claimed to be the overlying lake water, and therefore water isotopes do not provide a clue regarding the original water isotopic composition in the underlying brines. PW from the southeast with higher K/Cl and Na/Cl but lower concentrations of these solutes, suggest leaching by meteoric water of sub-surface halite and post-halite salt formations, while the more saline PW from the northern and central parts, that have lower K/Cl and Na/Cl, and higher Br/Cl, are similar to DSR brines and represent underlying residual brines.

J	Sorokin, DY; Kuenen, JG				Sorokin, DY; Kuenen, JG			Haloalkaliphilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in soda lakes	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS												The existence of chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) capable of growth in an extremely alkaline and saline environment has not been recognized until recently. Extensive studies of saline, alkaline (soda) lakes located in Central Asia, Africa and North America have now revealed the presence, at relatively high numbers, of a new branch of obligately autotrophic SOB in these doubly extreme environments. Overall more than 100 strains were isolated in pure culture. All of them have the potential to grow optimally at around pH 10 in media strongly buffered with sodium carbonate/bicarbonate and cannot grow at pH < 7.5 and Na+ concentration < 0.2 M. The majority of the isolates fell into two distinct groups with differing phylogeny and physiology, that have been described as two new genera in the Gammaproteobacteria; Thioalkalimicrobium and Thioalkalivibrio. The third genus, Thioalkalispira, contains a single obligate microaerophilic species T. microaerophila. The Thioalkalimicrobium group represents a typical opportunistic strategy, including highly specialized, relatively fast-growing and low salt-tolerant bacteria, dominating in hyposaline steppe soda lakes of Central Asia. The genus Thioalkalivibrio includes mostly slowly growing species better adapted to life in hypersaline conditions and with a more versatile metabolism. It includes denitrifying, thiocyanate-utilizing and facultatively alkaliphilic species. (c) 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Davies, GR				Davies, GR			Aeolian sedimentation and bypass, Triassic of western Canada	BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Triassic succession in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin contains extensive evidence, both direct and indirect, for an aeolian influence on sedimentation. Paleogeographic and paleoclimatic reconstructions for western Canada in Triassic time show that northeast trade winds would have been the expected prevailing wind system during the arid summer season. This is confirmed by southwesterly dip of crossbeds in dune sands in the Charlie Lake Formation, particularly when corrected for Triassic plate rotation. A west-flowing jetstream may also have influenced sediment transport, similar to northwest Africa today. Arid coastal and inland desert or semidesert conditions provided a source for "desert loess" (silt fines) and very fine sand. Specific evidence for aeolian processes in the Triassic of western Canada includes bimodal or coarse-grained deflation lags in the Montney, Charlie Lake, Baldonnel and Pardonet formations and crossbedded dune sands in the Artex Member and other members of the Charlie Lake Formation. In addition (and more conjecturally), thick accumulations of relatively well sorted siltstones in the Montney, Baldonnel and Pardonet formations, and probably in all other Triassic units, may have formed at least in part by fallout from aeolian suspension ("loessite" model). For the Montney at least, basinward aeolian sediment bypass is suggested by the presence of coarse-grained aeolian deflation lags at the tops of some lowstand coquinal units. By comparison with Quaternary analogues of aeolian-marine turbidite sands in the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of northwest Africa (offshore Saharan Desert) and in at least two other west-facing continental margin settings, bypassed well sorted aeolian silts and sands may have contributed to the formation of turbidites and extensive fluidized/downslope-displaced sandstones and siltstones in the Montney. The limited fine grain size, high detrital dolomite and feldspar composition, and high degree of sorting of many very fine-grained sandstones and siltstones in the Montney and in other Triassic units, are all consistent with aeolian source and transport mechanisms and also have direct impact on reservoir quality and petrophysical log characteristics.																			0007-4802					DEC	1997	45	4					624	642																WOS:000071755800013

Despite extensive watershed protection efforts, reservoirs can still experience seasonal, elevated total coliform bacteria concentrations, indicator bacteria commonly used for regulations. This study aimed to understand associations between concentrations of total coliform and an array of water quality, soil, and meteorological parameters over 10 years to identify potential causes and correlations of elevated total coliform bacteria concentrations in a protected watershed and clear, oligotrophic waters. Leveraging long-term data, we performed extensive data analysis and a data-driven model to investigate these relationships in the Quabbin Reservoir (Massachusetts, USA). Data analysis and data-driven modeling results indicated that proxies of algae, organic matter, and dry conditions, as well as water temperature and dissolved oxygen, were most associated with increased total coliforms in the reservoir. Although indicator bacteria such as total coliform are frequently used for routine monitoring, our findings highlight that it was unlikely that their proliferation is indicating a likely elevated risk in the reservoir. The studied reservoir has pristine water quality with low variability and low fecal bacteria indicator levels with no sign of external contamination; therefore, the high concentrations of total coliform bacteria in the summer is likely an autochthonous process. Additionally, applying machine learning methods to leverage long-term routine data collected by monitoring agencies highlights opportunities to better understand how to maintain high-quality surface water in drinking water supply reservoirs through a rapidly changing climate.

J	Saylor, JE; Mora, A; Horton, BK; Nie, JS				Saylor, Joel E.; Mora, Andres; Horton, Brian K.; Nie, Junsheng			Controls on the isotopic composition of surface water and precipitation in the Northern Andes, Colombian Eastern Cordillera	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Empirical datasets provide the constraints on the variability and causes of variability in stable isotope compositions (delta D or delta O-18) of surface water and precipitation that are essential not only for models of modern and past climate but also for investigations of paleoelevation. This study presents stable isotope data for 76 samples from four elevation transects and three IAEA GNIP stations in the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia and the northern Andean foreland. These data are largely consistent with theories of stable isotope variability developed based on a global dataset. On a monthly basis, the precipitation-amount effect exerts the dominant control on delta D-p and delta O-18(p) values at the IAEA GNIP stations. At the Bogota station (2547 m), the delta D-p and delta O-18(p) values vary seasonally, with isotopic minima correlating with maxima in precipitation-amount. Although surface water samples from Eastern Cordilleran streams and rivers fall on the Global Meteoric Water Line, samples from three of four lakes (2842-3459 m) have evaporatively elevated delta D-sw and delta O-18(sw) values. The IAEA GNIP station data averaged over multiple years, combined with stream and river water data, de. ne vertical lapse rates of -1.8 parts per thousand km(-1) for Delta delta O-18 and -14.6 parts per thousand km(-1) for Delta delta D, and are a close fit to a common thermodynamically based Rayleigh distillation model. Elevation uncertainties for these relationships are also evaluated. Comparison of this Colombian dataset with the elevation uncertainties generated by the thermodynamically based model shows that the model underestimates uncertainty at high Delta delta O-18 and Delta delta D values while overestimating it for low Delta delta O-18 and Delta delta D values. This study presents an independent, empirical assessment of stable isotope-based elevation uncertainties for the northern Andes based on a dataset of sufficient size to ensure statistical integrity. These vertical lapse rates and associated uncertainties form the basis for stable isotope paleoelevation studies in the northern Andes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	MATVEEV, VF				MATVEEV, VF			SELF-MAINTAINING PLANKTON - PELAGIC CLADOCERA IN SMALL MICROCOSMS WITH LAKE WATER	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Monospecific and mixed populations of pelagic cladocerans, Daphnia galeata, Bosmina coregoni, and Diaphanosoma brachyurum of Lake Glubokoe (Moscow Region) were isolated in 0.6 litre flasks with their natural medium - epilimnion water. In the laboratory they persisted for more than 100 days without external additions of food until the experiment was stopped. In three-species cultures Diaphanosoma was outcompeted, but in the presence of only Bosmina it persisted. Daphnia coexisted with Bosmina in two- and three-species cultures the whole period of observations in spite of competition. Birth and death rates of animals in microcosms depended on their density indicating that experimental conditions did not spoil natural population regulation. Demographic time lags underlay the observed oscillations in numbers. Because the time of Cladocera persistence in the cultures was comparable with lake vegetational period I conclude that summer zooplankton is capable of existing solely at the expense of nutrient recycling within epilimnion. Density regulation of cladocerans reinforces the stability of the system 'herbivore - algae', but it is weakened by the demographic time lags.

Leaf Wax Hydrogen Isotopes as a Hydroclimate Proxy in the Tropical Pacific	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Hydrogen isotope ratios of sedimentary leaf waxes (delta H-2(Wax) values) are increasingly used to reconstruct past hydroclimate. Here, we add delta H-2(Wax) values from 19 lakes and four swamps on 15 tropical Pacific islands to an updated global compilation of published data from surface sediments and soils. Globally, there is a strong positive linear correlation between delta H-2 values of mean annual precipitation (delta H-2(P) values) and the leaf waxes n-C-29-alkane (R-2 = 0.74, n = 665) and n-C-28-acid (R-2 = 0.74, n = 242). Tropical Pacific delta H-2(Wax) values fall within the predicted range of values based on the global calibration, and the largest residuals from the global regression line are no greater than those observed elsewhere, despite large uncertainties in delta H-2(P) values at some Pacific sites. However, tropical Pacific delta H-2(Wax) values in isolation are not correlated with estimated delta H-2(P) values from isoscapes or from isotope-enabled general circulation models. Palynological analyses from these same Pacific sediment samples suggest no systematic relationship between any particular type of pollen distribution and deviations from the global calibration line. Rather, the poor correlations observed in the tropical Pacific are likely a function of the small range of delta H-2(P) values relative to the typical residuals around the global calibration line. Our results suggest that delta H-2(Wax) values are currently most suitable for use in detecting large changes in precipitation in the tropical Pacific and elsewhere, but that ample room for improving this threshold exits in both improved understanding of delta H-2 variability in plants, as well as in precipitation.					; Langdon, Peter/B-4682-2013; Sear, David/J-6333-2012; Ladd, S.

C.; Garcia-Veigas, Javier			Influence of magmatic-hydrothermal activity on brine evolution in closed basins: Searles Lake, California	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Evaporites in a 700-m-long core (KM-3) from Searles Lake, California, preserve a record of the chemical evolution of inflow waters. Chemical analyses of fluid inclusions in halite and evaporite minerals show that the major ion composition of inflow waters to Searles Lake was changed by distant hydrothermal activity associated with magmatism at Long Valley caldera between 1.27 and 1.0 m.y. ago. Below core depths of 291 m, the evaporites consist of Ca-bearing sulfates (anhydrite, glauberite) and halite; fluid inclusions in the halite show that parent waters were Na+-Cl--SO42--rich waters. Above 291 m, the evaporites include sodium carbonates (pirssonite, trona) and halite, and fluid inclusion brines are Na+-K+-HCO3--CO32--Cl--SO42--rich. These fluctuations in mineralogy and brine chemistry document an alkalinity spike beginning between 1.27 and 1.0 Ma, when inflow waters to Searles Lake crossed the CaCO3 chemical divide and began to produce alkaline brines that precipitated trona upon evaporation. The Owens River is a modern chemical analog for inflow water into Searles Lake beginning between 1.27 Ma and 1.0 Ma. A major contributor of solutes to the Owens River is Hot Creek in Long Valley caldera, which is fed by hydrothermal springs with high alkalinity from magmatically derived CO2. The timing of magmatism in Owens Valley and the appearance of sodium carbonate minerals in core km-3 suggest a causal relationship. Volcanism and hydrothermal activity provided CO2 and elevated alkalinity to Searles Lake inflow waters 0.5-0.2 m.y. before the eruptions that formed the Bishop Tuff and Long Valley caldera.

Reliable long time-series of water temperature are rare. Here, we investigated how a numerical model can fill the gaps in heterogeneous time-series and make it possible to identify a significant trend in the lake thermal regime. We computed the mean water temperature and the Schmidt stability, an indicator of the stratification strength, in a deep and well-stratified lake (Lake Bourget, France), between 1976 and 2008. We first used temperature measurements and then a one-dimensional vertical model, which we describe here. The model performs as well as the best existing models. During the 1976-2008 periods, whereas no statistically significant trend came out of the measurements, we found in the simulation results an increase of 0.12 A degrees C per decade in the water temperature and of 5.9 days per decade in the stratification duration. This shows that the temperature history of a lake can be reconstructed and a reliable long-term trend computed when weather data and a calibrated temperature model are available. Our results also suggest that different local climatic influences cause a slower warming in this lake of the south-western Alps than in other sub-alpine lakes.

JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The distribution of egg strands of perch Perca fluviatilis and factors affecting this distribution, in terms of spawning sites and spawning depths used, was studied in spring 2010 in Chabarovice Lake, Czech Republic, using areas with an artificial spawning substrate (ASS.) and control areas outside the ASS. Perch significantly preferred a calm shore instead of a windward shore for spawning. The depths at which perch egg strands were found increased significantly during the spawning period in both A.S.S. areas and in areas outside the A.S.S. (on average from 4.9 m at the beginning to 12.3 m at the end of the spawning period). With increasing depth of deposition the size of the egg strands decreased significantly. The mean depth of egg strands on individual dates corresponded to the position of 10-12 degrees C water layers. From the third week onward, however, egg strands were deposited in much deeper and colder water A strong relationship was found between the depth at which egg strands were deposited and the duration of the daylight period, indicating that, at the end of the spawning season, perch do not react to the actual temperature of the water column but that they follow their inner clock, assuming that "normally" the shallower depth layers are too warm for successful embryo development. Factors influencing the depth distribution of egg strands were identified as waves, temperature and duration of the daylight period. Factors influencing the selection of spawning sites were identified as wind inducing current, internal seiches and temperature instability of the water column. The first perch larvae were present in the open water of Chabarovice Lake before mid-May, and the latest larvae not earlier than the beginning of July since warming of the water in deeper layers was very slow It appears that with prolonged spawning and hatching periods and with spawning occurring at various depths and temperatures, perch have evolved a powerful mechanism to protect their population against the vagaries of the weather and temporary bad biological conditions in the lake.

J	McSween, HY; Harvey, RP				McSween, HY; Harvey, RP			An evaporation model for formation of carbonates in the ALH84001 Martian meteorite	INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW												Small, discoid globules and networks of magnesium-iron-calcium carbonates occur within impact-produced fracture zones in the ALH84001 Martian meteorite. Because these carbonates contain or are associated with the hydrocarbons, single-domain magnetite and iran-sulfide grains, and purported microfossils that collectively have been cited as evidence for ancient Martian life, it is critically important to understand their formation. Previous hypotheses for the origin of the carbonates involve either alteration of the rock by hydrothermal fluids at relatively low temperatures, or formation from a CO2-rich vapor at high temperatures. This paper explores an alternative mechanism-direct precipitation from a ponded evaporating brine infiltrating into fractures in the floor of an impact crater. Such a model can be reconciled with the observed carbonate compositional zoning and extreme stable-isotopic fractionations. If the carbonates formed in this manner, this removes a possible obstacle to the proposed existence of microbial remains in ALH84001; however, the cited evidence for Life can be better explained by inorganic processes expected from brines in an evaporating alkaline lake, with an overprint of shock metamorphism and subsequent contamination by organic matter after falling to Earth.																			0020-6814					SEP	1998	40	9					774	783		10.1080/00206819809465238	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00206819809465238													WOS:000076933900003
J	Decrouy, L; Vennemann, TW; Ariztegui, D				Decrouy, Laurent; Vennemann, Torsten Walter; Ariztegui, Daniel			Controls on ostracod valve geochemistry, Part 1: Variations of environmental parameters in ostracod (micro-)habitats	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The variations of environmental conditions (T degrees, pH, delta C-13(DIC), [DIC], delta O-18, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca) of ostracod habitats were examined to determine the controls of environmental parameters on the chemical and isotopic composition of ostracod valves. Results of a one-year monitoring of environmental parameters at five sites, with depths of between 2 and 70 m, in Lake Geneva indicate that in littoral to sub-littoral zones (2, 5, and 13 m), the chemical composition of bottom water varies seasonally in concert with changes in temperature and photosynthetic activity. An increase of temperature and photosynthetic activity leads to an increase in delta C-13 values of DIC and to precipitation of authigenic calcite, which results in a concomitant increase of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of water. In deeper sites (33 and 70 m), the composition of bottom water remains constant throughout the year and isotopic values and trace element contents are similar to those of deep water within the lake. The chemical composition of interstitial pore water also does not reflect seasonal variations but is controlled by calcite dissolution, aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration with reduction of sulphate and/or nitrate, and methanogenesis that may occur in the sediment pores. Relative influence of each of these factors on the pore water geochemistry depends on sediment thickness and texture, oxygen content in bottom as well as pore water. Variations of chemical compositions of the ostracod valves of this study vary according to the specific ecology of the ostracod species analysed, that is its life-cycle and its (micro-) habitat. Littoral species have compositions that are related to the seasonal variations of temperature, delta C-13 values of DIC, and of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of water. In contrast, the compositions of profundal species are largely controlled by variations of pore fluids along sediment depth profiles according to the specific depth preference of the species. The control on the geochemistry of sub-littoral species is a combination of controls for the littoral and profundal species as well as the specific ecology of the species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chidami, S; Guénard, G; Amyot, M				Chidami, Saad; Guenard, Guillaume; Amyot, Marc			Underwater infrared video system for behavioral studies in lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												We propose the use of infrared (IR) video systems for the underwater behavioral study of animals at night, at depth, and/or in colored aquatic systems. This system is composed of a black-and-white video camera coupled with four projectors, each equipped with 50 IR light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The use of LEDs is energetically far more efficient than the use of halogen lights equipped with IR filters, and therefore allows automatic long-term video recording at low cost. Laboratory testing of one LED spot at increasing humic acid concentrations indicates that this system can be used for short-range underwater observation in colored lakes. We applied this system to the study of scavenger/carcass interactions. Under field conditions, the setup is not easily detected by animals and allows direct and continuous observation of animal interactions during a full daily cycle. Note that, to our knowledge, this video system provides the first published night movies of freshwater fish behavior filmed in highly colored lakes, without using visible light. Our results indicate that this nonintrusive system can be successfully used for scientific studies in freshwater ecology, even in the presence of significant concentrations of light-absorbing humic substances in the water.

During the primary spawning period of green sturgeon, mid-April to June, the water temperature may vary from 8 to 21degreesC. To estimate the potential implications of this modified thermal regime, we examined the survival and development in three progeny groups of green sturgeon embryos from zygote to hatch, at constant incubation temperatures (11-26degreesC). Temperatures 23-26degreesC affected cleavage and gastrulation and all died before hatch. Temperatures 17.5-22degreesC were suboptimal as an increasing number of embryos developed abnormally and hatching success decreased at 20.5-22degreesC, although the tolerance to these temperatures varied between progenies. The lower temperature limit was not evident from this study, although hatching rate decreased at 11degreesC and hatched embryos were shorter, compared to 14degreesC. The mean total length of hatched embryos decreased with increasing temperature, although their wet and dry weight remained relatively constant. We concluded that temperatures 17-18degreesC may be the upper limit of the thermal optima for green sturgeon embryos, and that the river thermal regime during dry years may affect green sturgeon reproduction.

We studied the fish fauna of this shallow artificial 0.19 km(2) mangrove lake. Gill net sampling conducted during 24 hour cycles in three wet and three dry season months captured 639 fish of 19 species. Achirus achirus (Soleidae), Centropomus pectinatus, C undecimalis (Centropomidae), and Mugil curema (Mugilidae) accounted for 82% of the total catch weight. Marine, estuarine and freshwater fish accounted for 71%, 27% and 2% of the total catch weight, respectively. CPUE was low (mean: 15.8 g m(-2) 24 h(-t) or 0.1 individuals m(-2) 24 h(-1)) and did not differ between seasons, but catches were highest at sunset and lowest during daylight hours. In the dry season, several species disappeared from the catches, possibly as a result of the hypersaline conditions (> 40 parts per thousand) and very low water level in the lake. The origin (fresh, brackish or marine) and size of the fish caught suggest that most species became land-locked as juveniles during the wet season (i.e. freshwater conditions (0.7 parts per thousand), high water level) and grew up in the lake. Spawning in the lake was recorded only for A. achirus. Our results suggest that re-connecting the lake to the tide channels would be beneficial for those fish populations as well as for local fisheries. Road construction through mangrove areas - if not avoidable at all - should preserve the natural watershed connections to minimize habitat degradation and maintain the proper dynamics of the tides in these environments.

Phytoplankton biodiversity changes in a shallow tropical reservoir during the hypertrophication process	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Study aimed at evaluating phytoplankton biodiversity changes in a shallow tropical reservoir during its hypertrophication process. Samplings were carried Out Monthly during 8 consecutive years (1997-2004) in 5 depths. Conspicuous limnological changes in the reservoir derived from the presence and/or removal of the water hyacinth, characterized 3 different phases. Over the time series, reservoir changed from a typical polymictic eutrophic system to hypertrophic one, leading to a reduction of approximately 70 species (average 37%). Chlorophyceae accounted for the highest species richness (46%) among all algal classes and strictly followed total species richness variation. Internal feedback mechanisms intensification over phase III clearly promoted the sharp decrease in biodiversity. Highest decreases, mainly during springs, occurred simultaneously to the highest Cyanobacteria blooms. Increased turbidity due to heavy phytoplankton blooms suppressed all other algal groups, so that at the end of the present study even Cyanobacteria species richness decreased. Total dissolved phosphorous was included in most of the best selected models used to analyze the temporal patterns in species richness loss. Present data show that biodiversity loss following trophic change was not a single dimension of a single factor but, rather, a template of factors (e.g. light, stability) co-varying in consequence of the larger levels of biomass supported in the reservoir.

However, because of their small signal size, such gravity changes are seldom studied using satellite gravimetry from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). Here we investigate the ability of GRACE to detect water storage changes in the Longyangxia Reservoir (LR), which is situated in the upper main stem of the Yellow River. Three different GRACE solutions from the CSR, GFZ, and JPL with three different processing filters are compared here. We find that heavy precipitation in the summer of 2005 caused the LR water storage to increase by 37.9 m in height, which is equivalent to 13.0 Gt in mass, and that the CSR solutions with a DDK4 filter show the best performance in revealing the synthetic gravity signals. We also obtain 109 pairs of reservoir inundation area measurements from satellite imagery and water level changes from laser altimetry and in situ observations to derive the area-height ratios for the LR. The root mean square of GRACE series in the LR is reduced by 39% after removing synthetic signals caused by mass changes in the LR or by 62% if the GRACE series is further smoothed. We conclude that GRACE data show promising potential in detecting water storage changes in this similar to 400 km(2) reservoir and that a small signal size is not a restricting factor for detection using GRACE data.					; Yi, Shuang/AAK-6411-2021; Wang, Qiuyu/KVX-9763-2024	Yi, Shuang/0000-0003-2976-2351; Wang, Qiuyu/0000-0002-4624-1489; sun, wen ke/0000-0003-0737-1827; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				AUG	2017	53	8					6562	6578		10.1002/2017WR020793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR020793													WOS:000411202000013

Impact of climate change in relation to ascochyta blight on field pea in Western Australia	AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY												Using a weather-based model, the G2 Blackspot Manager, the impact of climate change was studied in relation to a major disease of field pea, ascochyta blight, in three different field pea growing locations of Western Australia: Esperance, Lake Grace and Merredin representing high, medium and low rainfall zones. The model was run with weather data for two 30-year periods: the period centering on 1990 (termed as "current climate") and another centering on 2050 (termed as "future climate"). The model outputs were summarised as the epidemic-initiating ascospore-load that crops would be exposed to, disease severity, and yield loss in relation to nine times of sowing within the current sowing-window of field pea crops in Western Australia. Results show a decreased pressure of ascospore-load across the sowing-window in all three locations because of changed summer conditions (more rainy days in conjunction with higher temperatures) under future climate, which could be translated as lower disease severity compared to the current climate. The relationship between disease severity and time of sowing showed a significant decrease (P a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05) in the intercept of the regression lines for future climate compared to current climate in all three locations, but there was no significant difference between the slopes of the regression lines. This indicated a decreased initial disease pressure for future climate compared to the current. When the impact was assessed in terms of yield loss, results in Lake Grace, in contrast to Esperance and Merredin, showed insignificant difference between current and future climates. This was a consequence of the projected dry-finishing conditions of cropping seasons, the number of which could increase two-fold in the projected future climate. It is concluded that any decrease in ascochyta blight severity as a result of climate change would most likely be location-specific.

Two tributaries, receiving wastes from pyrite mines, enter the river and gave rise, in the middle reaches, to dissolved metal concentrations up to 88 mu gl(-1) Cu, 2.6 mu gl(-1) Cd and 1800 mu gl(-1) Zn. At the most polluted sites phytoplankton responded mainly by a shift towards metal resistant species: dominant species such as Rhodomonas minuta, Synedra ulna, Crucigenia tetrapedia and Stephanodiscus hantzschii were replaced by Gomphonema parvulum, Scenedesmus armatus and Nitzschia frustulum, while the total algal standing crop was not significantly affected. In contrast, zooplankton displayed a strong reduction in the abundance of major groups (40-100%), species richness (59%) and diversity (58-75%), and only a few taxa, namely Acanthocyclops robustus, Arcella vulgaris, Philodina sp., seemed to tolerate high metal concentrations. At the lower river reaches, where metal contamination decreased substantially, a recovery in species composition and abundance was observed for both plankton communities.

J	SCHLADOW, SG; FISHER, IH				SCHLADOW, SG; FISHER, IH			THE PHYSICAL RESPONSE OF TEMPERATE LAKES TO ARTIFICIAL DESTRATIFICATION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Prolonged periods of thermal stratification in a lake suppress convective motions capable of vertical transport of dissolved oxygen and other dissolved and suspended matter. When this leads to anoxia in the hypolimnion, it can give rise to profound water quality implications. Artificial destratification is one means whereby low oxygen levels in the hypolimnion may be averted. The operating principles of bubble plume destratification and its effect on the physical transport and mixing that occurs in a lake are described. Monitoring of temperature and dissolved oxygen was conducted at Lake Nepean, Australia, prior to the destratification, and then continued for two summers while the destratification system was operating. The results showed that artificial destratification had an immediate effect on lake motions across a range of scales. The actual process of destratification occurred by the erosion of the base of the thermocline. Deep-water temperatures were elevated well above historical values, the heat storage in the lake increased, and the time of turnover was brought forward 2.5 months. An integral plume model coupled with a one-dimensional lake model is shown to predict the effect of the bubble plume entrainment and the subsequent redistribution of the entrained water throughout the lake.																			0024-3590					MAR	1995	40	2					359	373		10.4319/lo.1995.40.2.0359	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.2.0359													WOS:A1995QZ60800015

The discovery of the Barmer Basin, Rajasthan, India, and its petroleum geology	AAPG BULLETIN												The discovery of oil and gas in the Barmer Basin in northwest India was one of the more significant global discoveries in the decade 2001-2010. The basin's presence was suspected from gravity and magnetic data in the late 1980s but not confirmed until 1999 from seismic and drilling. The basin is a lacustrine failed rift. Biostratigraphic data, however, indicate it was intermittently connected to marine waters via either the Cambay Basin, the Kutch Basin, or across the Devikot high, temporarily forming a large, shallow estuary. At least six major tectono-stratigraphic events have caused relative lake level falls and translation of elastic reservoirs basinward. Upward of 6 km (similar to 20,000 ft) of Cenozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks have been preserved. Prolific source rocks occur from the Mesozoic through Eocene strata. Tectonically, the basin is divided into a northern and a southern province. The north province continues to undergo inversion and erosion, and has not been buried as deeply as the south. Kinetics of the major source facies in the north are substantially different from those in the south, as well as the present-day and paleo-heat flow. These differences have made the northern part of the basin predominantly an oil province and the southern part a mixed oil and gas province. The prolific Paleocene Fatehgarh Formation contains the bulk of the 7.3 billion barrels of stock tank oil in place (STOIP) identified to date, but other reservoirs from the Mesozoic to the late Cenozoic are common and may yield significant future resource additions.

JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												To investigate the response of a remote boreal lake to recent climate warming, a similar to200-year varved sediment record from Rainbow Lake A (RLA), located in the northern boreal forest of Wood Buffalo National Park, straddling northern Alberta and the Northwest Territories (Canada), was investigated using diatom assemblages and biogenic silica concentrations. Diatom community composition, trends in diatom-inferred total phosphorus (TP) and biogenic silica levels all showed significant changes beginning between circa 1830 and 1840, coincident with the onset of increasingly warm June/July temperatures in northern Canada. We evaluated several hypotheses which may have caused these nutrient changes, including local anthropogenic disturbances, forest fires, increased atmospheric deposition of nutrients or pollen, and internal sources of nutrient regeneration. We concluded that TP is likely increasing as a result of enhanced internal cycling of phosphorus due to either increased thermal stratification in response to warmer summer temperatures and/or decreased meromictic stability. The results presented here, in combination with other recent paleolimnological research in northern latitude regions, suggest widespread aquatic response to increasing temperatures beginning in the 19th century.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Larsen, Chris/N-8976-2014	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Moser, Katrina/0000-0001-8633-5677													0921-2728					AUG	2002	28	2					269	281		10.1023/A:1021635024757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021635024757													WOS:000179614800008

Unialgal cultures were analyzed by salted closed-loop stripping analysis (CLSA) and gas chromatography (GC), which confirmed the presence of MIB at levels of up to 280-mu-g/l. Geosmin was also found at 2-36-mu-g/l. Resurgence of the alga following copper sulfate (CuS04) applications suggested resistance to the algicide. Laboratory experiments showed that the Phormidium was relatively tolerant of copper (surviving at least 3 mg/l of cupric ion after a 1-day exposure) in filtered lake water. The organism also survived 4 mg/l of copper for one day in a variety of sediment samples. This organism was implicated in the longest MIB episode in Lake Mathews, where MIB remained above historical background levels through the winter of 1989-1990. The Phormidium has apparently become the principal MIB producer in Lake Mathews, supplanting Oscillatoria curviceps after 10 years.																			0273-1223						1992	25	2					217	223		10.2166/wst.1992.0055	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1992.0055													WOS:A1992HR70900029

Objective criteria for choosing the most appropriate climate parameter(s) to be reconstructed at a specific site are thus lacking. Using a novel approach for testing the statistical significance of a quantitative reconstruction using random environmental data, in combination with the advantageous large environmental gradients, abundant vegetation types and comprehensive modern pollen databases in China, we describe a new procedure for pollen-based quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions. First, the most significant environmental variable controlling the fossil pollen assemblage changes is identified. Second, a calibration set to infer changes in this targeted variable is built up, by limiting the modern ranges of other environmental variables. Finally, the pollen-based quantitative reconstruction is obtained and its statistical significance assessed. This novel procedure was used to reconstruct the mean annual precipitation (P-ann) from Gonghai Lake in the Lvliang Mountains, and Tianchi Lake in the Liupan Mountains, on the eastern and western fringe of the Chinese Loess Plateau, respectively. Both P-ann reconstructions are statistically significant (p<0.001), and a sound and stable correlation relationship exists in their common period, showing a rapid precipitation decrease since 3300 cal yr BP. Thus, we propose that this procedure has great potential for reducing the uncertainties associated with pollen-based quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions in China.

J	Brooks, N				Brooks, Nick			Cultural responses to aridity in the Middle Holocene and increased social complexity	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The first complex, highly organised, state-level societies emerged in the Afro-Asiatic monsoon belt and northern South America during the 6th and early 5th millennia BP. This was a period of profound climatic and environmental change in these regions and globally, characterised by a weakening of the global monsoon system and widespread aridification in regions that today contain the bulk of the world's warm deserts. This paper examines trajectories of socio-cultural and environmental change in six key regions in which complex societies emerged during the Middle Holocene: the central Sahara (focusing on the Libyan Fezzan), Egypt, Mesopotamia, South Asia (Indus-Sarasvati region), northern China and coastal Peru. Links between environmental and socio-cultural change are explored in the context of archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data and a theoretical framework of increasing social complexity as a response to enhanced aridity, driven largely by population agglomeration in environmental refugia characterised by the presence of surface water. There is direct evidence of adaptation to increased aridity in the archaeological literature relating to the Sahara and Egypt. In the other regions examined, the data are consistent with the notion that increased social complexity was largely driven by environmental deterioration, although further local-scale archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data are required to clarify the processes involved.

J	de Lange, R; Adua, L				de Lange, Ruan; Adua, Lazarus			An independent assessment of potential social impacts of the newly initiated inland port in Salt Lake City, United States	IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND PROJECT APPRAISAL												State and local authorities in Utah, the United States, have initiated a new inland port project in Salt Lake City amidst unresolved controversies and disagreements. While a proper social impact assessment (SIA) can help address the manifold concerns of the community, there is currently no indication authorities of the new inland port are considering such an assessment. To help ameliorate this situation, at least in part, we conduct an independent limited scope SIA of the project. Our efforts are twofold: 1) examining whether project-related actions taken so far comport with SIA protocols and principles; and 2) anticipating potential impacts of the project on crime, housing cost, and unemployment. We find that some actions undertaken by project officials comport with SIA principles, although they fall short of what is needed to fully address residents' concerns. The project may also generate positive consequences, exemplified by long-term reduction in unemployment, and negative ones, exemplified by a modest increase in crime. As part of our conclusion, we recommend that port authorities should conduct a full-scale SIA, given the potential benefits of such an endeavor						de Lange, Ruan/0000-0002-5405-6195													1461-5517	1471-5465				MAY 4	2022	40	3					228	242		10.1080/14615517.2022.2035636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14615517.2022.2035636		FEB 2022											WOS:000758848000001

Numerical modeling of hydrodynamics and tracer dispersion during ice-free period in Lake Winnipeg	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The three-dimensional hydrodynamic Estuary Lake Coastal Ocean Model (ELCOM) was used to study the water circulation and thermal structure of Lake Winnipeg, Canada. To assess the model performance, we simulated circulation and temperature distribution of the lake in 2007 and compared the model results with the field observations of water levels, temperature, and currents. The model showed considerable success in reproducing the thermal structure and circulation. The model predicted isothermal conditions in the South Basin and Narrows for the whole period and produced weak thermal stratification during the early summer in the North Basin. The modeled currents were used to examine the transport, dispersion of passive tracers, and local flushing time in the lake. Simulations using passive tracers qualitatively agreed well with the field measurements of hydrogen isotopes in Lake Winnipeg taken during the study period. The mean transport is towards the north in the lake with two cyclonic gyres in the North Basin and one gyre in the South Basin. The model results show that the local flushing time of Red River waters in the South Basin is about 45 days.

Organic inclusions in Brazilian Cretaceous amber: The oldest ostracods preserved in fossil resins	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH												Fossil resins and ostracods are well-known in Brazilian Cretaceous sedimentary Basins, especially in the Araripe Basin. The present work reports several ostracods encapsulated in an amber sample recovered from limestones of the Crato Formation (Araripe Basin, Northeastern Brazil). The amber was analyzed under optical and eletronic microscopy revealing several ostracod specimens. Considering the general morphology, the recovered specimens were attributed to the freshwater to brackish genera Pattersoncypris Bate, 1972 and Damonella Anderson, 1966 in the superfamily Cypridoidea. Additionally, palynological analyses of the limestone rock around the amber demonstrate the predominance of pollen grains of the Classopolis genus, produced by conifers of Cheirolepidiaceae family, suggesting this family as possible botanical source of the fossil resin. The proposed interpretation for this preservation is as follow: (i) the lake level variations transported the ostracods to the margin; (ii) drops of resin exuded from the trunk fell to the margin on the dead ostracods; (iii) the exposed resin underwent polymerization preserving the ostracods; (iv) and finally, the amber was preserved in the laminated calcareous deposit. The record described here provides a detailed study of organisms fossilized in Brazilian amber as well as it reports the oldest record of ostracods enclosed in fossil resins (Aptian age).

The fate of phosphorus in decomposing fish carcasses: a mesocosm experiment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												An outdoor mesocosm experiment was conducted to study the process of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) release during fish carcass decomposition and its implications for the functioning of warm, shallow temperate lakes after massive fish kills. Specifically, we compared differences in the fate of P released from carcasses of two fish species that differ in body P concentrations and the ecosystem responses to these fish-derived nutrient inputs. Nutrients liberated from bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) carcasses induced phytoplankton blooms and high total P and N concentrations in the water column within a week after carcass addition; these effects persisted for 2-3weeks. Subsequently, water column P was transferred to other ecosystem compartments, primarily sediments and benthic algae. Fish species identity influenced the effects only slightly; decomposition of gizzard shad triggered the highest maximal chlorophyll-a concentrations in the water column, while the highest coverage of benthic algae and lowest biomass of periphytic biofilm were found in mesocosms containing bluegill carcasses. Both bluegill and gizzard shad carcasses decomposed completely during the experimental period (3months). Thus, apparently all carcass nutrients were mineralised into bioavailable forms and taken up by other ecosystem compartments. Fallen fish carcasses are not probably to represent long-term P sinks in warm-temperate shallow lakes. Decomposition following large mortality events can induce fleeting algal blooms in these ecosystems.

J	Alexander, MD; Caissie, D				Alexander, MD; Caissie, D			Variability and comparison of hyporheic water temperatures and seepage fluxes in a small Atlantic salmon stream	GROUND WATER												Ground water discharge is often a significant factor in the quality of fish spawning and rearing habitat and for highly biologically productive streams. In the present study, water temperatures (stream and hyporheic) and seepage fluxes were used to characterize shallow ground water discharge and recharge within the streambed of Catamaran Brook, a small Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stream in central New Brunswick, Canada. Three study sites were instrumented using a total of 10 temperature sensors and 18 seepage meters. Highly variable mean seepage fluxes, ranging from 1.7 X 10(-4) to 2.5 cm(3) m(-2) sec(-1), and mean hyporheic water temperatures, ranging from 10.5degrees to 18.0degreesC, at depths of 20 to 30 cm in the streambed were dependent on streambed location (left versus right stream bank and site location) and time during the summer sampling season. Temperature data were useful for determining if an area of the streambed was under discharge (positive flux), recharge (negative flux), or parallel flow (no flux) conditions and seepage meters were used to directly measure the quantity of water flux. Hyporheic water temperature measurements and specific conductance measurements of the seepage meter sample water, mean values ranging from 68.8 to 157.9 muS/cm, provided additional data for determining flux sources. Three stream banks were consistently under discharge conditions, while the other three stream banks showed reversal from discharge to recharge conditions over the sampling season. Results indicate that the majority of the water collected in the seepage meters was composed of surface water. The data obtained suggests that even though a positive seepage flux is often interpreted as ground water discharge, this discharging water may be of stream water origin that has recently entered the hyporheic zone. The measurement of seepage flux in conjunction with hyporheic water temperature or other indicators of water origin should be considered when attempting to quantify the magnitude of exchange and the source of hyporheic water.																			0017-467X	1745-6584				JAN-FEB	2003	41	1					72	82		10.1111/j.1745-6584.2003.tb02570.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2003.tb02570.x								12533078					WOS:000180367700013

Biodeposition rates at the five stations were determined by using sediment traps and converted to per unit area values to facilitate comparisons with natural sedimentation rates. Biodeposition of suspended material by zebra mussels was up to 8 times greater than sedimentation in the traps. Concentrations of organic matter, PCBs, and Cd were determined for the biodeposits and the sedimented material. There were no significant differences in concentration of organic matter, PCBs, or Cd between the two types of material. Biodeposition rates per unit area of organic matter, PCBs, and Cd wp,re 8-10 times greater than corresponding values for natural sedimentation; therefore, the natural sedimentation processes of these factors appear to be greatly accelerated in the presence of zebra mussels. Results support the possibility that zebra mussels are altering contaminant movement in western Lake Erie, as well as clarifying the water column by removing suspended material.																			0706-652X					MAY	1998	55	5					1131	1139		10.1139/cjfas-55-5-1131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-5-1131													WOS:000075787000009

Comparisons of Bird, Aquatic Macroinvertebrate, and Plant Communities Among Dredged Ponds and Natural Wetland Habitats at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario	WETLANDS												Decreased wetland interspersion and need for dredging of lower Great Lakes coastal wetlands results from encroachment of open water by invasive cattail (Typha x glauca, T. angustifolia) and common reed (Phragmites australis). To increase wetland interspersion and fish and wildlife habitat at Long Point, Lake Erie, wetlands were dredged to restore open water ponds (0.4-4.0 ha ponds) in monotypic stands of cattail and common reed (hereafter cattail-reed), 2008-2010. We determined if bird, aquatic macroinvertebrate, and plant communities differed among dredged ponds, natural ponds, and areas of monotypic cattail-reed to investigate effects of dredging, May-August 2011. Marsh-bird relative abundance was 40 % greater at dredged and natural ponds than cattail-reed areas, and richness was at least 16 % greater at dredged ponds than natural ponds and cattail-reed areas. Relative abundance of macroinvertebrates was 77 % greater in dredged than natural ponds. Plant species richness was 57 and 54 % greater, respectively, and diversity 42 % greater at dredged ponds than natural ponds and cattail-reed areas. Our comparison of dredged ponds with natural wetland habitats highlights that dredging to restore interspersion and manage monotypic cattail-reed in lower Great Lakes wetlands can be beneficial to marsh-nesting birds and habitat resources used by fish and wildlife.

Whereas Keratella cochlearis and Synchaeta pectinata showed a population maximum in the deeper layer during midday and in the upper layer during midnight, Asplanchna priodonta, Synchaeta kitina and Filinia terminalis always remained in the deeper layer. In contrast, Polyarthra dolichoptera and S. grandis were the only rotifer species that remained in the upper layer. Possession of mycosporine-like amino acids, a family of photoprotective compounds seemed to be an important strategy for occupying the upper layer. For other species, midday positioning in the deeper layer seemed to be related to UVR avoidance rather than to predation pressure, whereas the upward shift at night was species-dependent. Migrating species seemed favoured by higher temperatures in the upper layer, whereas non-migrating species seemed restricted by factors such as food supply. Our study indicates that rotifers exhibit different species-specific strategies for dealing with factors such as UVR exposure, temperature and food availability.

J	Sheikhazadi, A; Ghadyani, MH				Sheikhazadi, Ardeshir; Ghadyani, Mohammad Hasan			Epidemiology of drowning in Isfahan province, center of Iran	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MEDICAL SCIENCES												BACKGROUND: Drowning is a preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. We studied drowning deaths in Isfahan Province, focusing on the activity victims were involved in and the setting of the incident. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was done on all drowning deaths referred to Legal Medicine Organization of Isfahan province over a period of 5 years from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006. RESULTS: During these 5 years, 355 persons suffered fatal drowning in Isfahan province. The annual incidence rate was 1.6 per 100000 population (2.6 & 0.4 for males and females, respectively). Mean age was 21.99 +/- 14.86 and M/F ratio was 6.5:1. Most victims were 15-24 and 5-14 years of age (172 and 62 decedents, 3.0 and 1.8 per 100000 population/year, respectively). Most incidents occurred in natural settings, of which rivers, canals, lakes and ponds were the most common sites, respectively. The most frequently connected activity was swimming and wading, followed by accidental fall into water. The manner of death was found as following: 85.1% accidental, 1.7% suicidal, 0.3% homicidal and 12.9% undetermined.

J	DEMAURO, MM				DEMAURO, MM			RELATIONSHIP OF BREEDING SYSTEM TO RARITY IN THE LAKESIDE DAISY (HYMENOXYS-ACAULIS VAR GLABRA)	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The breeding system of a rare Great Lakes endemic, the lakeside daisy (Hymenoxys acaulis var. glabra), was investigated when plants from a remnant Illinois population produced no seeds for over 15 years. To determine if the Lakeside daisy was self-incompatible, 20 plants from two populations, Illinois and Ohio, were selfed and outcrossed Seed/ovule ratios were compared among the different treatments and the location of the incompatibility reaction was identified Lakeside daisy was found to be self-incompatible (sporophytic). The last Illinois population was effectively extinct because the remaining plants belonged to the same mating type (N(e) = 1) and only produced seeds when out-crossed to the Ohio plants. Cross-incompatibility was also observed among Ohio plants, suggesting that within large populations, compatible mating types may be rare locally In addition, inbreeding depression (lower seed/ovule ratios in inbred than in outcrosses) was observed after one generation of inbreeding. Small populations of self-incompatible species are vulnerable to extinction if the number of self-incompatibility alleles, either as a result of a bottleneck or of genetic drift, falls below the number needed for the breeding system to function Recovery protocols based on these genetic considerations were developed and implemented in 1988 when Lakeside daisy populations were established at three Illinois nature preserves.																			0888-8892					SEP	1993	7	3					542	550		10.1046/j.1523-1739.1993.07030542.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1993.07030542.x													WOS:A1993LZ05700014
J	Kean, WF; Williams, I; Chan, L; Feeney, J				Kean, WF; Williams, I; Chan, L; Feeney, J			Magnetism of the Keweenawan age Chengwatana lava flows, northwest Wisconsin	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Chengwatana Volcanics are subaerial plateau basalts which appear to be stratigraphically above the North Shore Volcanic Group of the Lake Superior Region. Sixty five oriented cores were collected at six sites near St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin. Magnetic cleaning of the samples was primarily step-wise alternating field (A.F.) demagnetization to 100 mT. Thermal demagnetization and hysteresis property measurements indicate the dominant magnetic mineralogy is multidomain magnetite. However, a stable remanence is present which we attribute to grains with single domain behavior. The mean remanent direction is D = 287.5 degrees, I = 45.8 degrees, alpha-95 = 8.0 degrees, with a mean pole at 186.1 degrees E., 30.9 degrees N. This result is consistent with the 1.1 Ga. apparent pole for the North American craton. Two sites mapped as stratigraphically equivalent show distinct reversed directions. Both AP. and thermal demagnetization isolate the same reversed direction which is interpreted as being primary. These particular flows record a short reversal in an otherwise normal sequence. This strengthens the evidence for more than one reversal in the Middle Keweenawan, and may be the same short reversal noted at Mamainse Point.					; Williams, Ian/F-4302-2012; Chan, Lung/D-3050-2009	Williams, Ian/0000-0003-4465-6493; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 15	1997	24	12					1523	1526		10.1029/97GL00993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97GL00993													WOS:A1997XF90400022

There should be underlying processes that enable the restoration of this species from small-sized populations, such as the existence of source (i.e. reproductive) populations in other areas and depth zones of the lake. However, there has been no robust, properly designed evaluation of the distribution of the Manila clam in the subtidal sand flats. In order to elucidate the possible mechanisms that allow for the persistence of populations of the Manila clam, we examined the spatio-temporal and vertical variation in distributions of 0-age clams in the subtidal zone of sand flats. Seasonal effects on population variations showed erratic changes among depth zones without a decreasing trend along the depth gradient. Further, many local populations became extinct even in the shallower zones due to seasonal (summer) hypoxia at deeper zones and hypoxia by the accumulation of key benthic species (Asian mussel and decaying macroalgae) in mats at shallower zones. A few surviving local populations were stable with a spatial-fragmental (patchy) distribution, associated with fragmented accumulations of Asian mussels and macroalgae. Efforts to maintain stable populations and to restore this species in the subtidal area may depend on these small, restricted, patchy local populations. These findings suggest that high fertility and productivity of the Manila clam as well as patchy distribution of small populations may contribute to the maintenance of the population and the avoidance of extinction (by spatially diffusing the risk of extinction) in harsh environments resulting from the reclamation project.					; Yamada, Katsumasa/AAA-1303-2020	Yamada, Katsumasa/0000-0003-2136-0366; 													0173-9565	1439-0485				SEP	2014	35	3					308	318		10.1111/maec.12082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maec.12082													WOS:000340543800005

This article evaluates the variable intensity of its occupation in five temporal segments between 2030 and 440 cal BP, according to a chronology modeled from 14 radiocarbon dates excavated in stone enclosures at three sites. The variation in the density of proximal flakes is used as a proxy of human occupation intensity. We assess the correlation of more intense human occupation and environmental changes in temperature and humidity, as recorded at three high-altitude lakes: Aculeo, Chepical, and Maule (33 degrees-35 degrees S). These archives include proxies for vegetation cover, ice cover extent, and changes in precipitation derived from the Westerlies and the El Nino Southern Oscillation. There is a correlation between favorable conditions and more intense occupations at multiple times in the sequence. We discuss two periods of greater intensity: 1200-1280 cal BP (calibrated medians), when summer temperature and precipitation was higher, and 450-500 cal BP, when temperatures were lower and the Inca were in the area.

Satellite remote sensing (RS) has been established as an important source of information to determine the trophic state of inland waters through the retrieval of optically active water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). However, the use of RS techniques for assessment of the trophic state of inland waters on a global scale is hindered by the performance of retrieval algorithms over highly dynamic and complex optical properties that characterize many of these systems. In this study, we developed a new RS approach to assess the trophic state of global inland water bodies based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and the Forel-Ule index (FUI). First, the FIJI was calculated from MODIS data by dividing natural water colour into 21 indices from dark blue to yellowish-brown. Then the relationship between FIJI and the trophic state index (TSI) was established based on in-situ measurements and MODIS products. The water-leaving reflectance at 645 nm band was employed to distinguish coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)-dominated systems in the FIJI-based trophic state assessment. Based on the analysis, the FUI-based trophic state assessment method was developed and applied to assess the trophic states of 2058 large inland water bodies (surface area > 25 km(2)) distributed around the world using MODIS data from the austral and boreal summers of 2012. Our results showed that FUI can be retrieved from MODIS with a considerable accuracy (92.5%, R-2 = 0.92) by comparing with concurrent in situ measurements over a wide range of lakes, and the overall accuracy of the FIJI-based trophic state assessment method is 80.0% (R-2 = 0.75) validated by an independent dataset. Of the global large water bodies considered, oligotrophic large lakes were found to be concentrated in plateau regions in central Asia and southern South America, while eutrophic large lakes were concentrated in central Africa, eastern Asia, and mid-northern and southeast North America.					; Tyler, Andrew/F-2034-2010; Zhang, Bing/JOZ-7091-2023; Kutser, Tiit/H-1304-2015	Spyrakos, Evangelos/0000-0001-7970-5211; li, jun sheng/0000-0002-8590-9736; Lehmann, Moritz/0000-0001-7346-3901; , shen qian/0000-0002-6034-0555													0034-4257	1879-0704				NOV	2018	217						444	460		10.1016/j.rse.2018.08.026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.08.026													WOS:000447570900033

However, information on NBFRs in animal feeds, the beginning of farm-to-fork pathway, is very limited. Fishmeal is one of the most widely applied feedstuff worldwide. The present study identified eleven NBFRs from ninety-two globally collected fishmeal samples with levels in the range of 0.13-822 (mean: 15.1 +/- 85.5) ng/g lipid weight (lw). Hexabromobenzene (HBB) and pentabromotoluene (PBT) were the most prevalent contributors (detection frequencies: 95.7% and 73.9%, respectively), and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE) was the weightiest contributor (accounted for 67.1% of the Sigma NBFRs, mean: 12.1 +/- 84.8 ng/g 1w). From a geographical view, the highest NBFR level was found in Chinese fishmeal. The NBFRs fell within an order of magnitude in South America, Southeast Asia, Europe and United States. DBDPE was predominant in the fishmeal collected from China, South America and United States, but it was not detected in European fishmeal. The NBFR levels are significantly lower compared to the polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (p < 0.01), indicating that the distribution of NBFRs was not as wide as PBDEs in fishmeal. DBDPE was significantly correlated with BDE209 (r = 0.557, p < 0.01), which implies that the two chemicals might have similar sources. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)results imply that the NBFRs might have similar persistence and biomagnification potential as legacy lipophilic POPs.					; Ruan, Zheng/IUM-7758-2023; Sun, Xiaoming/AHA-6034-2022; liu, zehui/JHS-7223-2023; Li, Xiaomin/ABI-2638-2020; Wang, Peilong/R-4412-2016	Li, Xiaomin/0000-0002-9037-211X; 													0147-6513	1090-2414				APR 15	2019	170						306	313		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.11.112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.11.112								30530183					WOS:000456890700039

To better elucidate this process, a series of laboratory experiments was performed with stream and river waters with pH range from 3.5 to 8.2 and concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus from 2 to 142 mu g L-1 Samples were filtered (0.4 mu m) and UV (350 nm) irradiated for 24 h at 68 W m(-2), i.e. under conditions equivalent to similar to 2 summer days of natural solar radiation. Irradiated samples and dark controls were then spiked with P-33-phosphate and the kinetics of P adsorption on freshly formed particles was determined after separation by ultracentrifugation. Up to 68% of the added P was removed from the solution within 48 h of the spike. The P sorption was pH dependent, with the maximum sorption ability at pHs of 6-7. We hypothesize that this process can importantly contribute to the immobilization and lower bioavailability of P in the inlet areas of (especially circum-neutral) lakes due to the intensive photochemical degradation of allochthonous DOC-metal complexes.

All of the feces samples were cultured in specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) for NDV isolation. The NDV isolates were analyzed for virulent fusion (F) protein by RT reverse transcription PCR (RRT-PCR). Of the 540 examined feces samples, 28 (5.18%) were found to be positive by RT-PCR. The same samples were cultured in ECEs and, of those, 9 (1.66%) were positive for NDV isolations. Of the isolates, 7 were obtained from the migrant waterfowls Phoenicopterus ruber, Anas clypeata, Aythya ferina, and Aythya fuligula and 2 were from the resident species Columba livia. The RRT-PCR F protein was determined in 1 isolate belonging to Aythya ferina; this strain was typed as mesogenic/velogenic avian paramyxovirus type 1 and the other 8 isolates as lentogenic. In this study, we investigated, for the first time, the presence of NDV in wild, seemingly healthy bird feces from areas in Lake Van basin, in Turkey.

In this study, magnetically recoverable La2O2CO3/Fe3O4 nanosheets were synthesized through the calcination of La-Fe binary metal glycolate. Based on magnetic and adsorption properties, La2O2CO3/Fe3O4 nanosheets with a La to Fe molar ratio of 1:1 (La2O2CO3/Fe3O4-1) were selected for further exploration. Electron microscopy characterization revealed that the nanocomposites consist of stacked La2O2CO3 and Fe3O4 nanosheets. The La2O2CO3/Fe3O4-1 nanocomposites exhibited exceptional adsorption capacities of 114.6 mg P/g and 230.2 mg As/g. Additionally, the material exhibited rapid adsorption kinetics and maintained excellent adsorption performance within a pH range of 3.0 to 9.0, showing significant selectivity for phosphate and arsenate even in the presence of various coexisting ions. Adsorption-desorption cycling tests indicated good potential for recycling. When applied to the spring water of Yangzonghai Lake, the material efficiently reduced the concentrations of phosphate and arsenate from 0.725 mg P/L and 1.380 mg As/L to below 0.020 mg P/L and 0.010 mg As/L, respectively. Mechanistic studies suggest that La2O2CO3 facilitates the removal of phosphate and arsenate primarily through electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange. These findings indicate that La2O2CO3/Fe3O4 holds significant promise for the co-removal of phosphate and arsenate, even at low concentrations.					yang, xiangjun/E-6195-2019														2214-7144					JUN	2024	63								105422	10.1016/j.jwpe.2024.105422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2024.105422		MAY 2024											WOS:001239554500001

Over a distance of 100 km, the LULC comprises artificially created open water bodies (i.e., two parallel large run-on-river dams separated by the LBL), mountainous terrain, forest cover, and extensive agricultural land. Such heterogeneities increase (decrease) moisture supply and sensible heat, resulting in a differential air mass boundary that helps to initiate (inhibit) convection. Hence, the LBL can potentially modify precipitation formation. Historical anecdotes reveal a tendency for storms to dissipate or reintensify near the LBL. The specific scientific question pursued in this study is therefore the following: Has the unique development of two parallel run-on-river reservoirs and the surrounding LULC heterogeneity modified storm patterns in the region? Ten storm events during the growing season were selected. Two additional events, observed by the newly established high-resolution Kentucky Mesonet network, were also considered. Radar reflectivity images were visually inspected to understand the evolution of convective cells that originated or were modified near the LBL. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) Model was used to determine near-surface trajectories that led to the selected events. The spatial synoptic classification and merged Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) IR images were analyzed to determine the prevailing synoptic conditions on the event dates. Six storm events showed a pattern wherein the convective cells lost strength as it passed over the LBL in a northeasterly direction. In two events, Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) reflectivity imagery revealed enhancement of convection as the storm passed over the LBL toward the Mississippi valley. Further dissection of the storm morphology suggested that the thermodynamic environment may have played an important role for the eight events where modification of precipitation near LBL has been clearly observed.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				JUN	2014	53	6					1506	1524		10.1175/JAMC-D-13-088.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-13-088.1													WOS:000337767400011

Stratigraphic analysis of lake level fluctuations in Lake Ohrid: an integration of high resolution hydro-acoustic data and sediment cores	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Ancient Lake Ohrid is a steep-sided, oligotrophic, karst lake that was tectonically formed most likely within the Pliocene and often referred to as a hotspot of endemic biodiversity. This study aims on tracing significant lake level fluctuations at Lake Ohrid using high-resolution acoustic data in combination with lithological, geochemical, and chronological information from two sediment cores recovered from sub-aquatic terrace levels at ca. 32 and 60 m water depth. According to our data, significant lake level fluctuations with prominent lowstands of ca. 60 and 35 m below the present water level occurred during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 and MIS 5, respectively. The effect of these lowstands on biodiversity in most coastal parts of the lake is negligible, due to only small changes in lake surface area, coastline, and habitat. In contrast, biodiversity in shallower areas was more severely affected due to disconnection of today sublacustrine springs from the main water body. Multichannel seismic data from deeper parts of the lake clearly image several clinoform structures stacked on top of each other. These stacked clinoforms indicate significantly lower lake levels prior to MIS 6 and a stepwise rise of water level with intermittent stillstands since its existence as water-filled body, which might have caused enhanced expansion of endemic species within Lake Ohrid.					; Schwenk, Tilmann/A-6324-2015; Vogel, Hendrik/C-6148-2014; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012; Daut, Gerhard/AAO-1514-2021; Krastel, Sebastian/C-2001-2017	Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Schwenk, Tilmann/0000-0002-9916-0340; Zander, Anja/0000-0003-0449-1401; Vogel, Hendrik/0000-0002-9902-8120; Daut, Gerhard/0000-0001-7414-1103; Krastel, Sebastian/0000-0002-5899-9748													1726-4170	1726-4189					2010	7	11					3531	3548		10.5194/bg-7-3531-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-7-3531-2010													WOS:000284756300011

Use of LCZs with urban canopy modeling to evaluate urban growth effects on meteorological conditions in the Salt Lake Valley	URBAN CLIMATE												Urban Canopy Models (UCMs) can be used to represent urban characteristics on a mesoscale without accounting for effects of individual buildings. A WRF-based single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM) was validated for the greater Salt Lake City area (GSLA) using measurements from two weather stations for a one-week period during summer 2019. A baseline model based on current GSLA properties developed using the Noah land surface model, SLUCM, and refined urban classifications based on WUDAPT Local Climate Zones (LCZs) produced acceptable predictions and computational times. The baseline model was validated using measured meteorological data and clearly showed diurnal heating patterns. Three scenarios representing multi-decade growth were defined by modifying LCZs in different parts of the GSLA. Compared to baseline values, results showed increased urban density increased local nighttime temperatures 5-10 degrees C depending on the extent of growth, but did not affect daytime temperatures. This was due to changes in LCZ anthropogenic heating rates and sky view factors which were most noticeable during early nighttime hours, consistent with atmospheric heat island behavior.

J	Hühn, D; Lübke, K; Skov, C; Arlinghaus, R				Huehn, Daniel; Luebke, Kay; Skov, Christian; Arlinghaus, Robert			Natural recruitment, density-dependent juvenile survival, and the potential for additive effects of stock enhancement: an experimental evaluation of stocking northern pike (Esox lucius) fry	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Density-dependent mortality in young life stages should strongly limit the potential for additive effects caused by stocking of fish sizes that are smaller than size at recruitment into the fishery. Indeed, stocking models have suggested that stocking of fry should not elevate year class strength in self-sustaining stocks. However, limited data based on replicated and controlled experiments are available to support this prediction. We performed a pond experiment (N = 4 per treatment) to compare the stock enhancing outcome of stocking hatchery-reared northern pike (Esox lucius) fry and the natural production of young in self-recruiting pike populations. We also added a treatment where pike fry were stocked into ponds that otherwise did not have pike to mimic the absence of natural recruitment. Fry stocking into self-reproducing stocks did not elevate year class strength over unstocked controls. However, in the absence of competition, year class strength of juveniles in late summer emerging from fry stocking was similar to the production of natural recruits. Overall, we demonstrated the competitive disadvantage of hatchery-reared fry when released into waters already containing natural recruits, the partial replacement of natural recruits by hatchery-reared fry, and the lack of additive effects of stock enhancement in naturally reproducing stocks. A stock-enhancing effect of pike fry stocking may only be expected in the absence of natural recruitment.					; Arlinghaus, Robert/E-3340-2010; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019	Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X; Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520													0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2014	71	10					1508	1519		10.1139/cjfas-2013-0636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-0636													WOS:000343125500007
J	Pratt, TC; Smokorowski, KE				Pratt, TC; Smokorowski, KE			Fish habitat management implications of the summer habitat use by littoral fishes in a north temperate, mesotrophic lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Compensation measures in response to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Policy for the Management of Fish Habitat includes provisions for habitat creation and enhancement. Thus, an assessment of nearshore habitat utilization patterns by fishes is needed to put DFO compensation measures in the context of the "no net loss of the productive capacity of fish habitat" directive. Measures of abundance, richness, and diversity of fishes were compared across nine habitat types in a lake using rapid visual underwater assessment. Multivariate analyses separated habitats into three groups and identified two distinct species assemblages. Most species were associated with macrophytes, but a few were primarily associated with rocky substrate. Shallow mud (open) habitats contained significantly fewer species and had lower mean scores and diversity than all other habitat types. Rocky habitats had lower mean scores and diversity than some vegetated habitat types containing similar fish assemblages. Surprisingly, within-site fish assemblage heterogeneity was similar to among-site heterogeneity, and among-habitat heterogeneity was lower than within-habitat heterogeneity, further supporting our inability to distinguish among vegetated habitat types. Our results suggest that habitat heterogeneity is critical in maintaining diverse communities and that compensation measures should account for differences in fish-habitat associations among varied habitats.

TOXINS												Recurring blooms of filamentous, red-pigmented and toxin-producing cyanobacteria Planktothrix rubescens have been reported in numerous deep and stratified prealpine lakes, with the exception of Lake Constance. In a 2019 and 2020 Lake Constance field campaign, we collected samples from a distinct red-pigmented biomass maximum below the chlorophyll-a maximum, which was determined using fluorescence probe measurements at depths between 18 and 20 m. Here, we report the characterization of these deep water red pigment maxima (DRM) as cyanobacterial blooms. Using 16S rRNA gene-amplicon sequencing, we found evidence that the blooms were, indeed, contributed by Planktothrix spp., although phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus taxa constituted most of the biomass (>96% relative read abundance) of the cyanobacterial DRM community. Through UPLC-MS/MS, we also detected toxic microcystins (MCs) in the DRM in the individual sampling days at concentrations of <= 1.5 ng/L. Subsequently, we reevaluated the fluorescence probe measurements collected over the past decade and found that, in the summer, DRM have been present in Lake Constance, at least since 2009. Our study highlights the need for a continuous monitoring program also targeting the cyanobacterial DRM in Lake Constance, and for future studies on the competition of the different cyanobacterial taxa. Future studies will address the potential community composition changes in response to the climate change driven physiochemical and biological parameters of the lake.					; Dietrich, Daniel/AAP-8698-2021	Riehle, Eva/0000-0001-7414-5382; Fournier, Corentin/0000-0003-4638-4006; Dietrich, Daniel/0000-0003-0416-3811; 														2072-6651				SEP	2021	13	9							666	10.3390/toxins13090666	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins13090666								34564670					WOS:000700168800001

At these northern latitudes, Asian clam populations are often limited to thermal refugia - particularly warmwater discharges from industrial facilities. Several such facilities exist in the lower Fox River in Green Bay. Asian clams were first documented in the lower Fox River in 1999 and were extensively surveyed near the river mouth in 2011, but the few individuals found were restricted to the warmwater discharge from the Pulliam Power Plant. We performed a follow-up survey during 2017 to re-assess the population status of Asian clams in the lower Fox River at four industrial discharges, including the Pulliam Power Plant. We found more widespread evidence of Asian clams throughout the lower Fox River than previous surveys, but only one live individual was captured. We suspect that the back-to-back severe winters of 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 caused widespread overwinter mortality. Our investigation highlights the significant challenges for establishment of Asian clam populations in the upper Great Lakes region, and provides an example of a potential invasive species struggling to establish a viable population in a hostile climate.

J	Hütteroth, A; Putschew, A; Jekel, M				Huetteroth, Alexandra; Putschew, Anke; Jekel, Martin			Natural production of organic bromine compounds in Berlin lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Berlin surface waters are characterized by elevated concentrations of organic bound bromine (up to 35 mu g/L) in late summer. Organic bromine compounds in lakes are of significant importance because human life is closely connected to fresh water. Apart from recreational use, fresh water is frequently used for the production of drinking water, e.g., after bank filtration. Therefore the source, particularly the mechanism responsible for the formation is studied. Field studies indicate that the organic bromine compounds, measured as adsorbable organic bromine (AOBr), are autochthonous. Staggered maxima concentrations of chlorophyll-a, DOC and AOBr indicate that phototrophic organisms might contribute to the AOBr after death. The involvement of phototrophic organisms was established in the laboratory using surface water and/or cultures of organisms. Light and the presence of phototrophic organisms are essential for an AOBr production. Phototrophic organisms incorporate bromide, which is released randomly and after cell death. A part of the incorporated bromide is used for the formation of organic bromine compounds in the cell. After death of the organisms the brominated compounds and the incorporated bromide are released into the water phase, and an extracellular AOBr production can lead to a further formation of AOBr, most probably due to the parallel release of haloperoxidases.																			0013-936X					MAY 15	2007	41	10					3607	3612		10.1021/es062384k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es062384k								17547185					WOS:000246371800039

The cladoceran Sida crystallina rapidly declined in exclosures with fry, but increased in control exclosures without fry. Chironomids and chydorids showed little change in the exclosures. Invertebrate populations and foraging by fry were also monitored in the lake during 1976 and 1979. Sida declined rapidly in June of both years. In 1979, a decline from 2.2 .times. 103-0.3 .times. 103 individuals/m2 and a sharp drop in the proportion of adults between June 19th and 22nd coincided with the entry of a large school of fry into the study site on 19 June. Chironomids also declined during June of both years, while chydorids became increasingly abundant in mid-summer and showed no evidence of depletion by the fish. Populations of certain prey, which are found locally in high densities in the littoral zone, may be highly susceptible to brief episodes of intense predation by fish fry.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	96	2					169	176																WOS:A1982PR15100008

We measured bacterial production, chlorophyll and light, and estimated primary production in Paul Lake (Gogebic County, Michigan) and Crystal and Trout lakes (Vilas County, Wisconsin) during the summer stratification period (May-September 1991). Bacterial productivity was measured using the [H-3]leucine incorporation method and primary productivity estimated from measured photosynthesis-irradiance relationships. Three distinct vertical patterns were observed. In Paul Lake, bacterial production was highest at the interface between the aerobic and anaerobic layers, well below the depth of maximum primary production. In Crystal Lake, bacterial production was uniform with depth, although primary productivity was highest in the hypolimnion. In the largest lake, Trout Lake, primary and bacterial production tended to co-vary with maximum rates of both processes occurring in the metalimnion. Overall, bacterial productivity was poorly related to contemporaneous primary production in the three lakes, suggesting that other factors, such as nutrient recycling, phytoplankton loss rates and allocthonous loading, determine patterns in the depth distribution of bacterial productivity.

Experiments were conducted in the Rimov Reservoir (South Bohemia) during the clear-water phase (experiment I), a period of law protistan gazing pressure on reservoir bacterioplankton, and during the late summer phytoplankton peak (experiment II), a period of high protistan grazing pressure. In both experiments, there was a significant shift in BCC in the <5 mu m treatments, which came in the form of increased proportions of alpha subclass of the class Proteobacteria (ALF) and Cytophaga/Flavobacterium group (C/F), corresponding with increased bacterivory of the ungrazed HNF populations. Changes in BCC in other experimental treatments were related to preincubation protistan grazing pressure. In experiment I, bacterioplankton were subjected to negligible protistan bacterivory in the reservoir and did not shaw a change in BCC in the predator-free treatment (<1 mu m), while BCC changed in treatments that yielded increases in protistan bacterivory compared with that in the ambient reservoir water. In experiment II, a significant shift in BCC was induced when bacterioplankton that were subjected to heavy predation pressure in the reservoir were transferred into the predator-free treatment. Treatments that induced small changes in protistan grazing pressure (<20 mu m and UNF in experiment II) did not show significant BCC shifts. Proportions of filamentous bacteria (>4 mu m) increased in treatments that yielded large increases in bacterivory. Filament formation also showed season-specific features; in experiment I, all filaments belonged into ALF, whereas in experiment II, most of them hybridized with the C/F probe. We conclude that the sudden shifts that violate the established balance between bacterial production and the protist-induced bacterial mortality led to the significant shifts in cell morphology and BCC.

Of the primary uses, fish cultivation and potable water production depend mainly on its water quality. Over the years, this tropical lake has been inundated with pollution from agricultural, industrial and domestic wastewaters. While new contaminants have emerged, traditional contaminants including heavy metals continue to threaten the lake's resources. In this study, the levels and distribution of heavy metals in Laguna de Bay were investigated. Surface water samples from nine sampling sites were analyzed for As, Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Co, Ni, and Mn by ICP-MS and Hg by cold-vapor AAS. These heavy metals are variably dispersed across the lake and the mean concentrations were from below detection limits to 110.7 mu g/L. Except for As and Mn, the levels are within the national standards for surface waters. In the south side of the lake near hot springs, As was found in relatively high concentrations up to 116.2 mu g/L. The findings of this study on the present-day levels of heavy metals in Laguna de Bay are useful in assessing and sustaining the pollution prevention strategies in this valuable aquatic system that provides natural resources and ecosystem services.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2022	23	1					253	264		10.1007/s10201-021-00667-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-021-00667-x		AUG 2021											WOS:000680365400001

Recent molecular studies suggest the existence of at least three very different genetic lineages of Craspedacusta: the "sowerbii", the "kiatingi", and the "sinensis" lineages. We report the presence of both medusae and polyps of this alien taxon in the Large Lake of Monticolo / Montiggl, a meso-eutrophic natural lake in the Province of Bolzano / Bozen in Northern Italy. Molecular analyses of mitochondrial 16S sequences showed that this population belongs to a different lineage than that recently described for Sicily (Southern Italy). Therefore, there are two different genetic lineages of C. sowerbii in Italy. In the Large Lake of Monticolo / Montiggl medusae were observed in 6 consecutive summers (2015 - 2020), from July to September. All the examined medusae were males. The stomach content analyses showed that zooplanktonic copepods and cladocerans with size range between 0.3 and 0.8 mm were the preferred prey of medusae. Polyps of C. sowerbii were recorded in the lake on the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha in shallow water and on the underside of artificial substrates. The analyses of zebra mussels would therefore be a simple method to check for the presence of the polyp stage of C. sowerbii in various aquatic environments.

The stand was vegetative, at all times submerged and therefore never flowering. On average each plant produced 3 adventitious roots and 40 leaevs. One or 2 turions were also produced each year, together with stolons and associated offsets. At the beginning of June 1977 the population density was 42 plants/m2 and the biomass was 290 kg/ha (dry wt basis). At the end of Sept. that year the respective values were 90/m2 and 756 kg/ha. The dry wt/fresh wt ratio of the biomass changed little during that period, from 6.4 to 6.5%. These and other results are compared with the respective data for Stratiotes stands in Central European lakes. In Abborravan Stratiotes seems well-adapted to survive the prevailing, hard, winter conditions. Freezing in situ is quite normal and is only lethal if the overwintering basal rosettes become frozen solid. The turions are quite frost-hardy.

Estimating lake ice thickness in Central Ontario	PLOS ONE												Lakes are a key geographical feature in Canada and have an impact on the regional climate. In the winter, they are important for recreational activities such as snowmobiling and ice fishing and act as part of an important supply route for northern communities. The ability to accurately report lake ice characteristics such as thickness is vital, however, it is underreported in Canada and there is a lack of lake ice thickness records for temperate latitude areas such as Central Ontario. Here, we evaluate the application of previously developed temperature models and RADARSAT-2 for estimating lake ice thickness in Central Ontario and provide insight into the regions long term ice thickness variability. The ALS Environmental Science Shallow Water Ice Profiler (SWIP) was used for validation of both temperature and radar-based models. Results indicate that the traditional approach that uses temperatures to predict ice thickness during ice growth has low RMSE values of 2.3 cm and correlations of greater than 0.9. For ice decay, similar low RMSE values of 2.1 cm and high correlations of 0.97 were found. Using RADARSAT-2 to estimate ice thickness results in R-2 values of 0.6 (p < 0.01) but high RMSE values of 11.7 cm. Uncertainty in the RADARSAT-2 approach may be linked to unexplored questions about scattering mechanisms and the interaction of radar signal with mid-latitude lake ice. The application of optimized temperature models to a long-term temperature record revealed a thinning of ice cover by 0.81 cm per decade.

Impact of toxaphene residues in United States soils	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A coupled atmospheric transport model was employed to study six scenarios to assess the contribution of reemission and long-range transport of toxaphene from different sources in the United States to its environmental fate in the Great Lakes ecosystem in the year 2000. Modeled air concentrations at the first model level (1.5 m) range from less than 5 pg m(-3) over the upper Great lakes (Lakes Superior and Huron)to several tens of picograms per cubic meter over the lower Great Lakes (Lakes Erie and Ontario) in the summer but drop off to the range from 0.05 to 2 pg m(-3) in the wintertime. The modeled toxaphene depositions to the lakes suggest a decreasing trend from the mid-1990s to 2000. Modeling results showed that, on an annual basis, for the Great Lakes basin as a whole, the southeast U.S. sources made the largest contribution to the toxaphene air concentrations and dry and wet depositions at 72%, 78%, and 88% respectively. The model results also showed that a significant proportion of these contributions occur during relatively short episodic events due primarily to the interseasonal changes in atmospheric circulation patterns.

Timing and cause of water level fluctuations in Kluane Lake, Yukon Territory, over the past 5000 years	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We reconstructed late Holocene fluctuations of Kluane Lake in Yukon Territory front variations in bulk physical properties and carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic abundances in nine sediment cores. Fluctuations of Kluane Lake in the past were controlled by changes in climate and glaciers, which affected inflow of Slims and Duke rivers, the two largest Sources of water flowing into the lake. Kluane Lake fluctuated within a narrow range, at levels about 25 m below the present datum, from about 5000 to 1300 cal yr BP. Low lake levels during this interval are probably due to southerly drainage of Kluane Lake to the Pacific Ocean, opposite the present northerly drainage to Bering Sea. Slims River, which today is the largest contributor of water to Kluane Lake, only rarely flowed into the lake during the period 5000 to 1300 cal yr BP. The lake rose 7-12 m between 1300 and 900 cal yr BP, reached its present level around AD 1650, and within a few decades had risen an additional 12 m. Shortly thereafter, the take established a northern outlet and fell to near its present level. (C) 2008 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

Physocypria kraepelini was commonly found in the lake while the others were recorded in particular months. UPGMA analyses clustered three groups based on their occurrence. Accordingly, the occurrence of species (C. candida, E. virens, and T. lutaria) was positive and significantly related to each other. Two species, P. kraepelini and D. stevensoni, showed a significant positive relationship with electrical conductivity. A significant negative correlation was found between the occurrence of P. kraepelini and dissolved oxygen, while there was a significant positive correlation between the occurrence of P. kraepelini and turbidity. About 76% of the relationship between species and environmental factors was explained by the first two axes of canonical correspondence analyses (CCA). Temperature and dissolved oxygen were the two most important influences on the species assemblages. All species showed different but high optima and tolerance ranges, corresponding with their cosmopolitan characteristics. These responses may be related to unstable ecological characteristics of Lake Aladag, which is often subjected to human activity.

Evaluation of stocking programs is important given the cost and effort involved in using this management strategy. We evaluated the initial contribution of stocked largemouth bass fingerlings in 15 lakes across Illinois during two years. Abundance of stocked largemouth bass fingerlings varied considerably across lakes, ranging from 0 to 23 stocked fish per hour of electrofishing during the first fall. Initial stocking mortality was low and was not an important factor in determining overall survival. Predation rates on stocked fish were high in some lakes, suggesting that losses of stocked fish to adult largemouth bass can be an important source of mortality. There was no relationship, however, between predator abundance and survival of stocked bass. In contrast, abundance of appropriately sized bluegill prey was positively correlated with survival. Natural recruitment of largemouth bass also varied across lakes, but was not related to stocking success. Our results indicate that the usefulness of supplemental stocking as a management strategy will vary among lakes. Additional research regarding the importance of predator and prey populations are needed to determine lake characteristics most favorable for stocking largemouth bass.																			0892-2284		1-888569-38-7				2002	31						639	647																WOS:000180817600053

Westerlies effect in Holocene paleoclimate records from the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Our knowledge of the influence of the Westerlies on the hydroclimate of High Mountain Asia during the Holocene, especially during the mid-Holocene, remains poorly understood, limiting our understanding of the controlling mechanisms of past climate change in this region. Assessing the impact of the westerly winds has proven to be a challenge due to a lack of direct indicators. In this study, we summarize the influence of the Westerlies reflected in Holocene paleoclimate records from the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (CQTP). This is the transitional zone of atmospheric circulation where the climate is drier under the influence of westerly winds than under monsoonal influences. We identify two types of "Westerlies effect", emerging at 13-11 ka (I) and 7-2 ka (II), and then assess potential circulation mechanisms by examining circulation indices and developing a Westerlies effect index (WEI) in combination with modern observations of precipitation stable isotopes. The WEI integrates signals of two independent environmental indicators, leaf wax delta D from Linggo Co and median grain size from Chibuzhang Co. We observe two types of Westerlies effects: Type I prevailed in the Late Glacial, and Type II occurred under the cool conditions of the mid- to late Holocene (7.0-4.5 ka and 3.5-2.0 ka on the CQTP). During the times of Type II Westerlies effects, circulation affecting regional atmospheric precipitation appears to have shifted from being dominated by the South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM) to a monsoon-westerly transition state with relatively lower total effective moisture. However, compared with the driest periods (e.g. the Younger Dryas), the westerly jets still brought considerable precipitation, especially in non-monsoon seasons, and even helped to maintain moderate lake water levels. The asynchronous relationship between lake levels (water balance) and atmospheric circulation patterns since similar to 2.0 ka indicates that air mass source (marine and continental) and trajectory can influence rates of water recycling and/or re-evaporation. This study sheds light on the hydrological processes and environmental dynamics associated with the interplay between the westerly winds and the monsoons on the QTP and indicates that at times during the Holocene the Westerlies played a more prominently role in delivering moisture to the region (especially the transitional zone) than was previously thought.

Sedimentological patterns in the outcrops indicate deposition in sublittoral to profundal environments where fine-grained, suspension fall-out sediments are intercalated with various types of mass transport deposits, most commonly turbidites. The ostracod fauna, consisting of 30 taxa, is dominated by endemic species of the brackish Lake Pannon. The assemblages indicate a mixture of deep-water (sublittoral to profundal) species, such as Paratethyan Candoninae, and shallow-water (littoral) species, belonging to Cyprideis, Loxoconcha, Amnicythere and Hemicytheria. The mixed character of the assemblages is most probably a consequence of the reworking of littoral specimens into deeper environments, a phenomenon also observed in the molluscan fauna from some of the investigated outcrops. Alternatively, some endemic and extinct species of the littoral genera might have adapted to the deep-water environment. A significant decrease in the abundance and diversity of ostracods from west to east is interpreted reflecting increasingly distal environments. The ostracod fauna indicates the Hemicytheria hungarica (2 outcrops), Hemicytheria tenuistriata (3 outcrops), and Propontoniella candeo Zones (2 outcrops) of the lower Pannonian Slavonian Substage.					; SZTANO, Orsolya/AAN-8741-2021	Sztano, Orsolya/0000-0003-0786-3653; Pipik, Radovan/0000-0001-6646-5984													1330-030X	1333-4875					2016	69	2					213	229		10.4154/gc.2016.16	http://dx.doi.org/10.4154/gc.2016.16													WOS:000378916900007
J	Pulkkanen, M; Salonen, K				Pulkkanen, Merja; Salonen, Kalevi			Accumulation of low-oxygen water in deep waters of ice-covered lakes cooled below 4 °C	INLAND WATERS												We studied vertical distribution of oxygen under the ice of 5 medium-sized, morphologically variable lakes that cooled well below 4 degrees C before freezing. In the upper part of the water column, dissolved oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations generally remained vertically almost uniform, but in the deepest water, concentrations changed rapidly near the bottom. The coincidence of the changes with an increase in deep water temperature shows that they were due to advection of water made heavier by the heat flux from the sediment. Consequently, water with low concentrations of dissolved oxygen and high concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon accumulated in the deepest part of the lake (i.e., outcome of sediment respiration on a large area was focused to a limited volume of the lake). This conclusion was supported by the results of an experiment in which water samples incubated at different depths showed no vertical differences in oxygen consumption. Our results show that temperature-dependent hydrodynamics affect under-ice oxygen conditions in medium-sized temperate lake basins. Interannual variation in water temperature and differences in morphology between lake basins probably cause significant variations in the accumulation of water in the deepest layers during winter.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2013	3	1					15	24		10.5268/IW-3.1.514	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-3.1.514													WOS:000318267100002

In this study, we investigated the use of multispectral imagery to monitor the winter evolution of land cover in the Albufera wetland (Spain), using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets. With multispectral data, the frequency of observation is limited by the possible presence of clouds. To overcome this problem, the data acquired by the two missions, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, were jointly used, thus roughly halving the revisit time. The varied types of land cover were grouped into four classes: (1) open water, (2) mosaic of water, mud and vegetation, (3) bare soil and (4) vegetated soil. The automatic classification of the four classes was obtained through a rule-based method that combined the NDWI, MNDWI and NDVI indices. Point information, provided by geo-located ground pictures, was spatially extended with the help of a very high-resolution image (GeoEye-1). In this way, surfaces with known land cover were obtained and used for the validation of the classification method. The overall accuracy was found to be 0.96 and 0.98 for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, respectively. The consistency evaluation between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 was performed in six days, in which acquisitions by both missions were available. The observed dynamics of the land cover were highly variable in space. For example, the presence of the open water condition lasted for around 60-80 days in the areas closest to the Albufera lake and progressively decreased towards the boundaries of the park. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using moderate-resolution multispectral images to monitor land cover changes in wetland environments.

The abundance of total Microcystis and MC-producing Microcystis genotypes was quantified based on the 16S rDNA and mcyD gene using real-time PCR. The results showed that atmospheric CO2 elevation would significantly decrease the pH value and increase the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration. Changes in CO2 concentration did not show significant influence on the abundance of total Microcystis population. However, CO2 concentrations may be an important factor in determining the subpopulation structure of Microcystis. The enhancement of CO2 concentrations could largely increase the competitive ability of non-MC-producing over MC-producing Microcystis, resulting in a higher proportion of non-MC-producing subpopulation in treatments using high CO2 concentrations. Concurrently, MC concentration in water declined when CO2 concentrations were elevated. Therefore, we concluded that the increase of CO2 concentrations might decrease potential health risks of MC for human and animals in the future.

J	Bernot, RJ; Dodds, WK; Quist, MC; Guy, CS				Bernot, RJ; Dodds, WK; Quist, MC; Guy, CS			Spatial and temporal variability of zooplankton in a great plains reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal and daily patterns of zooplankton populations are often predictable in natural lakes. Distinct zonation and geomorphic differences in reservoirs, however, make ecological extrapolations from lakes to reservoirs uncertain. We describe the spatial and temporal distribution of zooplankton, algae, and water clarity across reservoir zones and along a depth gradient in Glen Elder Reservoir, Kansas. Daphnia species were most abundant in the lacustrine zone, with D. pulicaria numerically dominant in early spring and D. mendotae dominant later in 1999 and 2000. Rotifers (Keratella quadrata, Asplanchna spp.) were dominant in the riverine zone in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Algal biomass was not significantly different between zones through most of the sampling periods, except late April in 1999 and mid-April in 2000. Chlorophyll a exceeded 81 mug l(-1) in the lacustrine zone in mid- to late-April in 1999 and 2000, and exceeded 90 mug l(-1) in the riverine zone in mid- April. Water clarity was significantly lower in the riverine zone in 1999 and 2000. Most zooplankton taxa had similar depth distributions at night and day, indicating a lack of diel vertical migration behavior on a large scale. However, in small scale (30 cm vertical enclosures) laboratory experiments, both D. pulicaria and D. mendotae occupied significantly deeper depths (>25 cm) under lighted conditions in the presence of fish chemical cues compared to shallow water (7-17 cm) under dark conditions and in the absence of fish cues. These contrasting results suggest that, as in other studies, Daphnia sense cues from predators and alter their depth in the water column on small scales without natural constraints on movement and choices. However, other factors in the reservoir such as wind-generated water movements and cues from other predators may prevent depth choices similar to those seen under controlled conditions. These results illustrate biotic and abiotic differences between riverine and lacustrine zones in a large reservoir, and contrast with Daphnia depth segregation and migration patterns in natural lakes.

Sediment cores from four different reservoirs were examined. These represent a broad range of trophic conditions (Neunzehnhain - oligotrophic; Muldenberg - oligotrophic, acidic, dystrophic; Saidenbach - mesotrophic; Quitzdorf - highly eutrophic). The vertical concentration gradients in the interstitial water of the examined sediments showed the tendencies characteristic of the trophic state of the reservoirs. The gradients increased with the trophic state, which affected the release of dissolved substances. The internal P load was substantial in all cases, in Quitzdorf it even exceeded the external P load. The total cell numbers of the bacteria in the sediment were only slightly influenced by the trophic state, all being in the same order of magnitude. The reservoir Quitzdorf displayed very high P release rates from the sediment and mass growths of Microcystis with a high content of intracellular polyphosphate granules in the summer months.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2003	88	5					508	518		10.1002/iroh.200310596	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200310596													WOS:000185891100006

Satellite monitoring of harmful algal blooms in the Western Basin of Lake Erie: A 20-year time-series	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Blooms of harmful cyanobacteria (cyanoHABs) have occurred on an annual basis in western Lake Erie for more than a decade. Previously, we developed and validated an algorithm to map the extent of the submerged and surface scum components of cyanoHABs using MODIS ocean-color satellite data. The algorithm maps submerged cyanoHABs by identifying high chlorophyll concentrations (>18 mg/m(3)) combined with water temperature >20 degrees C, while cyanoHABs surface scums are mapped using near-infrared reflectance values. Here, we adapted this algorithm for the SeaWiFS sensor to map the annual areal extents of cyanoHABs in the Western Basin of Lake Erie for the 20-year period from 1998 to 2017. The resulting classified maps were validated by comparison with historical in situ measurements, exhibiting good agreement (81% accuracy). Trends in the annual mean and maximum total submerged and surface scum extents demonstrated significant positive increases from 1998 to 2017. There was also an apparent 76% increase in year-to-year variability of mean annual extent between the 1998-2010 and 2011-2017 periods. The 1998-2017 time-series was also compared with several different river discharge nutrient loading metrics to assess the ability to predict annual cyanoHAB extents. The prediction models displayed significant relationships between spring discharge and cyanoHAB area; however, substantial variance remained unexplained due in part to the presence of very large blooms occurring in 2013 and 2015. This new multi-sensor time-series and associated statistics extend the current understanding of the extent, location, duration, and temporal patterns of cyanoHABs in western Lake Erie.

A fully-stochasticized, age-structured population model for population viability analysis of fish: Lower Missouri River endangered pallid sturgeon example	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We develop a fully-stochasticized, age-structured population model suitable for population viability analysis (PVA) of fish and demonstrate its use with the endangered pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) of the Lower Missouri River as an example. The model incorporates three levels of variance: parameter variance (uncertainty about the value of a parameter itself) applied at the iteration level, temporal variance (uncertainty caused by random environmental fluctuations over time) applied at the"time-step level, and implicit individual variance (uncertainty caused by differences between individuals) applied within the time-step level. We found that population dynamics were most sensitive to survival rates, particularly age-2+ survival, and to fecundity-at-length. The inclusion of variance (unpartitioned or partitioned), stocking, or both generally decreased the influence of individual parameters on population growth rate. The partitioning of variance into parameter and temporal components had a strong influence on the importance of individual parameters, uncertainty of model predictions, and quasiextinction risk (i.e., pallid sturgeon population size falling below 50 age-1+ individuals). Our findings show that appropriately applying variance in PVA is important when evaluating the relative importance of parameters, and reinforce the need for better and more precise estimates of crucial life-history parameters for pallid sturgeon.

J	Munkes, B				Munkes, B			Eutrophication, phase shift, the delay and the potential return in the Greifswalder Bodden, Baltic Sea	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Between the 1950s and 1980s concentrations of inorganic nutrients increased in the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea, including the Greifswalder Bodden. As a consequence, phytoplankton concentrations and suspended solids increased strongly and the light penetration decreased substantially. An increased turbidity led to a phase shift from a macrophyte-dominated to a phytoplanktondominated ecosystem. Within 30 years, macrophyte cover declined from 90% to 15%. Macrophyte depth limit decreased from 14 m to 6 m in the Bodden. After 1985, nutrient loading declined strongly. Although nutrient loads in the Greifswalder Bodden were reduced (a 50% decrease in phosphate concentration and a 40% decrease in nitrogen concentration) in the last 15 years, an expected improvement in water quality did not coincide. Light conditions improved slightly and macrophytes showed no recovery. Possible reasons for the slow improvement are internal loading and subsequent release of iron-bound phosphorus from sediments. This process sustains continuous high nutrient concentrations in the water column and facilitates the high growth and dominance of phytoplankton. During summer, an abundant Cyanobacteria community fuels phytoplankton dominance. In addition, heavy losses in macrophyte cover result in an increase in sediment resuspensation, which leads to a reduced light penetration. There is no sign of any change in current conditions.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				SEP	2005	67	3					372	381		10.1007/s00027-005-0761-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-005-0761-x													WOS:000232030000014

Migratory birds were thought to play a role in the long-distance spread of H5N1. This study identified 7 high-risk species and 18 potential high-risk species that may transmit H5N1 into Poyang Lake and determined four resident bird species as "bridge species" that may disperse H5N1 around the lake. The high-risk species were selected according to the following behavioral and ecological factors: migratory status, abundance, degree of mixing of species and gregariousness, migration from or stopovers at epidemic areas, and previous infection status. Among the 25 high-risk and potential high-risk species, 22 belonged to the orders Anseriformes (n = 11) and Charadriiformes (n = 11). The risk of intra-species transmission was high for Anseriformes (ducks and geese) and Charadriiformes birds, and was relatively low for Gruiformes and Ciconiiformes birds. This study can be informative and useful in the surveillance of avian influenza epidemics at breeding, stopover, and wintering sites other than Poyang Lake along the East Asian-Australian Flyway.					wu, xudong/KGL-1857-2024														0030-9923					DEC	2014	46	6					1545	1555																WOS:000347366100010

The Temes (Tamis/Timis) River flooded several hundred km, with many settlements. The extent of the flood was partly unexpected, especially in positional sense. In order to achieve a better understanding of the phenomenon, we analysed the SRTM digital elevation model as well as historical maps. Several historical maps, dating back to the 16th century, indicate marshland or even a large lake in the area, not existing today but almost exactly coinciding with the extent of the 2005 flood. The historical and archive maps document the water regulation measures taken since the early 19th century. The actual flood is found to be a sort of a restoration of the original natural conditions. Via the analysis of the DEM and historical maps the unexpected extent of the flood scenario can be explained and understood. We suggest that an analysis of historical and archive maps, combined (geo-referenced) with high-resolution DEMS in other flood-endangered areas, should be used in order to be better prepared for decadal or centennial flood events induced by climatic change.

J	Curry, BB; Baker, RG				Curry, BB; Baker, RG			Palaeohydrology, vegetation, and climate since the late Illinois Episode (∼130 ka) in south-central Illinois	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					9th International Palynological Congress	JUN 23-28, 1996	HOUSTON, TEXAS					Our interpretation of pollen and ostracode successions from four basins in south-central Illinois provides a new synthesis of palaeovegetation, palaeohydrology, and palaeoclimate for the period from the late Illinois Episode (about 130,000 years ago) to near the end of the Wisconsin Episode (about 25,000 years ago). Correlations of pollen biozones between Raymond, Pittsburg, and Bald Knob basins are the basis for identifying the late Illinois glacial, Sangamon interglacial, Wisconsin glacial, and Hudson interglacial episodes. Glacial episodes were identified primarily by the presence of Picea pollen and the ostracode Limnocythere friabilis, whereas interglacial episodes were identified by Quercus pollen and by the ostracodes Candona caudata and Heterocypris punctata. Within interglacial and glacial episodes, pollen and ostracode assemblages varied with changes in moisture balance. Local palaeohydrology was assessed primarily on the basis of environmental tolerance indices of ostracodes and the stable isotope (C,O) stratigraphy of ostracodal calcite. Regional moisture balance was assessed from multivariate analyses of the pollen successions. Three climatic regimes occurred during the Sangamon Episode. (1) One regime was characterised by precipitation exceeding evaporation that promoted basin overflow. This climate was inferred from the high percentages (generally >80%) of deciduous-forest pollen. Peaks in the abundance of Liquidambar and Fagus pollen indicate that winters may have been slightly warmer, and effective moisture slightly greater, than at present. (2) The second climatic regime was continental, similar to the present climate of Illinois in which precipitation is equal to or just less than evaporation. This climate is inferred from abundant Ambrosia pollen (40 to 60%) and abundant nektic (swimming) ostracode valves which suggest a shallow lake. These conditions probably developed in association with a 'heat-low' over the interior of North America during marine oxygen isotope stages 5e and 5c, Associated with the transition between the first two climates are fossils of the subtropical ostracode Heterocypris punctata and the giant tortoise Geochelone crassiscutata that suggest short periods in winter when polar low-pressure systems did not extend into Illinois as they do today. (3) The third climatic regime occur-red during the transition from the Sangamon interglacial episode to the Wisconsin glacial episode. A severely continental climate is indicated by the heat-tolerant ostracode Pelocypris tuberculatum, variable delta(18)O values of ostracode valves, and high environmental tolerance index values for the ostracode assemblages. The weedy Chenopodiaceae and Amaranthaceae families grew on exposed mudflats, The tree pollen associated with this type of climate included low percentages of Picea and Liquidambar, an assemblage that has no modem analogue, We suggest that this transitional climatic regime was associated with the large-scale changes in the climate system during marine oxygen isotope stage 4.

Disentangling the relative importance of multiple processes driving cyanobacteria blooms is difficult, in part because traditional monitoring programs often lack adequate temporal resolution, and in part because many studies seek to identify a single dominant mechanism. In this study, a holistic approach was used to identify multiple drivers of a strong cyanobacterial bloom over time in a shallow, eutrophic bay of Lake Champlain utilizing high-temporal-resolution meteorological, water quality, and biogeochemical sensor data; an intensive field sampling program; and a long-term monitoring dataset In contrast to studies in similar systems, spring runoff and nutrient loads could not explain the severity of the 2012 bloom. Instead, internal nutrient loading and hydrodynamic conditions mediated shifts in resource limitation. The cyanobacteria growth phase was associated with the depletion of available nitrogen and sediment phosphorus release. The peak bloom stage was characterized by multiple limiting resources and stable water column conditions. The decline phase of the bloom was associated with light limitation brought about by wind mixing, and was punctuated by a major storm event, which brought a major biogeochemical shift in the lake system. This study illustrates the complexity of cyanobacteria resource limitation in response to internal and external forcing over time, and also the power of comprehensive monitoring approaches in disentangling complex drivers of eutrophic ecosystem function that vary across temporal and spatial scales.

Using Stable Isotopes to Determine the Water Balance of Utah Lake (Utah, USA)	HYDROLOGY												To investigate the hydrology of Utah Lake, we analyzed the hydrogen (delta H-2) and oxygen (delta O-18) stable isotope composition of water samples collected from the various components of its system. The average delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of the inlets are similar to the average values of groundwater, which in turn has a composition that is similar to winter precipitation. This suggests that snowmelt-fed groundwater is the main source of Utah Valley river waters. In addition, samples from the inlets plot close to the local meteoric water line, suggesting that no significant evaporation is occurring in these rivers. In contrast, the lake and its outlet have higher average delta-values than the inlets and plot along evaporation lines, suggesting the occurrence of significant evaporation. Isotope data also indicate that the lake is poorly mixed horizontally, but well mixed vertically. Calculations based on mass balance equations provide estimates for the percentage of input water lost by evaporation (similar to 47%), for the residence time of water in the lake (similar to 0.5 years), and for the volume of groundwater inflow (similar to 700 million m(3)) during the period April to November. The short water residence time and the high percentage of total inflow coming from groundwater might suggest that the lake is more susceptible to groundwater pollution than to surface water pollution.

While rivers and lakes are abundant, they are vulnerable to contamination and may become dry in winter due to freezing. Groundwater can often provide a more secure and sustainable water source, however its availability is limited in northern Canada due to the presence of permafrost. Moreover, the exploitation of northern aquifers poses a dual challenge of identifying not only permafrost-free areas, but also permeable areas which will allow groundwater recharge and exploitation. Suitable aquifers are not as common in northern Canada since the shallow subsurface is mostly composed of low-permeability crystalline rocks or unconsolidated sediments of glacial origin that are highly heterogeneous. In order to investigate groundwater occurrence and associated geological contexts in Nunavik (northern Quebec, Canada), along with exploring how these resources will evolve in response to climate change, field and compilation work were conducted in the surroundings of the four villages of Salluit, Kuujjuaq, Umiujaq and Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik. These villages are located in different permafrost zones, ranging from continuous to discontinuous, as well as in different geological environments. It was found that despite the ubiquitous presence of permafrost, unfrozen aquifers could be identified, which suggests that groundwater may be available as a source of drinking water for small communities. Expected climate change, with predicted permafrost thawing and increases in temperature and precipitation, should enhance groundwater availability and may contribute to a more secure source of drinking water for northern communities.

Geochemical dynamics of phosphorus and metals in sediments of a shallow coastal lake (Xuño Lake, Galicia-NW Iberian Peninsula)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The shallow lakes are important freshwater ecosystems, since they support much of biodiversity and ecosystem services of life on land. Shallow lakes are highly dynamic ecological entities that can exist in several alternative stable states through regime shift caused by a natural or human disturbance that exceeds ecological thresholds for biological communities composition and structure equilibria. The sediment as a reservoir has a key role in the limnological regulation of wetlands linked to the fluxes of nutrients and elements in the biogeochemical interplay with the water and macrophytes. For this reason, the role of sediment in the limnology of the shallow coastal lake of Xuno (NW Iberian Peninsula) was explored by seasonally monitoring the chemical composition of water and sediments, also according to macrophyte species. The shallow depth determines the high availability of light in the bottom and a well-mixed water column maintain the surface of the water-sediment interface oxygenated. The oxic conditions of the bottom implies a top-down regulation of the water column in the Xuno shallow lake that limits the diffusion of phosphorus and trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, and Co) to the water, buffering eutrophication or contamination levels by immobilization in the sediments. In fact, the concentration of Hg in the lake water in spring, and also its bioavailability, are high due to its release from the sediment in suboxic conditions. The cover of helophyte species Phragmites Australis and Schoenoplectus Lacustris showed differences in the assimilation of organic monoester and diester phosphorus forms in the sediment. However, the water of the Xuno Lake shows an eutrophic status by the nutrient input associated with the birds populations as indicated by microbiological data.

The Cenozoic tectonics and volcanic activity of west-central Mexico have produced a set of lakes in warmer and drier conditions compared to lakes of central Mexico. Nevertheless, the Holocene landscape dynamics for this area remains understudied. Using age-depth models, OSL and multi-element chemistry analysis of sediments in the lakes of San Marcos and Sayula we explore the landscape dynamics from early Holocene present of west-central Mexico. Our results indicate that the sedimentation rates in San Marcos Lake notably increased from 240 yr BP to the present. Since AD 1950 the sedimentation rate in Sayula Lake rose fourfold the rates of the last 2000 years. Analysis of OSL and chemistry of major elements of sediments indicates that IRSL/BLSL strongly correlates with Ti/Al (R-2 = 0.93) and with the mean monthly rainfall (R-2 = 0.70). We propose that the IRSL/BLSL can be used as a proxy to infer past changes in landscape dynamics. Analysis of climatic data from the 1950s to present indicates that rainfall, and consequently water runoff, is enhanced in summers free of ENSO conditions. Extreme one-day rainfall can, however, exceed mean seasonal rainfall and occur in all phases of ENSO. Droughts are particularly severe in the phase of La Nina. Our results indicate that the erosion rate in San Marcos Lake was high from similar to 8000 to similar to 7000 yr BP in a period coinciding with the advance and recession of glaciers in Central Mexico, however, the erosion rates in the last 165 years have surpassed the rates of the early to mid-Holocene. By constraining the age of sediment and using environmental proxies such as the Ti/Al and IRSL/BLSL from lake sediments of Sayula and San Marcos we present the first model of landscape dynamics of this part of Mexico from the Early Holocene to present times.

Eradication of an invasive cyprinid (Gila bicolor) to achieve water quality goals in Diamond Lake, Oregon (USA)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Eilers JM, Truemper HA, Jackson LS, Eilers BJ, Loomis DW. 2011. Eradication of an invasive cyprinid (Gila bicolor) to achieve water quality goals in Diamond Lake, Oregon (USA). Lake Reserv Manage. 27: 194-204. We used a case study of whole-lake fish removal to demonstrate the importance of the fish community to nutrient cycling in Diamond Lake, Oregon, USA, to meet regulated water quality standards for pH, dissolved oxygen and nuisance algae. The cyprinid tui chub (Gila bicolor) was removed through a process beginning with netting and ending with a whole-lake and tributary rotenone treatment in September 2006. The lake was stocked with rainbow trout in spring 2007. Between 2007 and 2009, lake transparency increased 250%, accompanied by decreases in epilimnetic pH, total nitrogen, and total organic carbon. Mean concentrations of total phosphorus and ortho-phosphorus remained unchanged in epilimnetic waters. Chlorophyll a, phytoplankton biovolume, Anabaena biovolume, and Anabaena cell density declined. Daphnia pulicaria, a large herbivorous cladoceran virtually absent for 10 years, returned in abundance, and benthic biomass increased more than 12-fold. The project successfully demonstrated that water quality and fishery goals can be met through eradication of the invasive cyprinid. Fish populations need to be considered in some lakes to achieve water quality standards.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2011	27	3					194	204		10.1080/07438141.2011.590269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2011.590269													WOS:000299477100002

However, their separate potential contributions to precipitation changes are not well understood due to their complex interactions. Hence, a trajectory-based method was used to separate their potential contributions across national, regional and local scales in China. Precipitation changes in non-urban regions can be regarded as representing the influence of climate change and can serve as a reference for isolating precipitation changes due to urbanization in urban areas. Our results revealed that climate change was the dominant factor for precipitation trends, while urbanization exhibited a relatively weak influence, especially for extreme precipitation at the national scale. At the regional scale, the impacts of urbanization on precipitation became more significant. About 20.2 and -30.6% of positive and negative trends in total precipitation originated from urbanization. At the local scale, the potential contribution of urbanization was strongly correlated with local environmental characteristics. Although there were differences in the potential contributions of climate change and urbanization at national, regional and local scales, climate change was the dominant factor for precipitation trends and urbanization acted as a regulator to drying or wetting due to precipitation under climate change. In general, urbanization causes a greater impact on total precipitation than on precipitation extremes. Due to this, attribution approach is static and broad-based and does not render the level of confidence that is needed for scale-aware attribution, future studies are needed to understand the physical mechanisms of impacts of local environment changes on precipitation trends at different geographical locations over China.					; Singh, Prahat/HZH-4129-2023; Jianfeng, Li/AFD-9378-2022	Gu, Xihui/0000-0002-1924-9282; Li, Jianfeng/0000-0002-9288-3415													0899-8418	1097-0088				MAY	2019	39	6					2998	3012		10.1002/joc.5997	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5997													WOS:000465863900010

Samples were taken from the trophogenic water layer during summer stratification periods. Image analysis techniques with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) as well as [H-3]-methyl-thymidine incorporation methods were applied to analyze differences in the composition and activity of bacterial communities. The greatest differences in trophic parameters were found between the humic lake and remaining non-humic ones. The same bacterial and heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) cell size classes dominated in all the studied lakes. However, distinct increases in the contributions of large bacterial (>1.0 mu m) and HNF (>10 mu m) cells were observed in eutrophic lakes. The bacterial community was dominated by the beta-Proteobacteria group, which accounted for 27% of total DAPI counts. Ciliate communities were largely composed of Oligotrichida. Positive correlations between bacteria and protists, as well as between nanoflagellates (both heterotrophic and autotrophic) and ciliates, suggest that concentrations of food sources may be important in determining the abundance of protists in the studied lakes.

J	Purdie, J; Fitzharris, B				Purdie, J; Fitzharris, B			Processes and rates of ice loss at the terminus of Tasman Glacier, New Zealand	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE					International Symposium on Glaciers of the Southern Hemisphere	JUL 07-09, 1997	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA	Int Commiss Snow & Ice				The Tasman Glacier is the largest glacier in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Despite a century of climate warming, the glacier has until recently remained at its "Little Ice Age" terminus position, although there has been substantial downwasting. The lower glacier is covered by an extensive debris layer, which has redistributed ice losses in both space and time compared to the conventional glacier response to climate change. Ice is lost at the terminus through melt of bare ice slopes, melt under the debris layer, and calving of ice into a newly established pro-glacial lake. Over the past ten years, the glacier has evolved from an ablation regime of melt under the debris and around sinkholes, to one where calving into the lake is of greater importance. This study investigates the processes and rates of ice loss at the terminus during the summer of 1995. Melt rates of ice are greatest on bare ice slopes, averaging 96 mm day(-1) of ice depth over the summer period. Melt under the debris averaged 7 mm day(-1), and calving accounted for a specific ice loss of 125 mm day(-1). Overall, calving is the dominant form of ice loss at the terminus, accounting for 73% of the total. Melt under the debris layer accounted for 26% of terminus ablation, and melt on bare ice slopes just 1%, due to the relatively small area covered by these. Ice loss at the terminus is therefore largely de-coupled from climatic influences, and due mainly to the effect of the pro-glacial lake. However, when water loss from the whole ablation zone of the glacier is considered, calving accounts for just 4% of ice loss, with the largest portion of ice loss (80%) coming from melt on bare ice upstream of the debris cover. A total amount of 21 million m(3) a(-1) of water is estimated to be supplied to Tasman River due to ice loss from the lowest 4 km(2) of glacier. 135 million m(3) a(-1) of water is estimated to be lost below Ball Hut (approximately 10 km up-glacier), with 20% of this being calved from the terminus. This proportion will increase as the glacier terminus retreats up the valley, but at present rates, it will take over a century for the glacier to retreat to Ball Hut. Water stored as ice and then released from Tasman Glacier is resulting in a mean annual flow into Lake Pukaki of 4.3 m(3) s(-1). The water released from all glaciers in the region due to glacier ice loss is 6% of the annual inflow to Lake Pukaki. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Experimental study of heat and momentum exchange between a forest lake and the atmosphere in winter	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES (CITES-2017)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				8th International Conference on Computational Information Technologies for Environmental Sciences (CITES)	SEP 04-07, 2017	Zvenigorod, RUSSIA	RAS, SB , Inst Monitoring Climat & Ecol Syst, RAS, Inst Numer Math, Hydrometeorol Ctr Russian Federat, RAS, A M Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys				The article presents the results of an experimental study of turbulent heat exchange between the surface of a frozen lake surrounded by forest and the atmospheric boundary layer. Heat and momentum fluxes were measured at three levels by an eddy covariance (EC) technique. Additionally, the heat fluxes were estimated by a surface energy balance method using a temperature profile measured in the snow cover and net longwave and shortwave radiation. The results of the measurements show that the eddy covariance fluxes correlate well with those obtained by the surface energy balance method, with a tendency of underestimation. The presence of wind-shear effects at treetop height demonstrated recently in a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) [3] was supported in our measurements by the fact that the momentum flux increased with height from the surface. The negative sensible heat flux increased with height most of the time. We suggest that this phenomenon may partially be caused by the high negative heat fluxes above the surface formed when warm advection occurs at altitudes of similar to 100 m. During the warm advection events, Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) fails to reproduce the sharp increase of the negative heat flux at the surface layer. Beyond the warm advection events, the MOST calculations agree well with the EC fluxes, however, with some systematic underestimation bias.					; Gavrikov, Alexander/R-6905-2016; Repina, Irina/H-3530-2016; Stepanenko, Victor/N-8467-2013; Arseniy, Artamonov/S-2004-2017	Gavrikov, Alexander/0000-0002-4198-4400; Stepanenko, Victor/0000-0003-3033-6712; Repina, Irina/0000-0001-7341-0826													1755-1307						2017	96								012003	10.1088/1755-1315/96/1/012003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/96/1/012003													WOS:000426729700003

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Carbon stable isotope analyses have been widely used to estimate terrestrial carbon contribution to lake secondary production. In such approaches, phytoplankton is tacitly assumed as a single, isotopically homogenous source. Such assumption might be valid if (i) zooplankton do not feed selectively on specific algal taxa within bulk phytoplankton, or (ii) although zooplankton do feed selectively, the variability in the delta(13)C values amongst the different algal taxa is small compared with the variability between the delta(13)C values of bulk phytoplankton and terrestrial end-members. In a summer field study of six coastal lakes of British Columbia, Canada, we tested these assumptions using gut pigments and stable isotope measures on zooplankton and particulate organic matter. Results revealed that filter-feeding cladocerans positively selected cryptophytes, shown to be substantially (13)C-enriched compared with bulk phytoplankton and even with the terrestrial end-member. Comparing a classical two-source mixing model and a model that accounted for algal isotopic heterogeneity, we showed that the use of a classical two-source model can result in an overestimation of terrestrial contribution to zooplankton secondary production.

J	Brancelj, A				Brancelj, Anton			Two new stygobiotic copepod species from the Tibesti area (Northern Chad) and a re-description of Pilocamptus schroederi (van Douwe, 1915)	ZOOTAXA												Between 4th and 18th March 2014, an international group of biologists carried out a hydrobiological expedition to the Ounianga-Tibesti area of northern Chad (Africa). The Tibesti is a desert volcanic area, intersected by the beds of ancient rivers which were active in the Tertiary. In deep canyons there are small water bodies (gueltas/aguelmans), fed by rain and spring water. They are rich in zooplankton, benthos, and even fish, but their groundwater fauna has previously been unknown. Groundwater samples collected in the vicinity of one guelta contained Syncarida, Isopoda, and Copepoda. Among the latter, two new species were recognised, Haplocyclops (H.) henrii sp. nov. and Parastenocaris joi sp. nov., together with a third species, Pilocamptus schroederi (van Douwe, 1915), previously known only from the littoral zone and wet mosses of Lake Victoria. The Tibesti area is thus the third known location of P. schroederi. All these species have a Gondwanaland distribution and are probably relicts of the Tertiary fauna, formerly widespread in the Sahara. Together with descriptions of two new species, a detailed re-description of P. schroederi is presented, along with remarks on their ecology.																			1175-5326	1175-5334				AUG 4	2015	3994	4					531	555		10.11646/zootaxa.3994.4.3	http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.3994.4.3								26250289					WOS:000359361200003

Four of six Tundra Swan nests were in the Kanuti River drainage, and four of seven Trumpeter Swan nests were in the Kanuti-Chalatna Creek drainage. Tundra Swan nest lakes averaged 169 +/- 7% (CV) m elevation, and Trumpeter Swan, 181 +/- 10% m. Combined densities of nests for both species was 1 nest/625 km2 of suitable habitat. Most Tundra Swan nest lakes occurred in meadow, whereas Trumpeter Swans favored forest. Six of eleven and six of sixteen Tundra and Trumpeter pairs had clutches averaging 4.7 +/- 10.1% and 4.0 +/- 15.8% eggs, respectively. Recruitment at fledging was 20% for Tundras and 6-11% for Trumpeters. The present population and available habitat favors he marginal expansion of Trumpeter Swans, though in late years, it is not likely all young would fledge by freeze-up.																			0008-3550					JAN-MAR	1993	107	1					64	68																WOS:A1993MZ02900008
J	GREEN, WJ; CANFIELD, DE; STEINLY, BA				GREEN, WJ; CANFIELD, DE; STEINLY, BA			SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN AND CONTROLS ON THE CALCITE SATURATION INDEX IN ACTON LAKE, OHIO	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Acton Lake is a small, hardwater, eutrophic reservoir located in the southwestern corner of Ohio. Over a period of 5 weeks in mid-summer 1979, water samples were collected from the lake and its streams and analysed for seven major ionic species and for temperature, dissolved O2, pH and conductivity. Geochemically the waters are characterized by high calcium and bicarbonate concentrations. 2. Data obtained on all samples were used to compute calcite saturation indices (SI) and to map the spatial distribution of this function throughout the system. The saturation indices were corrected for activity and ion pairing effects and yet are still to our knowledge among the highest values reported for a natural water. 3. The good correlations obtained between the SI and both the pH and dissolved oxygen clearly indicate that biological activity is the dominant control on the degree of saturation in this largely isothermal lake. To account for the extreme departure from chemical equilibrium, it is proposed that dissolved organic matter may be poisoning freshly formed calcite surfaces and preventing them from from serving as effective nucleation centres.

Bacterioneuston in Lake Baikal: Abundance, Spatial and Temporal Distribution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												An aquatic surface microlayer covers more than 70% of the world's surface. Our knowledge about the biology of the surface microlayer of Lake Baikal, the most ancient lake on Earth with a surface area of 31,500 km(2), is still scarce. The total bacterial abundance, the number of cultured heterotrophic temporal bacteria, and the spatial distribution of bacteria in the surface microlayer and underlying waters of Lake Baikal were studied. For the first time, the chemical composition of the surface microlayer of Lake Baikal was determined. There were significant differences and a direct relationship between the total bacterial abundance in the surface microlayer and underlying waters of Lake Baikal, as well as between the number of cultured heterotrophic bacteria in studied water layers in the period of summer stratification. In the surface microlayer, the share of cultured heterotrophic bacteria was higher than in the underlying waters. The surface microlayer was characterized by enrichment with PO43-, total organic carbon and suspended particulate matter compared to underlying waters. A direct relationship was found between the number of bacteria in the surface microlayer and environmental factors, including temperature, total organic carbon and suspended particulate matter concentration.

J	Kostecki, M				Kostecki, Maciej			DIFFERENCES IN ICE COVER IN THE ANTHROPOGENIC RESERVOIR OF PLAWNIOWICE IN THE YEARS 1986-2012	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												The article presents changes in the thickness and duration of the ice cover found in the restored anthropogenic water reservoir of Plawniowice. It also defines the role the ice cover plays in the formation of the reservoir limnological cycle. Characteristic and significant changeability of the ice cover thickness and duration was observed. The changes in the ice cover demonstrate that they are cyclical but not regular. The ice cover did not always form in the analyzed period. It happened twice, i.e. in 1988 and 2007 (a gap of 20 years). The longest lake freezing period lasted 119 days. Changes in the ice cover duration also show certain periodicity. The shortest periods occurred approx. every 7 years. Maximum values of the ice cover thickness ranged between 10 and 52 cm. There is a relation between the ice cover thickness and its duration period. The rate of increase in the ice cover thickness varied between 0.296 and 3.6 cm/d. The hypolimnion removal impact on the ice cover duration period and thickness was not observed. On the other hand, the ice cover duration period affects the spring circulation duration. Thus, it has an influence on the oxygen balance of the limnic ecosystem.

Geosites are important resources for geotourism development. The eastern and southeastern Lake Tana region in Ethiopia has several geosites with a potential for geotourism development. Despite the diversity of potential geosites and the strategic location of the area in the Northern Tourist Circuit of Ethiopia, only a few attractions such as Lake Tana and the Blue Nile Falls are currently being visited. The objective of this paper is twofold: to inventory geosites in the eastern and southeastern Lake Tana region and assess their potential for geotourism development; and to propose a geosite inventory and assessment methodology for geotourism purposes with adaptations from previous studies. Several studies were reviewed and finally nine of them used as the main references to prepare the criteria, indicators, and sub-indicators for this study. The indicators used for assessing the potential of geosites relate to scientific, educational, scenic, recreational, protection, functional, and ecological values. This research presents the first inventory of geosites in the Lake Tana basin. A first list of 120 geosites has been inventoried. Further screening and clustering resulted in 61 geosites, of which 17 are viewpoints. Among the major geosites are waterfalls, a lake with islands and island monasteries, a flood plain, caves and cave churches, lava tubes, a mountain (shield volcano), volcanic plugs, volcanic cones, rock-hewn churches, and viewpoints. Quantitative assessment of the geotouristic potential of these geosites revealed that clustered (complex area) geosites received higher scientific, scenic, and recreational value scores.

Evapotranspiration estimates from eddy covariance towers and hydrologic modeling in managed forests in Northern Wisconsin, USA	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Direct measurement of ecosystem evapotranspiration by the eddy covariance method and simulation modeling were employed to quantify the growing season (May-October) evapotranspiration (ET) of eight forest ecosystems representing a management gradient in dominant forest types and age classes in the Upper Great Lakes Region from 2002 to 2003. We measured net exchange of water vapor fluxes in a 63-year-old mature hardwood (MHW) stand, a 60-year-old mature red pine (MRP) stand, a 3-year-old young hardwood (YHW) stand, a 17-year-old intermediate hardwood (IHW) stand, a young red pine (YRP age 8) stand, an intermediate red pine (IRP age 21) stand, and two pine barren ecosystems burned 12 years (FBI) and 2 years (PB2) ago. Field data suggested that there were no significant differences in growing season (June-September) ET/precipitation ratio among all ecosystems in 2002. However, PB2 had significantly lower ET/precipitation than those of other ecosystems in 2003. The ratios were much higher for all ecosystems, up to 0.90 for IHW, during the peak summer months (June-July). PB2 was the lowest (0.64) during that period. Stand leaf area index alone did not explain ecosystem ET at the landscape scale. Seasonal ET values measured by the eddy covariance method were significantly lower than those simulated with a process-based hydrologic model, MIKE SHE. Our integration approach combined with field measurements and simulation modeling proved to be useful in providing a full picture of the effects of forest cover type change on landscape scale water balance at multiple temporal scales. The ET procedure used in the MIKE SHE model needs improvement to fully account for the effects of vapor pressure deficit on tree transpiration. Seasonal distributions of ET coincided with precipitation in the growing season, when fluxes estimated by both field and models were the highest. The simulation model suggests that removal of conifer forests in the study region may reduce ET immediately by 113-30 mm/year or about 20%, but our field data suggests that ET can recover within 8-25 years from re-growth of hardwood forests.

J	Boar, RR				Boar, RR			Temporal variations in the nitrogen content of Phragmites australis (Cav) Trin ex Steud from a shallow fertile lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												Despite large differences in the amounts of nitrogen that accumulated in shoots, the amounts of nitrogen stored over a 4 year period in the rhizomes of Phragmites australis from a fertile English lake did not change. Rhizomes sampled in November contained a 4-year mean (+/- SD) of 22 +/- 3 g of nitrogen in an annual mean dry weight of 2360 +/- 290 g m(-2) Shoots contained between 8 +/- 1 g m(-2) and 20 +/- 10 g m(-2) nitrogen in the midsummer of the different years and from 0.2 +/- 0.4 g m(-2) to 18 +/- 7 g m(-2) in November. In the early winters, the mass of nitrogen still contained in standing dead stems was equivalent to between 1% and 49% of the combined shoot and rhizome-nitrogen. Thus, the sometimes large amounts of nitrogen that were potentially available for downward translocation to rhizomes were not reclaimed. This behaviour is typical of relatively open nutrient cycles where, over the longer-term, net storage of incoming nutrients does not occur.																			0304-3770					NOV	1996	55	3					171	181		10.1016/S0304-3770(96)01070-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3770(96)01070-4													WOS:A1996WA20900003

A brGDGT-Based Reconstruction of Terrestrial Temperature From the Maritime Continent Spanning the Last Glacial Maximum	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												The tropics exert enormous influence on global climate. Despite the importance of tropical regions, the terrestrial temperature history in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) region during the last deglaciation is poorly constrained. Although numerous sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions provide estimates of SST warming from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene, the timing of the onset of deglacial warming varies between records and inhibits determining the forcings driving deglacial warming in the IPWP. We present a 60,000-year long temperature reconstruction based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in a sediment core from Lake Towuti, located in Sulawesi, Indonesia. BrGDGTs are bacterial membrane-spanning lipids that, globally, become more methylated with decreasing temperature and more cyclized with decreasing pH. Although changes in temperature are the dominant control on brGDGTs in regional and global calibrations, we find that the cyclization of the brGDGTs is a major mode of variation at Lake Towuti that records important changes in the lacustrine biogeochemical environment. We separate the influence of lake chemistry changes from temperature changes on the brGDGT records, and develop a temperature record spanning the last 60,000 years. The timing of the deglacial warming in our record occurs after the onset of the deglacial increase in CO2 concentrations, which suggests rising greenhouse gas concentrations and the associated radiative forcing may have forced deglacial warming in the IPWP. Peaks in temperature around 55 and 34 ka indicate that Northern Hemisphere summer insolation may also influence land surface temperature in the IPWP region.					; Du, Xiaojing/GPF-6312-2022; Bijaksana, Satria/I-4683-2013	Bijaksana, Satria/0000-0001-6374-4128; Parish, Meredith/0000-0001-7159-3358; Du, Xiaojing/0000-0001-9709-0732													2572-4517	2572-4525				MAR	2023	38	3							e2022PA004501	10.1029/2022PA004501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022PA004501													WOS:001000274600011

Mesozooplankton and microzooplankton grazing during cyanobacterial blooms in the western basin of Lake Erie	HARMFUL ALGAE												Lake Erie is the most socioeconomically important and productive of the Laurentian (North American) Great Lakes. Since the mid-1990s cyanobacterial blooms dominated primarily by Microcystis have emerged to become annual, late summer events in the western basin of Lake Erie yet the effects of these blooms on food web dynamics and zooplankton grazing are unclear. From 2005 to 2007, grazing rates of cultured (Daphnia pulex) and natural assemblages of mesozooplankton and microzooplankton on five autotrophic populations were quantified during cyanobacterial blooms in western Lake Erie. While all groups of zooplankton grazed on all prey groups investigated, the grazing rates of natural and cultured mesozooplankton were inversely correlated with abundances of potentially toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Anabaena, and Cylindrospermopsis; p < 0.05) while those of the in situ microzooplankton community were not. Microzooplankton grazed more rapidly and consistently on all groups of phytoplankton, including cyanobacteria, compared to both groups of mesozooplankton. Cyanobacteria displayed more rapid intrinsic cellular growth rates than other phytoplankton groups under enhanced nutrient concentrations suggesting that future nutrient loading to lake Erie could exacerbate cyanobacterial blooms. In sum, while grazing rates of mesozooplankton are slowed by cyanobacterial blooms in the western basin of Lake Erie, microzooplankton are likely to play an important role in the top-down control of these blooms; this control could be weakened by any future increases in nutrient loads to lake Erie.

J	Allende, L				Allende, Luz			Combined effects of nutrients and grazers on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton abundance in an Antarctic lake with even food-chain links	POLAR BIOLOGY												The goal of this study was to address the top-down and bottom-up controls on different microbial web components (bacterioplankton, picophytoplankton, and > 3 mu m phytoplankton) in an Antarctic lake. Two experiments using a size fractionation approach and nutrient addition were conducted at microcosm scale (2.5 l). The variation in net growth rates (k') of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton size fractions was analyzed after 5 days. The results determined significant differences; whereas bacterioplankton and large phytoplankton showed an increase in their k' when their predators were removed, the picophytoplankton showed a decrease. All the studied plankton components presented the highest k' when nutrients were added. It is suggested that, in this lake, both the top-down and bottom-up regulations account for the regulation of bacterioplankton and large phytoplankton. As for picophytoplankton, the bottom-up control was evident and grazing did not pose a negative impact and rather, had a positive effect probably due to liberation of nutrients.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				MAR	2009	32	3					493	501		10.1007/s00300-008-0545-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-008-0545-6													WOS:000263389000018

Climate and the local environment strongly influence the properties of the lake sediments, and, through a combination of physical proxies, severe and favourable climate periods and anthropogenic effects on sedimentation with an annual to decadal resolution could be detected. We observed previously identified historical climate periods in the Lake Korttajarvi varve record. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (often termed the Medieval Warm Period) of AD 980-1250, which is characterized by highly organic sediment and a minor minerogenic flux during mild winters, started and terminated abruptly, but also included a short (30-year) colder period lasting between AD 1115 and AD 1145. The Little Ice Age, however, was not clear in our record, although there were two minor cooling periods in AD 1580-1630 and AD 1650-1710. Natural variability in the sediment record was disrupted by increased human impact in the catchment area at AD 1720. There is a distinct positive anomaly in mineral matter accumulation between 907 and 875 BC, which indicates more severe climate conditions. This period exists contemporary with a cold event, recorded worldwide, c . 2800 years ago.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				DEC	2003	32	4					566	577		10.1080/03009480310004152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03009480310004152													WOS:000185720600003

However, percent blue-green algae was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), and the ratio of NO3-N:TP. Multiple correlations involving percent blue-green algae (dependent variable) with respect to temperature, in combination with one of No3-N, TIN, NO3-N:TP, or TIN:TP, were also significant. In all cases, temperature effects accounted for most of the explained variation. The strongest correlation was found for the multiple regression involving percent blue-green algae versus temperature and the NO3-N:TP ratio. The pattern that emerged from the Lake St. George data set was that when temperature exceeded 21.degree. C and the ratio of NO3-N:TP was below 5:1, the likelihood of a blue-green algal bloom was high. When temperature was below 21.degree. C and NO3-N:TP exceeded 5:1, blue-green blooms never occurred.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	1987	44	3					598	604		10.1139/f87-073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-073													WOS:A1987H126800013

Two key areas within the Gulf were investigate using a multibeam echosounder, SeaBat 8111 and an EdgeTech 3300-HM acoustic sub-bottom profiling system. High-resolution multibeam bathymetric data (3-m resolution) were used to calculate aspect, slope, terrain ruggedness and bathymetric position index using ArcGIS Spatial Analyst and the Benthic Terrain Modeler toolbox. These data and resultant thematic maps revealed, for the first time, such features as streamlined till ridges, end-moraine ridges, and De Geer moraines that are being used for the reconstruction of the deglaciation in the Eastern Gulf of Finland. This deglaciation occurred between 13.8 and 13.3 ka BP (Pandivere-Neva stage) and 12.25 ka BP (Salpausselka I stage). Interpretations of the seismic-reflection profiles and 3D models showing the surfaces of till, and the identification of the Late Pleistocene sediment and modern bottom relief, indicate deep relative water-level fall in the Early Holocene and, most likely, several water-level fluctuations during this time.

J	BLINDOW, I				BLINDOW, I			DECLINE OF CHAROPHYTES DURING EUTROPHICATION - COMPARISON WITH ANGIOSPERMS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Charophytes have disappeared from several enriched lakes in Scania (southern Sweden) since the 1940s. Poor light conditions, rather than a toxic effect of phosphorus or negative impact of fish, are the most probable reason for this decline. 2. Small species of charophytes (shoot diameter 0.5-1.0 mm), which are able to form dense, low mats, still occur in eutrophic lakes with high phosphorus concentrations, but are restricted to areas of shallow water. In contrast, large species (shoot diameter 1-4 mm) have totally disappeared from the most turbid lakes. I suggest that these species are unable to grow in very shallow water because of damage by ice and wave action. 3. Maximum depth distribution (z(c)) and Secchi depth (D) were measured in Scanian lakes for both charophytes and angiosperms and combined with data obtained from Chambers & Kalff (1985). According to the combined data, z(c) and D are closely correlated with each other for both angiosperms and charophytes. 4. The z(c) of charophytes is higher than z(c) of angiosperms in dear lakes but lower in turbid lakes. Higher z(c) of angiosperms in the most turbid lakes is explained by special adaptations of these species to poor light availability (shoot elongation, canopy formation, rapid growth during spring).																			0046-5070					AUG	1992	28	1					9	14		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1992.tb00557.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1992.tb00557.x													WOS:A1992JL91000002
J	HAYES, DB; TAYLOR, WW; SCHNEIDER, JC				HAYES, DB; TAYLOR, WW; SCHNEIDER, JC			RESPONSE OF YELLOW PERCH AND THE BENTHIC INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY TO A REDUCTION IN THE ABUNDANCE OF WHITE SUCKERS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Competitive interactions between white suckers Catostomus commersoni and yellow perch Perca flavescens were evaluated in a whole-lake manipulation experiment with one treatment lake and one reference lake. After a 2-year pretreatment period, 80% of the adult white sucker population was removed from Douglas Lake, Michigan, with trap nets set during the spring spawning season of 1987. Following white sucker removal, the abundance of chironomid larvae and the mayfly Caenis sp. increased 13-18-fold in Douglas Lake. In Little Bear Lake, the control lake, Caenis sp. showed a 20% decline in abundance during the study period (1985-1989), and chironomid larvae showed a 2.2-fold increase over the same time period. Associated with the increase in benthic invertebrate abundance in Douglas Lake, the diet of adult (> age-0) yellow perch shifted from predominantly zooplankton to predominantly benthos. This shift was accompanied by an increase in mean stomach content weight and feeding rate, eventually becoming apparent as increased growth. Relatively small changes in feeding rate and no trend in the diet or growth rate of adult yellow perch were apparent in the reference lake. The size structure of the adult yellow perch population in Douglas Lake showed a small increase in the proportion of large (> 150 mm total length) individuals during the first 3 years following white sucker removal and a great increase during the fourth year. In the control lake, no significant change in the population size structure of yellow perch was observed. From these results, we suggest that removal of adult white suckers can be a useful management tool to improve yellow perch growth and the quality of yellow perch fisheries. Changes in yellow perch growth and size structure, however, did not occur immediately after white sucker removal and were relatively small in magnitude during the duration of this study.																			0002-8487					JAN	1992	121	1					36	53		10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0036:ROYPAT>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0036:ROYPAT>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1992HR39900005
J	Chen, CK; Chen, YC				Chen, Chih-Kuei; Chen, Ying-Chu			Detection of chlorophyll fluorescence as a rapid alert of eutrophic water	WATER SUPPLY												An in-situ detection of chlorophyll fluorescence was used in an innovative manner to detect eutrophic water, and the results were compared with the Carlson's Trophic State Index (CTSI) indicators. Eutrophication was due to climate warming and anthropogenic activities. The turbidity and chromaticity showed a strong linear relationship (R-2 = 0.85) of the Bi Lake in Taipei city. Both the swimming area and the bridge are popular with the general public and had the worst turbidity (35.80-44.00 NTU) and chromaticity (495.37-552.27 Pt). The CTSI had a stronger linear relationship with the phycocyanin (PC) concentration (R-2 = 0.605) than with any other three CTSI factors like chlorophyll-a concentration, total phosphorus (TP) concentration, and transparency. The TP pollution had a potential to cause an increase in PC concentration found in this study (R-2 = 0.86). The absorbances of the water samples represented the environment is PC (cyanobacteria) dominant in winter. The PC concentration in Bi Lake ranged from 75.55 to 80.24 mu g/L and higher with lower water temperature. Measurement of in-situ chlorophyll fluorescence is similar to lab-scaled spectrophotometer (R-2>0.92). The real-time detection of PC concentration could be the basis of a rapid alert system to biological threats to waters.

During the ALqueva hydrometeorological EXperiment (ALEX) field campaign, diatom communities were studied in the margins and in three platforms (from the surface to the bottom of the reservoir) located in the limnetic zone of the Alqueva reservoir, one of the largest artificial lakes in western Europe. A detailed meteorological and physico-chemical characterization of the reservoir was carried out from June to September in Summer 2014, when the reservoir was stratified, to relate these variables with diatom assemblages. Despite the large dimensions of the reservoir, no differences in the water physicochemical characteristics and diatom descriptors were detected among platforms. Small changes in diatom assemblages, ecological guilds, taxa richness and Shannon diversity index were observed between sampling campaigns. Nevertheless, differences in diatoms were detected along a depth gradient, both in terms of diatom assemblages and ecological guilds. Taxa richness, Shannon diversity index, Pielou's evenness and Specific Pollution sensitivity Index (SPI) also differed with depth, with the lowest values of all indices detected at surface samples, increasing with depth, reaching the highest values at 20 m for taxa richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness indices.

J	SIMOLA, H				SIMOLA, H			SEDIMENTATION IN A EUTROPHIC STRATIFIED LAKE IN SOUTH FINLAND	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												The temporal course of sedimentation in Lake Lovojarvi, a small, deep (17.5 m) and eutrophic brown-water lake, was studied with sediment traps in 1974. Annually laminated sediment occurs in deeper areas of the lake and a sediment sample, frozen in situ, was used to determine the net sedimentation in 1974 at 17 m depth. The pattern of sediment distribution on the lake bottom was investigated in 1979 with a series of surface sediment cores, using as marker horizons 2 extensive clay layers from the years 1959-1960 and 1965-1966. In 1974 the average net sedimentation in the profundal of the lake was 108 g m-2. Due to sediment focusing, the influx at 17 m was about 20% greater than the average. About 40% of the total net sedimentation was organic matter (43 g m-2 or 920 kJ m-2). Of this, about 60% originated from littoral and allochtonous sources and 40% from planktonic production. During the summer stagnation, the loss of sedimenting organic matter from the epilimnion equalled 12% of the phytoplankton production.																			0003-3847	1797-2442					1981	18	1					23	36																WOS:A1981LP00900003

Environment change, especially the range of water, paddy field and lake-beach, affects the migration of Microtus fords. Remote sensing technique can provide a rapid and effective way to identify the change of environment owing to its characteristics of objectivity, real-time and macroscopic view. This paper puts forward a method to identify the correlative environment information according to the MODIS and TM images, and simulates the migration range of Microtus fortis visually based on spatial analysis method of Geographical Information System (GIS). Via dynamic simulation with Digital Elevation Model (DEM), it shows that the results are mostly in accordance with the ground truth. It indicates that the method of this study is feasibility. This will be helpful for finding out some relationships between Microtus fortis migration and their. survival environment change in order to prevent and control Microtus fortis disaster.																					978-7-121-06304-6				2008							440	444																WOS:000257018700088

S., III			The potential use of synthetic aperture radar for estimating methane ebullition from Arctic lake	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Arctic lakes are significant emitters of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere; yet no rigorous quantification of the magnitude and variability of pan-Arctic lake emissions exists. In this study, we demonstrate the potential for a new method using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to detect methane bubbles in lake ice to scale up whole-lake measurements of CH4 ebullition (bubbling) to regional scales. We estimated ebullition from lakes, which is often the dominant mode of lake emissions, by mapping the distribution of bubble clusters frozen in early winter ice across surfaces of seven tundra lakes and one boreal forest lake in Alaska. Applying previously measured ebullition rates associated with four distinct classes of bubble clusters found in lake ice, we estimated whole-lake emissions from individual lakes. The percent surface area of lake ice covered with bubbles (R-2 = 0.68) and CH4 ebullition rates from lakes (R-2 = 0.59) and were correlated with radar return values from RADARSAT-1 Standard Beam mode 3 for the tundra lakes, suggesting that with appropriate scaling and consideration for variability in lake-ice conditions, this technique has the potential to be used for estimating broader-scale regional and pan-Arctic lake methane emissions.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011; Chapin, F/AAZ-3931-2020	Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910; Engram, Melanie/0000-0002-1144-1827; Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				APR	2008	44	2					305	315		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00163.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00163.x													WOS:000254741500005
J	Tanner, LH				Tanner, LH			Borate formation in a perennial lacustrine setting: Miocene-Pliocene Furnace Creek Formation, Death Valley, California, USA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Miocene-Pliocene Furnace Creek Formation was deposited in marginal lacustrine and lacustrine environments in an extensional setting. Laminated facies comprising marlstone/limestone and mudstone/marlstone laminites lack features of surficial or shallow water deposition, indicating that sediment accumulated on the floor of a deep, perennial lake. Meter-scale mounds of porous limestone with a clotted-micritic fabric are spring-apron tufas that formed where groundwater discharged into more saline lake-bottom waters. The bedded borate facies comprises meter-scale bodies of borate, mainly colemanite, interbedded with laminated mudstone. The massive borate facies comprises thick, nonbedded borate layers, locally containing host rock clasts with sharp to diffuse boundaries. Borate fort-nation took place at or below the sediment/water interface at the bottom of a permanently stratified carbonate lake. The composition of the borate deposits varies from mainly colemanite to zoned, with colemanite surrounding a core of probertite and ulexite. High Ca2+/Na+ ratios favored primary deposition of hydrated Ca-borates, which subsequently transformed by diagenetic dehydration to colemanite. Gradual depletion of Ca2+ and decreasing Ca2+/Na+ ratios resulted in NaCa-borate precipitation. Finally, renewed onset of elevated Ca2-/Na+ ratios again caused Ca-borate deposition.

Shrimps were usually contagiously distributed. To reduce error, samples were stratified resulting in confidence limits of 40-50% for the mean population density. Despite this variability, stable trends emerged, and variation was not so great as to mask significant differences. Length-frequency analyses distinguished cohorts; a regression was established between length and dry weight, enabling growth to be estimated from samples. By combining growth with population densities in Allen curves, production was computed. In Pink Lake and Lake Cundare mean production was 11.3 and 1.0 g dry weight m-2 yr, respectively. Generally there were 2 or 3 generations per yr, but time and extent of recruitment were not predictable. Each generation suffered continuous mortality, the death of young shrimps accounting for most of the production. This mortality remains unexplained; there are no significant predators and salinity and temperature stress would occur only during summer.																			0067-1940						1977	28	4					417	438																WOS:A1977EA77800002

After the completion of dike construction in 1994, the water quality inside the SCR drastically deteriorated. As a result, in 1996, the sluice gates were opened to dilute water pollution levels through the physical mixing of seawater from outside and freshwater from inside. Over the last 20 years, the Korean government has invested more than US $ 1.5 billion to recover SCR water quality by improving public sewage treatment systems, which is 2.7 times the cost of the original dike construction. Yet, within the reservoir, water quality has minimally improved, sediment pollution continues to be detected, and anoxic layers have been observed, due to stratification in summer. Severe sedimentary pollution caused by heavy metals and trace organic pollutants originating from the upstream regions of the watershed was evident during the SCR project; however, pollution levels appeared to decrease after seawater circulation. In parallel, the pelagic and benthic communities have also been affected by the deterioration of multiple water and sediment quality indices. While the recent construction of the tidal power plant has significantly increased the volume of seawater circulation, it has not been enough to improve the water quality of the upstream region of the SCR, where the water remains polluted. The SCR project presents a clear example that how incorrect policy leads to the mishandling of both coastal ecosystems and substantial governmental budgets. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Beltaos, S; Prowse, TD; Carter, T				Beltaos, Spyros; Prowse, Terry D.; Carter, Tom			Ice regime of the lower Peace River and ice-jam flooding of the Peace-Athabasca Delta	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in northern Alberta is one of the world's largest inland freshwater deltas, home to large populations of waterfowl, muskrat, beaver, and free-ranging wood bison. Beginning in the mid-1970s, a paucity of ice-jam flooding in the lower Peace River has resulted in prolonged dry periods and considerable reduction in the area covered by lakes and ponds that provide a habitat for aquatic life in the PAD region. Using archived hydrometric data and in situ observations, the ice regime of the lower Peace is described and quantified, setting the stage for identification of the conditions that lead to ice-jam flooding and replenishment of Delta habitat. The first such condition is the occurrence of a mechanical, as opposed to a thermal, breakup event; second, the river flow should be at least 4000 m(3)/s; and third, an ice jam should form within the last 50 km of the Peace River. The type of breakup event depends on the freeze-up stage and spring flow. The former has increased as a result of flow regulation, and the latter has decreased owing to changing climatic patterns. Both trends tend to inhibit the occurrence of mechanical break-ups and contribute to less frequent ice-jam flooding. Potential mitigation strategies are discussed.

We interpret a ripple-laminated sand unit exposed at the Public Shooting Grounds, and dated to this time interval, as the nearshore sediments of Great Salt Lake deposited during the formation of the Gilbert shoreline. The ripple-laminated sand is overlain by channel-fill deposits that overlap in age (11.9-11.2 cal ka) with the sand, and by wetland deposits (11.1 to 10.5 cal ka). Consistent accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon ages were obtained from samples of plant fragments, including those of emergent aquatic plants, but mollusk shells from spring and marsh deposits yielded anomalously old ages, probably because of a variable radiocarbon reservoir effect. The Bonneville basin was effectively wet during at least part of the Younger Dryas global-cooling interval, however, conflicting results from some Great Basin locations and proxy records indicate that the regional effects of Younger Dryas cooling are still not well understood.

High-resolution modeling for development of nearshore ecosystem objectives in eastern Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We develop a high-resolution (600 m) three-dimensional water quality model for Lake Erie capable of resolving predominant physical processes to study nutrient dynamics, with a particular emphasis on the northern near shore region of Lake Erie's eastern basin. The lake model output in conjunction with the Cladophora growth model (CGM) is used to predict Cladophora growth. The models were validated using extensive nearshore water quality, Cladophora biomass and tissue phosphorus measurements collected during April-September of 2013. Together, the models were used to evaluate the response of nearshore phosphorus concentrations and Cladophora growth due to changes in external phosphorus loading. The water quality model described here was able to resolve the nearshore dominant physical processes that occur within the Cladophora habitat zone (0-8 m depth) and revealed that phosphorus concentrations in the nearshore are governed by a combination of local inputs from the Grand River and exchange with the hypolimnion. Frequent upwelling events driven by favorable winds of 5-10 days period dominated nearshore-offshore exchanges, and in some years (e.g., 2013) can potentially add significant phosphorus (as soluble reactive phosphorus; SRP) to the nearshore during the spring; however, in other years (e.g., 2008), their effects are less important. The model demonstrates that the offshore supply of phosphorus via upwelling is of ecological significance with respect to Cladophora and that both lake-wide and local action may be required to address nuisance blooms of Cladophora in lake Erie.

Diagnostic criteria for proliferative hepatic lesions in brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus is used as indicator species for contaminant effects at areas of concern (AOC) in the Great Lakes and other areas. One of the beneficial use impairments at numerous AOC is 'fish tumors and other deformities'. An impairment occurs when the prevalence of fish tumors and other deformities exceeds those at unimpacted or control sites or when survey data confirm the presence of neoplastic or preneoplastic liver lesions in bullbead or white sucker Catostomus commersonii. Numerous surveys have been conducted over the years assessing neoplasia in these fishes, both liver and skin tumors. However, a major problem in comparing the results has been a lack of consistent criteria for evaluating histological changes in bullhead livers. As individual AOC develop and implement remedial action plans, realistic and attainable delisting targets need to be specified. For this to occur and be consistent from site to site there must be standardization of the criteria being used to evaluate specific impairments. In this report, specific diagnostic criteria are provided for both non-neoplastic and neoplastic proliferative hepatocellular and biliary lesions. These criteria should assist fish pathologists in describing and categorizing proliferative liver lesions from brown bullhead.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				SEP 14	2006	72	1					19	30		10.3354/dao072019	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao072019								17067070					WOS:000241912800003

A novel method for tracking western Lake Erie Microcystis blooms, 2002-2011	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												After a period of improvement from the late 1970s through the mid 1990s, western Lake Erie has returned to eutrophic conditions and harmful algal blooms now dominated by the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. The detection of long-term trends in Microcystis blooms would benefit from a convenient method for quantifying Microcystis using archived plankton tows. From 2002 to 2011, summer Microcystis blooms in western Lake Erie were quantified using plankton tows (N = 649). A flotation separation method was devised to quantify Microcystis biovolume in the tows, and the method was tested against whole water cell counts. Floating Microcystis biovolume (mL) in preserved tows was highly correlated with total Microcystis cells (R-2 = 0.84) and biomass (R-2 = 0.95) in whole water samples. We found that Microcystis annual biovolume was highly variable among years; the 2011 bloom was 2.4 times greater than the second largest bloom (2008) and 29.0 times greater than the smallest bloom (2002). Advantages of the method include use of archived samples, high sampling volume, and low effort and expense. Limitations include specificity for cyanobacterial blooms dominated by large Microcystis colonies and the need for site-specific validation. This study indicates that the flotation method can be used to rapidly assess past and present Microcystis in western Lake Erie and that there was high variability in the timing, duration, and intensity of the annual Microcystis blooms over a 10-year period. The data made possible by this method will aid further investigations into the underlying causal factors of blooms. (c) 2012 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

The status of habitat of great white and pink-backed pelicans in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a review	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												Habitat change, mainly through the actions of humans, poses a threat to great white (Pelecanus onocrotaltis) and pink-backed (P. rufescens) pelicans in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal, the southernmost distributions of these species on Africa's eastern seaboard. This study assessed the relative importance and state of the potential pelican habitat in the northeastern KwaZulu-Natal region, focusing particularly on Lake St Lucia and the Phongolo River floodplain. Great white pelicans breed on islands in Lake St Lucia. Should these islands be lost through falling water levels or their becoming joined to mainland by deposits of silt, or by flooding, no suitable habitat for their breeding will remain in the region. By contrast, the pink-backed pelican nests in trees, and there appears to be plentiful alternative habitat. Lake St Lucia and, to a lesser extent, the Phongolo River floodplain, are important foraging areas for both pelican species. The hydrology of both these systems has been affected by human activities.

A revision of the poorly known Pontocaspian gastropod genus Abeskunus, and its Central Paratethyan origin	HISTORICAL BIOLOGY												Biodiversity and conservation assessments rise and fall with taxonomic accuracy. An example of a still largely unresolved taxonomy is found in the Gastropoda of the Caspian Sea. The present paper clarifies the taxonomy of the genus Abeskunus and its three species of anomalohaline gastropods endemic to the Caspian Sea. Based on material from Pleistocene, Holocene, and (sub-)recent deposits from Russia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan we discuss species discriminations, synonyms, systematic position, as well as uncertainties regarding the type species. Given the apparent loss of all type material, we designate neotypes for all three species. Despite our efforts to collect and analyse new material and available material housed in museum collections, molecular data, and soft-part anatomy are unavailable precluding a firm systematic classification. Overall shell morphology and protoconch microsculpture are indicative of the family Lithoglyphidae. Comparison with Miocene and Pliocene fossils attributed to the genus Zagrabica suggests it to be a likely ancestor of Abeskunus, tracing back the lineage to the late Miocene Lake Pannon. Although the recent literature lists all three species of Abeskunus among the extant Pontocaspian fauna, two of the three species have never been found living and the third one not since the nineteenth century.

Part 1: Phenomenological description and management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Artificial oxygenation is a common management technique for lake restoration, but the use of hypolimnetic aeration in shallow basins can have dramatic effects on the dynamics of thermal stratification. This study presents the results of extensive field measurements performed in Lake Serraia (Trentino, Italy) after the installation of a Side Stream Pumping System, whereby oxygen-rich water is injected through 24 jets, uniformly distributed along an octagonal-shaped pipe at approximately 1 m above the sediment floor (10 m in depth). The lake is characterised by an average depth of 7 m, a volume of 3.1 x 10(6) m(3) and a residence time of about one year. Prior to the installation of the pumping system, the undisturbed hypolimnion thickness during summer stratification was relatively small. After the start of oxygen injection (up to 0.5 m(3)/s of oxygen-saturated water), an increase of in-lake temperature over the entire water column was noted with a maximum hypolimnetic temperature increase of up to 9 degrees C. The analysis of the flow field data and the results of numerical simulations (presented in the companion paper), indicate that the jets were solely responsible for the observed increase in temperature. Moreover, this study shows that modelling efforts are useful to provide guidelines for optimising contrasting needs (e.g., increase in oxygen supply versus jet discharge rate). (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Both strains were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, motile rods. Strains JS4-4(T) and SHS5-24(T) showed high sequence similarities (97.6-95.8%) and (96.5-95.6%), respectively, to the members of the genus Undibacterium. The sequence similarity between strains JS4-4(T) and SHS5-24(T) was 97.0%. A phylogenetic tree showed that these strains fell within the radius of the genus Undibacterium. The main fatty acids of strains JS4-4(T) and SHS5-24(T) were summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c) (50.1 and 58.7%, respectively) and C-16:0 (28.3 and 24.5%, respectively). Both strains had ubiquinone 8 as the only respiratory quinone, and phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol as the major polar lipids. Strain JS4-4(T) showed <70% DNA-DNA hybridization with members of the genus Undibacterium. Thus, based on the evidence of a polyphasic study, it is proposed that strains JS4-4(T) and SHS5-24(T) represent two novel species, for which the names Undibacterium jejuense sp. nov.

J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			GRANITE WEATHERING AND THE SENSITIVITY OF ALPINE LAKES TO ACID DEPOSITION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake chemical data from the National Surface Water Survey (NSWS) were corrected for the effects of regional atmospheric deposition and then used to evaluate the role of weathering in supplying base cations, silica, sulfate, and alkalinity to surface waters in alpine vs. subalpine, and in glaciated vs. unglaciated granitic terrane of the western and southeastern United States. Thermodynamic models, idealized reaction stoichiometry, and multivariate regression involving solutes and geographic variables indicate that irreversible weathering can largely account for lake chemistry. By contrast, relatively minor roles are played by reversible ion exchange in soils and sediments, terrestrial bioaccumulation, and transformations in lakes. The regional patterns in lake acidity components (NO3, SO4, DOC, CO2), and statistical relationships between acidity and base cations demonstrate that rock weathering is limited by acid inputs in many alpine catchments prior to fall overturn. The empirical success of the Henriksen alkalinity model depends on a high Ca: Na weathering ration. The latter increases with increasing physical disturbance of the catchment (juvenility), hence under natural circumstances attains a maximum as a result of on-going or recent glaciation. The Henriksen model fails in geochemically "old" terrane, where cation losses accompanying silicate weathering attain steady state proportions.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1990	35	5					1112	1134		10.4319/lo.1990.35.5.1112	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1990.35.5.1112													WOS:A1990EE63200010

However, little information is available about the distribution of P fractions in river sediment. Here, the sequential extraction approach was used to evaluate the sediment P fractionation and its content in the anthropogenically damaged river Ganga, India. Different sedimentary P fractions viz. exchangeable (Ex-P), aluminum bound (Al-P), iron bound (Fe-P), calcium bound (Ca-P), and organically bound phosphorus (Org-P), were quantified. Significantly higher level of total P was recorded in pre-monsoon season (438.5 +/- 95.8 mg/kg), than other [winter (345.7 +/- 110.6 mg/kg), post-monsoon (319.2 +/- 136.3 mg/kg), and monsoon (288.6 +/- 77.3 mg/kg)] seasons. Different P fractions such as Ex-P, Al-P, Fe-P, Ca-P and Org-P varied from 2.88-12.8 mg/kg, 7.64-98.8 mg/kg, 32.2-179.2 mg/kg, 51.97-286.1 mg/kg and 9.3-143.7 mg/kg, respectively, which correspondingly represented 0.5-10.54%, 3.41-20.18%, 17.27-37.82%, 37.35-60.2%, 4.15-25.88% of the Total P with a rank order of P-fractions was Ca-P > Fe-P > Org-P > Al-P > Ex-P. Bio-available P contributes a considerable portion (37.9-46.0%) of total P which may increase the eutrophication to overlying water. Results demonstrate that inorganic P species control the P bio-availability in both time and space. However, an estimated phosphorus pollution index based on sediment total P content showed no ecological risk of phosphorus to Ganga River sediment.

Geometry of the modelled freshwater/salt-water interface under variable-density-driven flow (Petrola Lake, SE Spain)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Petrola Lake in southeast Spain is one of the most representative examples of hypersaline wetlands in southern Europe. The rich ecosystem and environmental importance of this lake are closely associated with the hydrogeological behaviour of the system. The wetland is fed by the underlying aquifer with relatively fresh groundwater-1 g L-1 of total dissolved solids (TDS)-with a centripetal direction towards the wetland. In addition, the high evaporation rates of the region promote an increase in the concentration of salts in the lake water, occasionally higher than 80 g L-1 TDS. The density difference between the superficial lake water and the regional groundwater can reach up to 0.25 g cm(-3), causing gravitational instability and density-driven flow (DDF) under the lake bottom. The objective of this study was to gain an understanding of the geometry of the freshwater-saltwater interface by means of two-dimensional mathematical modelling and geophysical-resistivity-profile surveys. The magnitude and direction of mixed convective flows, generated by DDF, support the hypothesis that the autochthonous reactive organic matter produced in the lake by biomass can be transported effectively towards the freshwater-saltwater interface areas (e.g. springs in the lake edge), where previous research described biogeochemical processes of natural attenuation of nitrate pollution.

Patterns and influences on Dolly Varden migratory timing in the Chignik Lakes, Alaska, and comparison of populations throughout the northeastern Pacific and Arctic oceans	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) are a facultatively anadromous salmonid common around much of the North Pacific Rim, but little is known about the environmental factors affecting the timing and diversity of their migration. We combined telemetry of anadromous fish with long-term monitoring of Dolly Varden upstream migration timing and environmental data in the Chignik Lakes watershed in Alaska and then compared the timing data with that of other streams where only count data were available. Telemetry revealed two upstream migration modes: midsummer and late fall at the Chignik Lakes. Weir counts indicated that timing fluctuated markedly over the monitoring period (1996-2011) and was negatively correlated with June sea surface temperature. The relationship between sea surface temperature and migration timing in other watersheds with long-term records was as follows: negative (Buskin River), positive (Auke Creek), or nonexistent (Goodnews and Kanektok rivers). Among 18 streams and rivers throughout the eastern Pacific range of Dolly Varden, median upstream migration date increased with latitude. Overall, Dolly Varden migration timing is more variable, protracted, and more strongly influenced by local sea surface temperatures than is typical of semelparous salmonids. These results are likely indicative of other iteroparous salmonids in Pacific waters that share similar environments and life-history characteristics.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2013	70	5					655	665		10.1139/cjfas-2012-0416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2012-0416													WOS:000319257700001
J	Vione, D; Minero, C; Carena, L				Vione, Davide; Minero, Claudio; Carena, Luca			Fluorophores in surface freshwaters: importance, likely structures, and possible impacts of climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Fluorescence spectroscopy is one of the most useful techniques currently available for the characterisation of organic matter in natural water samples, because it combines easy availability of instrumentation, high sensitivity and limited requirements for sample treatment. The main fluorophores that can be found in natural waters are usually proteins (and/or free amino acids) and humic substances (humic and fulvic acids). The identification of these fluorescent compounds in water samples helps to obtain information about, among others, biological activity in the water body, possible transport of organic matter from soil, and the phenomenon of photobleaching that decreases both the absorbance and (usually) the fluorescence of natural organic matter. Interestingly, all these phenomena can be affected by climate change, which could alter to different extents the ratio between aquagenic and pedogenic fluorophores. Several events induced by warming in natural waters (and especially lake water) could enhance algal growth, thereby also enhancing the production of aquagenic organic matter. Intense precipitation events could increase the export of pedogenic material to surface waters, while photobleaching would be enhanced in the epilimnion of lakes when summer stratification becomes longer and more stable because of higher temperatures. Interestingly, photobleaching affects humic substances to a higher extent compared to protein-like material, thus protein fluorescence signals could be more preserved in stratified waters.

Mount Fuji: The Volcano, the Heritage, and the Mountain	NATURAL HERITAGE OF JAPAN: GEOLOGICAL, GEOMORPHOLOGICAL, AND ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS	Geoheritage Geoparks and Geotourism											This chapter describes Mount Fuji, which at 3776 m asl forms the highest point in Japan, as a composite heritage. Fuji was registered in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list in 2013 as a Cultural Property, but the mountain and its surrounding landscapes also represent a significant natural heritage. The steep, conically shaped mountain we see today almost wholly comprises volcanic products from the newest phase of Fuji volcanism, and a volcanic complex of three older volcanoes is buried under the ejecta from this new phase. Past eruptions of the mountain posed significant dangers for the densely populated Kanto plain; different landforms and ecosystems were formed out of those events that further underscore the mountain's value as a composite natural heritage. While Fuji is an exceptionally vigorous stratovolcano, many landforms in this area are formed by active denudation forces. Apart from the mountain, the surrounding areas offer a rich diversity of landforms such as artesian spring rivers, lava tunnels, and lakes. Tourism at Mount Fuji has changed significantly from its pilgrimage roots, and this transformation has put considerable pressure on the landscape. The natural heritage of this area urgently needs holistic planning and conservation measures to control the footprint of tourism and urban development.

J	KIRCHEIS, FW; STANLEY, JG				KIRCHEIS, FW; STANLEY, JG			THEORY AND PRACTICE OF FORAGE-FISH MANAGEMENT IN NEW-ENGLAND	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Several fish species serve as forage for freshwater predatory fish in New England but only the alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, and rainbow smelt, Osmerus mordax, have been managed extensively. Management consists of transplantation and regulation of sport, bait and commercial fisheries. Rainbow smelt are transplanted by transfer of eggs naturally deposited on burlap bags or by transfer of mature adults in aerated containers; alewives are established or maintained by transfer of ripe adults. Both species have anadromous populations; larval rainbow smelt migrate almost immediately to sea but alewives remain in freshwater pools for the 1st summer, where they provide food for predator fish. Landlocked populations of rainbow smelt are more vulnervaluable than those of alewives because rainbow smelt distribution within the water column more closely matches that of most coldwater predators. Landlocked Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, depend almost totally on rainbow smelt for good growth. When alewives and rainbow smelt have been stocked together in small lakes that lack the size and heterogeneity necessary for physical separation, intense competition resulted. Both species restructure the plankton community by virtually eliminating larger species of zooplankton and thereby may release algal blooms.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1981	110	6					729	737		10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<729:TAPOFM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<729:TAPOFM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1981MS98500005

Food web structure across basins in Lake Erie, a large freshwater ecosystem	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Understanding spatial variation of aquatic food web structure and how ecosystem boundaries should be delineated is important. Here, we investigated the spatial variation in food web structure within Lake Erie across its three basins using 313C and 315N. Fish and lower trophic level composition were similar but differences in food web structure were observed among basins. The food web in the central basin had the smallest 313C and 315N range and total area based on stable isotope values by the aquatic community, likely due to chronic epibenthic hypoxia in the summer that affects fish habitat and resources. The largest 315N range was in the east, driven by the high trophic position of lake trout present in this deepest basin. The western basin had the largest mean distance to the centroid of all three basins, indicating a large trophic diversity, probably due to high nutrient loadings and productivity. This research revealed spatial variability of food web structure in large lake ecosystems and the importance of considering smaller sub-units, such as basin, in large lakes.

J	Kolarova, N; Napiórkowski, P				Kolarova, Nikola; Napiorkowski, Pawel			Are rotifer indices suitable for assessing the trophic status in slow-flowing waters of canals?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Zooplankton indicators based on rotifers (TSIROT) and an indicator based on Secchi disk visibility (TSISD) were used to assess trophic state changes in artificial, slow-flowing, and stagnant canal waters. The study was conducted in the summers of 2019, 2021, and 2022 in the Bydgoszcz Canal and the Notec Canal (Poland). Water samples were taken from five sites once in the month of July and once in August. In terms of the species number and density, rotifers dominated among zooplankton (at almost all sites), which reflected the high trophic state. Our results showed statistically significant correlations between TSIROT and TSISD as well as between the individual indicators TSIROT1 (Rotifer numbers), TSIROT2 (Rotifer biomass), TSIROT3 (bacterivorous numbers of rotifers), TSIROT6 (rotifers indicating high trophic state), and TSISD. According to our study, the presented indices most likely determine the trends between TSIROT cumulative and TSISD in the studied canals. Similarly to previous studies performed on lakes and small reservoirs, zooplankton constituted a useful indicator of trophic state.

However, longevity of treatments varies among lakes; some lakes eutrophy faster than others. We conducted biogeo-chemical investigations of sediments of a closed artificial Lake Barleber, Germany that was successfully reme-diated with aluminum sulfate in 1986. The lake became mesotrophic for almost 30 years; a rather rapid re-eutrophication took place in 2016 leading to massive cyanobacterial blooms. We quantified internal loading from sediment and analyzed two environmental factors that might have contributed to the sudden shift in trophic state. Increase in lake P concentration started in 2016, reaching 0.3 mg L-1, and remained elevated into the spring of 2018. Reducible P fraction in the sediment was 37 -58% of total P, indicating a high potential for mobilization of benthic P during anoxia. Estimated P release from sediments for 2017 was approximately 600 kg for the whole lake. This is consistent with sediment incubation results; higher temperature (20 degrees C) and anoxia contributed to release of P (27.9 +/- 7.1 mg m- 2 d-1, 0.94 +/- 0.23 mmol m- 2 d-1) to the lake, triggering re-eutrophication. Loss of aluminum P adsorption capacity together with anoxia and high water temperatures (organic matter mineralization) are major drivers of re-eutrophication. Accordingly, treated lakes at some time require a repeated aluminum treatment for sustaining acceptable water quality and we recommend regular sediment monitoring in treated lakes. This is crucial given the effects of climate warming on duration of strat-ification in lakes which may result in the need for treatment of many lakes.

Surrounding topographic features such as forests and mountains affect a small lake more than a large one. This paper present a study of a small, shallow, sheltered, and weakly stratified lake in response to meteorological (MET) conditions and indirect effects of surrounding topographic features. Wind measurements at the lake shores indicated that spatial variations of wind speed and direction were substantial in nearshore areas with dense forest stands. Field measurements of velocity profiles and temperature spatial distributions were measured during the summer of 2004. A three-dimensional (3D) ocean model modified by a generic length-scale turbulence model was implemented to address the effects of spatially nonuniform wind caused by trees and weak thermal stratification on lake dynamics. Simulated vertical and horizontal distributions of mean velocities suggested that wind sheltering altered current patterns, particularly in sheltered areas, and weak stratification produced subsurface maximum velocities. Simulated water temperature profiles reproduced an observed diurnal thermal pattern. A modified stratification indicator is shown to yield reliable measure of thermal stratification without internal thermal structure; this indicator had a strong relationship with the 3D model output.

Perfluorinated compounds in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fillets from the Upper Mississippi River	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Ten different perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), including perfluooctane sulfonate (PFOS), were measured in 30 common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fillets collected from three sites on the Upper Mississippi River in Minnesota in an effort to evaluate the potential impact of PFAA emissions in this area. Samples upstream of the city of St. Cloud (reference site) had median PFOS concentrations of 8.1 ng/g wet weight (ng/g wet wt), but median levels increased significantly downstream in the Minneapolis-St. Paul urban area, with concentrations from the Pig's Eye Lake site at 26 ng/g wet wt (p=0.001 5) and the Spring Lake site at 40 ng/g wet wt (p=0.0004). This latter PFOS concentration is within the advisory range for limiting fish consumption to one meal a week according to the Minnesota Department of Health. Other PFAAs were also found to increase significantly between the reference site and the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, but maximal concentrations remained below 2.0 ng/g wet wt. This study demonstrates the bioaccumulation of PFAAs in a ubiquitous fish species in a major urban area known to have historical inputs of various PFAA compounds. The full extent of this contamination and the potential for accumulation in other species remain to be evaluated.

Modern isotope hydrology and controls on δD of plant leaf waxes at Lake El'gygytgyn, NE Russia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Stable isotope data from lipid biomarkers and diatom silica recovered from lake sediment cores hold great promise for paleoclimate and paleohydrological reconstructions. However, these records rely on accurate calibration with modern precipitation and hydrologic processes and only limited data exist on the controls on the delta D values for n-alkanoic acids from plant leaf waxes. Here we investigate the stable isotopic composition of modern precipitation, streams, lake water and ice cover, and use these data to constrain isotope systematics of the Lake El'gygytgyn Basin hydrology. Compound-specific hydrogen isotope ratios determined from n-alkanoic acids from modern vegetation are compared with modern precipitation and lake core top sediments. Multispecies net (apparent) fractionation values between source water (precipitation) and modern vegetation (e. g., epsilon(wax/precip) mean value is -107 +/- 12 parts per thousand) agree with previous results and suggest a consistent offset between source waters and the delta D values of alkanoic acids. We conclude that although there may be some bias towards a winter precipitation signal, overall delta D values from leaf wax n-alkanoic acids record annual average precipitation within the El'gygytgyn Basin. A net fractionation calculated for 200-yr-integrated lake sediments yields epsilon(30/precip) = -96 +/- 8 parts per thousand and can provide robust net "apparent" fractionation to be used in future paleohydrological reconstructions.

Cyanobacterial (Blue-Green algal) toxins in water supplies: Cylindrospermopsins	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY					12th International Symposium on Toxicity Assessment	JUN 12-17, 2005	Skiathos Isl, GREECE	Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev				The toxic alkaloid cylindrospermopsin is produced by a range of cyanobacterial species worldwide. It was first identified in the species Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii from tropical waters, and has since been isolated from four other genera in locations ranging from Israel to Japan. High concentrations of the organisms and toxin have been identified in reservoirs, natural lakes, and rivers in summer in the USA and in Australia. The toxin is a particular problem in drinking water sources as concentrations in the free water are appreciable, so that removal of the filaments during water treatment does not remove the toxin. The toxicity resulting from oral ingestion is seen in the liver, kidneys, stomach, intestine, and white blood cells, with some vascular damage in mice. Gastrointestinal as well as liver injury has been observed in human poisoning. Studies of toxicity in vitro have shown inhibition of protein synthesis. Genotoxicity has also been demonstrated, and there is preliminary evidence for carcinogenicity. A Guideline Value for safe water supply of 1 mu g/L has been proposed. Research into toxin measurement techniques and water treatment methods has indicated that effective control measures may be practicable for this toxin in drinking water. Considerably more research is needed to fully define the health risks from this toxin.

J	Wang, YN; Guo, BC				Wang, Yingnan; Guo, Baocheng			Adaption to extreme environments: a perspective from fish genomics	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												Fishes exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates. They are found in most bodies of water, including those that pose extreme challenges, such as sulfide springs, rivers contaminated with heavy metals and organic pollutants, and caves without light. Adaptation to these extreme environments usually occurs rapidly, which has stimulated much interest in uncovering the genetic basis of such rapid adaptation. Since the sequencing of the zebrafish genome in 2001, rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology has facilitated the additional sequencing of similar to 210 ray-finned fish genomes to date. As a result of this wealth of resources, much attention has been focused on the genetic basis of adaptation in fishes, particularly in extreme environments. The goal of this review is to summarize recent advances in fish genomics, with a specific focus on the use of genomic data to understand the genetic basis of adaptation to extreme environments in fishes. The results highlight that fishes often adapt to extreme environments through phenotypic and physiological changes that have a confirmed or inferred genetic basis. Moreover, such changes are usually rapid and repeated when parallel adaptation to similar extreme environments occurs. Specifically, parallel genetic changes are usually observed at both the intra- and interspecific level. The advances in fish genomics provide the opportunity to understand how evolutionary changes feed back into ecosystems that are facing extreme environmental changes, as well as to advance our understanding of the repeatability and predictability of evolutionary response (of fishes) to extreme environmental changes.

J	Smith, DR; Livingston, SJ				Smith, D. R.; Livingston, S. J.			Managing farmed closed depressional areas using blind inlets to minimize phosphorus and nitrogen losses	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT												Closed depressions are sites within a landscape from glacial origin in which runoff water tends to collect because there is no natural outlet. When farmed, this water is often drained via a tile riser, a vertical tube that connects the bottom of the low point of a closed depression with the subsurface tile drainage network. Two field-sized closed depressions (ca. 4ha) and two small catchments (ca. 300ha) were used to test the hypothesis that water quality could be improved by replacing tile risers with blind inlets, ca. 18m2 holes filled to 1m depth so that a high infiltration capacity was attained. At the field scale discharge, sediment and nutrient loads were lower when drained with the blind inlet compared to the tile riser. Late Spring 2010 was much wetter than normal, and increased nutrient loading was observed in both small catchments compared with previous years. In 2010, discharge and total P loading from Catchment AME (control catchment drained with tile risers) increased 417% and 737%, respectively, compared to the mean for the six previous years, whereas in Catchment BME (treatment catchment drained with blind inlets), there was only a 64% and 92% increase, respectively. Results from this study indicate that replacing tile risers with blind inlets to drain closed depressions may be one method to effectively reduce nutrient and sediment loading to Lake Erie and other sensitive water bodies that lie in landscapes formed by Wisconsin, Weichselian or Devensian glaciation.																			0266-0032	1475-2743				MAR	2013	29			1	SI		94	102		10.1111/j.1475-2743.2012.00441.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-2743.2012.00441.x													WOS:000315827800012

PHYTOPLANKTON BASED ASSESSMENT OF ECOLOGICAL STATUS OF BULGARIAN LAKES AND COMPARISON OF METRICS WITHIN THE WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Taxonomic composition and abundance of summer phytoplankton were studied in 78 lakes in Bulgaria. The Hungarian Assemblage index was applied for the first time on various Bulgarian lake types and 27 phytoplankton functional groups were identified. The dominant functional groups differed based on lake type and trophic status. Functional groups' frequency distribution showed that high relative abundance of assemblages L-0, Y, MP, N, E, X3, X-ph indicated high or good status, regardless of lake type. Simultaneously undesirable assemblages, linked to the declined water quality, were L-M, J, M, S1 and H1. We also examined the relationship between the Assemblage index and a number of phytoplankton metrics: Total biomass, % Cyanobacteria, Transparensy, Chlorophyll a, Algal bloom and Algae Group Index. The two applied indices (Hungarian Assemblage index and Algae Group index) were highly correlated (p<0.01). The Assemblage index had also strong relationship (p<0.001) with Total biomass, % Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyll a, as well as with the assessed overall ecological status. Assemblage index and Algae Group Index resulted in similar assessment and were applicable to all three Alpine and mountain, Deep semimountain and Small and middle sized lowland lake groups. Assemblage index is recommended especially for lentic ecosystems in extreme cases, e.g. hyperhaline lakes, for its flexibility and more adequate assessment.

J	Shindo, H; Kwak, M				Shindo, H; Kwak, M			Stabilities of crystal faces of aragonite (CaCO3) compared by atomic force microscopic observation of facet formation processes in aqueous acetic acid	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Crystal faces of aragonite in various orientations were dissolved in water or in a dilute aqueous acetic acid. Facet formation processes were observed in situ using atomic force microscopy (AFM). At the polar ( 001) surface, which gave atom-resolved AFM images in air, less polar {112} facets were developed in water. At two other polar faces ( 110) and ( 010), which are frequently seen in natural forms, electrically neutral facets such as ( 130) and ( 100) were developed in the acidic solution. No facet formation was observed at the neutral ( 130) and ( 100) faces. Atom-resolved AFM images observed in air at the latter nearly corresponded to the arrangement of H atoms binding to the carbonate ions. The relative stabilities of polar and neutral surfaces strongly depend on pH, since protonation of the carbonate ions changes distributions of positive and negative electric charges at the surfaces. The equilibrium crystal form of aragonite in acidic conditions most probably consists of {100}, {130} and {112} faces, which is in strong contrast to the cases of alkaline conditions. The ( 001) face having carbonate ions fully exposed to the solution will not be stabilized without a specific adsorbate.					kwak, musun/Q-9885-2019														1463-9076	1463-9084					2005	7	4					691	696		10.1039/b417384h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b417384h								19787887					WOS:000227386600018

This species is native primarily to estuarine environments on both sides of the North Atlantic, but in the US it has been established in the Gulf of Mexico since at least 1982 and more recently in the Mississippi River Basin. In 2005 it was found in the Dresden Island Pool of the Upper Illinois River, placing it within 100 river kilometers of Lake Michigan, and it is considered a high risk for continuing its spread into the Laurentian Great Lakes. During summer 2015 we conducted what we believe is the only sampling for this species to have taken place upstream of the Dresden Island Pool since 2005. We sampled at 25 sites from the Dresden Island Pool upstream to Lake Michigan, including six Lake Michigan harbors. A. lacustre was found at a single site in the Dresden Island Pool, indicating that the species has not spread over the last decade. This result could occur because of a physical or chemical barrier to further movement, or because our sampling was not sufficient to locate the population. Further sampling, and tests of A. lacustre tolerance to water from different sources, will be required to determine if spread has truly stopped, and if so, the reason for this.																			1989-8649					SEP	2017	8	3			SI		377	382		10.3391/mbi.2017.8.3.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2017.8.3.11													WOS:000412582000011

(2008). Appl Environ Microbiol 74, 6223-6229] was characterized in detail. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis had revealed that strain AZM16c01(T) was the first cultivated representative of the candidate phylum OP5. The cells were multicellular filaments with a single polar flagellum. The strain contained iso-C(17: 0) as the major fatty acid and menaquinone-8(H(6)), menaquinone-8(H(8)) and menaquinone-8(H(10)) as the respiratory quinones. The G + C content of the genomic DNA of strain AZM16c01(T) was 34.6 mol%. Optimum growth was obtained at 65 degrees C, pH 6.5 and in the absence of NaCl, with a doubling time of 10.6 h. On the basis of the results of phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence and the characterization of the strain in this study, we propose the name Caldisericum exile gen. nov., sp. nov. for strain AZM16c01(T) (=NBRC 104410(T) =DSM 21853(T)).

Showering in Flint, MI: Is there a DBP problem?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Lead contamination in the City of Flint, MI has been well documented over the past two years, with lead levels above the EPA Action Level until summer 2016. This resulted from an ill-fated decision to switch from Detroit water (Lake Huron) with corrosion control, to Flint River water without corrosion control. Although lead levels are now closer to normal, reports of skin rashes have sparked questions surrounding tap water in some Flint homes. This study investigated the presence of contaminants, including disinfection by-products (DBPs), in the hot tap water used for showering in the homes of residents in Flint. Extensive quantitative analysis of 61 regulated and priority unregulated DBPs was conducted in Flint hot and cold tap water, along with the analysis of 50 volatile organic compounds and a nontarget comprehensive, broadscreen analysis, to identify a possible source for the reported skin rashes. For comparison, chlorinated hot and cold waters from three other cities were also sampled, including Detroit, which also uses Lake Huron as its source water. Results showed that hot water samples generally contained elevated levels of regulated and priority unregulated DBPs compared to cold water samples, but trihalomethanes were still within regulatory limits. Overall, hot shower water from Flint was similar to waters sampled from the three other cities and did not have unusually high levels of DBPs or other organic chemicals that could be responsible for the skin rashes observed by residents. It is possible that an inorganic chemical or microbial contaminant may be responsible. (C) 2017 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

During MIS3, vegetation type was dominantly forest in eastern China, forest steppe/meadow in the north and Tibetan Plateau, and steppe desert in northwestern arid China. We developed a semi-quantitative vegetation index to reflect change in plant abundance (by inferring the general climate conditions), with a vegetation score from 1 to 3 based on the different vegetation types inferred from pollen data at individual sites at intervals of 2,000 years. The reconstructed vegetation index shows higher values during MIS 3, especially during the period 53-40 ka, than at the Last Glacial Maximum. Our results also suggest that climate on the basis of vegetation change was cooler and drier during MIS 3 than during the Holocene optimum; however, MIS 3 vegetation was probably similar to modern vegetation. The close relationship between vegetation change, insolation and Asian summer monsoon strength suggests that climate variations, probably in both temperature and precipitation, are the primary drivers of regional vegetation change.

Maskevarri Rahppat in Finnmark, northern Norway - is it an earthquake-induced landform complex?	SOLID EARTH												The Sami word rahppat means rough bouldery/ stony terrain with sharp-relief topography in Finnmark, northern Norway. Rahppat is a common name in the region of the Younger Dryas landforms, yet the origin of rahppat has remained obscure. The timing of the Younger Dryas is concomitant with the maximum neotectonic fault instability in Fennoscandia. Hence, earthquake activity may have been one of the contributing factors for the Younger Dryas morphologies. Rahppat on the Maskevarri fell, classified as a part of Tromso-Lyngen sub-stage of the Younger Dryas, was studied by means of geomorphology and measurements of electrical-sedimentary anisotropy. Rahppat was found to be built up of an anastomosing network of stony esker-like ridges and mounds bordered with arch-shaped and sinusoidal ridges. These bordering ridges exhibit sedimentary (azimuthal soil electrical conductivity) anisotropy parallel-to-ridge trends and were interconnected to meltwater gullies suggesting generation through short-lived conduit infills. We did not find electrical-sedimentary evidence to support the concept of englacial thrusting and/or compression, often described for Younger Dryas moraines. Maskevarri Rahppat is typified by similar to 500 ponds and small lakes on three different elevations descending in an up-ice direction. These may have generated through late glacial earthquake(s) also contributing to subglacial deformation of Maskevarri Rahppat.																			1869-9510	1869-9529					2014	5	2					683	691		10.5194/se-5-683-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/se-5-683-2014													WOS:000347545800008

It has been shown that the potential for morphological preservation of Niuafo'ou cyanobacteria is highly dependent on the timing and type of mineral phase involved in the fossilization process. Four main modes of mineralization of cyanobacteria organic parts have been recognized: (i) primary early postmortem calcification by aragonite nanograins that transform quickly into larger needle-like crystals and almost totally destroy the cellular structures, (ii) primary early postmortem silicification of almost intact cyanobacterial cells that leave a record of spectacularly well-preserved cellular structures, (iii) replacement by silica of primary aragonite that has already recrystallized and obliterated the cellular structures, (iv) occasional replacement of primary aragonite precipitated in the mucopolysaccharide sheaths and extracellular polymeric substances by Al-Mg-Fe silicates. These observations suggest that the extremely scarce earliest fossil record may, in part, be the result of (a) secondary replacement by silica of primary carbonate minerals (aragonite, calcite, siderite), which, due to recrystallization, had already annihilated the cellular morphology of the mineralized microbiota or (b) relatively late primary silicification of already highly degraded and no longer morphologically identifiable microbial remains.

A total of 100 lakes provided sufficient numbers of ostracod shells. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyse the influence of a number of environmental variables on the distributions of surface sediment ostracod assemblages. Of 23 variables determined for each site, 19 were included in the statistical analysis. Lake water electrical conductivity (8.2%), Ca% (7.6%) and Fe% (4.8%, ion concentrations as % of the cations) explained the greatest amounts of variation in the distribution of ostracod taxa among the 100 lakes. Electrical conductivity optima and tolerances were calculated for abundant taxa. A transfer function, based on weighted averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS), was developed for electrical conductivity (r(2) = 0.71, root-mean-square-error of prediction [RMSEP] = 0.35 [12.4% of gradient length], maximum bias = 0.64 [22.4% of gradient length], as assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation) based on 96 lakes. Our results show that ostracods provide reliable estimates of electrical conductivity and can be used for quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions similarly to more commonly used diatom, chironomid or pollen data.

Though quite a lot of work has been carried out to understand the formation of HNMs, the relationship between HNMs formation and the nitrite remains unclear. In this study, the effects of nitrite on the formation of HNMs during chlorination of organic matter from different origin were assessed. Organic matter (OM) derived from phoenix tree (fallen leaves: FLOM; green leaves: GLOM) and Microcystis aeruginosa (intracellular organic matter: IOM) were used to mimic the allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter in surface water, respectively. Results showed that HNMs yields were significantly enhanced with the addition of nitrite, and the highest enhancement was observed for FLOM, successively followed by GLOM and IOM, suggesting that the contribution of nitrite to HNMs formation was positively related with SUVA (an indicator for aromaticity) of OM. Therefore, the nitrite contamination should be strictly controlled for the source water dominated by allochthonous OM, which may significantly reduce the formation of HNMs during chlorination. Moreover, given a certain nitrite level, the higher pH resulted in higher stimulation of HNM formation, yet the chlorine dose (always added in excess resulting in residual reactive chlorine), reaction time and temperature did not show obvious influence.

As the lake fills, a wedge of water penetrates beneath the glacier, and the surface of this 'ice dam' rises; the surface then falls as the lake drains. Detailed optical surveying of the glacier near the lake allows characterization of ice-dam deformation. Surface uplift rate is close to the rate of lake-level rise within about 400 m of the lake, then decreases by 90% over about 100 m. Such a steep gradient in uplift rate cannot be explained in terms of ice-dam flexure. Moreover, survey targets spanning the zone of steep uplift gradient move relative to one another in a nearly reversible fashion as the lake fills and drains. Evidently, the zone of steep uplift gradient is a fault zone, with the faults penetrating the entire thickness of the ice dam. Fault motion is in a reverse sense as the lake fills, but in a normal sense as the lake drains. As the overall fault pattern is the same from year to year, even though ice is lost by calving, the faults must be regularly regenerated, probably by linkage of surface and bottom crevasses as ice is advected toward the lake basin.

Bioremediation using the combined emergent and submerged plants to control the microalgae growth was investigated in the present study. Two water bodies (Bei and Xin) of Yuyuantan Park in Beijing were selected for the field experiments, and the other lakes with different vegetation of macrophytes were selected as the comparison. The concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), and water temperature and transparency were monitored before and after bioremediation from 2015 to 2017. Results showed that the effects of microalgal inhibition were more significant 2 years after bioremediation. Specifically, the chl a of Dong Lake without any vegetation of macrophytes was up to 65.1 mu g/L in summer of 2017, while the Bei and Xin Lakes was only 6.2 and 11.3 mu g/L, respectively. In addition, the water quality and transparency also improved, with water bodies being crystal clear. Submerged plants played major roles in microalgal control and water quality improvement, compared to the lakes with only emergent plants. The intensity of humic acid-like substances in three-dimensional fluorescent spectra was stronger for the lakes with submerged plants.

To date, the only known DP manufacturing plant is located in Niagara Falls, NY (OxyChem). Dechloranes including DP, Dechlorane (Mirex), and the recently discovered Dechlorane 602 (Dec 602) were detected in air, soil, and sediment, while Dechlorane 603 and Dechlorane 604 were below detection limit in all matrices. DP air concentrations near the facility ranged from 7737 to 26 734 pg m(-3), the greatest reported thus far. Soil concentrations in the same area for DP, Dechlorane, and Dec 602 were 1490 +/- 3580 ng g(-1), 81.6 +/- 96.5 ng g(-1), and 7.24 +/- 13.2 ng g(-1) dry weight, respectively. Interestingly, lower concentrations of DP (4.93 +/- 4.34 ng g(-1)), Dechlorane (30.2 +/- 19.9 ng g(-1)), and Dec 602 (2.14 +/- 2.23 ng g(-1)) were found in sediment from a nearby canal. Spatial trends of Dechlorane and Dec 602 in soil were similar to DP, implying that the DP manufacturing plant may also be a source of these other flame retardants. DP soil concentrations surrounding the facility decreased by an order of magnitude within 7.5 km. The syn-DP fractional abundance (fsr) value (0.40) for the commercial DP product manufactured at Anpon was slightly higher than that (0.20-0.36) produced by OxyChem. The fsyn value in most air samples was largely similar to the Chinese commercial DP mixture, while most soil and sediment abundances were lower, suggesting a stereoselective depletion of syn-DP.

Individual particle analysis provides combined elemental and morphologic characterizations. Results are presented in terms of particle projected area per unit volume (PAV), consistent with optical impacts, and partitioned into seven generic particle types according to composition. Minerals of terrigenous origins, particularly clay minerals, dominated the inorganic particle populations of all the study systems except one downstream reservoir. Higher PAV levels were observed in the Catskill system. Particle dynamics represented by PAV were driven primarily by runoff, while the reservoirs were also greatly influenced by the timing of sediment resuspension promoted by drawdown of the surface and fall mixing. The benefit of the serial configuration of the reservoirs in decreasing inorganic particles with progression downstream towards the city is demonstrated. The patterns in PAV levels among the study systems generally tracked those of more common metrics of impacts of suspensoids, including mass concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and Secchi disc transparency.

He examined only the time-averaged sound levels and did not report measurements of individual snowflake impacts. Subsequently, the noise produced by individual and multiple snowflake impacts was examined for a number of different snowfalls. The radiated acoustic signals generated by the impact of individual snowflakes upon a body of water have a remarkable similarity to each other and differ principally in the frequency of the emitted sound wave. The acoustic signal of a snowflake impact thus generates a characteristic signature for snowfall that is clearly distinct from other forms of precipitation noise. Various aspects of this signature suggest that the radiated acoustic waveform from a snowflake impacting with water is due to the entrainment of a gas bubble into the liquid, and the subsequent oscillation of this bubble as it establishes its equilibrium state. Various scenarios are presented for bubble entrainment and approximations to the amplitude of the radiated signal and the acoustic waveform are obtained. (C) 1999 Acoustical Society of America.

Significant changes in its capacity to do this will have direct impacts on regional climatic gradients and global atmospheric circulation. Determining the mechanisms that force long-term variation in monsoon behavior is therefore important for understanding global climate change. Competing theories vary in the degree of importance attached to glacial forcing, other orbital rhythms, and internal feedback mechanisms as primary drivers of change. There is, however, no convincing explanation as to why different proxy records from closely neighboring regions are tuned to different orbital rhythms. Here we present quantitative climatic reconstructions for the past 450 k.y. based on a long pollen record from Lake Biwa in Japan. The data suggest that continental and oceanic air mass temperatures respond predominantly to the 100 k.y. orbital rhythm, whereas the land-ocean temperature gradient and monsoon vigor oscillate mainly at the 23 k.y. insollation cycle. We suggest that the mechanisms for this behavior lie in the differential response of land and ocean to solar forcing, and conclude that the 100 k.y. signal dominates monsoon intensity only when the amplitude of solar forcing falls below a threshold level.

(Amoebozoa, Vannellida) and rainbow trout nodular gill disease (NGD) in Russia	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												An outbreak of nodular gill disease (NGD) in farmed rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792) was recorded in Ladoga Lake (Karelia, north-western Russia) in Spring 2020. The disease was characterised by typical clinical signs including asphyxiation, distended opercula, loss of activity and swimming upside down under the water surface. Maximum monthly mortality was 15.2%. The histological examination of the gills showed deformation and clubbing of lamellae, epithelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia, lamellar fusion and fusion of filaments. Granulomas were located within the epithelial layer and/or rose above its surface. Light microscopic in vivo observations of the mucus smears from the affected gills revealed numerous amoeboid protists demonstrating a flattened body when adhering to the substratum, and blunt, radiating pseudopodia when afloat. Based on these morphological characters, these amoebae could be assigned to the Discosea (Amoebozoa), and analyses of their small subunit rRNA gene sequences showed that they belonged to the genus Vannella Bovee, 1965. The results reported herein support the designation of a new species, V. mustalahtiana sp. nov. Despite having been isolated from the gills of a freshwater fish, the species belongs to a Glade of Vannella comprising mostly species isolated from marine and brackish water habitats. These findings may be essential for the aetiology and treatment of the disease.

Pseudovertical Temperature Profiles in a Broad Valley from Lines of Temperature Sensors on Sidewalls	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Pseudovertical temperature soundings from lines of inexpensive temperature sensors on the sidewalls of Utah's Salt Lake valley are compared with contemporaneous radiosonde soundings from the north, open end of the valley. Morning [0415 mountain standard time (MST)] soundings are colder, and afternoon (1615 MST) soundings are warmer than radiosonde soundings because of warm and cold boundary layers that form over the slopes. Cross-valley temperature differences occur between east- and west-facing sidewalls because of differing insolation. Differences in vertically averaged pseudovertical and radiosonde temperatures are generally within 1 degrees C, with a standard deviation of 2 degrees-3 degrees C. The pseudovertical soundings are especially good proxies for radiosondes in winter. The sounding comparisons identified along-valley differences in temperature, inversion depth, and lapse rate that have led to hypotheses concerning their causes, to be evaluated with future research. The low cost and much better time resolution of the pseudovertical soundings suggest that such lines will be a useful supplement to valley radiosondes and will have significant operational advantages if available in real time. Lines of surface-based sensors will prove useful in identifying intravalley meteorological differences and may be used to estimate free-air temperature structure in other valleys where radiosondes are unavailable.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				NOV	2014	53	11					2430	2437		10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0177.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0177.1													WOS:000344938500002

When this planktonic diatom is cultivated in water from one of these lakes, Windermere, the addition of small amounts of phosphate phosphorus permits the growth of so large a crop that all the silica present is incorporated into the cells. The intensity and duration of the illumination and the temperature of the water affect this relationship between silica, phosphorus and the growth Asterionella. Therefore, the regular, observed relationship between the concentration of silica and the vernal maximum of Asterionella in nature may be related to the amount of this substance in the water, to the amount of phosphate phosphorus present and to the rate of growth imposed upon this diatom by the light and temperature conditions in the lake during the period concerned. The possible importance of the relatively low concentration of phosphate phosphorus in certain very unproductive lakes is discussed.																			0003-9276						1962	42	2					117	+		10.1007/BF00408168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00408168								14449810					WOS:A19625641A00002

Monitoring data was collected in an effort to understand the impact of this change on the crustacean zooplankton composition and abundance and the biomass variation in the Huayanghe Lakes between a regular hydrological cycle (RHC) and an extreme hydrological cycle (EHC). The crustacean zooplankton community composition, abundance, and biomass in the floodplain lakes were markedly affected by the water-level disturbance. The number of species was lower in the RHC, but the mean density and biomass decreased from 93.84 +/- 13.29 ind./L and 6.11 +/- 0.89 mg/L, respectively, in the RHC to 66.62 +/- 10.88 ind./L and 1.22 +/- 0.26 mg/L, respectively, in the EHC. Pearson correlations and redundancy analyses revealed the environmental factors with the most significant impact on the crustacean zooplankton community differed between the RHC and EHC cycles. Little previous information exists on the zooplankton in these lakes, and the present study provides data on the zooplankton composition, abundance, and biomass, both at baseline and in response to hydrological changes.

J	Ortega-Guerrero, A				Ortega-Guerrero, Adrian			Evaporative concentration of arsenic in groundwater: health and environmental implications, La Laguna Region, Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												High arsenic concentrations in groundwater have been documented in La Laguna Region (LLR) in arid northern Mexico, where arsenic poisoning is both chronic and endemic. A heated debate has continued for decades on its origin. LLR consisted of a series of ancient connected lakes that developed at the end of a topographic depression under closed basin conditions. This study addresses the isotopic, chemical composition of the groundwater and geochemical modeling in the southeasternmost part of the LLR to determine the origin of arsenic. Groundwater samples were obtained from a carbonate and granular aquifers and from a clayey aquitard at terminal Viesca Lake. Results show that groundwater originated as meteoric water that reached the lakes mainly via abundant springs in the carbonate aquifer and perennial flooding of the Nazas-Aguanaval Rivers. Paleo-lake water underwent progressive evaporation as demonstrated by the enrichment of delta O-18, delta H-2 and characteristic geochemical patterns in the granular aquifer and aquitard that resulted in highly saline (> 90,000 mS/cm), arsenic-rich (up to 5000 mu g/L) paleo-groundwater (> 30,000 years BP). However, adsorption or co-precipitation on iron oxides, clay-mineral surfaces and organic carbon limited arsenic concentration in the groundwater. Arsenic-rich groundwater and other solutes are advancing progressively from the lacustrine margins toward the main granular aquifer, due to reversal of hydraulic gradients caused by intensive groundwater exploitation and the reduction in freshwater runoff provoked by dam construction on the main rivers. Desorption of arsenic will incorporate additional concentrations of arsenic into the groundwater and continue to have significant negative effects on human health and the environment.

J	LAWLER, GH				LAWLER, GH			THE BIOLOGY AND TAXONOMY OF THE BURBOT, LOTA-LOTA, IN HEMING LAKE, MANITOBA	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Vital statistics on the burbot, Lota lota, of Heming Lake, Manitoba were collected over a period of several years. Age, weight and length data are presented. The maximum age of fish in the sample was 8 years. The largest fish (for which no age was determined) was 33 inches long and weighed 11 pounds. The growth of Heming Lake burbot appears slower than in Lakes Erie and Simcoe. The main types of food found in 1,441 burbot stomachs, in order of highest incidence, were yellow perch, ninespine sticklebacks and crayfish. Winter food was almost exclusively ninespine sticklebacks. The average number of eggs per female was approximately 1/2 million. Spawning probably occurred in early March. The morphometry of the burbot of Heming Lake was described on a sample of over 100 fish. The inadequacy of most of the published data made comparisons with other populations almost impossible. It was concluded that, until statistically significant samples are obtained over the burbot''s range, there is insufficient evidence for recognizing subspecific differences and that all should be referred to as Lota lota (Linnaeus).																									1963	20	2					417	433		10.1139/f63-033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f63-033													WOS:A1963WV54200012

Proxy-based reconstructions of erosion/runoff (Ti), water column salinity (CaCO3), sediment-water interactions (PIA), and provenance of organics (delta C-13(org) and C/N) showed similarities with the summer insolation modulated ITCZ position between similar to 11.5 and 4.2 cal ka BP, and more frequent ENSO between similar to 4.2 and 2.1 cal ka BP. After a possible depositional hiatus between similar to 11.2 and 10.2 cal ka BP, the moderate-to-extremely altered sediments were deposited with enhanced erosion/runoff during the wetter similar to 10.2-6 cal ka BP and the organic matter was dominantly autochthonous. Comparison of delta C-13(org) and C/N suggested that the contribution of C-4 plants to organic matter increased over the drier similar to 6-4.2 cal ka BP. Sediments representing this middle- Holocene drought-like condition showed geochemical similarity with sediments of the Post-Classic drought (similar to 1-0.4 cal ka BP), coeval with abandonment of the Xochicalco culture. Variation in seasonal insolation at orbital scales might have forced frequent droughts between similar to 6 and 4.2 cal ka BP and the ENSO related short-lived storms possibly led to an unstable hydroclimate after similar to 4.2 cal ka BP when the first Olmec settlements commenced in the region. Dissimilarity between this lacustrine archive and speleothems from southwest Mexico for the later part of the Holocene reflected different sensitivities of the geological records to seasonal and-annual precipitation.

J	Nykamp, M; Knitter, D; Schütt, B				Nykamp, Moritz; Knitter, Daniel; Schuett, Brigitta			Late Holocene geomorphodynamics in the vicinity of Gobekli Tepe, SE Turkey	CATENA												This study traces the geomorphological development in the environs of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic site Gobekli Tepe by means of radiocarbon dated sediment profiles from its close vicinity. Based on facies interpretation we identify different depositional environments and discuss the involved process dynamics. Our results show that the sediments from the foot slopes are characterized by soil creep and slope wash. Further downstream, in the proximal piedmont zone, fluvial deposition prevails forming a channel and an overbank facies. The sediments at the foot slopes were mainly deposited during Roman and Byzantine times, while those from the proximal piedmont zone cover the period from the Bronze Age to the Roman times. Phases of geomorphological activity and stability can be distinguished in the course of the later Holocene, where organic rich topsoils were buried at c. 4750, 4200, and 3650 cal. a BP documenting phases of landscape stability followed by enhanced geomorphodynamics. These phases fall into the Bronze Age in Anatolia and coincide with an increasing population, pronounced human impact, and climatic aridization that occurred in Turkey around 5.3-4.1 ka BP. Our findings provide among the first insights into the environmental development including the involved process dynamics in the vicinity of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Gobekli Tepe during the later Holocene, also allowing to further develop hypotheses for the period of its occupation.					; Knitter, Daniel/AAD-2142-2020	Nykamp, Moritz/0000-0003-2074-1511; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2020	195								104759	10.1016/j.catena.2020.104759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104759													WOS:000580366300021

SUBSPECIES STATUS AND POPULATION GENETIC STRUCTURE IN PIPING PLOVER (CHARADRIUS MELODUS)	AUK												Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) is a migratory shorebird that is listed as endangered in Canada and the U.S. Great Lakes and as threatened throughout the rest of its breeding and winter range. We undertook a comprehensive molecular-genetic investigation to (1) address subspecific taxonomy, (2) characterize Population genetic structure, and (3) infer past bottlenecks and demographic processes in this species. Analyses included individuals from 23 U.S. states and Canadian provinces and were based on initochondrial DNA sequences (580 base pairs, n = 245) and 8 nuclear microsatellite loci (n = 229). Our findings provide support for separate Atlantic and Interior subspecies (C. m. melodus and C. m. circumcinctus, respectively). Birds from the Great Lakes region were allied with the Interior subspecies and should be referred to as C. m. circumcinctus. Population genetic analyses illustrated stronger genetic structure among Atlantic than among Interior birds, which may reflect reduced natal- and breeding-site fidelity of Interior individuals. Furthremore, analyses suggested that Interior birds previously experienced genetic bottlenecks, whereas there was no evidence of such patterns in the Atlantic subspecies. We interpret these results in light of 25 years of range-wide census data. Overall, differences between Interior and Atlantic Piping Plovers may reflect differences in spatiotemporal stability of nesting habitat between regions.

J	Li, WM; Wang, BB; Ma, YM				Li, Weimo; Wang, Binbin; Ma, Yaoming			Quantifying the CO2 sink intensity of large and small saline lakes on the Tibetan Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study quantitatively evaluates the carbon dioxide (CO2) sink intensity of a large saline lake (area > 2000 km(2)) and a small saline lake (area 1.4 km(2)) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), alongside an alpine meadow, by analysing their net ecosystem exchange (NEE) figures obtained by eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Specifically, the "large lake" exhibits an NEE value of -122.51 g C m(-2) yr(-1), whereas the small lake has an NEE value of -47.17 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The alpine meadow, in contrast, demonstrates an NEE value of -128.18 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Through standardization of the eddy flux data processing and accounting for site-specific conditions with a wind direction filter and footprint analysis, the study provides robust estimates of CO2 sink intensity. The "large lake" was found to absorb CO2 primarily during non-icing cold periods with minimal exchange occurring during ice-covered season, whereas the "small lake" showed no significant CO2 exchange throughout the year. On the other hand, alpine meadows engaged in CO2 uptake during the vegetative growth season but showed weak CO2 release in winter. CO2 uptake in lakes is mainly controlled by ice barrier and chemical processes, while biological processes dominate the alpine meadow. The carbon sink intensity of the TP's saline lakes is estimated to be 1.87-3.01 Tg C yr(-1), smaller than the previous reported estimations. By evaluating the CO2 sink intensity of different lakes, the study highlights the importance of saline lakes in regional carbon balance assessments. It specifically points out the differential roles lakes of various sizes play in the carbon cycle, thereby enriching our understanding of carbon dynamics in high-altitude lacustrine ecosystems.

The EDCs can be introduced into an aquatic system via physicochemical reactions by nature and anthropogenic activities mainly including pharmaceuticals and industrial discharges. Generally, concentrations of EDCs in the Pearl River fall in higher ranges than those in other lakes and rivers in China and around the world. The potential hazards of the EDCs in the Pearl River have been thoroughly assessed in the last two decades but not comprehensively compared. This review aimed to discuss the detected concentration levels of EDCs in the surface water and sediment of the Pearl River respectively and conducted the risk assessment for residents along the Pearl River. Among EDCs, six important groups of chemicals (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, nonylphenol, octylphenol, bisphenol A, and triclosan) were selected for analysis in this review due to their environmental ubiquity and toxicity in the Pearl River. The risk assessment indicated there was no potential negative impact of target EDCs on human health via water ingestion.

Conducted during 2013-2014, these observations are coincident with the ISAS/JAXA EXCEED mission's continuous monitoring of the Jo plasma torus and will enable the speculated effects of volcanic outgassing on the torus to be observed directly, in addition to enabling an assessment of the frequency and properties of large-scale outbursts. On 29 August 2013 we detected a powerful eruption (designated 201308C) on Jo at 223.5 +/- 2.6 degrees W, 29.1 +/- 1.8 degrees N. Emitting between 15 and >25 TW, this event is one of the most powerful eruptions ever seen on Io and falls into the rare "outburst" class. This was the third eruption of this type seen on Io in August 2013, an unprecedented occurrence. Also unprecedented was the charting of the decay in thermal emission over the subsequent days and weeks. Modeling of the outburst spectrum places a lower bound of 1200-1300 K on the eruption temperature, and is suggestive of temperatures 1900 K or higher, typically associated with ultramafic lava composition. The eruption is likely a highly energetic, high-volume lava fountain event. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Investigation of non-stationarity in hydro-climatic variables at Rift Valley lakes basin of Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Streamflow, lake level and rainfall data acquired from 11 monitoring stations and 21 grid points at Rift Valley lakes basin of Ethiopia have been analyzed to evaluate short and long term dependence using parametric and non-parametric tests. Temporal variation in land use/cover has also been analyzed to investigate its effect on streamflow. Summer rainfall at Alaba Kulito and Bilate Farm show decreasing trend at 10% significance level. All other events of observed and gridded rainfall and total number of rainy days exhibit insignificant trends. Streamflow and lake level exhibit significant increasing trend for more than three-quarter of events investigated. Extreme wet years are marked with increased positive Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies whereas extreme dry years are characterized by negative SST anomalies. Even though there are such apparent associations between extreme rainfall magnitudes and SST, the frequency of above average total rainfall years to occur is relatively less during the analysis window. The observed trend in streamflow, lake level and rainfall is attributed to the combined effect of global climatic change and variability on local climate and altered catchment condition over the years. Thus, simultaneous analysis of catchment dynamics and hydro-climatic variables using multiple time series models to detect non-stationarity eliminate potential bias of ruling out the effect of catchment dynamics.

The detection of the aminotransferase domain located on modules mcyE and ndaF using specific molecular markers confirmed the presence of potential toxin-producing cyanobacteria. The eight nucleotide sequences obtained from DGGE bands were placed in three divergent cyanobacterial clusters. Five nucleotide sequences were close to members of the genera Anabaenopsis and Umezakia (Nostocales), two sequences fell in the cluster with Arthrospira sp. (Oscillatoriales) and one sequence was related to Chroococcidiopsis sp. (Pleurocapsales). The presence of the latter taxon was demonstrated de novo in the investigated lakes. All nine attained nucleotide sequences of the aminotransferase region belonged to the mcyE module. Five sequences of the aminotransferase domain were included in the cluster having the nucleotide sequence of Anabaena sp. but showed a separate lineage. Other four aminotransferases were placed in the cluster represented by nucleotide sequence of Microcystis aeruginosa. To our knowledge, this is the first report on molecular detection of cyanobacterial phylotypes in sediments of African lakes and aminotransferase domains for cyanotoxin production from sediment samples in general.

Distinguishing characteristics were: 1) predominance of bicarbonate among the anions.sbd.accounting for >90% of the negative equivalents in two-thirds of the waterbodies, 2) the near absence of sulfates.sbd.accounting for <1% of the anions in half the samples so that chloride exceeded sulfate (as meq/L) in three-fourths of the waters tested and 3) calcium was the dominant cation, although in certain waters the relative proportion of either magnesium or the monovalent cations was much higher than the world average. Regional patterns in water chemistry were apparent and are largely explained by differences in local geology, inputs from artesian wells or extensive use by humans. Most ionic salinity values were <400 mg/L. Using conventional criteria to assess trophic state, most waterbodies were eutrophic or hypereutrophic when judged by total phosphorus and chlorophyll content but as a whole the lakes sampled were low in nitrogen. Nitrogen:phosphorus ratios (generally <10) and a significant empirical relation for chlorophyll-nitrogen provide evidence that nitrogen limited algal biomass. Secchi transparency values indicate light regimes were affected by nonalgal materials.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 8	1989	184	3					171	189																WOS:A1989CB24300005

Some toxicological assessments of MC-LR have performed at physiological and biochemical levels. However, plenty of blanks about the potential mechanism in aquatic crustacean remains. In this study, we firstly assessed the exposure toxicity of MC-LR to juvenile E. sinensis and clarified that the 96 h LD50 of MC-LR was 73.23 mu g/kg. Then, hepatopancreas transcriptome profiles of MCLR stressed crabs were constructed at 6 h post-injection and 37 differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. These DEGs were enriched in cytoskeleton, peroxisome and apoptosis pathways. To further reveal the toxicity of MC-LR, oxidative stress parameters (SOD, CAT, GSH-px and MDA), apoptosis genes (caspase 3, bcl-2 and bax) and apoptotic cells were detected. Significant accumulated MDA and rise-fall enzyme activities verified the oxidative stress caused by MC-LR. It is noteworthy that quantitative real-time PCR and TUNEL assay indicated that MC-LR stress-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. Interestingly, activator protein-1 may play a crucial role in mediating the hepatotoxicity of MC-LR by regulating apoptosis and oxidative stress. Taken together, our study investigated the toxic effects and the potential molecular mechanisms of MC-LR on juvenile E. sinensis. It provided useful data for exploring the toxicity of MC-LR to aquatic crustaceans at molecular levels.

J	Van den Berg, MS; Coops, H; Simons, J; Pilon, J				Van den Berg, MS; Coops, H; Simons, J; Pilon, J			A comparative study of the use of inorganic carbon resources by Chara aspera and Potamogeton pectinatus	AQUATIC BOTANY												We studied the potential role of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in determining vegetation dominance of Potamogeton pectinatus L. and Chara aspera Deth. ex Willd. by monitoring the seasonal dynamics of DIC in a shallow lake and comparing the use of DIC of the two species. The HCO3- -concentration in summer dropped from 2.5 to <0.5 mM with seasonally increasing Chara biomass, whereas outside the vegetation concentrations remained at 2.5 mm. Inside Potamogeton spp. vegetation DIC decreased from 2.5 to ca. 0.75 mM HCO3 (-). A growth experiment showed ash-free biomass for R pectinatus was nearly two times as high as for C. aspera at 3 mM HCO3-, but almost two times lower at 0.5 mM than at 3.0. In a separate experiment, R pectinatus precultured at a relatively low HCO3- -level had a lower net photosynthetic rate (P-max, 0.1 mmol O-2 g(-1) DW h(-1)) than C. aspera (P-max, 0.1 mmol O-2 g(-1) DW h(-)1) over the range of HCO3--concentrations tested (P-max, 0.14 mmol O-2 g(-1) DW h(-1)). In response to CO2 no significant differences between the compensation points (R pectinatus, 28 mM; C. aspera 66 mM), were observed, but the photosynthetic rate increased faster than for C. aspera than for P. pectinatus. Under field conditions, the use Of CO2 is not important since inside vegetation CO2 -concentrations were below 10 muM, and thus, not available for photosynthesis of either species during the main part of the growth season. It is suggested that C. aspera may be a better competitor for HCO3- than P. pectinatus in conditions with a low HCO3- supply. As HCO3- is a strong limiting factor for growth inside the vegetation and probably the only carbon source available, the superior ability of C. aspera to use HCO3- - may be an important factor explaining its present dominance in Veluwemeer.

James			The OWLeS IOP2b Lake-Effect Snowstorm: Dynamics of the Secondary Circulation	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Intense lake-effect snowfall results from a long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) precipitation band that often forms when the flow is parallel to the long axis of an elongated body of water, such as Lake Ontario. The intensity and persistence of the localized precipitation along the downwind shore and farther inland suggests the presence of a secondary circulation that helps organize such a band, and maintain it for some time as the circulation is advected inland. Unique airborne vertical-plane dual-Doppler radar data are used here to document this secondary circulation in a deep, well-organized LLAP band observed during intensive observing period (IOP) 2b of the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign. The circulation, centered on a convective updraft, intensified toward the downwind shore and only gradually weakened inland. The question arises as to what sustains such a circulation in the vertical plane across the LLAP band. WRF Model simulations indicate that the primary LLAP band and other convergence zones observed over Lake Ontario during this IOP were initiated by relatively shallow airmass boundaries, resulting from a thermal contrast (i.e., land-breeze front) and differential surface roughness across the southern shoreline. Airborne radar data near the downwind shore of the lake indicate that the secondary circulation was much deeper than these shallow boundaries and was sustained primarily by rather symmetric solenoidal forcing, enhanced by latent heat release within the updraft region.					; Geerts, Bart/H-7570-2017	Bergmaier, Philip/0000-0002-9389-9646; Campbell, Leah/0000-0001-6601-8770; Geerts, Bart/0000-0002-1508-6121													0027-0644	1520-0493				JUL	2017	145	7					2437	2459		10.1175/MWR-D-16-0462.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0462.1													WOS:000402574700002

Isolation, identification and outdoor cultivation of thermophilic freshwater microalgae Coelastrella sp. FI69 in bubble column reactor for the application of biofuel production	BIOCATALYSIS AND AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY												Identifying a suitable microalga, which has the attributes of optimal growth characteristics, preferable biofuel profile and high-value product accumulation capability, is necessary for a feasible microalgal cultivation process. In this regard, the objective of this present study comes under the topic called phyco-prospecting, which is identification of appropriate microalgae for a specified task. With this, the aim of the study is to molecularly identify an interest of organism to conduct outdoor cultivation, biomass production and biofuel evaluation. Concerning this, environmental samples were collected from a dry lake at summer time to isolate thermophilic microalgae using traditional isolation techniques. The isolated microalgae was identified as species of Coelastrella based on 18 s rRNA gene analysis, and tested specifically for its thermo-tolerant competency at an outdoor pilot scale cultivation facility. Based on the desirable growth performance of the species, it was further cultivated in series of bubble column reactors aerated at a higher rate of 4.4 vv(-1) m(-1) of 0.04%, 1.5% and 5% CO2 (vv(-1)) enriched air. Improved growth was observed in 1.5% CO2 aeration, whereas slightly inhibited growth was found biomass productivity, and produced 3.5 g L-1 of dry biomass from 0.05 g L-1 of initial concentration within 9 days of cultivation. The biomasses had similar to 18% (ww(-1)) of total lipids, and the fatty acid profile of lipids shows higher presence of C18:1, which is desirable for biodiesel conversion. The energy content biomass was about 21 MJ kg(-1), and the reddish pigment accumulation characteristic of the species was considered as beneficial.

To analyze the scattered power in terms of surface conditions, verification sensors are collocated with the GNSS receiver. The ground-based mobile sensor suite we have developed consists of: a reflected-GNSS antenna and universal software radio peripheral (USRP) front end; a second (direct) GNSS reference antenna and USRP; lidar; camera; weather station and supporting power and electronics. The mobile sensor suite is set up on a dock on the Lake Michigan shore in Chicago, Illinois. Data are post-processed to acquire GPS L1 signals and to estimate the sensor suite location. The weather station and collocated camera data provide the reference surface temperature and wind speed conditions. Almanac information is used to compute the specular points' (SP) positions in the east-north-up coordinate system (ENU). To determine specular point position on the surface, a LiDAR-SP map is computed. The SP-LiDAR map helps to find the location of the SP on the water. A delay-Doppler map (DDM) is a representation of the power scattered in time delay and Doppler shift, and depends on surface conditions. A DDM is computed for the satellite whose corresponding SP is located on the water and has a high elevation angle, to minimize direct GPS signal interference. We use an incoherent integration signal processing method to compute the DDM due to the signal noise level in this work. The DDMs for both direct and reflected GPS signals are examined. DDMs generated from the directly received signal correctly show the power concentrated at the code chip and Doppler frequency of the acquired satellite, indicating that the incoherent processing is sound. The sensor suite and processing will be used in future data campaigns for detecting seasonal freshwater and surface ice variations.					; pan, li/LCE-3452-2024	Pervan, Boris/0000-0002-9466-2499; 													2331-5911	2331-5954					2018							2834	2847		10.33012/2018.15860	http://dx.doi.org/10.33012/2018.15860													WOS:000545000102063

Amino acid-assimilating phototrophic heliobacteria from soda lake environments: Heliorestis acidaminivorans sp nov and 'Candidatus Heliomonas lunata'	EXTREMOPHILES												Two novel taxa of heliobacteria, Heliorestis acidaminivorans sp. nov. strain HR10B(T) and 'Candidatus Heliomonas lunata' strain SLH, were cultured from shoreline sediments/soil of Lake El Hamra (Egypt) and lake water/benthic sediments of Soap Lake (USA), respectively; both are highly alkaline soda lakes. Cells of strain HR10B were straight rods, while cells of strain SLH were curved rods. Both organisms were obligate anaerobes, produced bacteriochlorophyll g, and lacked intracytoplasmic photosynthetic membrane systems. Although the absorption spectrum of strain HR10B was typical of other heliobacteria, that of strain SLH showed unusually strong absorbance of the OH-chlorophyll a component. Major carotenoids of both organisms were OH-diaponeurosporene glucosyl esters, as in other alkaliphilic heliobacteria, and both displayed an alkaliphilic and mesophilic phenotype. Strain HR10B was remarkable among heliobacteria in its capacity to photoassimilate a number of carbon sources, including several amino acids. Nitrogenase activity was observed in strain HR10B, but not in strain SLH. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene tree placed strain HR10B within the genus Heliorestis, but distinct from other described species. By contrast, strain SLH was phylogenetically more closely related to neutrophilic heliobacteria and is the first alkaliphilic heliobacterium known outside of the genus Heliorestis.																			1431-0651	1433-4909				JUL	2012	16	4					585	595		10.1007/s00792-012-0458-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00792-012-0458-8								22588563					WOS:000305886500002

Beginning in the 1890s, the channel was greatly simplified for navigation. By the 1940s, it was polluted by organic wastes, which resulted in low dissolved oxygen concentrations and floating and benthic sludge deposits that hindered salmon migration and boating. Following basin-wide secondary waste treatment and low-flow augmentation, water quality markedly improved, salmon runs returned, and recreational uses increased. However, water pollution remains a problem as do physical habitat alterations, flow modification, and alien species. Fish assemblages in the main-stem Willamette River were sampled systematically, but with different gear, in the summers of 1945, 1983, and 1999. In the past 53 years, tolerant species occurrences decreased and intolerant species occurrences increased. In the past 20 years, alien fishes have expanded their ranges in the river, and four native fish species have been listed as threatened or endangered. We associate these changes with improved water quality between 1945 and 1983, fish migrations, altered flow regimes and physical habitat structure, and more extensive sampling.																			0892-2284		1-888569-72-7				2005	45						61	74																WOS:000232020900005

Rapid climate changes during the Lateglacial and the early Holocene as seen from plant community dynamics in the Polar Urals, Russia	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												A detailed, well-dated record of pollen and sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) for the period 15 000-9500 cal a bp describes changes at Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye in the Polar Ural Mountains, located far east of the classical Lateglacial sites in western Europe. Arctic tundra rapidly changed to lusher vegetation, possibly including both dwarf (Betula nana) and tree birch (B. pubescens), dated in our record to take place 14 565 cal a bp, coincident with the onset of the Bolling in western Europe; this was paralleled by increased summer temperatures. A striking feature is an early decline in Betula pollen and sedaDNA reads 300 years before the onset of the Younger Dryas (YD) in western Europe. Given the solid site chronology, this could indicate that the YD cooling started in Siberia and propagated westwards, or that the vegetation reacted to the inter-Allerod cooling at 13 100 cal a bp and did not recover during the late Allerod. During the YD, increases in steppe taxa such as Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae suggest drier conditions. At the onset of the Holocene, the vegetation around the lake reacted fast to the warmer conditions, as seen in the increase of arboreal taxa, especially Betula, and a decrease in herbs such as Artemisia and Cyperaceae.

Managenes oxidation was dependent on photosynthetic activity: no oxidation was observed in the dark when cells were grown heterotrophically on glucose, or in the light when photosystem II was inhibited by the addition of DCMU. Manganates were not formed when mediat were buffered below pH 8.0, suggesting that an important driving force for manganese oxidation was the high pH resulting from photosynthesis. Field studies with minielectrodes in Oneida Lake, New York, demonstrated steep gradients of O2 and pH and the presence of particulate manganic oxides associated with pelagic aggregates of the cyanobacterium Micocystis sp. The manganese oxidation reaction apparently occurs only when photosynthesizing algae are present as dense populations that can generate microenvironments of high (> 9.0) pH, either as aggregates in the pelagic zone or concentrated cell cultures in the laboratory. A large-scale transition from soluble to particulate mangenese was measured in the surface waters of Oneida Lake throughout summer 1986. Removal of Mn(II) was correlated with the presence of aggregate-forming cyanobacteria that oxidize Mn(II) by the mechanism described above.

Selective Survival of Escherichia coli Phylotypes in Freshwater Beach Sand	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Escherichia coli is used as an indicator of fecal pollution at beaches despite evidence of long-term survival in sand. This work investigated the basis for the survival of E. coli through field microcosm experiments and phylotypic characterization of >1,400 E. coli isolates recovered from sand, sewage, and gulls, enabling the identification of long-surviving populations and environmental drivers of their persistence. Microcosms containing populations of E. coli from each source (n =176) were buried in the backshore of Lake Michigan for 45 and 96 days under several different nutrient treatments, including unaltered native sand, sterile autoclaved sand, and baked nutrient-depleted sand. The availabilities of carbon and nitrogen, as well as competition with the indigenous community, were major factors that influenced E. coli survival. E. coli Clermont phylotypes B1 and A were the dominant phylotypes surviving seasonally (>6 weeks), regardless of source and nutrient treatment, whereas cryptic Glade and D/E phylotypes survived over the winter (>300 days). Autoclaved sand, presumably supplying nutrients through increased availability, promoted growth, and the presence of the indigenous microbial community reduced this effect. Screening of 849 sand E. coli isolates from four freshwater beaches demonstrated that B1 and D/E were the most common phylotypes recovered. Analysis by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the Gull2, Lachno3, and HB human markers demonstrated that only 25% of the samples had evidence of gull waste and none of the samples had evidence of human waste. These findings suggest that the prevalence of E. coli in sand could be attributed more to long-term-surviving populations than to new fecal pollution. IMPORTANCE Fecal pollution monitoring still relies on E. coli enumeration, despite the fact that this organism can survive for prolonged periods and has been shown to be easily transported from sand into surrounding waters through waves and runoff, thus no longer representing recent fecal pollution events. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that regardless of the host source, certain genetically distinct subgroups, or phylotypes, survive longer than others under conditions typical of Great Lakes beach sites. We found that nutrients were a major driver of survival and could actually promote growth and that the presence of native microorganisms modulated these effects. These insights into the dynamics and drivers of survival will improve the interpretation of E. coli measurements at beaches and inform strategies that could focus on reducing nutrient inputs to beaches or maintaining a robust natural microbiome in beach sand.

Concentrations of mercury in feathers from the western part of the lake fell during the period 1969-1998, when pollution from industrial mercury had decreased and a paper mill upstream of the lake was closed down in 1979. Nestlings from the eastern part of the lake had initially lower levels of mercury, predominantly from atmospheric fallout. The levels did not decrease during the period. The reason for the differences seems to be the limited water flow between the western and the eastern part of the lake. The selenium concentrations were constant over time and approximately the same in both parts of the lake. The total-Hg/Se ratio in the western part of the lake was 2.94, which is somewhat higher than the 1:1 molar ratio constant (2.54). This indicates that the bioaccumulated quantity of selenium which is thought to be protective for the organisms against the toxic effects of mercury, is somewhat insufficient to bind all body mercury.																			0044-7447	1654-7209				MAY	2004	33	3					133	137		10.1639/0044-7447(2004)033[0133:TTFOON]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1639/0044-7447(2004)033[0133:TTFOON]2.0.CO;2								15151382					WOS:000221132300003

The increasing eutrophication of natural waters has led to an increase in the incidence of algal blooms and the consequent increased risk of microcystin contamination of water resources, The removal of microcystins LR, YR and YA from contaminated water was investigated using an experimental laboratory-scale photocatalytic 'falling film' reactor in which an oxygen purge, UV radiation and semiconductor titanium dioxide (TiO2) catalyst were used to oxidatively decompose the microcystin pollutants. Preliminary studies, using algal extracts spiked into distilled water, indicated that the microcystins were rapidly decomposed in this reactor. The decomposition followed first order reaction kinetics with half-lives of less than 5 min with the reactor operating in a closed-loop mode. Reaction rates were strongly dependent on the amount of TiO2 catalyst (0 5 g/l), but only marginally influenced by a change in gas pul-ge from oxygen to compressed air. The use of lake water, rather than distilled water, showed that this process is feasible in natural waters, although increased levels of catalyst (up to 5 g/l) were required to achieve comparable decomposition rates.

J	VERDUIN, J				VERDUIN, J			PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND GROWTH RATES OF 2 DIATOM COMMUNITIES IN WESTERN LAKE ERIE	ECOLOGY												Comparison of an Asterionella-Cyclotella community with a Stephanodiscus community growing in w. Lake Erie showed that the photosynthetic and respiratory rates of the former were approx. twice those of the latter. Photosynthesis was measured under fluorescent light of about 400 f.c, at temps. close to those of the natural environment. The natural growth rate of the Asterionella-Cyclotella community was about 3 times that of the Stephanodiscus community. Although the Stephanodiscus community grew in water having a depth (18 m.) about twice that of the Asterionella-Cyclotella habitat (8 m.), the euphotic zone represented about one-half the water column in both communities, because the water in the Stephanodiscus community was less turbid (7 ppm.) than in the Asterionella-Cyclotella community (15 ppm.). It is suggested that Stephanodiscus cells may have less active protoplasm per unit volume than Asterionella and Cyclotella cells have, the non-active fraction perhaps representing stored material, and that this may be the most significant difference between the 2 communities. Grazing by herbivores appeared to be negligible during the spring diatom pulse.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1952	33	2					163	168		10.2307/1930636	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930636													WOS:A1952XU89400002

In this study, Upper Oligocene strata from the Daniment and Linfa areas and Lower Miocene strata from the Bengiler area were sampled palynologically and for radiometric dating. The Daniment assemblage, which is older than the Linfa assemblages, mainly contains coniferous and evergreen to deciduous mixed mesophytic forest elements. Relatively high quantities of the altitudinal plants Picea and Abies, indicate a cooler palaeoclimate. The Linfa associations mainly include coniferous and riparian elements. Pollen of the riparian plant Alnus and Taxodiaceae indicative for the swamp forest community was predominant, probably as a result of a high lake level. There is a hiatus during the Oligocene-Miocene transition, probably showing a non-depositional phase and sea-level fall indicating the Mi-1 glaciation event. Higher in the sequence, the Aquitanian Bengiler sediments include high amounts of coniferous forest elements as well as components indicative for the evergreen and deciduous mesophytic forest and also riparian forest and swamp forest. Due to presence of thermophilous taxa Reveesia, Mastixiaceae and Arecaceae, a warm and humid palaeoclimate is inferred according to quantitative analyses using the Coexistence Approach.

J	Azari, H; Nazarian, S; Yuan, D				Azari, Hoda; Nazarian, Soheil; Yuan, Deren			Use of Portable Seismic Property Analyzer to Assess Colorado's Hanging Lake Tunnel Liner	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												A survey of the condition of the tunnel liner in Hanging Lake Tunnel, near Glenwood Springs, Colorado, was performed with a handheld device, the portable seismic property analyzer (PSPA), within the framework of SARP 2 Project R06G. The PSPA simultaneously applies two stress wave-based nondestructive testing (NDT) methods: the ultrasonic surface wave (USW) and the impact-echo (IE). The USW method can provide the average modulus as an indication of the quality of the concrete. The IE method can provide the thickness of the concrete liner or the depth of any reflector within the liner. The objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the PSPA to tunnel work and the performance of the IE and USW methods in estimating the thickness and evaluating the quality of the tunnel liner. For this purpose, several sections of the plenum of Hanging Lake Tunnel were tested. The selection of the testing areas was based on a visual inspection, infrared thermography, and the surface dielectric constant measured by other NDT methods. The results from this study demonstrated that the combination of the IE and USW results provided by the PSPA enhanced the effectiveness of the two methods in detecting and locating the defective areas within the tunnel liner. No additional time was needed to collect the data.																			0361-1981	2169-4052					2014		2407					12	19		10.3141/2407-02	http://dx.doi.org/10.3141/2407-02													WOS:000341280900002

The Holocene palaeoenvironmental changes reflected in the multi-proxy studies of Lake Slone sediments (SE Poland)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Multi-proxy data from the Lake Slone sediments (SE Poland) yielded information on the Holocene changes of Lake Stone in a karst region. Changes of limnological conditions and vegetation reconstructions correspond to high resolution multi-proxy records from north-central Europe. Ostracods showed several small oscillations. Most significant changes occurred at 12300 cal yr BP (Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition) and between 11800 and 11100 cal yr BP ("Preboreal Oscillation"). Lowering of the water table at around 11100-10800 cal yr BP was probably connected with abrupt warming at ca. 11000 cal BP. Temperature and water depth fell at about 8400-8100 cal yr BP (8200 cal yr BP). The Atlantic period was generally warm and is divided into two parts: an older one with comparatively stable water level and a second one (between 7000 and 6300 cal yr BP) with two phases of higher water level separated by lowering at 6800 cal yr BP. At the transition from the Atlantic to the Subboreal (6200-5950 cal yr BP) the dry period is more pronounced than changes in the second half of the Atlantic.

Snow cover, snowmelt timing and stream power in the Wind River Range, Wyoming	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Earlier onset of springtime weather, including earlier snowmelt, has been documented in the western United States over at least the last 50 years. Because the majority (>70%) of the water supply in the western U.S. comes from snowmelt, analysis of the declining spring snowpack (and shrinking glaciers) has important implications for the management of streamflow. The amount of water in a snowpack influences stream discharge which can also influence erosion and sediment transport by changing stream power, or the rate at which a stream can do work, such as move sediment and erode the stream bed. The focus of this work is the Wind River Range (WRR) in west-central Wyoming. Ten years of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) snow-cover, cloud-gap-filled (CGF) map products and 30 years of discharge and meteorological station data are studied. Streamflow data from streams in WRR drainage basins show lower annual discharge and earlier snowmelt in the decade of the 2000s than in the previous three decades, though no trend of either lower streamflow or earlier snowmelt was observed within the decade of the 2000s. Results show a statistically-significant trend at the 95% confidence level (or higher) of increasing weekly maximum air temperature (for three out of the five meteorological stations studied) in the decade of the 1970s, and also for the 40-year study period as a whole. The extent of snow-cover (percent of basin covered) derived from the lowest elevation zone (2500-3000 m) of the WRR, using MODIS CGF snow-cover maps, is strongly correlated with maximum monthly discharge on 30 April, where Spearman's Rank correlation, r(s), = 0.89 for the decade of the 2000s. We also investigated stream power for Bull Lake Creek above Bull Lake; and found a trend (significant at the 90% confidence level) toward reduced stream power from 1970 to 2009. Observed changes in streamflow and stream power may be related to increasing weekly maximum air temperature measured during the 40-year study period, possibly contributing to a reduction in snow cover. In addition, the strong relationship between percent of basin that was snow covered, and maximum monthly streamflow indicates that MODIS snow-cover maps are useful for predicting streamflow, and can be used to improve management of water resources in the drought-prone western United States.

Recovery of three arctic stream reaches from experimental nutrient enrichment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Nutrient enrichment and resulting eutrophication is a widespread anthropogenic influence on freshwater ecosystems, but recovery from nutrient enrichment is poorly understood, especially in stream environments. We examined multi-year patterns in community recovery from experimental low-concentration nutrient enrichment (N + P or P only) in three reaches of two Arctic tundra streams (Kuparuk River and Oksrukuyik Creek) on the North Slope of Alaska (U.S.A.). 2. Rates of recovery varied among community components and depended on duration of enrichment (2-13 consecutive growing seasons). Biomass of epilithic algae returned to reference levels rapidly (within 2 years), regardless of nutrients added or enrichment duration. Aquatic bryophyte cover, which increased greatly in the Kuparuk River only after long-term enrichment (8 years), took 8 years of recovery to approach reference levels, after storms had scoured most remnant moss in the recovering reach. 3. Multi-year persistence of bryophytes in the Kuparuk River appeared to prevent recovery of insect populations that had either been positively (e.g. the mayfly Ephemerella, most chironomid midge taxa) or negatively (e.g. the tube-building chironomid Orthocladius rivuloruin) affected by this shift in dominant primary producer. These lags in recovery (of >3 years) were probably driven by the persistent effect of bryophytes on physical benthic habitat. 4. Summer growth rates of Arctic grayling (both adults and young-of-year) in Oksrukuyik Creek (fertilised for 6 years with no bryophyte colonisation), which were consistently increased by nutrient addition, returned to reference rates within 1-2 years. 5. Rates of recovery of these virtually pristine Arctic stream ecosystems from low-level nutrient enrichment appeared to be controlled largely by duration of enrichment, mediated through physical habitat shifts caused by eventual bryophyte colonisation, and subsequent physical disturbance that removed bryophytes. Nutrient enrichment of oligotrophic Arctic stream ecosystems caused by climate change or local anthropogenic activity may have dramatic and persistent consequences if it results in the colonisation of long-lived primary producers that alter physical habitat.																			0046-5070					JUN	2007	52	6					1077	1089		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01723.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01723.x													WOS:000246904500010

R. life stages (eggs, larvae and pupae) was studied at 3 different temperatures (15.degree., 20.degree. and 25.degree. C) with long day (18/6) conditions. There are differences in developmental rates and developmental thresholds between males and females and a profound influence of insect origin (laboratory or field strain) and nutrition (apple leaves or artificial food) on the developmental biology of these life stages. The data on the development of males (field strain, reared on apple leaves) and on the age specific fecundity of adults kept at 25.degree. C were used to construct a temperature-driven (Gilbert et al. 1976) time distributed (Manetsch 1976; Welch et al. 1978) phenology model to describe the flight pattern as observed in the lake Leman area in western Switzerland. When young larvae are assumed to enter diapause with decreasing daylength, the model satisfactorily describes the 1st flight (moths from the overwintering generation) and the summer flight which included moths from more than 1 generation in 2 out of 5 yr under study.																			0044-2240						1983	95	4					405	413																WOS:A1983QU51100011

Studies insofar have reached divergent conclusions on whether climate change limits or reinforces the extent and duration of hypoxia under ice, raising the need for a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics under lake ice. Using high-temporal resolution time series of DO concentration and temperature across 14 mountain lakes, we showed that the duration of bottom hypoxia under ice varies from 0 to 236 d within lakes and among years. The variability of hypoxia duration was primarily explained by changes in the decay rate of DO above the lake bottom rather than by differences in DO concentration at the ice onset or in the ice-cover duration. We observed that the DO decay rate was primarily linked to physical controls (i.e., deep-water warming) rather than biogeochemical drivers (i.e., proxies for lake or catchment productivity). Using a simple numerical model, we provided a proof-of-concept that the near-bed stratification can be the mechanism tying the DO decay rate to the sediment heat release under the ice. We ultimately showed that the DO decay rate and hypoxia duration are driven by the summer light climate, with faster oxygen decline found under the ice of clearer cryostratified alpine lakes. We derived a framework theorizing how the hypoxia duration might change under the ice of alpine lakes in a warmer climate.					; Ulloa, Hugo N./HOA-7472-2023; Rüegg, Janine/AFP-1428-2022; Doda, Tomy/AGR-1940-2022; Lambert, Thibault/M-7192-2017; Minaudo, Camille/AAG-9707-2019; Beria, Harsh/AAE-4111-2020; Obrador, Biel/A-1856-2009	Ulloa, Hugo N./0000-0002-1995-6630; Ruegg, Janine/0000-0002-7090-4852; Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Lambert, Thibault/0000-0002-7666-5370; Minaudo, Camille/0000-0003-0979-9595; Doda, Tomy/0000-0002-7110-8540; Obrador, Biel/0000-0003-4050-0491													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	2023	68	6					1232	1246		10.1002/lno.12341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12341		MAR 2023											WOS:000956360100001

We present high-resolution pollen, XRF and charcoal records from Lagoa Feia, located in central Cerrados, and assess how they compare with other pollen records from the surrounding region to investigate regional trends of vegetation and fire regime variability. Our results show that the Pleistocene-Holocene transition was marked by a wet episode, which included moist forest expansion and rising lake levels, that correlates well with increased monsoon activity in a large area of central South America during the same period. This wet episode chronologically coincides with the Younger Dryas cold episode in the northern hemisphere. Our data revealed moisture declines in central Cerrados after 11.2 kyr BP, along with centennial-scale fluctuations from dry to wet conditions throughout the early Holocene period until around 6 kyr BP. These dry/wet oscillations are associated with weakened SASM activity and repeated shifts of its belt position during this time range. Fire activity increased in central Cerrados just after the onset of drier conditions during the early Holocene, and likely contributed to decreased arboreal cover at that time. A trend of increasing moisture in the region was observed after 6 kyr BP. Our study reveals how centennial and millennial-scale changes in monsoon activity influenced arboreal cover, diversity and fire regimes in the central Cerrados. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lozhkin, AV; Anderson, PM				Lozhkin, Anatoly V.; Anderson, Patricia M.			Another perspective on the age and origin of the Berelyokh mammoth site (northeast Siberia)	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The Berelyokh site includes an exceptional bone horizon consisting of 8431 remains of Mammuthus primigenius. Previous investigations, spanning similar to 40 years, concluded that the deaths and bone concentration were caused by spring flooding, possibly related to wetter Bolling climates. We review work from these studies with emphasis on under-reported palynological data to provide more detail on paleoenvironmental reconstructions and an alternative interpretation for the age and origin of the bone bed. Palynological results suggest the horizon formed under cool conditions of the last glacial maximum, rather than during a Bolling-type oscillation. Presence of permafrost features and associated tundra pollen taxa in the Berelyokh sections suggest that thermokarst processes, unrelated to climate change, could account for the formation of the bone horizon. The penetration of surface waters into frozen sediments of a high floodplain terrace resulted in the formation of hidden thaw sinks. As thaw continued, the pits expanded with surface soils supported by a viscous water-sediment mixture. The weakened surface gave way under the weight of the mammoths, with the hillside collapsing either due to the animals' struggles or destabilization related to the thaw sinks. This scenario highlights the hazards of thermokarst terrain for present and future populations of northern animals.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				MAR	2018	89	2					459	477		10.1017/qua.2018.3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2018.3													WOS:000430317400007

Total Mercury in Sediments, Macrophytes, and Fish from a Shallow Steppe Lake in Eastern Austria	CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY												During summer 2011, samples of sediment, macrophytes, and fish tissues from the shallow, slightly alkaline Lake Neusiedl, Austria, were evaluated for their total Hg content. This is the first report of Hg levels from this lake. Sediments displayed Hg contents between 0.025 and 0.113gg(-1) dw (dry weight), significantly correlating with the proportion of organic components pointing to a small anthropogenic impact on the lake's Hg content. Hg Levels in plants and fish were unexpectedly high: both investigated submerged plant species, Potamogeton pectinatus and Myriophyllum spicatum, showed mean values of 0.245 +/- 0.152 and 0.298 +/- 0.115gg(-1) dw, respectively. Biomagnification was evident when comparing muscle samples of the planktivorous fish species rudd Scardinus erythrophthalmus (n=10, mean=0.084gg(-1) ww (wet weight)) with the piscivorous perch Perca fluviatilis (n=21, mean=0.184gg(-1) ww) or pike-perch Sander lucioperca (n=9, mean=0.205gg(-1) ww). Significantly lower values were found in the muscle of the piscivorous pike Esox lucius (n=25, mean=0.135gg(-1) ww), pointing to a specific Hg metabolism of this fish, presumably under the particular physicochemical properties of the lake. Hg Concentrations in fish could pose a risk to piscivorous birds in this protected wetland system.

Cyanobacteria blooms are becoming an increasingly common phenomenon worldwide, especially in urban lakes and reservoirs. The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate the potential relationship between cyanobacteria in the drinking water from the Guarapiranga Reservoir and climate change in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo, as well as health risks factors associated. Methods used: literature review and analysis of data on water quality and climate parameters. Results: The Guarapiranga Reservoir in Sao Paulo-Brazil, accountable for supplying water to 3.8 million inhabitants of this city, has shown frequent cyanobacterial blooms when the temperature rises and in rainy weather (summer). Climate change in the city of Sao Paulo can worsen these problems related to drinking water once the ideal climatic conditions for the proliferation of cyanobacteria are increasing in frequency. Especially in the last 20 years, the maximum temperatures are higher and episodes of heavy rain are more frequent. This scenario can magnify a public health problem related to cyanobacteria in Sao Paulo and around the world. Climate change may increase public health risks related to drinking water quality as associated with land use.

Population Characteristics of Paddlefish in Two Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Habitats	PADDLEFISH MANAGEMENT, PROPAGATION, AND CONSERVATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY: BUILDING FROM 20 YEARS OF RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Paddlefish Conservation and Management	DEC 05, 2006	Omaha, NE	Amer Fisheries Soc				Paddlefish Polyodon spathula vanished from areas of the upper Tombigbee River basin in Mississippi and Alabama during the 1950s, long before channelization and damming associated with construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway (TTW) were completed in 1984. This study was undertaken to assess distribution and population dynamics of any remaining stock. Paddlefish were not captured in upstream impoundments, but an unexploited remnant population was located in the downstream impoundment: Demopolis Lake, Alabama. Paddlefish in Demopolis Lake were characterized by a population density of 2.6 fish/ha, high growth rate relative to more northern populations, and natural annual mortality rate (A = 0.406) similar to other southern populations. Two wintering habitats (cutoff bendways) were heavily utilized by paddlefish. Large males primarily inhabited the more lotic bendway while females and small males were more common in the more lentic bendway, indicating differential importance of habitats among demographic groups. The restricted distribution of TTW paddlefish and demographic differences between habitats suggest that areas heavily utilized by paddlefish should be protected from further degradation. Sedimentation has resulted in reductions of bendway depth and reduced connectivity of backwaters, reducing availability of suitable paddlefish habitat. Restoring connectivity of bendways through dredging could reverse this trend and provide other benefits to fisheries.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-12-7				2009	66						83	101																WOS:000278471300006

The main advantages of the records from maar lakes compared with other lacustrine records are as follows: First, the presence of varves (annually laminated layers) and tephra layers, as well as other materials (like terrestrial plant macrofossils, charcoals, organic carbon, organic shells) suitable for isotopic dating (like AMS C-14, Pb-210, Cs-137, U-238/Th-230, 40Ar/39Ar), provides the possibility of developing several independent chronologies, enabling the development of robust, high-resolution chronologies. Second, maars and maar lakes can provide continuous sedimentary records spanning tens of thousands of years (Tianyang Maar in China is hosted the longest known record spanning at least 400 kyr BP) that are ideal for the investigation of climate change on different timescales, including orbital, millennial-centennial and annual-decadal. Third, recent studies of biomarkers based on long-chain alkenones (LCAs) and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) have demonstrated the potential of maar lakes for quantitative paleotemperature reconstruction. In this study, we review some of the more significant achievements of palaeoclimatic research based on maar lake sediment sequences from China, with the focus on chronology, multiple timescales and quantitative paleoclimatic reconstruction.

Paleoenvironmental changes in the basin are important since its deposits are a significant source of Northern Hemisphere dust. In this study we employed a K-feldspar pIRIR dating technique to date shoreline features <= 940 m at multiple locations in the Ejina Basin similar to 45-50 m above the modern basin floor. Internal checks of luminescence characteristics were employed to test the reliability of the pIRIR dating. In combination with our previously reported stratigraphy and chronology of shorelines at <= 927 m in the Ejina Basin, these results imply that a paleolake was present in the basin prior to similar to 350 ka. Other high stands in the basin occurred at similar to 320-310 ka, 240-180 ka, 120-80 ka, and similar to 5 ka, corresponding to MIS 9, MIS 7, MIS 5 and the mid Holocene (MIS 1), respectively, indicating a strong link with glacial-interglacial cycles. Extensions of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) during interglacial periods, possibly interacting with the Westerlies, apparently caused higher precipitation and lake formation. The impact of orbital eccentricity on the EASM/Westerlies appears to be responsible for the formation of major lake/desert cycles on the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.

J	Gula, J; Peltier, WR				Gula, Jonathan; Peltier, W. Richard			Dynamical Downscaling over the Great Lakes Basin of North America Using the WRF Regional Climate Model: The Impact of the Great Lakes System on Regional Greenhouse Warming	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) is employed to dynamically downscale global warming projections produced using the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). The analyses are focused on the Great Lakes Basin of North America and the climate change projections extend from the instrumental period (1979-2001) to midcentury (2050-60) at a spatial resolution of 10 km. Because WRF does not currently include a sufficiently realistic lake component, simulations are performed using lake water temperature provided by D.V. Mironov's freshwater lake model "FLake" forced by atmospheric fields from the global simulations. Results for the instrumental era are first compared with observations to evaluate the ability of the lake model to provide accurate lake water temperature and ice cover and to analyze the skill of the regional model. It is demonstrated that the regional model, with its finer resolution and more comprehensive physics, provides significantly improved results compared to those obtained from the global model. It much more accurately captures the details of the annual cycle and spatial pattern of precipitation. In particular, much more realistic lake-induced precipitation and snowfall patterns downwind of the lakes are predicted. The midcentury projection is analyzed to determine the impact of downscaling on regional climate changes. The emphasis in this final phase of the analysis is on the impact of climate change on winter snowfall in the lee or the lakes. It is found that future changes in lake surface temperature and ice cover under warmer conditions may locally increase snowfall as a result of increased evaporation and the enhanced lake effect.

The well-dated core is located within the former Norse Eastern Settlement and covered the last 1500 yr. The comparison of chironomid stratigraphy (PCA axis scores) with instrumental temperature data, land use history and organic matter in the sediment over the last 140 yr suggested that the primary changes in chironomid fauna in 1988 2 yr were driven by the shift to modem agriculture in the catchment. This unprecedented change in chironomid fauna was most likely triggered by a shift in in-lake processes. Within the instrumental period, subtle variations in the chironomid assemblages that occurred before 1988 2 yr were significantly correlated with summer temperatures even in times of traditional extensive sheep farming in the catchment. The relevance of the chironomid-derived climate signal over the last 1500 yr was supported by its good concordance with previous studies in west Greenland and in the Arctic. The chironomid assemblage therefore appeared to be a valuable proxy for climate changes within the Norse colony area. Synchronous changes in Norse diet and chironomid-reconstructed climate give new insights into the interplay of Norse society with climate. (c) 2014 University of Washington.

Evaluating the genetic status of a Great Basin endemic minnow: the relict dace (Relictus solitarius)	CONSERVATION GENETICS												The relict dace (Relictus solitarius) is an endemic minnow restricted to isolated spring systems within Butte, Goshute, Ruby and Steptoe valleys in the eastern Nevada portion of the Great Basin. It is the only native fish in these basins, but speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus) have been introduced into some localities in Ruby Valley and, based on morphology, the two species are believed to have hybridized in those areas. We used DNA sequence data from one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome b) and one nuclear intron (S7) to determine if putative relict dace populations in Ruby Valley share mtDNA haplotypes with speckled dace, or show signs of hybridization. Results of our analyses show that 11 of 16 Ruby Valley populations sampled contain only speckled dace, and one speckled dace population exhibited signs of limited introgressive hybridization. The remaining five Ruby Valley populations that were sampled contain relict dace that remain genetically distinct from speckled dace. The integrity of the Ruby Valley relict dace populations should be actively protected, particularly in the area surrounding Ruby Lake where speckled dace have been widely introduced.

These mats also prevent gaseous exchange between water and atmosphere resulting in anoxic conditions of the water layer. In shallow waters, nutrient fluxes from the sediment to the water layer are expected to play a key role in the shift to floating plant dominance. This study investigated the potential recruitment and development of duckweed mats from propagule banks in field enclosures containing either muddy or sandy sediment. It was observed that free-floating fronds of Lemna minor were derived from both sediment types, but that dense duckweed mats developed exclusively in enclosures with muddy sediment. The results can be explained by differences in nutrient release from the sediments to the overlying water during summer, when high fluxes, especially of phosphorus and nitrogen, were observed almost exclusively in enclosures with muddy sediment involving anoxia of the water layer. This study discusses the results in relation to free-floating plant dominance and the management of shallow waters.

Lake water samples (n=523) were collected from six stations in the North Basin and three stations in the South Basin. River water samples (n=178) were collected from 14 major rivers flowing into the North Basin. Rainwater samples (n=89) were collected at Otsu. The river water was enriched with Mn, Al, Fe, P, and Zn and the rainwater was enriched with Zn, Al, Fe, and Mn compared to North Basin water during winter mixing. The residence times of dissolved species were estimated on the basis of input through the rivers and rain. The residence times for Ca, Mg, and Sr were about 8 years, the same as that for water. Mn, Al, Fe, and Zn showed the shortest residence times (0.05-0.19 year). A budget calculation suggested that more than 60% of the input of dissolved Si, P, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Zn was scavenged and retained in the lake sediments and/or discharged as suspended particles.					; Sohrin, Yoshiki/A-8133-2011; Hasegawa, Hiroshi/C-4261-2015	Mito, Saeko/0000-0001-7647-8674; Sohrin, Yoshiki/0000-0001-6744-6048; Hasegawa, Hiroshi/0000-0001-8210-4775													1439-8621					APR	2004	5	1					7	16		10.1007/s10201-003-0111-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-003-0111-4													WOS:000220834700002

Measuring and modelling functional moat area in perennially ice-covered Lake Fryxell, Antarctica	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The perennially ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), Antarctica, are an important reservoir of liquid water in an arid and largely frozen environment. During the austral summer, the margins of these ice covers melt, forming a "moat" of liquid water and thin ice, allowing exchange between lake waters and the atmosphere to occur and serving as an interface between lake, soil, and stream ecosystems. The size of these moats varies from year to year. Here, we have established the first published record of moat area changes at MDVs' Lake Fryxell through time using manual traces of the moat as observed via satellite imagery. We have also tested a semi-automated approach for measuring moat area and found that it consistently underestimated the manual record, which we suspect may be due to the lower spatial resolution of images used in this versus the manual approach. Finally, we developed a predictive model based on readily available climate data, allowing moat area to be predicted beyond the limits of the satellite-based records. We found that functional moat area varies annually, potentially influencing ecosystem processes in the moats.					; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	Stone, Michael/0000-0002-1069-016X; 													1523-0430	1938-4246				DEC 31	2024	56	1							2406626	10.1080/15230430.2024.2406626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2024.2406626													WOS:001335314800001
J	Tian, DD; Zhang, JS; Gao, Z				Tian, Dongdong; Zhang, Jianshun; Gao, Zhi			The advancement of research in cool roof: Super cool roof, temperature-adaptive roof and crucial issues of application in cities	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS												Cool roofs play a significant role in mitigating urban heat islands, improving indoor thermal comfort, and saving energy. In recent years, with advances in the manufacturing of nanophotonics and metamaterials, researchers have developed super cool roofs where the surface temperature remains below the air temperature in direct daylight and temperature-adaptive roofs where the solar reflectance or thermal emissivity can change with temperature. This paper reviews the research progress and status of conventional cool roofs, super cool roofs, and temperature-adaptive roofs. This paper affirms the role of cool roofs in mitigating urban heat islands and energy conservation. And this paper also summarizes some of the crucial issues that cool roofs may face when used in cities. The effects of cool roofs on urban wind fields, planetary boundary layer heights, and pollutants above cities as well as the effects of sky view factor, atmospheric humidity, dust, and aging on the performance of cool roofs are discussed. The results show that the use of cool roofs is limited by geography and climate. The net cooling power can reach 150 W/m2 in dry, rainless, and clear sky areas. Cool roof technology is less effective in hot and humid climates because the first atmospheric window is affected to varying degrees by the increased radiation medium in the atmosphere, while the second atmospheric window is nearly closed in hot and humid climates, weakening the terrestrial long-wave radiation entering space. The use of cool roofs in warm and humid climates (over 80% relative humidity, with temperature over 24 degrees C) for most summer nights may limit the radiative cooling performance of the cool roof. The large-scale use of cool roofs in cities near huge lakes or seas may affect the urban wind field, causing a cooling island effect and a local build-up of pollutants. Finally, an outlook on the research prospects of cool roofs was given to provide ideas for further research.					; Gao, Zhi/KWT-4322-2024; gao, zhi/KWT-4322-2024	Zhang, Jianshun/0000-0002-6858-9777; gao, zhi/0000-0002-1657-8734													0378-7788	1872-6178				JUL 15	2023	291								113131	10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113131		MAY 2023											WOS:001004342600001

The longfinned eel was numerically dominant in two of the streams, whereas the shortfinned eel was more abundant in the third stream. For comparisons, the data were stratified into 100-mm size classes for eels less than or equal to 600 min long, whereas eels >600 mm were pooled into a single class. Log-linear analysis indicated that the size distribution of both species differed significantly between streams. Moreover, the size distribution of shortfinned, but not longfinned eels, differed significantly between reaches. Neither species showed significant change in size distribution between years. In contrast to the shortfinned eel, the density of longfinned eel less than or equal to 100 min long was consistently low for all three years, which probably indicates poor recruitment.																			0906-6691					SEP	2001	10	3					147	153		10.1034/j.1600-0633.2001.100304.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0633.2001.100304.x													WOS:000172120400004

Nevertheless, one of the nagging questions is why the precipitation of CaCO3 rarely occurs without the help of biological activity even in the surface seawater, where the calcite saturation state (Omega, expressed as the ratio of the calcium and carbonate ion concentration product to the stoichiometric solubility constant of calcite) is up to 5, but commonly takes place in hard-water lakes, springs and the low-salinity zone (practical salinity <5) of estuaries. Studies have found that Mg2+ plays a significant role in inhibiting all aspects of CaCO3 precipitation, namely crystal formation, solubility, and precipitation rate. However, whether the presence of Mg2+ in seawater is sufficient to inhibit CaCO3 precipitation has not been clearly stated, and the specific inhibitory role of Mg2+ in CaCO3 precipitation still requires clarification. In this study, we used four different seed materials to induce CaCO3 precipitation in artificial seawater of four Mg:Ca ratios and examined the crystal morphologies of the resulting precipitates using scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). We found that Mg2+ inhibits the precipitation at the first stage of nucleation, which drastically increases the difficulty of calcite nucleation. At a seawater Mg:Ca ratio of 5.2, aragonite preferentially nucleates instead of calcite. Among the tested materials, only calcite and aragonite seeds exhibit marked catalysis of CaCO3 precipitation, indicating that not all the particles in natural seawater can catalyze CaCO3 precipitation. Our results demonstrate while the precipitation of CaCO3 is inhibited by Mg2+ at all stages, the inhibition at the nucleation stage is the main reason massive spontaneous CaCO3 precipitation does not occur under the surface seawater conditions, supporting the notion that the incorporation of foreign ions such as Mg2+ increases the surface energy and the solubility of the overgrowth or cluster, and thus inhibits CaCO3 precipitation.					; di, yanan/KIA-0814-2024; Chen, Chen-Tung/C-8901-2011; Li, Yifan/LWI-1434-2024; Cai, Wei-Jun/C-1361-2013; FU, WEIQI/E-4167-2019; Fu, Weiqi/E-4167-2019; Pan, Yiwen/K-5392-2019	Sun, Zhentao/0000-0001-7606-0278; dong, bo/0000-0001-7784-5173; Pan, Yiwen/0000-0002-5331-931X; Cai, Wei-Jun/0000-0003-3606-8325; Fu, Weiqi/0000-0002-7368-383X; 													0304-4203	1872-7581				DEC 20	2021	237								104036	10.1016/j.marchem.2021.104036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marchem.2021.104036		NOV 2021											WOS:000720846400002

The role of ultraviolet radiation and fish in regulating the vertical distribution of Daphnia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Previous studies have demonstrated independent effects of both solar ultraviolet radiation (UV; 280-400 nm) and planktivorous fish on the vertical distribution of Daphnia. We examined the behavioral response of adult and juvenile Daphnia to both UV and planktivorous fish simultaneously in a small temperate lake in eastern Pennsylvania by conducting a large-scale (15 m deep) in situ mesocosm experiment with full factorial treatments (+/- UV and +/- fish). UV induced an avoidance of the surface waters in both juvenile and adult Daphnia. In contrast, the response of Daphnia to fish depended on the presence of UV, with a clear interactive effect. In the presence of both UV and fish, Daphnia were deeper in the water column than they were in the absence of either UV or fish. Sampling of the lake also revealed a rapid upward shift in the depth distribution of both juveniles and adults following a rare and intense early-summer storm that reduced the lake's transparency to both UV (for example, 380 nm UV-A) and photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) by 44% and 39%, respectively. Evidence of a novel benefit to UV avoidance behavior was also observed: surface avoidance of UV reduces the hazards of Daphnia getting caught in the surface air-water interface and perishing. These results highlight the interactive effects of fish and UV on Daphnia vertical distribution under near-natural conditions in situ.

Metabolism, Gas Exchange, and Carbon Spiraling in Rivers	ECOSYSTEMS												Ecosystem metabolism, that is, gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), controls organic carbon (OC) cycling in stream and river networks and is expected to vary predictably with network position. However, estimates of metabolism in small streams outnumber those from rivers such that there are limited empirical data comparing metabolism across a range of stream and river sizes. We measured metabolism in 14 rivers (discharge range 14-84 m(3) s(-1)) in the Western and Midwestern United States (US). We estimated GPP, ER, and gas exchange rates using a Lagrangian, 2-station oxygen model solved in a Bayesian framework. GPP ranged from 0.6-22 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and ER tracked GPP, suggesting that autotrophic production supports much of riverine ER in summer. Net ecosystem production, the balance between GPP and ER was 0 or greater in 4 rivers showing autotrophy on that day. River velocity and slope predicted gas exchange estimates from these 14 rivers in agreement with empirical models. Carbon turnover lengths (that is, the distance traveled before OC is mineralized to CO2) ranged from 38 to 1190 km, with the longest turnover lengths in high-sediment, arid-land rivers. We also compared estimated turnover lengths with the relative length of the river segment between major tributaries or lakes; the mean ratio of carbon turnover length to river length was 1.6, demonstrating that rivers can mineralize much of the OC load along their length at baseflow. Carbon mineralization velocities ranged from 0.05 to 0.81 m d(-1), and were not different than measurements from small streams. Given high GPP relative to ER, combined with generally short OC spiraling lengths, rivers can be highly reactive with regard to OC cycling.

J	Phillips, JS				Phillips, Joseph S.			Time-varying responses of lake metabolism to light and temperature	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Light is a primary driver of lake ecosystem metabolism, and the dependence of primary production on light is often quantified as a photosynthesis-irradiance or "P-I" curve. The parameters of the P-I curve (e.g., the maximum primary production when light is in excess) can change through time due to a variety of biological factors (e.g., changes in biomass or community composition), which themselves are subject to external drivers (e.g., herbivory or nutrient availability). However, the relative contribution of variation in the P-I curve to overall ecosystem metabolism is largely unknown. I developed a statistical model of ecosystem metabolism with time-varying parameters governing the P-I curve, while also accounting for the influence of temperature. I parameterized the model with dissolved oxygen time series spanning six summers from Lake Myvatn, a shallow eutrophic lake in northern Iceland with large temporal variability in ecosystem metabolism. All of the estimated parameters of the P-I curve varied substantially through time. The sensitivity of primary production to light under light-limiting conditions was particularly variable (>15-fold) and had a compensatory relationship with ambient light levels. However, the 3.5-fold variation in the maximum potential primary production made the largest contribution to variation in ecosystem metabolism, accounting for around 90% of the variance in net ecosystem production. Much of the variation in maximum primary production was attributable to cyanobacterial blooms, which occur in some but not all years in Myvatn. Overall, these results illustrate how changes in the P-I curve contribute substantially to temporal variation in lake ecosystem metabolism.

Although toxic cyanobacteria have been recorded in the Swan-Canning and Peel-Harvey estuaries in Western Australia, very little is known about the blooms in the surrounding freshwater lakes. In this study, a total of 32 natural bloom samples representing 13 lakes were analyzed by HPLC for microcystin (MC)-LR, -RR, and -YR. Twenty-eight samples proved to be toxic. The highest total microcystin concentration ranged from 1645 to 8428.6 mu g L-1, and the lowest concentrations were less than 10 mu g L-1 with some below the detection limit (< 0.05 mu g L-1). MC-LR (100%) was the predominant microcystin, followed by MC-YR (71.4%) and MC-RR (60.7%). The presence of a Nodularia spumigena bloom in the freshwater Lake Yangebup was associated with the detection of nodularins (1664 mu g L-1). This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of microcystins and nodularins in urban lakes on the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia.

J	Lieberman, DM; Horn, MJ; Duffy, S				Lieberman, DM; Horn, MJ; Duffy, S			Effects of a temperature control device on nutrients, POM and plankton in the tailwaters below Shasta Lake, California	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A temperature control device (TCD) was installed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on Shasta Dam, California, in March 1997 for controlling downstream river temperatures. Temperature modification was required to aid recovery of the endangered winter run chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Sacramento River, and to minimize loss of generating capacity as a result of releasing deeper, colder water through low level outlet works to meet downstream temperature criteria. This study began two years prior to operation of the TCD, to compare pre- and post-operational changes on downstream tailwaters, including nutrients, particulate organic matter (POM) and plankton. During epilimnetic withdrawals from January to mid-June, and mid-level withdrawals through August, operation of the TCD was associated with decreases in dissolved nitrate-nitrate concentrations, localized increases in small particulate organic matter (SPOM) at Shasta tailwaters, increases of bacillariophyta (< 25 mum size fraction), and increases in copepod biomass. These changes can potentially influence the food base of the river and therefore fish production in the Upper Sacramento River, including the chinook salmon.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2001	452	1-3					191	202		10.1023/A:1011962523355	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011962523355													WOS:000170963800019
J	Houser, JN				Houser, Jeffrey N.			Water color affects the stratification, surface temperature, heat content, and mean epilimnetic irradiance of small lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The effects of water color on lake stratification, mean epilimnetic irradiance, and lake temperature dynamics were examined in small, north-temperate lakes that differed widely in water color (1.5-19.8 m(-1)). Among these lakes, colored lakes differed from clear lakes in the following ways: (i) the epilimnia were shallower and colder, and mean epilimnetic irradiance was reduced; (ii) the diel temperature cycles were more pronounced; (iii) whole-lake heat accumulation during stratification was reduced. The depth of the epilimnion ranged from 2.5 m in the clearest lake to 0.75 m in the most colored lake, and 91% of the variation in epilimnetic depth was explained by water color. Summer mean morning epilimnetic temperature was similar to 2 degrees C cooler in the most colored lake compared with the clearest lake. In clear lakes, the diel temperature range (1.4 +/- 0.7 degrees C) was significantly (p = 0.01) less than that in the most colored lake (2.1 +/- 1.0 degrees C). Change in whole-lake heat content was negatively correlated with water color. Increasing water color decreased light penetration more than thermocline depth, leading to reduced mean epilimnetic irradiance in the colored lakes. Thus, in these small lakes, water color significantly affected temperature, thermocline depth, and light climate.

Despite their significance, the water quality in these reservoirs faces considerable threats due to intensive anthropogenic activities within the watersheds, particularly in agricultural reservoir-type headwater watersheds. This study investigated nitrate stable isotopes (S15N-NO3- and S18O-NO3- ), hydrochemistry, and stable water isotopes (S2HH2O and S18O-H2O) in river water to identify nitrate sources and processes in the Tianmu Lake Basin. Results indicated a notable increase in NO3- N concentration during low-flow period of March, which subsequently declined during high-flow period of July. Additionally, NO3- N concentrations exhibited a decreasing trend from upstream to downstream. Isotopic evidence and MixSIAR model highlight the significant influence of agricultural activities on nitrate sources. The contribution of soil nitrogen (SN) remains a consistent nitrate source (29-33 %) across seasons and watersheds due to nitrogen accumulation. During low-flow period of March, intensive spring cropping operations led to an increased contribution from chemical fertilizer sources (CF; 32 %), elevating NO3-N concentrations. Conversely, manure and sewage (SW) emerged as the primary nitrate sources (34 %) due to reduced cropping operations and the flushing of poultry manure during high-flow period of July. Spatial variations showed that tea garden in the upstream regions contributed to a higher CF-derived NO3- -N presence (33 %), while downstream regions, characterized by aquaculture and poultry farming, showed a significant SW contribution (38 %). Nitrogen cycling processes, influenced by high temperatures and dissolved oxygen (DO), facilitated extensive nitrification as the characteristics of increasing nitrate concentrations in the river. The correlation between NO3--N and S15N-NO3- showed the presence of denitrification with a slower rate, resulting in a low nitrate removal efficiency. This study underscores the necessity to limit nitrogen inputs at headwaters to enhance nitrate removal efficiency throughout the watershed management cycle.

Based on a new direct land-sea comparison in SW Iberian margin IODP Site U1385 we examine the climatic variability between 1100 and 1050 ka including the "super interglacial" MIS 31, a period dominated by the 41-ky obliquity periodicity. Pollen and biomarker analyses at centennial-scale resolution provide new insights into the regional vegetation, precipitation regime and atmospheric and oceanic temperature variability on orbital and suborbital timescales. Our study reveals that atmospheric and SST warmth during MIS 31 was not exceptional in this region highly sensitive to precession. Unexpectedly, this warm stage stands out as a prolonged interval of a temperate and humid climate regime with reduced seasonality, despite the high insolation (precession minima values) forcing. We find that the dominant forcing on the long-term temperate forest development was obliquity, which may have induced a decrease in summer dryness and associated reduction in seasonal precipitation contrast. Moreover, this study provides the first evidence for persistent atmospheric millennial-scale variability during this interval with multiple forest decline events reflecting repeated cooling and drying episodes in SW Iberia. Our direct land-sea comparison shows that the expression of the suborbital cooling events on SW Iberian ecosystems is modulated by the predominance of high or low-latitude forcing depending on the glacial/interglacial baseline climate states. Severe dryness and air-sea cooling is detected under the larger ice volume during glacial MIS 32 and MIS 30. The extreme episodes, which in their climatic imprint are similar to the Heinrich events, are likely related to northern latitude ice-sheet instability and a disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In contrast, forest declines during MIS 31 are associated to neither SST cooling nor high-latitude freshwater forcing. Time-series analysis reveals a dominant cyclicity of about 6 ky in the temperate forest record, which points to a potential link with the fourth harmonic of precession and thus low-latitude insolation forcing.

Here, we analyzed the microbiomes of the putative ancient asexual ostracod species, Darwinula stevensoni, in three natural populations from different freshwater habitats in the UK, Belgium, and Spain. We applied high-throughput amplicon sequencing approaches to analyze the V3-V4 part of the bacterial 16S rRNA region. We tested for host-specific microbiomes by comparing bacterial assemblages of ostracods with those of sediment and water samples from the same locations. Around 2,200 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were identified from ostracod samples with universal primers and 1,700 ASVs with endosymbiotic-specific primers, illustrating a high microbiome diversity in D. stevensoni. Most bacterial taxa were unique to the microbiome of D. stevensoni as compared to other freshwater invertebrates and to non-marine ostracods. Alpha diversity of ostracod microbiomes did not differ significantly between the three populations, but PERMANOVA detected significant differences in bacterial compositions. Microbiomes varied highly among ostracod specimens from the same population. Possible factors shaping ostracod microbiomes could be latitude, food, age, and environmental variables. Preliminary functionality analyses showed that Darwinula-specific microbiomes contribute to lipid, carbohydrate, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolic processes and the synthesis of co-factors and vitamins.					; Mesquita-Joanes, Francesc/F-3200-2011	Martens, Koen/0000-0001-8680-973X; Mesquita-Joanes, Francesc/0000-0001-7168-1980; Vandenboer, Yelle/0000-0003-3974-5109													0018-8158	1573-5117				2023 JUN 7	2023										10.1007/s10750-023-05257-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05257-9		JUN 2023											WOS:001002873500001

Invasive cattail reduces fish diversity and abundance in the emergent marsh of a Great Lakes coastal wetland	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Great Lakes coastal wetlands (GLCWs) provide critical fish habitat. The invasion of GLCWs by hybrid and narrow-leaved cattail, Typha x glauca and Typha angustifolia (hereafter Typha), homogenizes wetlands by out-competing native plant species and producing copious litter. However, the effect of this invasion on fish communities is little known. To measure the effect of Typha on fishes, we established plots in Typha invaded and native wetland emergent zones in a northern Lake Michigan coastal wetland, and measured environmental variables, plants, and fishes in each zone over two summers. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature were significantly lower in invaded compared to native plots. Invaded plots were dominated by Typha and its litter; whereas. sedges (Carex spp.) were the most abundant species in native plots. Fish abundance and species richness were significantly lower in Typha compared to native wetland plots. The Typha fish community was dominated by hypoxia tolerant mudminnow whereas other small, schooling, fusiform species such as cyprinids and fundulids were absent. These results illustrate the negative impact of a dominant invasive plant on Great Lakes fishes that is expected to be found in Typha invasions in other GLCWs.

Effects on the number of deer using the feeding sites, the prevention of bark stripping damage, the amount of feeding, and eating time in a 5-year period (1999-2003) were evaluated. The number of deer using feeding sites increased with years during the feeding period. The damaged tree ratio after the initiation of feeding markedly decreased compared with 16.5% before the initiation of feeding. After the start of feeding, there were no trees with damage the entire circumference. According to tree species, the number of damaged trees of Ulmus laciniata Mayr as a percentage of all investigated trees was high (5.2%). The total amount of beet pulp feeding increased with the feeding year, showing 4.5-fold increase. At feeding sites in deer culling, eating behavior was observed during the night. The preventive effects on bark stripping damage continued during the 5-year feeding period. However, with the course of feeding years, the number of deer using feeding sites and the level of feeding increased.																			1344-3941						2011	82	4					580	586		10.1111/j.1740-0929.2010.00863.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2010.00863.x								21794018					WOS:000293193500014

Climatology and extreme cases of sea-effect snowfall on the southern Baltic Sea coast	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Heavy snowfall events of possible sea-effect origin, occurring on the southern Baltic Sea coast, are described in this study. The analysed region is not very snowy, with an average of 40 days with snow cover in the winter season and a mean maximum snow depth of 8-12 cm. Twenty-five snowfall events were selected using the threshold of 20 cm/2 days (i.e., 20 cm of snow depth increase during 2 days), and the synoptic climatology, as well as triggering factors of their occurrence, were defined. The bipolar pattern of sea level pressure with a high-pressure over Scandinavia and a low-pressure system southward of it was identified as favourable for sea-effect snowfall on the southern Baltic Sea coast. This pressure field, causing northeastern circulation in the lower troposphere, brings cold air masses over the relatively warm sea basin, and the negative anomalies of air temperature at 850 hPa geopotential level, amounting to -9 degrees C, encompass Scandinavia, as well as central and northeastern Europe. This makes the temperature difference between the air at the 850 hPa geopotential height and the sea surface exceeding 15 degrees C. This large temperature difference establishes favourable conditions for convection in cold air masses, which become unstable while crossing over the warm sea. The formed clouds give snowfall in the coastal areas. In the further part of the study, three sea-effect snowfall cases were chosen for detailed analysis, including atmospheric sounding, radar and satellite images, air parcel backward trajectories, and synoptic maps. They reveal high-pressure wedges associated with low air temperature over Scandinavia and northern airflow over the Baltic Sea. The wind direction and the temperature of air masses are key components in the occurrence of sea-effect snowfall, and global warming conditions seem to reduce the frequency of snow events over the Polish Baltic Sea coast.

Setting: John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. Design: Experimental study. Methods: Study and control (1-piece hydrophobic acrylic) IOLs were implanted into the right and left eyes, respectively, of 8 New Zealand rabbits. Eyes were examined at the slitlamp at set intervals for 6 months. At the end of the clinical follow-up, the globes were enucleated and capsular clarity was scored from the posterior view (Miyake-Apple technique). Then, all the eyes were processed for a complete histopathological evaluation. Results: At 6 months, the slitlamp evaluation showed a posterior capsule opacification score of 0.28 +/- 0.26 (SD) in the study group and 4 +/- 0 in the control (P < .0001, paired t test). The anterior capsule was generally clear in the study group. This parameter was difficult to analyze in the control group because of synechiae formation and poor pupil dilation. Conclusions: The degree of capsular bag clarity observed at 6 months postoperatively in the study eyes in this rabbit model was exceptional. It was likely because of the IOL design, keeping the capsular bag open and expanded, and minimizing contact between the IOL and the anterior capsule.																			0886-3350	1873-4502				APR	2018	44	4					504	509		10.1016/j.jcrs.2017.12.029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrs.2017.12.029								29685775					WOS:000433394600014

China's inland waters have been increasingly threatened by CyanoHABs during the past several decades. The environmental factors controlling CyanoHABs are highly variable in space and time in China due to significant variations in climate, geography, geological and geochemical conditions among its many regions. Here, we synthesize diverse examples among Chinese water bodies regarding interactive effects of anthropogenic, climatic and geographic drivers influencing CyanoHAB potentials and dynamics in lakes and reservoirs; in order to provide a perspective and integrative approach to mitigating CyanoHABs. In China's many shallow water bodies, water quality is highly susceptible to human activity and to changing climatic and hydrological conditions, when compared to deeper lakes. Rapid increases in population, economic activity, and wastewater have accelerated CyanoHABs in China since 1980s, especially in the heavily urbanized, agricultural and industrial regions in the middle and lower Yangtze River basins. Climatic changes have provided an additional catalyst for expansion of CyanoHABs. In particular, rising spring temperatures have accelerated the onset and proliferation of Microcystis spp, blooms in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River basin. Large hydroelectric and water supply projects, like the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), have altered hydrological regimes, and have led to an increase of CyanoHABs in reservoirs and tributaries due to increases in water residence times. Manipulating water level fluctuations in the TGR may prove useful for controlling CyanoHAB in its tributary bays. Overall,CyanoHAB mitigation strategies will have to incorporate both N and P input reductions in these shallow systems. Furthermore, nutrient reduction strategies must consider climate change-induced increases in extreme weather events, including more intense rainfall and protracted heat waves and droughts, which can extend the magnitudes and duration of CyanoHABs. Ensuring the maintenance of natural hydrologic connectivity between lakes and rivers is of utmost importance in mitigating CyanoHABs throughout China.					; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Paerl, Hans/ACA-9911-2022	Zhang, Qingji/0000-0002-9426-7157; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				DEC	2021	110								102127	10.1016/j.hal.2021.102127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2021.102127		NOV 2021						34887007					WOS:000719324600003
J	Fisher, SJ; Willis, DW				Fisher, SJ; Willis, DW			Seasonal dynamics of aquatic fauna and habitat parameters in a perched upper Missouri River wetland	WETLANDS												The Missouri River floodplain historically contained numerous wetlands; however, alterations to the corridor have resulted in the loss of flood-pulse processes. The annual contributions of small wetlands (<15 ha) perched on the Missouri River floodplain have not been viewed as important; however, consequences of draining or filling perched wetlands in the upper Missouri River basin remain unclear. The objective of this study was to survey aquatic fauna and basic habitat characteristics in a small perched wetland before, during, and after a connection period within a naturally functioning section of the Missouri River. Fishes, macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, and habitat parameters were sampled during May, July, and September 1997. No significant differences (P > 0.05; F < 4.2; df = 2,9) in densities or catch-per-unit-effort among sample periods were detected for macroinvertebrates. Copepoda nauplii, calanoid Copepoda, and Bosmina spp. densities showed significant changes (P < 0.03; F > 6.1; df = 2,9) and collectively surpassed 3,200 organisms/L. These densities exceeded other regional means by as much as 900%. Twenty-four fish species were documented in the wetland; however, the black bullhead, Ameiurus melas Rafinesque, dominated the fish community. Wetland depth and surface area increased during the connection period and inundated terrestrial grasses and woody debris. Decay of submerged organic matter, combined with the lack of rooted macrophytes, loss of algal productivity to flushing, and higher turbidity, may have all contributed to reduced summer dissolved oxygen levels. Avian feeding activity suggested that fishes were using the upper water column when nearly anoxic lower water column conditions existed. Although the wetland habitat may be harsh, presence of juvenile fishes and dense zooplankton populations establishes the potential importance of these water bodies to the Missouri River ecosystem.

Organic-rich Ah-horizon soils, Fe-rich B-horizon soils, C-horizon soils, tree cores of Jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and glacially dispersed boulders of Manitou Falls Formation sandstone that host the U deposit were collected in four sampling grids near the mine site. Two of the grids overlaid the trace of the P2 fault that hosts the deposit and extends nearly to the surface, one grid overlaid both the P2 fault and one of the high-grade ore bodies (Zone 4), and one grid was located 2.5 km away from the ore body surface trace in the barren hanging wall of the P2 fault. The grid overlying the Zone 4 ore body had the highest proportion of samples with elevated U and low Pb-207/Pb-206 ratios, the latter indicative of radiogenic Pb from a high-U source, measured in two size fractions of Ah-horizon soils using Na pyrophosphate leach, pine tree cores using total digestion, and sandstone boulders using 2% HNO3 leach. A handful of pathfinder elements, such as As, Co, Ni, and Pb, are variably associated with the U and radiogenic Pb. Sandstone boulders with an assemblage of dravite thorn kaolinite 6 illite, determined using shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy and matching the alteration mineralogy in the Manitou Falls Formation above the U deposit, were prevalent in the grid above the Zone 4 ore body and in the adjacent grid in the direction of glacial dispersion. A coarse fraction of the B-horizon soils, leached with 5% HNO3, highlighted the grid above the Zone 4 ore body to a lesser extent, whereas HNO3 leaches and aqua regia digests of C-horizon soil separates did not highlight the P2 fault or ore body trace due to influence by parent till mineralogy. Results of environmental monitoring at the mine site, which was active at the time of sampling, suggest that dust containing U, Pb, and radionuclides from waste rock piles and a ventilation shaft could influence A-horizon soil geochemistry near the mine site, and that U and radiogenic Pb anomalies in B-and C-horizon soils near the water table are close to a treated mine effluent discharge point. However, older trees that record elevated U and radiogenic Pb in annual rings that pre-date mining activity, and alteration mineralogy and geochemistry of boulders that are less susceptible to the influences of mining activity, add confidence that the geochemical anomaly in diverse surficial media above the Zone 4 ore body represents secondary dispersion from the underlying U deposit.

The terraces consist of fluvial-alluvial to littoral-lacustrine facies. End-member modeling of grain-size distributions allowed quantification of sediment transport processes and relative lake levels during times of deposition. Radiocarbon dating revealed higher than modern lake levels during the early and mid Holocene. Lake levels follow the trend of Asian monsoon dynamics, and are modified by local non-climatic drivers. Site-specific impacts explain fluctuations during the initial lake-level rise similar to 11 cal ka BP. Maximum lake extension reached similar to 9.2 cal ka BP, at similar to 16.5 m above present lake level (a.p.l.l.). Littoral and lacustrine sediment deposition paused during a phase of fluvial activity and post-depositional cryoturbations at similar to 8.5 cal ka BP, when the lake level fell to similar to 8 m a.p.l.l. After a second maximum at similar to 7.5 cal ka BP, lake level declined slightly at similar to 6.8 cal ka BP, probably due to a non-climatic pulse that caused lake opening. The level remained high until a transition towards drier conditions similar to 4.7 cal ka BP. Though discontinuous, high-stand sediments provide a unique, high-resolution archive.

J	THOMAS, JD				THOMAS, JD			THE FOOD AND GROWTH OF BROWN TROUT (SALMO-TRUTTA-L) AND ITS FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE SALMON PARR (SALMO-SALAR L) AND THE EEL (ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA (L)) IN THE RIVER TEIFY, WEST WALES	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												The fish examined were captured at two stations station A in the area of a "raised" bog, and station B characterized by a variety of water types. The fauna was richer in number of species at station B than at A because of the wider range of habitats available at the former station. All the species in the fauna were classified as far as possible on a habitat basis. The fish were captured by angling. At station B 3 species, Salmo trutta, S. salar and Anguilla anguilla were caught, but at station A only trout and eels were taken. No eels occurred in the samples taken from December to March when the temperature was below 9C. A comparison of the dietaries of the 3 species shows dissimilarities in diet that can be attributed to difference in: (a) size-range and extent of gape, (b) selection mechanisms not attributable to size factors, (c) vertical stratification, (d) region of stream frequented, (e) seasonal activity. There is a closer resemblance between the dietaries of salmon parr and trout of the same age. Mainly because of the benthic habits and winter hibernation of the eel there are appreciable differences between its diet and that of the salmonids. Structurally the present community consists of generalized feeders comparable with that described by Hartley (1948) but unlike many of the communities described by Fryer (1959) and Greenwood (1959) in African lakes. Competition for food is possible between the two salmonid species in the Teify, but is unlikely to have any serious effect as it seems not to be expressed in the growth of the trout.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1962	31	2					175	+		10.2307/2136	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2136													WOS:A1962WV72900001

HYDRO-CLIMATOLOGY: VARIABILITY AND CHANGE	IAHS Publication				25th General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics	JUN 28-JUL 07, 2011	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	Int Commiss Water Resources Systems, Int Commiss Surface Water, Int Commiss Water Qual, Int Assoc Hydrol Sci, UNESCO-IHP				The Poyang Lake wetland of China is in the first batch of the Ramsar Convention List of Wetlands of International Importance. Poyang Lake's surface area has decreased drastically in the past three decades, and hydrological droughts have occurred more frequently in the region in recent years. It is unclear which factors are responsible for the change and to what extent. This study utilized satellite remote sensing to investigate the recent increase of drought events in the region. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to retrieve the lake variations in the last decade. The Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data sets were incorporated to analyse the water cycle in the basin. Our results revealed no significant increasing or decreasing long-term trend in precipitation. The lake surface reached minimum levels in the winters of 2003, 2006 and 2009, corresponding to three severe hydrological droughts in the basin. Case examinations showed less precipitation in 2003 and greater evapotranspiration in 2006, but this was not the case for 2009. The explanation is likely related to operation of the Three Gorges Dam, the largest dam in the world. Overall, the increased frequency of droughts was very likely related to the dam construction and operation and climate change, in addition to land-use and land-cover change.

To investigate the effects of H2S to metals and evaluate metal environment effect in the sediments of the East China Sea (ECS) and Yellow Sea (YS), geochemical characteristic and spatial distribution of nine heavy metals and H2S profile were studied. Higher H2S content and lower metal content was observed in the sediments 10 cm in depth in the North Yellow Sea and the west coast of South Korea. The pollution load index (I-pl) indicates that the southern coast of Shandong Peninsula underwent moderate pollution (I-pl=1) of heavy metals and no heavy metal pollution appeared in other areas (I-pl<1). To some extents, the ecological risk of Cd and As enrichment was moderately severe in all stations. The chance of heavy metal combination to be toxic in ECS and YS during summer was 21%. In addition, correlation between H2S content and metals in both solid and porewater phases was obvious, corroborating important effect of H2S on metal distribution. Moreover, H2S could affect the spatial distributions of heavy metals in porewater directly and be indicative of potential biological effects of combined toxicant groups in the study region.

Stacking of discontinuous regional palaeoclimate records: Chironomid-based summer temperatures from the Alpine region	HOLOCENE												Since multi-site reconstructions are less affected by site-specific climatic effects and artefacts, regional palaeotemperature reconstructions based on a number of sites can provide more robust estimates of centennial- to millennial-scale temperature trends than individual, site-specific records. Furthermore, reconstructions based on multiple records are necessary for developing continuous climate records over time scales longer than covered by individual sequences. Here, we present a procedure for developing such reconstructions based on relatively short (centuries to millennia), discontinuously sampled records as are typically developed when using biotic proxies in lake sediments for temperature reconstruction. The approach includes an altitudinal correction of temperatures, an interpolation of individual records to equal time intervals, a stacking procedure for sections of the interval of interest that have the same records available, as well as a splicing procedure to link the individual stacked records into a continuous reconstruction. Variations in the final, stacked and spliced reconstruction are driven by variations in the individual records, whereas the absolute temperature values are determined by the stacked segment based on the largest number of records. With numerical simulations based on the NGRIP O-18 record, we demonstrate that the interpolation and stacking procedure provides an approximation of a smoothed palaeoclimate record if based on a sufficient number of discontinuously sampled records. Finally, we provide an example of a stacked and spliced palaeotemperature reconstruction 15000-90 calibrated C-14 yr BP based on six chironomid records from the northern and central Swiss Alps and eastern France to discuss the potential and limitations of this approach.

Modelling influences of local and climatic factors on the occurrence and abundance of non-marine ostracods (Crustacea: Ostracoda) across Patagonia (Argentina)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In this study, we tested the significance of environmental influences on non-marine ostracod communities at high taxonomic levels across Patagonia, Argentina. We used a dataset compiled from 243 Patagonian freshwater bodies, representing an area of similar to 900,000 km(2) and covering the main local and climatic gradients. We applied generalized linear models to test the effects of hydroperiod, local and climatic variables on the occurrence and abundance of Ostracoda, and the occurrence of the most frequent families (i.e., Cyprididae, Ilyocyprididae and Limnocytheridae). We found ostracods in 77% of the total sampled sites, driven mainly by dissolved oxygen levels and water temperature (local variables) as well as precipitation and air temperature (climatic variables). Specifically, warmer winters and dryer climates favored ostracod occurrences, which covered wide ecological ranges, such as peat bogs or high-altitude wetlands. For the Ilyocyprididae and Limnocytheridae families, precipitation and pH were important predictors of their occurrence. Furthermore, wind speed, nutrient levels and water depth had positive effects on ostracod abundance. This updated Patagonian freshwater dataset contributes towards filling those knowledge gaps related to the habitat suitability of ostracods communities in this vast region. Our findings could help us understand the past and future responses of ostracods to environmental changes.

J	WALKINSHAW, LH				WALKINSHAW, LH			SUMMER BIOLOGY OF TRAILLS FLYCATCHER	WILSON BULLETIN												Traill''s flycatchers of the fitz-bew song type arrived at Battle Creek in southern Michigan on dates averaging 17 May (10-27) during a 35-year periodiand departed on 15 Aug. (2 Aug. -13 Sept.). The average size of 27 territories was 2. 06 (1. 3-2. 9) acres (83. 8 acres). Habitats in southern Michigan are chiefly in dry shrubby marshes or along lake borders. On the Baker Sanctuary, Convis Township, Calhoun County, 48. 5% of nests were found in Cornus amomum bushes, and 14. 3% in Crataegus. At Ackley Lake, in the same township, 35. 7% of the nests were in Salix, 21. 4% in C. amomum. and 14. 2% each in Rosa Carolina and Spiraea tomentosa. The average height of 93 nests was 133. 2 cm. Eggs are laid during the early morning, as a rule; often the last egg is laid just prior to noon. The average egg set was 3. 68 and the average measurements, 17. 70 x 13. 29 mm. The average egg weight was 1. 67 grams. Incubation required between 13 and 15 days, averaging 14. Of 92 nests observed, eggs hatched in 64 and young left 60 (65. 2%). In these 92 nests, 302 eggs were laid, of which 223 hatched; 198 young fledged (65. 6%). Thirteen young left nests at 13. 8 (12-16) days of age. They remained on their parent''s territories until about a month old. Cowbird parasitism was found in 5 of 94 nests. Two cowbird young were fledged, at the expense of 7 Traill''s flycatcher eggs. The laying of a cowbird egg in a nest causes the nest to fail in over 80% of cases. Of 22 banded males. 9 returned the next year, 5 the 3rd, 3 the 4th, and 1 the 5th. Of 3i banded females, 7 returned the next year and only 1 the next 4 years. Through 1964 2 banded nestlings out 147 returned to nest within 1, 600 ft and 5, 230 ft of where they were born. Both male and female return to their past year''s territory if possible. One pair was paired for 4 of 5 years. From records of 23 banded females, the 1st egg was laid 17 (6-28) June, and nests were terminated 19 July (9 July-10 Aug). Only 2 of these females attempted 2nd nests. The average number of eggs laid by the 23 females during the summer was 4. Adult weights and measurements are given.																			0043-5643						1966	78	1					31	+																WOS:A19667542900004

Climate impacts on human settlement and agricultural activities in northern Norway revealed through sediment biogeochemistry	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Disentangling the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the environment is a major challenge in paleoenvironmental research. Here, we used fecal sterols and other biogeochemical compounds in lake sediments from northern Norway to identify both natural and anthropogenic signals of environmental change during the late Holocene. The area was first occupied by humans and their grazing animals at similar to 2,250 +/- 75 calendar years before 1950 AD (calendar years before present). The arrival of humans is indicated by an abrupt increase in coprostanol (and its epimer epicoprostanol) in the sediments and an associated increase in 5 beta-stigmastanol (and 5 beta-epistigmastanol), which resulted from human and animal feces washing into the lake. Human settlement was accompanied by an abrupt increase in landscape fires (indicated by the rise in pyrolytic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and a decline in woodland (registered by a change in n-alkane chain lengths from leaf waxes), accelerating a process that began earlier in the Holocene. Human activity and associated landscape changes in the region over the last two millennia were mainly driven by summer temperatures, as indicated by independent tree-ring reconstructions, although there were periods when socioeconomic factors played an equally important role. In this study, fecal sterols in lake sediments have been used to provide a record of human occupancy through time. This approach may be useful in many archeological studies, both to confirm the presence of humans and grazing animals, and to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural factors that have influenced the environment in the past.

Toxicity of microcystin-LR, a cyanobacterial toxin, to multiple life stages of the burrowing mayfly, Hexagenia, and possible implications for recruitment	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												Burrowing mayflies, genus Hexagenia, were extirpated from the major water bodies of North America in the early 1950s, paralleling an increase in eutrophication and organic pollution, and a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations. Burrowing mayflies recolonized the western basin of Lake Erie, but remain absent in other former habitats such as Oneida Lake, New York. Eutrophication is commonly associated with a shift in the phytoplankton community toward dominance by cyanobacteria, and therefore, one class of cyanobacterial toxins, microcystins, were investigated as a contributing factor to Hexagenia's eradication or as an impediment to recolonization. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine if microcystin-LR (MC-LR) produced negative effects on Hexagenia at three points within its life cycle: egg, hatchling nymph (<24-h old, <1 mm total length), and pre-emergence nymph (>17 mm). Treatment concentrations ranged from the guideline set by the World Health Organization for drinking water (0.001 mu g mL(-1)) to 0.1 mu g mL(-1) for the egg experiment and 10 mu g mL(-1) for the nymph trials. Eggs showed a delay in hatching and an altered distribution of hatching over the study period when submerged in 0.1 mu g mL(-1) MC-LR (an elevated concentration representative of bloom scum). The 72-h (1.1 mu g mL(-1)) and 96-h (0.049 mu g mL(-1)) LC50 values for hatchling nymphs exceeded typical bloom concentrations of North American lakes, (0.01 mu g mL(-1)). Large nymphs were more tolerant of the toxin, as indicated by 100% survival over seven days exposure to 10 mu g mL(-1), suggesting older larvae can withstand brief encounters with high microcystin levels for at least short periods of time. The sensitivity of young nymphs and eggs to MC-LR may have implications for the recruitment of the genus in water bodies with persistent summer cyanobacterial blooms.

The past and present occurrence of Elatine and implications for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												The past and present occurrence of Elatine hydropiper L. (eight-stamened waterwort), E. hexandra (Lapierre) DC. (six-stamened waterwort) and E. triandra Schkuhr (three-stamened waterwort) in the Netherlands is discussed. It has proved possible to distinguish the slightly curved seeds of E. hexandra and E. triandra in subfossil material on morphological grounds. E. hexandra is the most common species at present, but subfossil finds are confined to Late-glacial and Pre-boreal sediments of one lake in the Pleistocene area of the Netherlands. Living plants of E. triandra have only been found in the Netherlands in 1838-1839, but there are 17 records from five archaeological sites, all located in the western Dutch estuarine area. Several of these sites also yielded E. hydropiper, archaeobotanically the most common species. The occurrence of E. triandra and E. hydropiper in the Netherlands seems to have been favoured by high summer temperatures. The ecological amplitude of this combination of species gives firm clues for the reconstruction of the environment, which must have been a freshwater tidal area. Since this type of environment is strongly threatened on a worldwide scale, the presence of these species in the past may also provide interesting information for present nature development projects in the Dutch estuarine area.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				JAN	2008	17	1					15	24		10.1007/s00334-007-0104-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-007-0104-z													WOS:000251232800003

For both juveniles (2.0 mu g C ind.(-1)) and adults (6.6 mu g C ind.(-1)), three different estimates of P release were made by two different parametrizations and by considering the importance of ingestion of detrital particles. As a basis for estimates of P release, clearance rates of algae and bacteria were determined as well as a thorough characterization of the food compartments. The specific release rate of P varied between 0.16 and 1.18 mu g P mg C-1 h(-1) for juveniles and between 0.06 and 0.96 for adults, independent of estimate. These release rates are considerably lower than those obtained by previously published models. Most of the observed variation was due to variation in the P content of the food, thus emphasizing the importance of including this variable in studies of P release from zooplankton. Calculations of rates of population P release suggest that D. galeata contributed <1/3 of the P requirements of algae and bacteria.

J	MAKAREWICZ, JC; DILCHER, RC				MAKAREWICZ, JC; DILCHER, RC			OCCURRENCE OF MACROPHYTES IN THE NEARSHORE WATERS OF LAKE-ONTARIO	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Growth of the submersed macrophytes was determined from biomass of samples collected at Wautoma Shoal in the nearshore waters of Lake Ontario from June to October, 1986. Growth began in June, peaked in September, and decreased by October; Plants dominated by Potamogeton pectinatus L. Were observed growing only in the relatively quiet water of the trough between the shoal and shoreline. In the generally productive waters of Lake Ontario, the low biomass of macrophytes (5.0 g ash-free dry weight/m2) in comparison to other bodies of water suggests this plant community is living marginally at the extremes of their tolerances. Anecdotal evidence suggests macrophytes were present at Wautoma Shoal from 1930 to the early 1940s, but were absent from 1950 to the late 1970s. The establishement of the macrophyte bed at Wautoma Shoal is associated with a significant decrease in turbidity of the nearshore waters during the summer. The reestablishment of macrophytes may be a result of the phosphorus abatement program and could represent a tangible first step in the recovery and rehabilitation of the littoral zone of Lake Ontario.																			0380-1330						1988	14	4					405	410		10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71573-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71573-7													WOS:A1988R673900005
J	Wang, XQ; Wei, J; Zhao, JK; Zhou, Z; Huang, X				Wang Xiao-qun; Wei Jie; Zhao Jia-kang; Zhou Zhou; Huang Xin			Simulation of the dynamic disturbance characteristics of the soft sediment in the Diexi ancient dammed lake, China	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												In an earlier study of the Diexi ancient dammed lake along the Minjiang River in Southwest China, 10 disturbed layers with envelope and flame structures were found in more than 240 m of lacustrine sediments. In this paper, the soft-sediment disturbances caused by earthquakes in the Diexi ancient dammed lake were studied based on field investigations and laboratory core observations. A two- to three-degree-of-freedom spring-type earthquake simulation vibration table was used to carry out disturbance tests on lacustrine sediments under different dynamic conditions. The results support the following conclusions: (1) The disturbance layers in the lacustrine sediments were caused by strong earthquakes in the region. (2) The characteristics of the disturbance layers are related to the seismic parameters and the degree of sediment consolidation. (3) The greater the earthquake intensity is, the greater the disturbance amplitude is; moreover, the lower the consolidation degree is, the greater the disturbance amplitude. (4) The simulation tests verify that the disturbance layers in the sediments of the Diexi ancient dammed lake correspond to strong earthquakes in the region. These results are valuable for ongoing palaeoseismic research in the region.

Currently, researchers have a limited understanding of N2O emission patterns and controlling factors in different habitats of large, shallow lakes. This study focused on the phytoplankton-dominated zone (PDZ), submerged plants-dominated zone (SDZ), and emergent plants-dominated zone (EDZ) of Lake Taihu, China. The N2O fluxes in each lake zone were recorded monthly for one year using the static floating chamber method, to explore the spatio-temporal variations in N2O emissions and their controlling factors in lakes with complex habitat types. Additionally, a microcosm experiment was used to identify the effect of algal addition on the water column nitrogen (N) load and N2O emissions. Results showed that the annual average N2O fluxes at the water-air interface were 0.66 +/- 0.62 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), 0.09 +/- 0.06 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), and 0.56 +/- 0.93 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), from the PDZ, SDZ, and EDZ, respectively. The N2O fluxes in the PDZ were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those from the SDZ (p < 0.05), while those in the EDZ did not differ significantly from the other two zones. During summer, the N2O concentrations and fluxes in all lake zones were higher than those in the other seasons. Statistical analysis indicated that water TN, temperature (T-W), and TP are crucial factors regulating N2O emissions. The algae addition experiment demonstrated that phytoplankton aggregation promoted N2O emissions by altering DO content and water column N load. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering habitat differences in regional and global lake N2O emission estimates.

During the research period, 88 taxa were identified. The most abundant group was Bacillariophyceae with 57 taxa. Species Cyclotella comta (Ehr.) Kutz., Achnanthidium affine (Grunow) Czarn., Cocconeis placentula Ehr. and Eolimna minima (Grunow) Lange-Bertalot were present in all samples. The results show significant differences in abundance, number and composition of algae between growth surfaces and depths. The number of species present shows statistically significant differences with respect to all three variables (days of colonization, depth and orientation), while the total number of cells per square centimeter varies with respect to the days of colonization and the depth only. The highest growth potential was observed after 60 days of exposition on the upper side of the horizontally placed surface at a depth of 1 m. During the same exposition time, the lowest growth potential was noted on the vertical slide at a depth of 18 m. Physical and chemical parameters and their relations to algal periphyton assemblages were also monitored.

Accurately evaluating lake eutrophication is the basis for effective management of the water environment. This study aimed to study eutrophication and its anthropogenic forcing in Chagan Lake, which is surrounded by agricultural areas with irrigation discharge as the primary water source. The spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of lake eutrophication and the anthropogenic forcing factors were analyzed based on the long-series multi-source data and modified eutrophication index. The results showed that (1) the average trophic state of Chagan Lake was eutrophic according to the modified eutrophication index (TLI=58.31) and the nutrient level was higher in summer, reaching hypertrophy (TLI 61.49); (2) the maximum pollution footprint affecting the lake reached 34.7 km2, with a maximum buffer zone radius of 1 km; (3) the gross domestic product of primary industry, total sown area, and rice field area were the main anthropogenic factors leading to the lake eutrophication, with contribution rates of 64.43%, 13.09%, and 10.23%, respectively. Multidimensional management strategies for maximum pollution footprint, buffer zone radius, and contribution of anthropogenic factors were used to improve the water quality of the lake. The findings provided scientific support for the management of water environment of Chagan Lake and guided the formulation of "one lake, one policy."

In this study, the conventional (coagulation-sedimentation-sand filtration) and ozonation-biologically activated carbon filtration (O-3-BAC) advanced treatment processes at a full-scale drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) were combined with a pilot-scale NF process for treatment of Taihu Lake water. The results showed that the "conventional + O-3-BAC + NF" combined processes had superior effects on removing natural organic matter (NOM), Br-, and other common water quality parameters (e.g., turbidity, conductivity, TDS, and total hardness) with efficiencies of 88.8-99.8%, for which the NF process played a critical role. The conventional plus O-3-BAC processes effectively removed formation potential of chlorinated disinfection by-products (Cl-DBPFPs, by 28.0-46.6%), but had poorer effect in reducing formation potential of brominated DBPs (Br-DBPFPs, by -2637.2-17.3%). NOM concentrations (characterized by dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), and/or fluorescent components) were the driving factors for most DBPFP species, while elevation of [Br-]/[DOC] ratio likely resulted in enhanced formation of brominated trihalomethanes (THMs) during chlorination of the BAC effluent. By adding the pilot-scale NF process, the "conventional + O-3-BAC + NF" treatment train effectively controlled DBPFP, yielding the removal efficiencies of Cl-DBPFP and Br-DBPFP as 77.6-100% and 33.5-100%, respectively, with monochloroacetic acid, mono-bromo-acetic acid, and tribromomethane formation potentials (MCAA-FP, MBAA-FP, and TBM-FP) not detected in the final effluent. Low temperature in the winter season might be the primary reason for the rapid increase of transmembrane pressure when operating the NF membrane under flux of 25 L/(m(2)center dot h), which could be largely delayed by lowering the flux to 20 L/(m(2)center dot h). Characterization of the membrane cleaning solutions showed that macromolecular biopolymers (6000 Da-4000K Da) such as polysaccharides and proteins were the main contributors to membrane fouling.

J	Arismendi, I; Penaluna, B; Soto, D				Arismendi, Ivan; Penaluna, Brooke; Soto, Doris			Body condition indices as a rapid assessment of the abundance of introduced salmonids in oligotrophic lakes of southern Chile	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												In South America, salmonids have been widely introduced to lakes, yet there are still many oligotrophic lakes without current abundance estimates. Catch per unit effort is a good estimator of fish abundance, but its correct implementation requires an expensive and long-term effort. Thus, there is a need to develop a rapid assessment to estimate the relative abundance of salmonids. Under well-delimited circumstances, condition indices may be a good technique to estimate fish population relative abundances. We sampled adult salmonids with gillnets from 6 oligotrophic lakes in southern Chile during the Austral summer. Our data show that as rainbow trout condition indices decrease, the abundance of salmonids increases both temporally and spatially. Because all 6 lakes are limited by food, the most likely reason for the change in the rainbow trout condition indices is change in salmonid abundance. The strong inverse relationship between condition indices of rainbow trout and the relative abundance of salmonids suggests that our model can be a useful tool for the estimation of relative fish abundance in lakes. This study provides a model that can be used to improve lake and fishery management decisions for introduced salmonids in southern South America.

J	von Rintelen, T; Glaubrecht, M				von Rintelen, Thomas; Glaubrecht, Matthias			Rapid evolution of sessility in an endemic species flock of the freshwater bivalve Corbicula from ancient lakes on Sulawesi, Indonesia	BIOLOGY LETTERS												The fauna of ancient lakes frequently contains taxa with highly derived morphologies that resulted from in situ radiation of lacustrine lineages with high antiquity. We employed a molecular mtDNA phylogeny to investigate this claim for corbiculid freshwater bivalves in two ancient lake systems on the Indonesian island Sulawesi. Among the otherwise mobile corbiculid species flock, only one taxon, Posostrea anomioides, in the ancient Lake Poso exhibits a unique habit, i.e. cementing one valve to the substrate. Our data show that Corbicula on Sulawesi is polyphyletic, with the endemic riverine taxa in terminal position, and the lacustrine species flock being paraphyletic. Surprisingly, Posostrea is not confirmed as a genus distinct from Corbicula and genetic distances suggest a rather recent origin from the only other corbiculid species endemic to Lake Poso, the non-cementing Corbicula possoensis. While the cementing anomioides, despite its unique behavioural and morphological characteristics, clusters together with non-sessile Corbicula species, the latter exhibit strong genetic distances in the absence of morphological disparity and fall into several genetically rather distinct clades. These findings suggest that developmental plasticity of animals in ancient lakes rather than the antiquity of lineages might account for the unique morphology of some species.																			1744-9561	1744-957X				MAR 22	2006	2	1					73	77		10.1098/rsbl.2005.0410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2005.0410								17148330					WOS:000241958200021

Due to its ease of use and great performance, colorimetric detection of AP based on Pt-based nanozymes is gaining popularity. A significant difficulty is how to reduce Pt loading content while retaining a high catalytic activity. Methods: Controlling the deamination of Co-NH3 complexes, including Ni(OH)2, led to the formation of small NiCo2O4 nanoparticles, which were afterwards decorated with a 0.37wt% Pt loading. Significant findings: With a low Michaelis-Menten constant of 0.0112 mM, the 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was oxidized with O2 utilizing the Pt(0.37wt%)/NiCo2O4 nanocomposite. The detection settings were tuned for nanozyme and TMB concentrations, pH, temperature, and reaction duration. Utilizing AP's inhibitory impact on the oxidase-like activity at pH = 1, an AP colorimetric sensor was created. It was possible to establish a linear response with a detection limit (LOD) of 2.4 mu M and a range of 10 mu M-0.25 mM. In natural water, such as spring, lake, and river water, this colorimetric sensor was effectively employed to detect AP with good selectivity over interfering substances.																			1876-1070	1876-1089				NOV	2023	152								105183	10.1016/j.jtice.2023.105183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtice.2023.105183		OCT 2023											WOS:001103880500001

However, little attention has been paid to the role of waterfowl's behavior perturbation in N and P nutrients releasing from the sediment. In this study, five feeding experiments were undertaken in the Swan Lake (Shandong Province, northern China) during the wintering season and a noticeable release of nutrients in all experiments was found by the disturbance of the swan behaviors. The release of TN and TP was through three stages including the non-release stage, the rapid release stage, and the stable release stage. Moreover, supplemental food also influenced the swan behavior changes and triggered the frequency of the swans' grazing and aggression. The aggressive behaviors among the swans stirred nutrient (N & P) releasing from sediments and altered TN and TP concentrations in the water columns, indicating that the aggressive behaviors may be a significant factor in affecting the TN and TP releasing from the sediment. Human feeding intensity (HFI) suggested > 850 g of supplemental corn can be an optimal way to aid in avoiding foraging competition among the swans to control nutrient release by three levels of human feeding intensity assessment. Our findings demonstrate that under the swans' optimal foraging need in natural versus artificial feeding scenarios, the swans acted as biological pumps to increase nutrient release. There is a need for a systematic and evidence-based feeding strategy for swans, with greater restrictions on the provision of small food items scattered by visitors. Our study provided novel insights into the release mechanism of N and P from bioturbation and could help to inform a whooper swan conservation strategy in coastal wetlands and nature reserves.					; Liu, Jiayuan/KIG-2185-2024	liu, yu hong/0000-0002-7302-843X; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2023	154								110818	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110818		AUG 2023											WOS:001062743400001
S	Burn, CR		Slaymaker, O		Burn, C. R.			Mackenzie Delta: Canada's Principal Arctic Delta	LANDSCAPES AND LANDFORMS OF WESTERN CANADA	World Geomorphological Landscapes											Mackenzie Delta, in Canada's western arctic, is North America's largest arctic delta. For over half the year, the rivers and lakes of this vast alluvial plain are ice covered. Permafrost is ubiquitous in the delta and the surrounding landscape. The tree line traverses the delta, separating closed-canopy white spruce forests in southern parts from low shrub tundra and sedge wetlands at the Beaufort Sea coast. The extension of the delta northwards into the ocean is the net result of 128 Mt of sediment brought annually to the delta by Mackenzie and Peel rivers, of which about two-thirds is deposited offshore. The permafrost of the uplands adjacent to the delta is ice rich, with numerous tabular bodies of almost pure ice that formed when the ground originally froze. Throughout the region, the terrain surface is criss-crossed by networks of ice-wedge polygons, initiated by water freezing in cracks opened by ground contraction during winter cooling. A large number of pingos-ice-cored, conical hills up to 50 m high-have developed in the sandy sediments of drained lakes in the area. These features grow as permafrost aggrades in saturated lake sediments. Continual uplift of these little hills demonstrates the enormous forces that can be generated by ground freezing.																			2213-2090	2213-2104	978-3-319-44595-3; 978-3-319-44593-9				2017							321	334		10.1007/978-3-319-44595-3_23	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-44595-3_23	10.1007/978-3-319-44595-3												WOS:000415340100025

Four cores from two coring sites were analysed. At Site 1, located at 70 m depth, cores PALB94 1E and PALB94 1C were collected, while cores PALB94 6A and PALB94 6B were collected at Site 6 at 30 m depth. The autoecology of the ostracod species, cluster analysis, PCA and CA ordination numerical analyses were performed in order to identify changes in environmental conditions within the sedimentary record. Three assemblages were recognized: (a) dominated by C. neglecta representing sublittoral environments, (b) dominated by C. neglecta accompanied by Potamacypris spp. related to spring influx and (c) dominated by Cyclocypris sp. associated with littoral and relatively warmer conditions. A reconstruction of lake water level, oxygen concentration near the bottom and lake productivity, based on ostracod autoecology and supported by fossil pigment data, was accomplished. Sharp fluctuations in water level and productivity seem to indicate climatic oscillations between ca 30 to ca 17 kyr BP.					; Belis, Claudio/AGG-8514-2022	Belis, Claudio Alejandro/0000-0003-1285-8322; 													0049-6979					OCT	1997	99	1-4					593	600		10.1023/A:1018372313717	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018372313717													WOS:A1997XW68200061

The area of the lake, and the volcano as a whole, is also considered to he geologically, hazardous due to continual shallow seismic activity, gaseous emissions and hydrothermal activity. Therefore, most research has been focussed on the geological aspects of the Albano lake system, whilst long-term limnological studies have been lacking. A meromictic classification was given to the lake, but this was based on one year studies of the surface water only. Presented and discussed are the results of a water chemistry, and biological study of the full depth profile of Lake Albano from 2604 to 2008. During winter 2005-2006 the lake underwent a complete overturn, resulting in an influx of nutrient rich hypolimnetic water into the upper productive layers and oxygenated epilimnetic water into the deepest water layers. The effect of full overturn on the phytoplankton community is described and compared with those of meromictic years. The interplay between natural and anthropological processes on water quality and water usages is also discussed.					; Mosello, Rosario/ABA-4690-2021	ELLWOOD, Neil Thomas William/0000-0001-7933-4246; Galvez, Rosa/0000-0001-7357-1582; Mosello, Rosario/0000-0002-1873-0162													1129-5767	1723-8633					2009	68	2					288	303		10.4081/jlimnol.2009.288	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2009.288													WOS:000268778300012

Heavy metal and nutrient standing stock by ditch plant species	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Agricultural runoff impacts rivers and lakes on a global scale, while in developing countries (e.g., China), rural domestic wastewater is often an additional source of pollution. Scholars and policy makers are now promoting the use of agricultural vegetated ditches (VDs) as a potential supplemental management practices for nutrients and pesticide reduction from agricultural sources; however, information on the efficacy of these systems for the treatment of rural wastewater loaded with nutrients and heavy metal(loid)s (HMLs) removal and standing stock (SS) in aquatic plants growing there is rare or unknown. These shortcomings in our understanding of these systems must be addressed if they are going to serve further as an effective tool for purifying rural domestic sewage laden with concentrations of HMLs. To address this knowledge gap, the present study deals with SS of ten HMLs in ten plant species growing in a VD receiving raw rural domestic wastewater, with the intention to revealing an appropriate period for ditch plant harvesting to maximize HM removal. Mean reduction efficiencies amount to TN (60.6%), NH4-N (63.3%), NO3-N (48.1%), TP (58.5%) and PO4-P (51.9%), with favorable treatment performance during the summer season. Concentrations of nutrients typically declined gradually with distance along the length of the VD. Furthermore, the annual average reduction amounted to Ni (50.6%), Cu (56.1%), Cr (63.3%), Zn (79.3%), Cd (67.5%), Pb (80.1%), As (60.3%), Fe (52.6%), Al (19.8%), and Mn (24.3%). Plant uptake and sediment retention were the major contributors for nutrient mitigation within the vegetated ditches, with subsequent bacterial interaction and transformation of pollutants. Accumulation of HMLs varied among species and plant parts. Overall, SSs of most HMLs in plant species were greater in either stems or roots than leaves, with maximum values recorded in SSs of Al, Fe, and Mn. Based on the seasonal fluctuation of the accumulated HMLs in different plant species, the approach of harvesting plant biomass in order to effectively target HMLs in August or early September is recommended. Overall, reported results suggest that VD is an effective ecosystem to mitigate HMLs and nutrients from raw rural domestic wastewater in a similar way as constructed wetlands, noting the potential incorporation into local best management practices.

Water flux was measured from 1995. The data for most species were subjected to fast Fourier transformation (FFT) to extract dominant periodicities, their magnitudes, and their phases. Clear seasonal variations were observed for Al, V, As, Rb and Cs at some sampling points, especially in the tributaries. The seasonal variations may be due to either anthropogenic causes, such as irrigation or wastewater discharge, or natural causes, such as water temperature, pH, redox condition, water flux, or activity of microorganisms. We found no correlation with pH. Water temperature may not be a main controlling factor, although the seasonal variability would be correlated with it. Hydrologic factors may have only minor effects. We suggest that most of the seasonal variation might be correlated with the irrigation of rice paddies. It was difficult to identify all the causes of the seasonal variability. To investigate interannual trends, we used centered 12-month moving averages to eliminate seasonal variations. The water quality of the uppermost streams was generally constant, being controlled by springs on Mt. Fuji. However, in 1993 and 1998, V, As, Rb, Cs and U were depleted briefly, possibly by dilution by overflow from Lakes Kawaguchi and Yamanaka. Hydrologic factors may be more important for interannual variability than seasonal variability. Some heavy trace elements (Zn, Ni, Cd and Sb) showed very irregular variations with high concentration peaks. These elements were discharged from either factories or abandoned mine tailings.

Several temporal orders of sedimentary cycles have been identified in the basin, recording fluctuations in the lake level owing to different magnitudes of climate changes. The shorter cycles (millimetric) span some years and the largest cycles (tens of meters) span a hundred thousand years or more. The sedimentary cycles are of two different rock types and sedimentary features. One rock type represents periods of falling (or low) lake levels, and the other type subsequent periods of rising (or high) lake levels. Two main types of cycles can be distinguish within the basin. Cyclity in marginal areas was recorded by the alternation of subaquatic and subaereal deposits caused by the expansion and contraction of the lake. In contrast, the cyclicity in the central areas of the basin was recorded in continuous subaquatic deposits caused by oscillation of the lake level that changed the salinity and circulation in the paleolake. These central area deposits have the potential to contain a complete record of climate cyclity for most of the last 4 million years.

Patterns of CO2 concentration and inorganic carbon limitation of phytoplankton biomass in agriculturally eutrophic lakes	WATER RESEARCH												Lake eutrophication is a pervasive problem globally, particularly serious in agricultural and densely populated areas. Whenever nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus do not limit phytoplankton growth directly, high growth rates will rapidly lead to biomass increases causing self-shading and light-limitation, and eventually CO2 depletion. The paradigm of phytoplankton limitation by nutrients and light is so pervasively established, that the lack of nutrient limitation is ordinarily interpreted as sufficient evidence for the condition of light limitation, without considering the possibility of limitation by inorganic carbon. Here, we firstly evaluated how frequently CO2 undersaturation occurs in a set of eutrophic lakes in the Pampa plains. Our results confirm that conditions of CO2 undersaturation develop much more frequently (yearly 34%, summer 44%) in these agriculturally impacted lakes than in deep, temperate lakes in forested watersheds. Secondly, we used Generalized Additive Models to fit trends in CO2 concentration considering three drivers: total incident irradiance, chlorophyll a concentration, and lake depth; in eight multi-year datasets from eutrophic lakes from Europe, North and South America, Asia and New Zealand. CO2 depletion was more often observed at high irradiance levels, and shallow water. CO2 depletion also occurred at high chlorophyll concentration. Finally, we identified occurrences of light- and carbon-limitation at the whole-lake scale. The different responses of chlorophyll a and CO2 allowed us to develop criteria for detecting conditions of CO2 limitation. For the first time, we provided whole-lake evidence of carbon limitation of phytoplankton biomass. CO2 increases and eutrophication represent two major and converging environmental problems that have additive and contrasting effects, promoting phytoplankton, and also leading to carbon depletion. Their interactions deserve further exploration and imaginative approaches to deal with their effects. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Wetlands have been shown to be efficient in particle removal, primarily through dry deposition and leaf accumulation. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of PM2.5 removal by wetlands during urbanization processes could inform urban planning. In the current study, three wetland plots, Cuihu Lake Park (CL), Summer Palace (SP), and Olympic Park (OP), were selected as low, medium, and highly degrees of urbanization site respectively based on the proportions of building and traffic district areas to compare the removal efficiencies. Results show the average dry deposition velocity in OP was significantly higher than CL and SP. Dry deposition is mainly influenced by meteorological conditions. Buildings and other infrastructure make the meteorological conditions conducive to deposition, resulting in higher wind velocity, higher temperature, and more intense turbulence between buildings. Variation in leaf accumulation was not statistically significant between the three plots, and plant species was the major factor affecting the amount of accumulation. The dry deposition contribution to particle removal increases with degree of urbanization. The average dry deposition accounted for 39.74%, 52.55%, and 62.75% at low, middle and high level respectively. Therefore, Wetlands with greater degree of urbanization improve PM2.5 removal efficiency primarily by accelerating the dry deposition process. The result emphasizes the importance of wetlands in particle removal in highly urbanized areas and thus more wetlands should be preserved and/or created during urban expansion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Research teams from several environmental science institutes, both national and international, participated in this interdisciplinary effort to investigate the deeper parts of Lake Geneva. Using the MIRs allowed the scientists to see and precisely select the sites where they could extract specific sediment cores and carry out detailed in situ measurements at the sediment-water boundary. One focus site was the surrounding of the outlet of the wastewater treatment plant of the City of Lausanne, which discharges into the Vidy Bay. The investigations concentrated on the pollution of the local sediments, pollution-related ecotoxicological risks, microbial activity and spreading and removal of the effluents from the bay to the open waters of the lake. The other focus site was the Rhne River delta and its subaquatic canyons, which formed as a result of the long-term interplay of the deposition of river-borne sediments and flood-triggered canyon erosion events.

Exploring Holocene continentality changes in Fennoscandia using present and past tree distributions	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												With global warming, the distribution of warmth through the year is likely to change in the future and comparable changes may have occurred over the course of the Holocene. Its effect on vegetation composition and species distribution can be compared to that of a continental versus an oceanic climate. The distribution of five major tree species along a continentality gradient was studied in Fennoscandia based on distribution maps and on their proportions of pollen in surface-sediment samples. Both analyses indicate that the five arboreal species show similar patterns of response to a continentality index in the order Ulmus glabra, Corylus avellana, Quercus robur, Tilia cordata, and Picea abies from the most oceanic to most continental. Continentality, growing degree days above 5 degrees C, and January temperature were reconstructed quantitatively from four pollen diagrams using transfer functions based on a combined Fennoscandian pollen surface-sample data-set. Quantitative reconstructions indicate that the climate in Fennoscandia has become increasingly more continental over the last 7000 years, and this is largely an effect of winter cooling. Early Holocene vegetation composition has poor analogues to the present vegetation in Fennoscandia, which hampers quantitative reconstructions. Qualitative reconstructions suggest that the early Holocene in Fennoscandia was the most oceanic period, but probably with a high variability in temperature. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bowser, CJ; Jones, BF				Bowser, CJ; Jones, BF			Mineralogic controls on the composition of natural waters dominated by silicate hydrolysis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												A detailed mineral-solute mass-balance spreadsheet model has been developed to improve understanding of mineralogic controls on water composition in surface waters and groundwater systems dominated by silicate lithologies. The spreadsheet-based approach is used to investigate mass-balance solutions over a range of mineral compositions for predominant, multi-element phases such as plagioclase, biotite, chlorite, amphibole, and dioctahedral smectite. The mass-balance technique has been applied to a variety of hydrogeologic environments including calibrated watersheds, springs and groundwater systems. Lithologic settings include plutonic, metamorphic, minor volcanic, and sedimentary (alluvial and glacial deposits) materials. Sites investigated, most of which allowed comparison with earlier work, include ephemeral and perennial springs of the central Sierra Nevada Mountains, California; the Loch Vale, Colorado high-altitude watershed; four catchments in the Inyo Mountains, California and Nevada; watersheds in the Catoctin Mountain, Maryland area; and ground-water How systems in Vekol Valley, Arizona and in the Trout Lake area, Wisconsin. Analytical mass balances were derived with a novel approach that permits graphic analysis of the functional dependency of mineral mass-transfer coefficients on variations in major silicate composition. A 10 x 10 matrix of mineral-solute reaction equations was used to solve for the best mass balances. Alternative methods were developed to investigate cases where the number of mineral phases exceeds the number of solute constraints (10) that are commonly found in clastic, silicate-dominated systems with diverse sources and/or phase mixtures of variable chemistry (such as an assortment of plagioclase compositions). Techniques were also developed to allow for important structurally controlled compositional variation in clay minerals. Final mass-balance choices were tempered by thermodynamic stability calcudations for various minerals under near-surface weathering conditions. Mineral mass-transfer ratios were also found to be useful in restricting mass balances. Additional constraints were provided by establishing consistent sets of similar mineral assemblages and mineral compositions for a series of wells along a ground-water flow path, or through comparison of multiple nearby watersheds subject to similar climatic and vegetative conditions. Whereas unique analytical solutions from spreadsheet mass balances were not always possible, a surprisingly limited range was obtained for mineral assemblages and compositions satisfying observed mineral occurrences and thermodynamic stability conditions. Our results demonstrate the importance of having well-characterized mineral compositions for both reactant and product phases. The mass-balance results are particularly sensitive to the compositions of plagioclase, dioctahedral smectite, and a few primary mafic mineral groups (trioctahedral mica, amphibole, and pyroxene). In addition to mineral controls, the specific examples studied demonstrate effects of dolomite and calcite overprints on silicate weathering, biomass fluctuations, road salt contamination, and on buried evaporite salts. A comparison of the mass-balance results from surface- and groundwater systems indicates strong similarities, suggesting that similar processes dominate the mineral controls in both settings, and that, under soil weathering conditions ion exchange might have been overemphasized, except under conditions where pre-existing waters are displaced by solutions of significantly different composition.																			0002-9599	1945-452X				SEP	2002	302	7					582	662		10.2475/ajs.302.7.582	http://dx.doi.org/10.2475/ajs.302.7.582													WOS:000178513900002

Trophic interaction between topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva) and the co-occurring species during summer in the Dniprodzerzhynsk reservoir	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Topmouth gudgeon, Pseudorasbora parva is the most common invasive fish in Europe, which can compete with the juveniles of valuable commercial fishes. The goal of this work is to study the diet of topmouth gudgeon and trophic relationships with some native fishes inhabiting the littoral zone of the Dniprodzerzhynsk reservoir. The obtained relatively low values of diet overlaps between topmouth gudgeon and other co-occurring cyprinids such as juvenile roach, Rutilus rutilus; silver bream, Blicca bjoerkna; rudd, Scardinius erythrophthalmus; Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio and bleak, Abramis brama, indicate that it is not a serious food competitor for them, especially commercially valuable ones. On the contrary, high diet overlaps were observed among some native cyprinids such as juvenile roach, silver bream, rudd, and bleak. The major prey items of topmouth gudgeon were Chydorus sphaericus and chironomids, whereas other cyprinids selected Bosmina spp. This peculiarity may be due to different vertical distributions of these fish in the littoral zone of the reservoir, where topmouth gudgeon inhabit near-bottom water layers, where they preyed on near-bottom and benthic zooplankters and chironomids, while juvenile roach, silver bream, rudd, and juvenile and adult bleak live in higher water layers, where they preyed on pelagic zooplankton.

In both years the larvae appeared between April and October, with maximum numbers occurring in spring (e.g. the maximum peak at Karlsruhe was about 315 larvae/l at the end of May 1991). However, in 1991 the total amount of larvae (e.g. about 10(15) larvae in 1991, at Cologne) was about three times higher than in 1992. For nearly all samples, the average larval shell length was ca. 100 mum. Generally, far less than 0.1% of the larvae were about 200 mum in length and were, thus, at a stage near to settlement. In 1991, larval growth was studied under controlled laboratory conditions. Studies for two ''fliessende Welle''-inventories were also carried out. Growth rates ranged from 3.7 to 15.0 mum/day, assuming that no larvae originating from the river bed itself had the chance to complete their development before reaching the North Sea. Thus, the search for parent populations concentrated on those parts of the river system where the current is slower, thereby enabling the larvae to pass their main developmental period before being introduced into the ''fliessende Welle'' of the River Rhine. By combining all information on the larvae and knowing the time it takes for a water column to flow between two points one can roughly estimate the places of origin of a larval age group which is drifting downstream. In 1991 and 1992, the places of probable major importance were the 'Rest Rhine' between Basel and Breisach, the other dammed up parts of the Upper Rhine and the River Main (a major tributary).

Reconstructing the paleoenvironment of an oxygenated Mesoproterozoic shoreline and its record of life	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The Nonesuch Formation microbiota provide a window into ca. 1075 Ma life within the interior of ancient North America. The Nonesuch water body formed following the cessation of widespread volcanism within the Midcontinent Rift as the basin continued to subside. In northern Michigan and Wisconsin, USA, the Copper Harbor Conglomerate records terrestrial alluvial fan and fluvial plain environments that transitioned into subaqueous lacustrine deposition of the Nonesuch Formation. These units thin toward a paleotopographic high associated with the Brownstone Falls angular unconformity. Due to these "Brownstone Highlands," we were able to explore the paleoenvironment laterally at different depths in contemporaneous deposits. Rock magnetic data constrain that when the lake was shallow, it was oxygenated as evidenced by an oxidized mineral assemblage. Oxygen levels were lower at greater depth-in the deepest portions of the water body, anoxic conditions are recorded. An intermediate facies in depth and redox between these endmembers preserves detrital magnetite and hematite, which can be present in high abundance due to the proximal volcanic highlands. This magnetic facies enabled the development of a paleomagnetic pole based on both detrital magnetite and hematite that constrains the paleolatitude of the lake to 7.1 +/- 2.8 degrees N. Sediments of the intermediate facies preserve exquisite organic -walled microfossils, with microfossils being less diverse to absent in the anoxic facies where amorphous organic matter is more likely to be preserved. The assemblage of cyanobacteria and eukaryotes (both photoautotrophs and heterotrophs) lived within the oxygenated waters of this tropical Mesoproterozoic water body.

Remote sensing is a new technique in disaster monitoring. In this study, the Sihu Basin in Hubei Province of China and the Huaibei Plain in Anhui Province of China were selected as the study areas. Thresholds of backscattering coefficients in the decision tree method were calculated with the histogram analysis method, and flood disaster monitoring in the two study areas was conducted with the threshold method using Sentinel-1 satellite images. Through satellite-based flood disaster monitoring, the flooded maps and the areas of expanded water bodies and flooded crops were derived. The satellite-based monitoring maps were derived by comparing the expanded area of images during a flood disaster with that before the disaster. The difference in spatiotemporal distribution of flood disasters in these two regions was analyzed. The results showed that flood disasters in the Sihu Basin occurred frequently in June and July, and flood disasters in the Huaibei Plain mostly occurred in August, with a high interannual variability. Flood disasters in the Sihu Basin were usually widespread, and the affected area was between Changhu and Honghu lakes. The Huaibei Plain was affected by scattered disasters. The annual mean percentages of flooded crop area were 14.91% and 3.74% in the Sihu Basin and Huaibei Plain, respectively. The accuracies of the extracted flooded area in the Sihu Basin in 2016 and 2017 were 96.20% and 95.19%, respectively. (C) 2021 Hohai University.

We used four different techniques to establish a chronological framework for the site. Radiocarbon dating of lake organics, bone collagen, and shell carbonate, and in situ cosmogenic Be-10 and Al-26 ages on a boulder on the crest of a moraine that impounded the lake suggest that the ages of the sediments that hosted the fossils are between similar to 140 lea and >45 ka. Uranium-series ages of vertebrate remains generally fall within these bounds, but extremely low uranium concentrations and evidence of open-system behavior limit their utility. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages (n = 18) obtained from fine-grained quartz maintain stratigraphic order, were replicable, and provide reliable ages for the lake sediments. Analysis of the equivalent dose (D-E) dispersion of the OSL samples showed that the sediments were fully bleached prior to deposition and low scatter suggests that eolian processes were likely the dominant transport mechanism for fine-grained sediments into the lake. The resulting ages show that the fossil-bearing sediments span the latest part of Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, all of MIS 5 and MIS 4, and the earliest part of MIS 3.

Water temperature profiles and ice thicknesses are simulated for Thrush Lake, Minnesota, (from 1986 to 1991) and Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, (from 1983 to 1991) and compared to measurements. Standard errors between simulated and measured water temperatures in winter are 0.48 degrees C and 0.60 degrees C for Thrush Lake and Little Rock Lake, respectively. Standard errors between simulated and measured ice and snow thicknesses are 0.11 m and 0.06 m for Thrush Lake, respectively, and on the same order for Little Rock Lake. Model parameters/coefficients are kept constant over the entire simulation period. A sensitivity analysis of model results to one of three threshold conditions for ice formation (mean water temperature) is performed. Simulation results around the freeze-over and ice-out dates are analyzed and illustrated specifically.																			0165-232X					JUL	1996	24	3					289	304																WOS:A1996UZ16500005

Data of grain size and loss on ignition at 550 degrees C (LOI550) were used to reconstruct the climatic changes since the late Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The climate was generally warm and humid between 48.5 and 30 cal ka BP, but was interrupted by a cold and dry period between 37.7 and 33.5 cal ka BP. Cold and dry climate occurred between 30 and 11.5 cal ka BP, especially during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Beginning at 11.5 cal ka BP until present day, the climate was generally warm and humid. Our results are similar to the climate records from the Chinese Loess Plateau since the late MIS 3, which indicates that intensification and weakness of the Asian summer monsoon responding to high and low June insolation are the main mechanism of climate evolution in Wulagai Lake area since the late MIS 3. However, LOI550 content increased in Wulagai Lake since 2.5 cal ka BP, which probably resulted from human activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

J	Oczkowski, A; Nixon, S				Oczkowski, Autumn; Nixon, Scott			Increasing nutrient concentrations and the rise and fall of a coastal fishery; a review of data from the Nile Delta, Egypt	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												There is a conceptual basis, and some empirical evidence, that increasing nutrient loads to coastal waterbodies will initially increase ecosystem productivity up to a threshold, beyond which secondary productivity and fishery yields will decline. Here we have compiled data from the Egyptian and international literature for fish landings and inorganic nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) data from four large coastal lagoons (63-500 km(2)) on Egypt's Nile Delta to provide evidence for the initially positive, but then negative, response of fishery yields to increased nutrient supply across a very wide range of enrichment (up to 1 mM dissolved organic nitrogen, DIN). Taking the data from the four lagoons as an aggregate, fish landings increase with increased nutrients up to a peak in landings at approximately 100 mu M DIN, beyond which there was an exponential decline in landings. It appears that pesticide and heavy metal contamination and overfishing played only minor roles in the lowered fishery yield at highest DIN concentrations. We do not have sufficient evidence about the specific mechanisms that led to the decline of the fishery, but suspect that some feature of eutrophication-low oxygen, for example, may have been involved.

J	Mountfort, DO; Kaspar, HF; Downes, M; Asher, RA				Mountfort, DO; Kaspar, HF; Downes, M; Asher, RA			Partitioning effects during terminal carbon and electron flow in sediments of a low-salinity meltwater pond near Bratina Island, McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												A study of anaerobic sediments below cyanobacterial mats of a low-salinity meltwater pond called Orange Pond on the McMurdo Ice Shelf at temperatures simulating those in the summer season (<5 degrees C) revealed that both sulfate reduction and methane production were important terminal anaerobic processes. Addition of [2-C-14]acetate to sediment samples resulted in the passage of label mainly to CO2. Acetate addition (0 to 27 mM) had little effect on methanogenesis (a 1.1-fold increase), and while the rate of acetate dissimilation was greater than the rate of methane production (6.4 nmol cm(-3) h(-1) compared to 2.5 to 6 nmol cm(-3) h(-1)), the portion of methane production attributed to acetate cleavage was <2%, Substantial increases in the methane production rate were observed with H-2 (2.4-fold), and H-2 uptake was totally accounted for by methane production under physiological conditions, Formate also stimulated methane production (twofold), presumably through H-2 release mediated through hydrogen lyase. Addition of sulfate up to 50-fold the natural levels in the sediment (interstitial concentration, similar to 0.3 mM) did not substantially inhibit methanogenesis, but the process was inhibited by 50-fold chloride (36 mM), No net rate of methane oxidation was observed when sediments were incubated anaerobically, and denitrification rates were substantially lower than rates for sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. The results indicate that carbon flow from acetate is coupled mainly to sulfate reduction and that methane is largely generated from H-2 and CO2 where chloride, but not sulfate, has a modulating role. Rates of methanogenesis at in situ temperatures were four- to fivefold less than maximal rates found at 20 degrees C.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				DEC	1999	65	12					5493	5499											10584008					WOS:000084036800045

This research focuses on the long-term changes in phytoplankton diversity in the floodplain lake situated in the Kopa & ccaron;ki Rit (Croatia), one of the largest conserved floodplains in the Middle Danube. The recent dataset from 2003 to 2016 and historical data from the 1970s and 1980s indicate high phytoplankton diversity, summarising 680 taxa for nearly half a century. The variability of species richness is driven by specific in-lake variables, particularly water temperature, water depth, total nitrogen, pH, and transparency, determined by a redundancy analysis of the current data. The high phytoplankton diversity levels are sustained regardless of intense pressures on the lake environment, including exposure to strong anthropogenic pollution in the past and extreme hydrological events, both droughts and floods, which have increasingly affected this part of the Danube in the last decades. The conserved hydrological connection between various biotopes along the river-floodplain gradient seems crucial in maintaining high phytoplankton diversity. Accordingly, conserving natural flooding is mandatory to maintain high biodiversity in complex and dynamic river-floodplain systems.

However, the broadly inaccessible nature of subglacial systems has left them vastly understudied, and research to date has been limited to laboratory experiments or field measurements using basal ice or subglacial water accessed through boreholes or from the glacier margin. In this study, we extend our understanding of subglacial biogeochemistry and microbiology to include observations of a slushy pond of water that occupied a remnant meltwater channel beneath a polythermal glacier in the Canadian High Arctic over winter. The hydraulics and geochemistry of the system suggest that the pond water originated as late-season, ice-marginal runoff with less than similar to 15% solute contribution from subglacial sources. Over the 8 months of persistent sub-zero regional temperatures, the pond gradually froze, cryo-concentrating solutes in the residual water by up to 7 times. Despite cryoconcentration and the likely influx of some subglacial solute, the pond was depleted in only the most labile and biogeochemically relevant compounds, including ammonium, phosphate, and dissolved organic matter, including a potentially labile tyrosine-like component. DNA amplicon sequencing revealed decreasing microbial diversity with distance into the meltwater channel. The pond at the terminus of the channel hosted a microbial community inherited from late-season meltwater, which was dominated by only six taxa related to known psychrophilic and psychrotolerant heterotrophs that have high metabolic diversity and broad habitat ranges. Collectively, our findings suggest that generalist microbes from the extraglacial or supraglacial environments can become established in subglacial aquatic systems and deplete reservoirs of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon over a period of months. These findings extend our understanding of the microbial and biogeochemical evolution of subglacial aquatic ecosystems and the extent of their habitability.

Greece	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												The presence of phosphorus (P) and heavy metals (HMs) in surface sediments originating from lakes Volvi, Kerkini, and Doirani (N. Greece), as well as their fractionation patterns, were investigated. No statistically significant differences in total P content were observed among the studied lakes, but notable differences were observed among sampling periods. HM contents in all lakes presented a consistent trend, i.e., Mn > Cr > Zn > Pb > Ni > Cu > Cd, while the highest concentrations were recorded in Lake Kerkini. Most of the HMs exceeded probable effect level value indicating a probable biological effect, while Ni in many cases even exceeded threshold effects level, suggesting severe toxic effects. P was dominantly bound to metal oxides, while a significant shift toward the labile fractions was observed during the spring period. The sum of potentially bioavailable HM fractions followed a downward trend of Mn > Cr > Pb > Zn > Cu > Ni > Cd for most lakes. The geoaccumulation indexI(geo)values of Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn in all lakes characterized the sediments as "unpolluted," while many sediments in lakes Volvi and Kerkini were characterized as "moderately to heavily polluted" with regard to Cd. The descending order of potential ecological riskEriwas Cd > Pb > Cu > Ni > Cr > Zn > Mn for all the studied lakes. Ni and Cr presented the highest toxic risk index values in all lake sediments. Finally, the role of mineralogical divergences among lake sediments on the contamination degree was signified.

Although not necessarily synchronous across the hemisphere, the regional signature of these pre-26.5 kyr 'events' suggests greater complexity of events preceding the global LGM in the Southern Hemisphere than in the North. Here we explore climatic and environmental variability across the Southern Hemisphere during two time-slices: 32 +/- 1 kyr (representing the period of Southern Hemisphere summer insolation minimum) and 21 +/- 1 kyr (representing the period of maximum global ice volume), based on previously published palaeoclimate proxy data. Temperatures were already approaching glacial levels across the Southern Hemisphere at 32 +/- 1 kyr and minimum temperatures were attained in many records at ~21 +/- 1 kyr. Furthermore, the descent into minimum temperatures occurred later in Antarctica than elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Effective precipitation was more variable, with evidence for both increased and decreased moisture availability across the hemisphere during each time slice. The pattern of effective precipitation indicates that local factors likely played a more significant role in driving moisture availability compared to temperature. Our findings indicate that the onset of full-glacial conditions across the Southern Hemisphere occurred prior to the attainment of global maximum ice volume.

Prior studies have shown that the rate of ascent is one of the primary risk factors for the development of AMS but the role of body hydration, age, gender, alcohol and medication usage, body weight,and altitude of residence continues to be in question. This study estimates the incidence of AMS at 4234 m at Pheriche in the Everest region, explores a number of risk factors predisposing trekkers to a diagnosis of AMS and attempts to quantify the relationship between the Lake Louise AMS diagnostic criteria and oxygen saturation. Methods: Demographic data and information about risk factors felt to place trekkers at increased risk of AMS was collected from 550 trekkers for I mo in the fall of 1996 at 4234 m in the Everest region. Results: Diagnosis of AMS was made in 29.8% (159 trekkers) of the study population. Low water intake (odds ratio 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.40), the presence of respiratory symptoms (odds ratio 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.43-3.40), and an oxygen saturation below 85% at 4243 m (odds ratio 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-3.56) were identified as independent risk factors for AMS diagnosis in this sample. In addition, AMS risk decreased 18.7% (95% confidence interval, 3.8-31.2%) for each additional night spent between Lukla (2804 m) and the study site at 4243 m. Conclusion: Increased reported fluid intake decreased the risk of AMS in this cross sectional prospective study. Further studies need to be done to confirm this finding before recommendations can be made. In addition the rise in the risk of AMS as the rate of ascent increased along this popular Everest trek was quantified for the first time. Finally, AMS was also associated with respiratory symptoms and with a lower oxygen saturation.

Occurrence, Genetic Diversity, and Persistence of Enterococci in a Lake Superior Watershed	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												In 2012, the U.S. EPA suggested that coastal and Great Lakes states adopt enterococci as an alternative indicator for the monitoring of recreational water quality. Limited information, however, is available about the presence and persistence of enterococci in Lake Superior. In this study, the density, species composition, and persistence of enterococci in sand, sediment, water, and soil samples were examined at two sites in a Lake Superior watershed from May to September over a 2-year period. The genetic diversity of Enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from environmental samples was also studied by using the horizontal, fluorophore-enhanced repetitive PCR DNA fingerprinting technique. Results obtained by most-probable-number analyses indicated that enterococci were present in 149 (94%) of 159 samples and their densities were generally higher in the summer than in the other months examined. The Enterococcus species composition displayed spatial and temporal changes, with the dominant species being E. hirae, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. mundtii, and E. casseliflavus. DNA fingerprint analyses indicated that the E. faecalis population in the watershed was genetically diverse and changed spatially and temporally. Moreover, some DNA fingerprints reoccurred over multiple sampling events. Taken together, these results suggest that some enterococci are able to persist and grow in the Lake Superior watershed, especially in soil, for a prolonged time after being introduced.

However, the current satellite data falls short of meeting these monitoring requirements. Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) presents an effective method for obtaining continuous high-resolution data. This study explores five established STF algorithms, namely Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), Robust Adaptive Spatial and Temporal Fusion Model (RASTFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) and Unmixing-Based Data Fusion (UBDF), through experimentation across 45 lakes worldwide. Results are comprehensively compared and analyzed using two indicators: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Robert's edge (Edge) based on a dataset that contains 360 image pairs collected in 2021. The five algorithms underwent 950 random experiments. The results indicate that: (1) ESTARFM outperforms the other four algorithms in terms of visual effect and accuracy assessment. Its average RMSE of and EDGE are 0.0023 sr-1 and -0.0419, respectively. Followed by: FSDAF (RMSE: 0.0026 sr-1, EDGE: -0.0584), RASTFM (RMSE: 0.0029 sr-1, EDGE: -0.4128), STARFM (RMSE: 0.0027 sr-1, EDGE: -0.5207), and UBDF (RMSE: 0.0030 sr-1, EDGE: -0.6505) algorithms. (2) the algorithms have varied performance in different water monitoring missions: for water body extraction, the ESTARFM and FSDAF algorithms are recommended; for algae bloom detection, the FSDAF algorithm is recommended; for seasonal water body monitoring, the ESTARFM is recommended; for quantitative monitoring, the ESTARFM, FSDAF, and UBDF algorithms are recommended. (3) STARFM-like algorithms are sensitive to radiometric uncertainties and UBDF algorithm is sensitive to spatial uncertainties. The findings of this study can help generate high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing datasets for water quality monitoring, waterbody detection, algae bloom tracking, and other water environmental monitoring missions.

Microcystins are non-ribosomal peptides with toxic effects, e.g. on vertebrates, but their function remains largely unresolved. Moreover, not all strains produce microcystins, and many different microcystin variants have been described. Here we explored the diversity of microcystin variants within Microcystis botrys, a common bloom-former in Sweden. We isolated a total of 130 strains through the duration of a bloom in eutrophic Lake Vomb, and analyzed their microcystin profiles with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We found that microcystin producing (28.5%) and non-producing (71.5%) M. botrys strains, co-existed throughout the bloom. However, microcystin producing strains were more prevalent towards the end of the sampling period. Overall, 26 unique M. botrys chemotypes were identified, and while some chemotypes re-occurred, others were found only once. The M. botrys chemotypes showed considerable variation both in terms of number of microcystin variants, as well as in what combinations the variants occurred. To our knowledge, this is the first report on microcystin chemotype variation and dynamics in M. botrys. In addition, our study verifies the co-existence of microcystin and non-microcystin producing strains, and we propose that environmental conditions may be implicated in determining their composition.

In this study, we investigated whether chronically stressed mothers experienced such effects in cooperatively breeding species, in which helpers at the nest potentially compound the negative effects of maternal stress. Using Neolamprologus pulcher, a group-living cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika, we observed the effects of experimentally increased stress on female reproductive success (measured as inter-spawn interval, and number of eggs) as well as egg characteristics including egg size and cortisol concentrations. Stress levels were manipulated by repeated exposure to the acute stresses of chasing and netting. Stressed females had longer inter-spawn intervals and laid fewer, smaller eggs. Although no significant differences in egg cortisol concentrations were detected between control and stressed females, egg cortisol concentration fell between spawns in control but not in stressed fish. No effect of helper number was detected for any parameter examined, except there appeared to be less change in egg cortisol content in groups with helpers present. Our results suggest that stress imposes fitness costs on breeding females, and social regulation of a dominance hierarchy does not appear to exacerbate or alleviate the negative effects of maternal stress.

Cells of the Gram-negative strain were motile and spirochaete-shaped with sizes of 0.2-0.22 x 8-18 mum. Growth of the strain was observed between 10 and 44 degreesC (optimum 37 degreesC), in 2-12 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 3 % NaCl) and between pH 8 and 10.5 (optimum pH 9.5). The novel strain was strictly alkaliphilic, required high concentrations of carbonates in the medium and was capable of utilizing D-glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, starch and D-mannitol. End products of glucose fermentation were H-2, acetate, ethanol and formate. Strain ASpG1(T) was resistant to kanamycin and rifampicin, but sensitive to gentamicin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. The G + C content of its DNA was 58.5 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis of strain ASpG1(T) with its most closely related species, Spirochaeta alkalica Z-7491(T), revealed a hybridization value of only 48.7%. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, strain ASpG1(T) appears to represent a novel species of the genus Spirochaeta, for which the name Spirochaeta americana is proposed (type strain ASpG1(T) = ATCC BAA-392(T) = DSM 14872(T)).

We tested the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of different species and interspecific hybrids of the Daphnia longispina species complex is non-random under such conditions. During the summer stratification, we sampled crustacean zooplankton from 11 reservoirs, covering both longitudinal (upstream, middle, dam) and vertical (epi-, meta- and hypolimnion) environmental gradients. Allozyme electrophoresis was used to discriminate among different Daphnia taxa. All three frequently hybridizing European species of the complex (galeata, cucullata, longispina = hyalina) and hybrids with Dophnia galeata were commonly recorded. Smaller-bodied Dophnia cucullata and its hybrids, when present, preferred mostly the nutrient- and food-rich upstream regions; D. longispina and its hybrids were more commonly found in the downstream part, and often dominated in the meta- or hypolimnion. Redundancy analyses confirmed significant differences in the Daphnia taxon composition, as well as in spatial distribution of other crustacean species, along both gradients. For the first time, we demonstrate regular patterns in the horizontal distribution of Daphnia species and hybrids within a water body, thus accepting our hypothesis. Such spatial distributional patterns may strongly impact local hybridization processes.

The surveyed area was about 35 000 km(2) with a lithology including both crystalline (18 towns) and sedimentary (12 towns) rocks. Concentrations ranging from < 2.8 to 354 Bq m(-3) and from 50.5 to 580 Bq m(-3) were observed for the gross alpha- and beta-activities, respectively. For the gross beta-activity, which was always higher than the corresponding alpha-activity, the arithmetic mean with its standard deviation was 226 +/- 154 Bq m(-3). In order to evaluate the radioactive dose due to the ingestion of these waters, a conservative dosimetric calculation was carried out using the dose conversion factors suggested by the ICRP. An average annual effective dose equivalent of 60 +/- 42 mu Sv was obtained together with a range of 14-161 mu Sv y(-1). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Hydrologic calibration and validation of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool for the Leon River watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												The Leon River watershed which drains into Lake Belton, a primary drinking water supply for central Texas residents, is being affected by high-density daily production and manure management. Our objective was to apply the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to evaluate its ability to simulate the hydrology of the Leon River watershed including water discharge from treatment facilities, reservoirs, and point sources. The 2005 version of SWAT (SWAT2005) was calibrated and verified using hydrologic data from the watershed. Runoff was simulated well (0.65 E(NS) <= 0.75 vertical bar good vertical bar) to very well (E(NS) > 0.75 vertical bar very good vertical bar) based on the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E(NS)) value. Average streamflow simulations agreed well with observed values during the calibration phase (PBIAS < +/- 10 vertical bar very good vertical bar). but the validation period agreement (PBIAS >= +/-25 vertical bar unsatisfactory vertical bar) was less than desired because one of the five validates stream gauges fell into the unsatisfactory range. These results demonstrate the rigor needed to calibrate and validate simulation models for the Conservation Effects Assessment Project, and although additional studies are needed, they also confirm that SWAT2005 can be an effective tool for evaluating the hydrology within the Leon River watershed.

Variation in depth of the mixed surface layer of temperate lakes should affect phytoplankton dynamics because, with increasing mixing depth, average light intensity in and specific sedimentation losses out of the mixed layer both decrease. 2. Our aim was to test a recent dynamic model which relates phytoplankton biomass and the availability of production-limiting resources (light and dissolved mineral nutrients) to mixing depth and nutrient supply from external sources. 3. During summer stratification we sampled the mixed layers of 30 dimictic, phosphorus-limited, oligo- to mesotrophic, mostly non-humic lakes north of the Alps. 4. The results agree well qualitatively with model expectations. Algal concentration in the mixed layer was negatively related to mixing depth or its surrogate log-transformed lake area. Light intensity at the bottom of the mixed layer decreased whereas the concentration of available, inorganic phosphorus increased with increasing mixing depth. Across all depths, higher total phosphorus content was accompanied by higher phytoplankton biomass, lower light availability, and higher inorganic phosphorus concentration. 5. Our data match the predicted shift with increasing mixing depth from predominantly nutrient limitation towards increased light limitation of algal biomass.

Differences in the ecology of Bartonella infections of Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus in a boreal forest	PARASITOLOGY												The epidemiology of Bartonella species infecting Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus in a forest in Eastern Poland was followed for 2 years using mark-recapture. Infections could be acquired in any month, but prevalence, and probability of infection, peaked in the summer. There were significant differences in the pattern of infections between the two species. Both hosts were primarily infected as juveniles, but the probability of infection was highest for A. flavicollis, which, evidence suggests, experienced longer-lasting infections with a wider range of Bartonella genotypes. There was no evidence of increased host mortality associated with Bartonella, although the infection did affect the probability of recapture. Animals could become re-infected, generally by different Bartonella genotypes. Several longer lasting, poorly resolved infections of A. flavicollis involved more than 1 genotype, and may have resulted from sequential infections. Of 22 Bartonella gltA genotypes collected, only 2 (both B. grahamii) were shared between mice and voles; all others were specific either to A. flavicollis or to M. glareolus, and had their nearest relatives infecting Microtus species in neighbouring fields. This heterogeneity in the patterns of Bartonella infections in wild rodents emphasizes the need to consider variation between both, host species and Bartonella genotypes in ecological and epidemiological studies.

J	Villanueva, VD				Diaz Villanueva, Veronica			Dissolved organic matter as P source for biofilms in two contrasting low-order streams	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Forest streams receive large amounts of leaves whose leachates are an important source of dissolved organic matter (DOM), providing not only carbon but also organic nutrients to the microbial communities in streams. I carried out a field study to evaluate the effect of different DOM concentrations on the biofilm structure and functional traits in two similar forest streams belonging to the same catchment. I compared biofilm biomass and nutrient content throughout one year, algal species composition, and biofilm conununity-level physiological profiles in two streams with different DOM concentration and aromaticity. Dissolved nutrient concentrations were higher in the stream with higher DOM concentration, with a concomitant higher biofilm biomass, and there was also a temporal pattern, with higher values during the autumn. Phosphorus content in biofilms was also higher in the high DOM stream, coincidently with a higher capacity of the community to utilize organic P source (glucose-l-P) as a substrate. In contrast, the biofilms from the stream with lower DOM concentrations preferentially used N-organic substrates (amino acids and amines). These results reveal that the biofilms of forest streams make use of organic matter nutrients, so that streams with different DOM loads may differ in biofilm biomass due to changes in both bacterial and autotrophic biomass. In addition, biofilm dynamics may be related to forest phenology, as the highest OM input in this deciduous forest is represented by tree leaves, which supply DOM through leachates, and in particular, with P-rich leachates. In conclusion, different DOM concentrations in two nearby streams led to differences in the community-level physiological profile, as has been previously demonstrated at larger spatial scales in oceans, lakes and along larger rivers.																			1863-9135					DEC	2019	193	2					131	142		10.1127/fal/2019/1234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2019/1234													WOS:000501526000002

Whole-Catchment Manipulations of Internal and External Loading Reveal the Sensitivity of a Century-Old Reservoir to Hypoxia	ECOSYSTEMS												Climate change is predicted to have widespread impacts on freshwater lake and reservoir nutrient budgets by altering both hypolimnetic hypoxia and runoff, which will in turn alter the magnitude of internal and external nutrient loads. To examine the effects of these potential climate scenarios on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) budgets, we conducted a whole-catchment manipulation of hypolimnetic oxygen conditions and external loads to Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR), an old, eutrophic reservoir in a reforested catchment with a history of agricultural land use. Throughout 2 years of monitoring, internal N and P loading during hypoxic conditions dominated the hypolimnetic mass of nutrients in FCR, regardless of changes in external loading. FCR commonly functioned as a net sink of N and P, except during hypoxic conditions, when the reservoir was a net source of ammonium () to downstream. We observed extremely high nitrate-nitrite (), soluble reactive P (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) retention rates, indicating that the reservoir served as a sink for greater than 70% of inputs and greater than 30% of SRP, TN, and TP inputs, on average. Our study is notable in the length of time since reforestation (> 80 years) that a reservoir is still exhibiting high N and P internal loading during hypoxia, potentially as a result of the considerable store of accumulated nutrients in its sediment from historical agricultural runoff. Our whole-catchment manipulations highlight the importance of understanding how multiple aspects of global change, waterbody and catchment characteristics, and land use history will interact to alter nutrient budgets in the future.

Hence, this study aims to find the maincontroling factors of riverine chemistry. 52 water samples were collected for the determination of major ions and environmental isotopes of delta O-18 and delta H-2. Stoichiometry of geochemical data with mixing end members and multivariate statistical analysis were employed with integrated GIS approach for data interpretations. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 of the Jialing River Basin (JRB) were used to define the origin of river water from meteoric water and waterin the spring season is affected by high evaporation and evaporates dissolution. The average TDS 301mg/L that is higher than the Yangtze River. Inthe JRB, 80% of the anion in water samples represented HCO3- (207mg/L) and SO42- (80mg/L) while 80% of the cations were accounted by Ca2+ (59.8mg/L) and Mg2+ (17.9mg/L). The water chemistry mainly derived from the water rock interaction. Piper plot indicated that Ca-Mg-HCO3- was the most dominant water type and most ions derived from carbonate weathering by H2SO4 and H2CO3. The stoichiometry results further confirmed carbonate weathering is dominant than silicate weathering. Evaporate ions were modified by anthropogenic sources. Agricultural inputs are higher than the industry and atmospheric inputs. Redundancy analysis showed that most contributive land-use type in explaining riverine chemistry was the cultivate land (62.6, 66.4, and 67.9%) at all buffer scales of 30, 20, and 10km, respectively. Forest and grasslands mostly correlate with Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, EC, pH, and HCO3- while anthropogenic land-use types such as cultivated and construction lands correlate with Na+, K+, Cl-, and NO3-. These results revealed that the lithology of the basin mainly controlled the upstream water chemistry while downstream riverine chemistry was controlled by both lithology and anthropogenic inputs. Nevertheless, this study suggested that explicitly determining the controlling factors of riverine chemistry involves a complex process and combination of different chemical constituents and factors on river water. However, this study managed to provide useful information to further understanding of the geochemical process in JRB.

In this paper, temperature and chemical characteristics of the lake measured in the period 2003-2017 are used to discuss the mixing pattern and the variation in the oxygen and algal nutrient concentrations, as indicators of the trophic level. In the analysed period the lake showed oligomictic characteristics, reaching the full overturn, with homogenization of the chemical profile over the whole water column, only in 4 out of the 15 considered years. A regular decrease of oxygen and increase of phosphorus concentrations in the deepest layers has been observed in the non-circulating mull-year periods. The mean total phosphorus concentration showed a regular increase, reaching values close to 16 mu g P L-1 in early spring 2017, mostly because of the urban discharge from the watershed, not adequately collected from an existing sewage pipe. Chemical and mixing patterns are discussed in relation with a previous study, carried out in 1966-1971, confirming the recent increase of phosphorus concentrations and the lower frequency of full circulation. The progressive deterioration of lake water quality indicates the need of prompt actions to reduce the external nutrient load and of further studies on the physical and biological characteristics of the lake, still strongly missing.

In fact, after the basin was granted Ramsar status it was made the subject of a 'hard-park' conservation policy. This in practice disenfranchised and alienated local people but did not lead to the effective preservation of the basin. We aim to shed light on the political ecology of the ongoing degradation, which has layers at local, national, and international levels, by using both quantitative and qualitative methods (consisting of in-depth interviews, focus groups, and face-to-face, randomly selected interviews with 625 people). We specifically explore the possible reasons why local people by and large did not despite their high level of environmental concern about the site-demand conservation policies or voluntarily take action to preserve their site. Acknowledging that the sources of the problem are multilayered in nature, thus requiring a multilevel solution, we then propose a governance modality tailored for the case at hand. Since many of the problems that Burdur Lake faces are not unique, it is hoped that the conducted analysis will be relevant to other similar sites.

We show that fluctuations in the diatom record occur in response to changes in sea level, ocean-atmosphere interactions and latitudinal shifts in the wind belts. During the early to mid-Holocene, the system primarily responds to sea level changes. A marine community that favours high nutrients is evident, particularly during 9200-8000, 7420-7000 and 6200-5600 cal a bp, corroborating periods of Benguela upwelling linked to fluctuations in the southeast trade winds. Increases in bioproductivity (%TOC, C/N) and fresher-water diatoms are associated with wetter conditions over the region and the northward migration of the southern westerly wind belt, most notably between 8000 and 7500 cal a bp and over the last 700 years. The latter trends are concomitant with changes in the extent of Antarctic sea ice and availability of moisture in southern South America. During the late Holocene, as sea levels stabilised to modern levels, climate variability is more strongly evident. The body of evidence further reveals the sensitivity of the region to high-latitude atmospheric mechanisms, but also showcases the significance of the southeast trade winds.

In this study, we tested a new approach, combining a process-based model with regression models, to create EPFs to evaluate water storage and local climate regulation from a green infrastructure project on the Yongding River in Beijing, China. Seven artificial lakes and wetlands were established to improve local water storage and human comfort; evapotranspiration (ET) regulates both services. Managers want to minimize the trade-off between water losses and cooling to sustain water supplies while lowering the heat index (HI) to improve human comfort. We selected human benefit indicators using water storage targets and Beijing's HI, and the Variable Infiltration Capacity model to determine the change in ET from the new ecosystems. We created EPFs to quantify the ecosystem services as marginal values [Delta final ecosystem service/Delta ecohydrological process]: (1) Delta water loss (lake evaporation/volume)/Delta depth and (2) Delta summer HI/Delta ET. We estimate the new ecosystems increased local ET by 0.7 mm/d (20.3 W/m(2)) on the Yongding River. However, ET rates are causing water storage shortfalls while producing no improvements in human comfort. The shallow lakes/wetlands are vulnerable to drying when inflow rates fluctuate, low depths lead to higher evaporative losses, causing water storage shortfalls with minimal cooling effects. We recommend managers make the lakes deeper to increase water storage, and plant shade trees to improve human comfort in the parks.					lettenmaier, dennis/T-3088-2017; Bohn, Theodore/K-4494-2012														0043-1397	1944-7973				APR	2017	53	4					3197	3223		10.1002/2016WR019445	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019445													WOS:000403682600038

Our record reveals six cooling events occurring during 5600-4800, 4400-4100, 3800-3300, 3200-2900, 1600-1400, and 500-380 cal yr BP in this area. These cooling events broadly correspond to the episodic weakening of the Asian summer monsoon and the Bond events in the North Atlantic realm, suggesting a common forcing mechanism. Given that temperature has an important effect on the vertical distribution of alpine vegetation in this area, the projected future warming may lead to a large upward shift of the upper forest line and a threat to the life of alpine tree species on the Nanling Mountains. For example, under the RCP8.5 scenario, mean surface air temperature is projected to increase by 4.9 degrees C by the end of this century. This magnitude of warming definitely would result in the disappearance of Tsuga chinensis in this area.

Rich in Lake Chicot, Louisiana after 44 years of flooding	WETLANDS												Lake Chicot, in south central Louisiana, USA, was created in 1943 by the impoundment of Chicot Bayou. Extensive establishment of woody seedlings occurred in the lake during a 1.5 year period, including the growing seasons of both 1986 and 1987, when the reservoir was drained for repair work on the dam. Study plots were established in September 1986 to document woody vegetation establishment and to provide a baseline by which to monitor survival and growth after flooding resumed. Taxodium distichum seedlings were the dominant species after one growing season, with a maximum density of 50 seedlings/m(2), an average of about 2/m(2), and an average height of 75 cm. The lake was reflooded at the end of 1987, bringing water depths at the study plots up to about 1.4 m. Temporary drawdowns were again conducted during the fall of 1992 and 1996. In December 1992, the site was revisited, new plots established, and saplings counted and measured. There was an average of 2.1 T. distichum stems/m(2), and the average height was 315 cm. After the 1996 growing season, there was still an average of about 1.9 stems/m(2), and the average height had increased to 476 cm. Preservation of T. distichum forests in relatively shallow but continuously flooded areas such as Lake Chicot may be a simple matter of draining the lake after a good seed crop and maintaining the drawdown long enough for the seedlings to grow taller than the typical growing season water level. In the case of Lake Chicot, this period was two growing seasons. This action will mimic natural, drought-related drawdowns of the lake and will allow the seedlings to establish themselves and grow tall enough to survive normal lake water levels.																			0277-5212					MAR	1999	19	1					149	155		10.1007/BF03161743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03161743													WOS:000079409700016

Using field measurements (foraging habitat, food acquisition behavior, and food manipulation time), the summer diet of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) in Wisconsin, USA, was determined; foods consumed based on foraging behavior were identified; and ingestion for Sandhill Cranes (Antigone canadensis) was assessed. Based on 102 observations, Whooping Cranes occupying six territories consumed 17 food items (verified with images), of which 90 samples from nine foods were modeled. Food manipulation time predicted food size: ln(y) = 3.50 + 0.45ln(x) - 0.05ln(x(2)) (r(2) = 0.63, P < 0.001). Classification tree analysis identified consumed food using foraging behavior (error rate = 17%). A schematic model with the same three behavioral variables and an additional variable of direct observation identified 93% of 90 items. With Sandhill Cranes, observed swallows predicted actual swallows (y = 1.12x - 6.18 (r(2) = 0.85, 95% CI of slope = 0.79 to 1.45, 95% CI of y-intercept = -50.55 to 38.19)). Field observation of diet and ingestion can be applied to any bird species that uses open habitats where food acquisition behavior and food size vary enough to inform models of foraging behavior.

Reconstructing depositional processes and history from reservoir stratigraphy: Englebright Lake, Yuba River, northern California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												[1] Reservoirs provide the opportunity to link watershed history with its stratigraphic record. We analyze sediment cores from a northern California reservoir in the context of hydrologic history, watershed management, and depositional processes. Observations of recent depositional patterns, sediment-transport calculations, and Cs-137 geochronology support a conceptual model in which the reservoir delta progrades during floods of short duration (days) and is modified during prolonged (weeks to months) drawdowns that rework topset beds and transport sand from topsets to foresets. Sediment coarser than 0.25-0.5 mm deposits in foresets and topsets, and finer material falls out of suspension as bottomset beds. Simple hydraulic calculations indicate that fine sand (0.063-0.5 mm) is transported into the distal bottomset area only during floods. The overall stratigraphy suggests that two phases of delta building occurred in the reservoir. The first, from dam construction in 1940 to 1970, was heavily influenced by annual, prolonged >20 m drawdowns of the water level. The second, built on top of the first, reflects sedimentation from 1970 to 2002 when the influence of drawdowns was less. Sedimentation rates in the central part of the reservoir have declined similar to 25% since 1970, likely reflecting a combination of fewer large floods, changes in watershed management, and winnowing of stored hydraulic mining sediment.

J	Schultz, DM; Arndt, DS; Stensrud, DJ; Hanna, JW				Schultz, DM; Arndt, DS; Stensrud, DJ; Hanna, JW			Snowbands during the cold-air outbreak of 23 January 2003	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A cold-air outbreak east of the Rocky Mountains on 23 January 2003 produced banded clouds and snow across the central and southeastern United States. The bands occurred through two processes: 1) thermal instability in the planetary boundary layer produced horizontal convective rolls (HCRs) over widespread areas, and 2) lake-effect processes downstream of small lakes (fetch, 100 km) produced localized bands. Characteristics of the observed bands associated with the HCRs, such as horizontal scale, depth of circulation, orientation, duration, and dynamics, are explored through observations, previous literature, and theoretical models. Snow from clouds produced by HCRs over land during the cold season has not been extensively studied previously. In this event, cold-air advection over the warm ground led to an upward sensible heat flux, promoting the occurrence of the HCR circulations. As the surface temperature decreased, the height of the lifting condensation level decreased, eventually forming cloud bands within the ascending portion of the HCR circulations. Ice crystals are inferred to have fallen from a large-scale precipitation system aloft into the cloud bands in the planetary boundary layer, which was within the favored temperature regime for dendritic growth of ice crystals. The ice crystals grew and reached the surface as light snow. This seeder-feeder process suggests one way to anticipate development of such snowbands in the future, as demonstrated by other similar events on other days in Oklahoma and Illinois. As the cloud bands were advected equatorward, they ingested drier air and dissipated. Among the several lake-effect bands observed on 23 January 2003, one notable band occurred downwind of Lake Kentucky. Midlake convergence of the land breeze may have initially produced a narrow cloud band that broadened as the land breeze ended. That the snowbands due to the HCRs and lake effect were both associated with heat and/or moisture fluxes from the earth's surface highlights the potential importance of ground- and water-surface temperature measurements for accurate numerical weather prediction.

Macrophyte habitat architecture and benthic-pelagic coupling: Photic habitat demand to build up large P storage capacity and bio-surface by underwater vegetation	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Macrophytes play an important role in shallow lakes if large standing crop can be achieved. Here we stress the role of submerged macrophytes for benthic-pelagic coupling in the shallow oxbow lake Alte Donau (Austria) during restoration triggered by sufficient light availability (12% surface ambient light, photic(> 12%) depth, z o p t i m u m ) in both, the benthic and the pelagic habitat. Focusing on z o p t i m u m , rather than on minimum light requirement (euphotic depth), seemed to be more meaningful to follow the macrophyte development. After phosphate precipitation treatment, the photic(> 12%) pelagic habitat accounted for more than half of the total water volume in summer, while the achievement of the same photic(> 12%) conditions for half of the total sediment surface area was delayed by 8 years. A delay of light exposure on the lake bottom area compared to the lake water volume is given by the basin morphometry, but the time span that is required for passing this delay depends on the efficiency of restoration measures. The 8-year delay for Alte Donau means that lake restoration focusing on macrophyte re-establishment was difficult to stimulate due to insufficient light exposure at the lake bottom. A further increase of photic(> 12%) conditions to more than 3/4 size of both pelagic and benthic habitat, however, eventually stimulated sustained macrophyte growth. With the onset of this large macrophyte biomass yield, the phosphorus storage pool of submerged macrophytes exceeded the annual peak concentration of total phosphorus of the whole lake water by about one order of magnitude for the first time. Further, the submerged macrophyte bio-surface exceeded the size of lake bottom surface, also by about one order of magnitude. Our results support that macrophytes can act as a significant sink of phosphorus by retaining this nutrient at least during the growing season. We further see the immensely large macrophyte bio-surface as a vast spatial dimension for an additional habitat for freshwater biota. Therefore, we conclude that mature submerged macrophyte formations need to be considered not only as biomass yield, but create a unique macrophyte habitat architecture as a third main component in the network between benthic (lake bottom) and pelagic (lake water) habitat.					; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021; Tolotti, Monica/D-4441-2018; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019	Waidbacher, Herwig/0000-0002-6205-5977; Tolotti, Monica/0000-0003-2674-8597; Teubner, Katrin/0000-0002-3699-2043; Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; 														2296-665X				SEP 23	2022	10								901924	10.3389/fenvs.2022.901924	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.901924													WOS:000875335800001

Battery technology is at the heart of this transition as it is vital to hybrid and fully electric vehicles' performance, affordability, and reliability. However, it is not abundant in nature. Lithium has many uses, one of which is heat transfer applications; synthesized as an alloying agent for batteries, glass, and ceramics, it therefore has a high demand on the global market. Lithium can be attained by extraction from other natural resources in igneous rocks, in the waters of mineral springs, and geothermal brine. During the research, geothermal brine was used because, from the technological point of view, geothermal brine contains higher lithium content than other resources such as seawater. The nanofiltration separation process was operated using various solutions of pH 5, 7, and 10 at high pressures. The varying pressures are 11, 13, and 15 bar. The nanofiltration method was used as the separation process. High pressure of inert nitrogen gas was used to supply the driving force to separate lithium from other ions and elements in the sample. The research results supported the selected parameters where higher pressure and pH provided more significant lithium recovery but were limited by concentration polarization. The optimal operating conditions for lithium recovery in this research were obtained at a pH of 10 under a pressure of 15 bar, with the highest lithium recovery reaching more than 75%.

Here we present a palynological record at unprecedented subdecadal resolution for MFM, covering the Allerod-YD transition. Our results show a fluctuation in pollen accumulation rates (PARs) before the onset of the YD, with lower rates between ca. 12 725 and 12 685 varve a BP. The fluctuation in PARs occurs simultaneous with a previously undescribed short fluctuation in sediment composition and varve thickness, as well as with changes in biogeochemical proxies. The combined evidence indicates signs of climatic instability ca. 45 years before the onset of the YD. The PAR records of Betula and Pinus furthermore show earlier and more abrupt changes at the onset of the YD than the percentage-records do. Finally, heliophilous herbaceous taxa show a delayed increase following the onset of the YD of ca. 145 years. This paper illustrates the potential to identify previously unrecognized climate variability and vegetation change when using subdecadal-resolution analyses.

Spatial extent and dissipation of the deep chlorophyll layer in Lake Ontario during the Lake Ontario lower foodweb assessment, 2003 and 2008	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Increasing water clarity in Lake Ontario has led to a vertical redistribution of phytoplankton and an increased importance of the deep chlorophyll layer in overall primary productivity. We used in situ fluorometer profiles collected in lakewide surveys of Lake Ontario in 2008 to assess the spatial extent and intensity of the deep chlorophyll layer. In situ fluorometer data were corrected with extracted chlorophyll data using paired samples from Lake Ontario collected in August 2008. The deep chlorophyll layer was present offshore during the stratified conditions of late July 2008 with maximum values from 4-13 mu g l(-1) corrected chlorophyll a at 10 to 17 m depth within the metalimnion. Deep chlorophyll layer was closely associated with the base of the thermocline and a subsurface maximum of dissolved oxygen, indicating the feature's importance as a growth and productivity maximum. Crucial to the deep chlorophyll layer formation, the photic zone extended deeper than the surface mixed layer in mid-summer. The layer extended through most of the offshore in July 2008, but was not present in the easternmost transect that had a deeper surface mixed layer. By early September 2008, the lakewide deep chlorophyll layer had dissipated. A similar formation and dissipation was observed in the lakewide survey of Lake Ontario in 2003.					; Weidel, Brian/LFR-6469-2024	Rudstam, Lars/0000-0002-3732-6368; 													1463-4988	1539-4077					2015	18	1					18	27		10.1080/14634988.2014.937316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2014.937316													WOS:000351695400004

Over a distance of 1100 m, the channel geometry dramatically changes, reaching depths > 20m and widths > 100m. After rapidly enlarging, the channels appear to evolve toward a new equilibrium geometry. Compared to the glacier surface, the air temperature in the channels is warmer by similar to 1.7 degrees C, wind speed is reduced by similar to 2.4 m s(-1) and net shortwave radiation is greater by similar to 14 W m(-2). The microclimate in the channel shifts the energy balance towards enhanced melt. Field evidence and energy-balance modeling indicate ablation in the deep channels is similar to 4.5 times greater than the local horizontal glacier surface and that melt accounts for similar to 99% of the summer ablation, compared to similar to 75% on the adjacent horizontal glacier surface. Melt in these channels supplies 65% of the unaccounted water discharge into the neighboring lake. In large part, the channels generate the water they carry, rather than merely route water generated elsewhere.

Yu			The Contribution of Glacial Melt Water to Annual Runoff of River Volga in the Last Glacial Epoch	WATER RESOURCES												The runoff of glacial melt water into the river system of the Volga and farther into the Caspian Sea is evaluated for the epoch of the last glaciation. Melt water entered the Volga only from the part of the basin that was covered by the Scandinavian ice sheet. During the maximal phase (19-20 thousand years ago) the glacier occupied the farthest upstream parts of the basin, i.e., the Mologa-Sheksna depression (60 thous. km(2)) and the area near the Volga source and Lake Seliger (5 thous. km(2)). The volume of melt water runoff was calculated for deglaciation time by three models of the ice sheet. The upper estimate yielded a value of 60-70 km(3) per year, and the lower estimate was 15 km(3) per year, or 5-25% of the present-day Volga runoff into the Caspian Sea, where the lower value appears more plausible. In that case, even the maximal estimate is not enough to initiate the Khvalynian level rise in the Caspian Sea. In addition, the major part of the time of meltwater inflow into the Volga (similar to 21...similar to 16.5 thous. years ago) corresponds to a regressive state of the Caspian basin. This also does not allow us to consider the glacial factor as the cause of the Khvalynian transgression, the rise of which similar to 17 thousand years ago fell into the period of a decline of the glacial runoff.					; Sidorchuk, Aleksey/R-8968-2019; Panin, Andrei/K-2895-2012; Ukraintsev, Vadim/JWO-4251-2024	Ukraintsev, Vadim/0000-0002-3255-613X; Sidorchuk, Aleksey/0000-0002-6750-5463; Panin, Andrei/0000-0001-9587-1260; 													0097-8078	1608-344X				NOV	2021	48	6					877	885		10.1134/S0097807821060142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807821060142													WOS:000720647800006
J	von Einem, J; Granéli, W				von Einem, Jessica; Graneli, Wilhelm			Effects of fetch and dissolved organic carbon on epilimnion depth and light climate in small forest lakes in southern Sweden	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We sampled small (0.03 to 3.3 km(2) surface area) forest lakes in southern Sweden during two summers to investigate how concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and lake size influence epilimnion depth (z(e)) and light conditions in the epilimnion. z(e) increased with increasing fetch (square root of lake area) but did not decrease with increasing DOC concentration. This suggests greater importance of wind mixing in our study area than in areas with more continental climate, i.e., epilimnion-deepening wind mixing overrides the tendency for epilimnion depth to decrease with increasing DOC concentration. Extinction of photosynthetically active radiation was mainly caused by DOC. The euphotic zone was shallower in the first year than in the second, probably because of higher precipitation and lower solar irradiance in 2007, which together led to higher water color. Mean epilimnetic irradiance was low, especially in 2007, mainly because the increase in DOC did not lead to shallower epilimnia. Browning of lakes in southern Sweden, in combination with a predicted increase in the number of storm events, may lead to more severe light limitation of phytoplankton in small, nutrient-poor lakes, since it may not be accompanied by a compensatory shallowing of the epilimnion. As a consequence, lake ecosystems will become more heterotrophic, CO2-evasion to the atmosphere will increase, and fish production decrease.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2010	55	2					920	930		10.4319/lo.2009.55.2.0920	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.55.2.0920													WOS:000276440000038

A combination of mathematical modelling and monitoring techniques in the lake can provide an efficient and cost-effective framework for management of microbial pollution of beach waters, as well as serving as a timely reporting tool to communicate associated human health risks from recreational use. Here, a high resolution 3D hydrodynamic model is developed and applied to assess the flow and microbial contribution of major Lake St. Clair tributaries during the Summer of 2010. The model skill in reproducing water temperature is in good agreement with the observed data (gamma(2), NRMSE, R-2 and WS values of 0.12, 0.37. 0.88 and 0.96, respectively). Assuming E. coli input estimates to be conservative, the model results show that the maximum predicted fecal concentrations from the combined input of the major tributaries to be <100 CFU/100 mL for most of the lake. High dominant flow with low E. coli input from the St. Clair River and microbial decay due to residence time in the lake are largely responsible for the results obtained. The results indicate that the four major tributaries are unlikely to be responsible for the observed E. coli exceedances of the Ontario safety guidelines for recreational activity at the highly visited Sandpoint Beach.

The correlations between the fish size (body length) and metal concentrations in the tissues were investigated by linear regression analysis. In addition, the bioadcumulation coefficient, as a measure of accumulation intensity of an element in an organ, was analyzed. The mean content of K, Mg, and Zn in the analyzed perch was higher in the muscle (18.90, 1.53, and 52.92, mg.kg(-1)) than in gills (8.88, 1.30, and 44.99 mg-kg(-1)), and the difference between these values (except for Zn) was statistically significant (p <= 0.05). The analyses of the correlation between metal concentration in the meat and the body length of fish show that the bioaccumulation of Na, K, Mg, and Zn decreases as fish body length increases (negative correlation). The evaluation of the chemical pollution of Lake Goplo concentrations was based on the following ions (N-NO3, N-NO2, and P-PO4) and minerals (Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn). The concentrations of nitrite nitrogen in the waters of Lake Goplo range from 0.012 (in September) to 0.057 mg N-NO2 dm(-3) (in November). The concentration of nitrate nitrogen ranges from 0.09 to 1.888 mg N-NO3 dm(-3). The concentration of orthophosphate in surface waters of Lake Goplo is not very diverse (0.17-0.2 mg PO4-3 dm(-3))																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2012	21	4					1033	1038																WOS:000306575000026

The C-13/C-12 fractionations of two species, Candona candida and Pseudocandona rostrata, correspond to values expected for isotopic equilibrium with the pond's dissolved inorganic carbon at the measured temperature (11degreesC) and pH (6.9), whilst those of a third species, Herpetocypris reptans, would represent equilibrium at a slightly higher pH (7.1). The O-18/O-16 fractionations confirm two previous studies in being larger, by up to 3parts per thousand, than those 'traditionally' regarded as representing equilibrium. When the measured fractionations are considered in the context of more recent work, however, they can be explained in terms of equilibrium if the process of calcite formation at the ostracod lamella occurs at a relatively low pH (less than or equal to7) irrespective of the pH of the surrounding water. The pH of calcite formation, and therefore the calcite-water O-18/O-16 fractionation, may be species and stage (adult versus juvenile) specific, and related to the rate of calcification.

J	Liu, AB; Chen, YT; Cheng, X				Liu, Aobo; Chen, Yating; Cheng, Xiao			Effects of Thermokarst Lake Drainage on Localized Vegetation Greening in the Yamal-Gydan Tundra Ecoregion	REMOTE SENSING												As the climate warms, the Arctic permafrost region has undergone widespread vegetation changes, exhibiting overall greening trends but with spatial heterogeneity. This study investigates an underexamined mechanism driving heterogeneous greening patterns, thermokarst lake drainage, which creates drained lake basins (DLBs) that represent localized greening hotspots. Focusing on the Yamal-Gydan region in Siberia, we detect 2712 lakes that have drained during the period of 2000-2020, using Landsat time-series imagery and an automated change detection algorithm. Vegetation changes in the DLBs and the entire study area were quantified through NDVI trend analysis. Additionally, a machine learning model was employed to correlate NDVI trajectories in the DLBs with environmental drivers. We find that DLBs provide ideal conditions for plant colonization, with greenness levels reaching or exceeding those of the surrounding vegetation within about five years. The greening trend in DLBs is 8.4 times the regional average, thus contributing disproportionately despite their small area share. Number of years since lake drainage, annual soil temperature, latitude, air temperature trends, and summer precipitation emerged as key factors influencing DLB greening. Our study highlights lake drainage and subsequent vegetation growth as an important fine-scale process augmenting regional greening signals. Quantifying these dynamics is critical for assessing climate impacts on regional vegetation change.					; Cheng, Xiao/AAT-6307-2020; Chen, Yating/AAT-5592-2020; Liu, Aobo/AAT-5467-2020	Cheng, Xiao/0000-0001-6910-6565; LIU, AOBO/0000-0001-8912-8729; 														2072-4292				SEP	2023	15	18							4561	10.3390/rs15184561	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15184561													WOS:001077704000001

Twenty-three green-pigmented strains of P. agardhii originating mostly from shallow water bodies fell into two groups, those possessing mcyA and those lacking mcyA. In contrast, all of the 49 strains that were assigned to the red-pigmented P. rubescens contained mcyA. One strain of P. agardhii and eight strains of P. rubescens contained the total microcystin synthetase gene cluster but were found inactive in microcystin synthesis. To investigate the natural abundance of inactive mcy genotypes in P. rubescens individual filaments sampled from Lake Irrsee and Lake Mondsee (Austria) were analysed directly for the presence of mcyA and microcystin by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. All filaments assigned to P. rubescens contained mcyA. The proportion of inactive microcystin genotypes in populations with a low (Irrsee) or high density (Mondsee) of P. rubescens was 5% and 21%, each. The results of this study demonstrate that P. rubescens typically contain mcy genes whereas P. agardhii have a patchy distribution of mcy genes. In both species microcystin producers co-occur with non-microcystin producers due to the absence/inactivation of mcy genes.					; Kurmayer, Rainer/AFJ-4791-2022	Kurmayer, Rainer/0000-0002-2100-9616; Borner, Thomas/0000-0001-9548-3348													1462-2912	1462-2920				AUG	2004	6	8					831	841		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2004.00626.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2004.00626.x								15250885					WOS:000222578600008

Crantz and Dactylorhiza spp. seeds in early Holocene sediments from Central Europe	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Numerous subfossil seeds of Epipactis palustris (L.) Crantz, and Dactylorhiza spp. (D. incarnata/maculata complex) found in early Holocene sediments in northern Poland are the first record of orchid seeds in geological formations of any age and location. The macro- and micromorphological characters of the seeds were examined to determine their taxonomic affinity. The seeds were found among numerous macroremains of aquatic and terrestrial organisms, which are distinct in effective buoyancy, enabling air and water dispersal. The orchid populations developed in a floodplain meadow where summer inundation was probably among the main agents facilitating seed dispersal and deposition in lake sediments. We discuss potential environmental factors enabling the formation and preservation of the subfossil assemblages and suggest some technical issues among the reasons for the general poverty of orchid fossil data. Our data provide the first direct evidence for the early post-glacial establishment of populations of E. palustris and species of the D. incarnata/maculata complex in the northern part of Central Europe.

Here, we present a record from Barley Lake, California, focusing on the interval spanning the Younger Dryas (YD) to the early Holocene (EH), a period of acute and rapid global climate change. Twelve radiocarbon dates constrain the timing between 12.9 and 8.1 ka. We combine a variety of sediment analyses to infer changes in lake productivity, relative lake level, and runoff dynamics. In general, the lake is characterized by two states separated by a <200-year transition: (1) a variably deep, lower-productivity YD lake; and (2) a two-part variably shallow, higher-productivity EH lake. Inferred EH winter-precipitation runoff reveals dynamic multidecadal-to-centennial-scale variability, in agreement with the EH lake-level data. The Barley Lake archive captures both hemispheric and regional signals of climate change across the transition, suggesting a role for both ocean-atmosphere and insolation forcing. Our paleoperspective emphasizes California's sensitivity to climate change and how that change can generate abrupt shifts in limnological regimes.

KCB is located in the semi-arid central Anatolian region of Turkey and hosts many important wetland sites including Salt Lake. Six Landsat-5 TM images selected from the 1984-2011 period were used in the analysis. A real-time field work was performed during the overpass of Landsat-5 satellite on 21/08/2011 over Salt Lake to collect coordinated temperature measurements using a handheld GPS and thermal infrared thermometer. All satellite images were geometrically and radiometrically corrected to relate the image data with in-situ measurements. Thematic LST images were used to evaluate the conditions over the region between 1984 and 2011. The results show that real-time ground temperature and satellite remote sensing data were in good agreement with correlation coefficient (R2) values of 0.94. The remotely sensed and processed satellite images and resulting thematic indices maps show that dramatic land surface temperature changes occurred (about 2 degrees C) in the KCB from 1984 to 2011. Analysis of climatic data supports this finding. Air temperatures and pan evaporation had significant upward trends from 1984 to 2011. Analysis conducted using both LST and climatic data prove that the basin has been experiencing drought in recent years. It is suggested that the use of water supplies, especially ground water should be controlled taking into account particularly summer drought impacts over the basin.

In this study, an Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS), together with an Aethalometer, was deployed at two of China's national background sites in northern (Lake Hongze site; 33.23 degrees N, 118.33 degrees E; altitude 21 m) and southern (Mount Wuzhi site; 18.84 degrees N, 109.49 degrees E; altitude 958 m) China in the spring seasons in 2011 and 2015, respectively, in order to characterize submicron aerosol composition and sources. The campaign-average PM1 concentration was 36.8 +/- 19.8 mu g m(-3) at the northern China background (NCB) site, which was far higher than that at the southern China background (SCB) site (10.9 +/- 7.8 mu g m(-3)). Organic aerosol (OA) (27.2 %), nitrate (26.7 %), and sulfate (22.0 %) contributed the most to the PM1 mass at NCB, while OA (43.5 %) and sulfate (30.5 %) were the most abundant components of the PM1 mass at SCB, where nitrate only constituted a small fraction (4.7 %) and might have contained a significant amount of organic nitrates (5-11 %). The aerosol size distributions and organic aerosol elemental compositions all indicated very aged aerosol particles at both sites. The OA at SCB was more oxidized with a higher average oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio (0.98) than that at NCB (0.67). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis was used to classify OA into three components, including a hydrocarbon-like component (HOA, attributed to fossil fuel combustion) and two oxygenated components (OOA1 and OOA2, attributed to secondary organic aerosols from different source areas) at NCB. PMF analysis at SCB identified a semi-volatile oxygenated component (SV-OOA) and a low-volatility oxygenated component (LV-OOA), both of which were found to be secondary species and could be formed from precursors co-emitted with BC. Using the total potential source contribution function model, the likely source areas of the major PM1 components at both sites were a on large regional scale in East Asia. The possible sources may include not only emissions from the Chinese mainland but also emissions from ocean-going cargo ships and biomass burning in neighboring countries.					; Gong, Zhaoheng/J-2445-2019; Cao, Liming/AAF-8631-2019; He, Lingyan/D-9206-2019; Zhu, Qiao/CAJ-0392-2022; HU, Min/D-1037-2011	Hu, Min/0000-0003-4816-9123; Zhu, Qiao/0000-0001-6439-2160; Cao, Liming/0000-0001-7304-2891; 													1680-7316	1680-7324				AUG 15	2016	16	15					10283	10297		10.5194/acp-16-10283-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-10283-2016													WOS:000383230400001

Ca isotopic geochemistry of an Antarctic aquatic system	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, are a polar desert ecosystem. The hydrologic system of the dry valleys is linked to climate with ephemeral streams that flow from glacial melt during the austral summer. Past climate variations have strongly influenced the closed-basin, chemically stratified lakes on the valley floor. Results of previous work point to important roles for both in-stream processes (e.g., mineral weathering, precipitation and dissolution of salts) and in-lake processes (e.g., mixing with paleo-seawater and calcite precipitation) in determining the geochemistry of these lakes. These processes have a significant influence on calcium (Ca) biogeochemistry in this aquatic ecosystem, and thus variations in Ca stable isotope compositions of the waters can aid in validating the importance of these processes. We have analyzed the Ca stable isotope compositions of streams and lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The results validate the important roles of weathering of aluminosilicate minerals and/or CaCO3 in the hyporheic zone of the streams, and mixing of lake surface water with paleo-seawater and precipitation of Ca-salts during cryo-concentration events to form the deep lake waters. The lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys evolved following different geochemical pathways, evidenced by their unique, nonsystematic Ca isotope signatures.

Cyanobacteria as biological drivers of lake nitrogen and phosphorus cycling	ECOSPHERE												Here we draw attention to the potential for pelagic bloom-forming cyanobacteria to have substantial effects on nutrient cycling and ecosystem resilience across a wide range of lakes. Specifically, we hypothesize that cyanobacterial blooms can influence lake nutrient cycling, resilience, and regime shifts by tapping into pools of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) not usually accessible to phytoplankton. The ability of many cyanobacterial taxa to fix dissolved N-2 gas is a well-known potential source of N, but some taxa can also access pools of P in sediments and bottom waters. Both of these nutrients can be released to the water column via leakage or mortality, thereby increasing nutrient availability for other phytoplankton and microbes. Moreover, cyanobacterial blooms are not restricted to high nutrient (eutrophic) lakes: blooms also occur in lakes with low nutrient concentrations, suggesting that changes in nutrient cycling and ecosystem resilience mediated by cyanobacteria could affect lakes across a gradient of nutrient concentrations. We used a simple model of coupled N and P cycles to explore the effects of cyanobacteria on nutrient dynamics and resilience. Consistent with our hypothesis, parameters reflecting cyanobacterial modification of N and P cycling alter the number, location, and/or stability of model equilibria. In particular, the model demonstrates that blooms of cyanobacteria in low-nutrient conditions can facilitate a shift to the high-nutrient state by reducing the resilience of the low-nutrient state. This suggests that cyanobacterial blooms warrant attention as potential drivers of the transition from a low-nutrient, clear-water regime to a high-nutrient, turbid-water regime, a prediction of particular concern given that such blooms are reported to be increasing in many regions of the world due in part to global climate change.					; Cottingham, Kathryn/AAV-3934-2021; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016	Greer, Meredith/0000-0002-9543-4498; Cottingham, Kathryn/0000-0003-3169-5047; 													2150-8925					JAN	2015	6	1							1	10.1890/ES14-00174.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES14-00174.1													WOS:000350440400001

This case will associate with significant environment problems around the Salt Lake and its environments. In this study, the data have been evaluated for the groundwater samples taken from Aksaray which is one of the agricultural areas of Turkey and bounded of south and east shores of the Salt Lake. Totally 40 groundwater samples including 3 spring and 37 well were sampled from the region. The physical and chemical parameters of the water quality were investigated bi monthly during one year. The maps of water quality were prepared by using the Geographic Information System (GIS) to evaluate well effectively the data of the groundwater. The groundwaters generally have medium salinity hazard rate and a low sodium (alkali) hazard rate in terms of irrigation water use according to the USA Salinity Laboratory Irrigation Water Classification Diagram.

The data set is based on continuous runoff measurements and weekly chemical and biological samples. The data were collected during the open water period, from May to October, in year 2000. The runoff patterns during the summer were similar in the two rivers at though the size of the catchments is very different (the catchment of River Utsjoki 1,520 km(2) and of River Kidisjoki 22 km(2)). For both rivers, variations in runoff were followed by variations in the water quality and bacterial densities. The measured chemical concentrations were usually the highest in the headwaters of river Kidisjoki, while in the lower Kidisjoki they were clearly lower than in Utsjoki. Bacterial densities were on average highest in Utsjoki and the strongest relationships between water chemistry and bacteria were found in Kidisjoki. Both the chemical concentrations and bacterial densities were low in the two rivers when compared to other studied rivers in northern Finland.

Sedimentary effects of flood-producing windstorms in playa lakes and their role in the movement of large rocks	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												This paper sheds light on the hydrodynamic conditions of transport and sedimentary effects of wind-induced water currents produced during strong windstorms in low gradient systems. Repeated field surveys were conducted in a playa lake in central Spain to determine the impacts of major winter storms on the bed form morphology in real time. The succession of storms that passed through the area from mid-December 2013 to early February 2014 left behind a variety of sedimentary structures: mainly ripple marks showing complex patterns and erosional structures. The latter include obstacle scours, grooves and other tool marks. In situ observations revealed that strong storm events in almost flat, extremely shallow lakes (less than 5cm) have enough hydraulic energy to erode and remove high volumes of sediments and may also lead to large stones sliding across the bed, thus creating long grooves. Sole marks found in ancient continental successions have been typically attributed to fluvial conditions. We suggest that shallow lake basins should not be discounted when storm-generated structures are preserved in ancient rocks. The identification of such sedimentary structures provides valuable information for reconstructing hydrodynamic conditions and paleoclimatic conditions in semi-arid environments.

Increasing salinity clearly endangers future exploitation of regional water resources. Here we describe an ongoing study that involves researchers from Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, in which we examine the sources of salinity along the Lower Jordan River. In the past, the river received considerable fresh water from Lake Tiberias, the Yarmouk River and local runoffs. Currently, a much smaller flow rate of mostly poor quality fluids enters the river, leading directly to the degradation of water quality. Using a variety of diagnostic geochemical. tracers for elucidating salinity sources, we have identified three principal zones along the river in which salinity is dramatically modified due to both surface water and groundwater inflows. The influence of groundwater on water quality of the river was previously unrecognized, and adds an additional constraint on future management policy. Future reductions of surface fresh water inflows will further increase the influence of the saline groundwater.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Zooplankton biomass was assessed in 20 reference lakes, nine logged-watershed lakes, and nine burned-watershed lakes during three summers following watershed disturbances by logging or wildfires. Biomass of cladocerans, calanoids, cyclopoids, and rotifers was quantified in the 38 lakes for the first year following disturbances. Limnoplankton biomass in four size fractions was quantified during 3 years following disturbances. One year after disturbances, burned-watershed lakes supported 59% more biomass of the rotifer size fraction of limnoplankton (100-200 mum) than reference lakes, while logged-watershed lakes supported 43% less of calanoid biomass. Two years after disturbances, differences in limnoplankton biomass between burned-watershed lakes and reference lakes were more pronounced than during the first year, while logged-watershed lakes supported levels of limnoplankton biomass no different from those of reference lakes. Three years after disturbances, no significant variations could be detected among the three groups of lakes for any of the limnoplankton size fractions. The proportion of watershed area impacted by logging activities was on average less than half the proportion impacted by wildfires. Nonetheless, both types of disturbances seemed to have opposite effects on the zooplankton biomass during the first year, and the effects did not extend beyond 2 years.					; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/U-9107-2019	Patoine, Alain/0000-0003-1322-919X; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/0000-0002-1070-2968													0706-652X						2000	57			2			155	164		10.1139/cjfas-57-S2-155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-S2-155													WOS:000089999500017

MONGOLIAN LEGENDS IN THE LYRICS OF AXEN SUSEEV	NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN												The Mongolian theme in the works of Aksen Ilyumjinovich Suseev (1905-1995) is defi ned both by the ancestral homeland of the Kalmyks (Oirats) and his biography (work in the MPR during the Great Patriotic War), visiting the country in 1964, 1969 and 1971. His creation of small poems, the poem and the play that conveyed familiarity with the history, culture, and nature of the Mongols refl ected Kalmyk-Mongolian literary contacts in the last century. Three Mongolian legends became the basis of three poems by A. Suseev 1964, written after exploring the local attractions: "Khuartin arshan" ("The Source of Khuzhrt"), "Cahan Nur" ("White Lake"), "Taihir cholun" ("Taihir Stone"). First published in the almanac "Teegin Gerl" in 1965, then included in the Mongolian section of the author's book "Zurkna dun" ("Song of the Heart", 1984), they diff er in minor stylistic edits, the names of toponyms are transmitted not in Mongolian, but in Kalmyk. According to the poet's memoirs, the fi rst two legends were heard by him during a visit to the spring and lake. He did not mention the acquaintance with the third legend "Taihar chuluu". Therefore, the article provides this folklore text with a Russian translation for intro-duction into scientifi c circulation. In general, the content of these works, indicating the genre of "domg" (legend), corresponds to Mongolian legends, diff ering in some details supplemented by the author, or, conversely, omitted.A. Suseev prefaces the texts about the Tahir stone and Tsagan Nur Lake with small introductions, in which he shares his impressions of the beauty of the local nature, the hospitality of the hosts, and the legend of the lake heard from them. The element of the miraculous, characteristic of the genre of legend, in the poem "Khuartin Arshan" is due to the healing properties of a natural spring. In the poem "Cahan Nur", the hero Buhe Sart-agtai saves the world from flooding by plugging a gigantic stone into a well where a white bull used to live; as a result, a lake of wonderful beauty was formed. The third poem about the Tahir stone, contaminating elements of the legend itself and myths about the giant world serpent, glorifies another hero Buhe Belegte, who also protected people from mortal danger when he crushed a snake with stones. All three texts have a frame indicating the place and date of writing.

Characterisation of bacterioplankton communities in the meltwater ponds of Bratina Island, Victoria Land, Antarctica	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												A unique collection of Antarctic aquatic environments (meltwater ponds) lies in close proximity on the rock and sediment-covered undulating surface of the McMurdo Ice Shelf, near Bratina Island (Victoria Land, Antarctica). During the 2009-10 mid-austral summer, sets of discrete water samples were collected across the vertical geochemical gradients of five meltwater ponds (Egg, P70E, Legin, Salt and Orange) for geochemical and microbial community structure analysis. Bacterial DNA fingerprints (using Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis) statistically clustered communities within ponds based on ANOSIM (R = 0.766, P = 0.001); however, one highly stratified pond (Egg) had two distinct depth-related bacterial communities (R = 0.975, P = 0.008). 454 pyrosequencing at three depths within Egg also identified phylum level shifts and increased diversity with depth, Bacteroidetes being the dominant phyla in the surface sample and Proteobacteria being dominant in the bottom two depths. BEST analysis, which attempts to link community structure and the geochemistry of a pond, identified conductivity and pH individually, and to a lesser extent Ag-109, NO2 and V-51 as dominant influences to the microbial community structure in these ponds. Increasing abundances of major halo-tolerant OTUs across the strong conductivity gradient reinforce it as the primary driver of community structure in this study.

Spatial distribution and interannual variability of cyanobacteria blooms on the North-Western shelf of the Black Sea in 1985-2019 from satellite data	HARMFUL ALGAE												Long-term high and medium resolution satellite data are used to study spatial, seasonal and interannual variability of the cyanobacteria blooms (CB) in the North-Western Shelf (NWS) of the Black Sea. High-resolution Landsat data demonstrate that CB were regularly observed in the study area on satellite images in 1985-2020. Comparison of quasi-synchronous Landsat and MODIS images was used to study the characteristic features of CB spectra, which are: a "step" formed by MODIS 3 (469) and 4 (488) channel, probably related to the absorption by photoprotective carotenoids; increased reflectance in near-infrared; maximum at 547-555 nm. On the base of these features, we develop the automated algorithm of CB identification and reconstruct the daily dataset of CB over 2003-2019. The main advantage of the developed algorithm is its ability to filter out non-bloom areas in all seasons and meteorological conditions and during blooms of other algae in the deep part of the sea. Analysis of this dataset, complemented by Landsat data, allows to identify two primary sources of the CB in the NWS: the Dnieper-Bug estuary and the Danube mouth, and study the evolution of CB in these areas in detail. CB can penetrate on more than 150 km from the sources reaching in rare cases the Crimean coast. Such offshore propagation is mainly wind-driven and was often related to the upwelling frontal currents. The climatic seasonal peak of CB near the Danube is observed in May-June following the peak of river discharge in April-May. It precedes the peak of CB near the Dnieper-Bug estuary observed during maximum surface heating in August. At the same time, the case study of bloom evolution in 2009 shows that CB can be observed in these areas several times in a season, triggered mainly by periods of low winds. The strongest bloom of CB in 2003-2019 was observed in 2004-2006 and 2008-2010 following by the sharp decrease after 2011. This decrease is related to the observed reduction of the river discharge and, more important, the rise of the wind intensity in summers of the recent period.

J	Andraso, GM				Andraso, GM			Summer food habits of pumpkinseeds (Lepomis gibbosus) and bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus) in Presque Isle Bay, Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (D. bugensis) have received much attention since they were first reported in the Great Lakes. Predation by fishes may be an important factor in regulating dreissenid populations, but the extent to which fish prey on them is not entirely clear. Pumpkinseeds (Lepomis gibbosus) are known to be effective predators of mollusks, but bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus) do not generally prey heavily on mollusks. Analysis of stomach contents of pumpkinseeds and bluegills collected from Presque Isle Bay of Lake Erie (Erie, Pennsylvania) revealed considerable differences in the diets of the two species. Specifically, dreissenids were the most important food item in the diet of pumpkinseeds and composed 63% of the volume of their diet. In contrast, dreissenids were relatively unimportant in the diet of bluegills and composed only 2.3% of the volume of their diet. Although bluegills and pumpkinseeds differed considerably in their consumption of dreissenids and other prey items, no clear differences in PCB concentrations were detected between the two species. Thus bluegills must acquire most of their PCBs from prey other than dreissenids.																			0380-1330						2005	31	4					397	404		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70271-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70271-9													WOS:000234491200003

Compared to published data, the growth of R. rutilus and G. cernuus was about average, while that of P. fluviatilis was below average. Comparing to literature, the fecundity of R. rutilus and G. cernuus was low but their oocytes were large. In contrast, P. fluviatilis had a high fecundity but small oocytes. At the end of summer, an abrupt decrease in the condition was recorded only for perch, probably due to stress as a result of environmental conditions. The sex-ratio was in favour of females for the three studied species but, in contrast to G. cernuus, the sex-ratio of R. rutilus and P. fluviatilis increased significantly also with age. It is concluded that Lake Aydat is a more favourable environment for R. rutilus and G. cernuus than for P.fluviatilis.

At present, half of it is covered by Phragmites australis which developed after the lake fell dry for the last time in 1868. Due to its astatic character, with about 100-200 dry periods since the lake came into existence, most of the sediment of the open lake overlying a thick Tertiary layer presents a mixture of terrestrial and lacustrine components. Because of disturbance by wind, this lacks stratification. Preliminary investigations, however, demonstrated that within the fringing Phragmites belt - especially landward - such a stratification does still exist. In order to learn more about the history of the lake 18 deep freeze cores of between 135 and 190 cms in depth, were collected from the Phragmites belt and investigated for chemical data (see Gunatilaka, this volume) and the succession of ostracods. Most of the cores contain Tertiary material (foraminifera and ostracods) at their base, followed by a cold water fauna as indicated by the presence of Cytherissa lacustris. Indicators of high alkalinity (i.e. the remains of male Limnocythere inopinata and high salinity (Hetereocypris salina) were found in only a few cores.																			0018-8158					MAY 31	1991	214						229	238		10.1007/BF00050955	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00050955													WOS:A1991FX93500031

However, the 'Marmara Transition Zone' in northwest Turkiye, a region of significant societal transformation, lacks high-resolution pre-industrial climate records. Continuous paleoclimate reconstructions are critical to reveal the nature and pattern of Late Holocene hydroclimatic changes and extremes, and to study their impacts on societies. Here, we present a precisely dated and sub-decadal resolution speleothem record from Uzuntarla cave, located near to Istanbul (historically Byzantium and Constantinople), that shows sensitivity to cold-season rainfall amount and seasonality for the Late Holocene. Prior to 2005 CE, stalagmite U-1 reveals two periods of high multidecadal variability of cold-seasonal rainfall in similar to 1900-400 BCE and similar to 690-1900 CE, separated by a relatively stable phase. This variability aligns with the rise and fall of Byzantine agrarian productivity between similar to 350 and 1250 CE, while the most pronounced aridification anomaly in similar to 1210-1170 BCE coincides with the collapse of the Hittite Empire (c. similar to 1200 BCE), partly linked to regional famine and drought. Our findings indicate that the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Iron Age in the Marmara Transition Zone was marked by a pronounced shift in the regional climate regime. Namely, that a previously warmer and more stable 'Mediterranean-style' climate shifted toward cooler conditions characterised by increased rainfall variability, and a greater influence of moisture sourced from the Black Sea. Therefore, we suggest that cold-seasonal rains played a critical role in shaping human-climate interactions, power dynamics, and social stability in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Holocene. This record offers valuable context for understanding how hydroclimate variability influenced past societies, highlighting the importance of climate as a driver in historical societal resilience and collapse.

Pollen, diatoms, chironomids and selected geochemical parameters were analysed and the sediment record was dated with radiocarbon. The study shows Holocene changes in the terrestrial vegetation as well as responses of the lake ecosystern to catchment maturity and multiple stressors, such as climate change and volcanic eruptions. Climate change is the major driving force resulting in the recorded environmental changes in the lake, although recurrent tephra deposition events also contributed. The sediment record has an age at the base of about 10,000 cal yrs BP, and during the first 400 years the climate was cold and the lake exhibited extensive ice-cover during winter and relatively low primary production. Soils in the catchment were poor with shrub alder and birches dominating the vegetation surrounding the lake. At about 9600-8900 cal yrs BP the climate was cold and moist, and strong seasonal wind stress resulted in reduced ice-cover and increased primary production. After ca. 8900 cal yrs BP the forest density increased around the lake, runoff decreased in a generally drier climate resulting in decreased primary production in the lake until ca. 7000 cal yrs BP. This generally dry climate was interrupted by a brief climatic perturbation, possibly attributed to the 8.2 ka event, indicating increasingly windy conditions with thick snow cover, reduced ice-cover and slightly elevated primary production in the lake. The diatom record shows maximum thermal stratification at ca. 6300-5800 cal yrs BP and indicates together with the geochemical proxies a dry and slightly warmer climate resulting in a high productive lake. The most remarkably change in the catchment vegetation occurred at ca. 4200 cal yrs BP in the form of a conspicuous increase in Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila), indicating a shift to a cooler climate with a thicker and more long-lasting snow cover. This vegetational change was accompanied by marked shifts in the diatom and chironomid stratigraphies, which are also indicative of colder climate and more extensive ice-cover. (C) 2015 The Authors.

J	FINNEY, BP; JOHNSON, TC				FINNEY, BP; JOHNSON, TC			SEDIMENTATION IN LAKE MALAWI (EAST-AFRICA) DURING THE PAST 10,000 YEARS - A CONTINUOUS PALEOCLIMATIC RECORD FROM THE SOUTHERN TROPICS	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A suite of piston cores recovered from Lake Malawi (9-14-degrees-S, 34-35-degrees-E), east Africa in 1986 has been analyzed for major and minor elements, organic C and N. calcium carbonate and diatoms. An internally consistent stratigraphy was constructed from calcium carbonate abundance and variations in the two most abundant diatom genera, Stephanodiscus and Melosira, with age control obtained primarily from C-14 dating of the carbonate. Differences with time in Fe abundance in a transect of cores from different water depths have been interpreted to reflect changes in chemocline depth. The depth to the chemocline was on the order of 100 m shallower than present prior to 3500 yr B.P., indicating less seasonality. Carbonate production and preservation appears to be related to climatically induced changes in both salinity and chemical distributions in the water column. The carbonate, which precipitates from surface waters, is most abundant during the interval from about 10,000 to 6000 yr B.P. This micrite most likely represents periods of low lake level when salinity increased and carbonate precipitation was enhanced. Sedimentary evidence suggests that lake levels were 100-150 m lower than present during this period. This record is different from climatic trends in northern intertropical Africa, but appears to also be related to changes in insolation and monsoon circulation. This is the northernmost basin in Africa reported to exhibit a "southern hemisphere" response to the early Holocene northern hemisphere summer insolation maximum. The climatic hingeline north of Lake Malawi (approximately 9-degrees-S) implied by our results is significantly south of that indicated by general-circulation model simulations, however. The cores show evidence for periods of abrupt climate change during the interval or generally arid climate.					; Johnson, Thomas/C-1423-2010	Johnson, Thomas/0000-0003-4630-6788; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				JUN	1991	85	3-4					351	366		10.1016/0031-0182(91)90167-P	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(91)90167-P													WOS:A1991GA44800013

Definite diagnosis of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia infected farmed rainbow trout and histopathologic study of acutely diseased fish in Iran	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) is one of the most important viral diseases in rainbow trout that has caused great losses to the Iranian rainbow trout aquaculture industry in few recent years. In the early autumn of 2015, in order to identify the possible causes of loss, farmed fish were sampled from the epicenter where massive mortalities and economic losses had occurred. Three samples were collected from relevant tissues (i.e. liver, kidney, spleen, heart, and brain) of the rainbow trout with clinical signs of VHS disease. The samples were stored in 70% ethanol, Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) and 10% formalin to perform RT-PCR, cell-culture and histopathology examinations, respectively. A virus was isolated using fish cell lines inoculated with a homogenate of the internal organs. Sequencing analysis of truncated N gene confirmed the existence of VHS virus. RT-PCR and histopathology tests indicated the suitability and simplicity of the test as a paraclinical diagnostic method for VHS virus in the region. Haemorrhage, necrosis and other changes in histological sections of the diseased fish demonstrated pathological changes identical with the typical VHS pathology in target organ of the virus (i.e. heart, spleen, liver and kidney). To our knowledge, this is one the first studies that fully focused on the identification of VHSV from farmed trout in Iran by using histopathology examinations.					; Rezaie, Annahita/AAK-5990-2020; Peyghan, Rahim/AAA-3850-2022; Shapouri, Masoud/AAH-7999-2021	seyfi abad shapouri, masoud reza/0000-0002-3284-1651; 													1562-2916						2020	19	3					1556	1572		10.22092/ijfs.2019.118390	http://dx.doi.org/10.22092/ijfs.2019.118390													WOS:000548350300037

Acigol (Denizli, Turkey), which is a suitable habitat for flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber), is a lake that is affected by seasonal anomalies as a result of being shallow. ADO, which is fed by precipitation, groundwater and the springs that occur along tectonic faults, has no water output other than evaporation and industrial activities. In addition to natural factors, it is important to determine the changes in the wetlands of Acrgol, where industrial salt is produced, in order to reveal the micro-ecological equilibrium, the relationship between climate and natural life, and regulation of industrial activities. Remote sensing tools are frequently used in determination of changes in wetlands. Changes in coastlines, water level and area covered by water are parameters that can be examined by remote sensing while investigating wetlands. In this study, the water-covered area was examined using remote sensing. Within the scope of this study, CHRIS/Proba Mode 2 (water bandset) hyperspectral satellite images, acquired on 9/17/2011 for the season and on 6/18/2012 - 6/19/2012 for wet season, were used in order to present the seasonal changes in Acigol, during one hydrogeological period. The processes of noise reduction, cloud screening, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and identification of wetlands have been implemented on the CHRIS/Proba images. In determining the water-covered areas, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used. It was determined that W6 (560 nm) and W18 (1015 nm) and W2 (447 nm) and W18 (1015 nm) band combinations were most appropriate to be used in NDWI to demonstrate the water-land separation. Using Proba-NDWI image, it was established that an area of 27.4 km(2) was covered with water during dry season, and 61.2 km(2) was covered during wet season. The results indicated that; since the lake water area is directly affected by seasonal and annual climatic anomalies, water used by industrial facilities has to be drawn out of the lake in reasonable amount.

Warming-induced destabilization of peat plateau/thermokarst lake complexes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Peat plateaus are widespread at high northern latitudes and are important soil organic carbon reservoirs. A warming climate can cause either increased ground subsidence (thermokarst) resulting in lake formation or increased drainage as the permafrost thaws. A better understanding of spatiotemporal variations in these landforms in relation to climate change is important for predicting the future thawing permafrost carbon feedback. In this study, dynamics in thermokarst lake extent during the last 35-50 years has been quantified through time series analysis of aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite images (IKONOS/QuickBird) in three peat plateau complexes, spread out across the northern circumpolar region along a climatic and permafrost gradient. From the mid-1970s until the mid-2000s there has been an increase in mean annual air temperature, winter precipitation, and ground temperature in all three study areas. The two peat plateaus located in the continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, respectively, where mean annual air temperatures are below -5 degrees C and ground temperatures are -2 degrees C or colder, have experienced small changes in thermokarst lake extent. In the peat plateau located in the sporadic permafrost zone where the mean annual air temperature is around -3 degrees C, and the ground temperature is close to 0 degrees C, lake drainage and infilling with fen vegetation has been extensive and many new thermokarst lakes have formed. In a future progressively warmer and wetter climate permafrost degradation can cause significant impacts on landscape composition and greenhouse gas exchange also in areas with extensive peat plateaus, which presently still experience stable permafrost conditions.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				SEP 15	2011	116								G03035	10.1029/2010JG001635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JG001635													WOS:000295130400002
J	Haack, SK; Fogarty, LR; Wright, C				Haack, SK; Fogarty, LR; Wright, C			Escherichia coli and enterococci at beaches in the Grand Traverse Bay, Lake Michigan: Sources, characteristics, and environmental pathways	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This study quantified Escherichia coli(EC) and enterococci (ENT) in beach waters and dominant source materials, correlated these with ambient conditions, and determined selected EC genotypes and ENT phenotypes. Bathing-water ENT criteria were exceeded more frequently than EC criteria, providing conflicting interpretations of water quality. Dominant sources of EC and ENT were bird feces (10(8)/d/bird), storm drains (10(7)/d), and river water (10(11)/d); beach sands, shallow groundwater and detritus were additional sources. Beach-water EC genotypes and ENT phenotypes formed clusters with those from all source types, reflecting diffuse inputs. Some ENT isolates had phenotypes similar to those of human pathogens and/or exhibited high-level resistance to human-use antibiotics. EC and ENT concentrations were influenced by collection time and wind direction. There was a 48-72-h lag between rainfall and elevated EC concentrations at three southern shoreline beaches, but no such lag at western and eastern shoreline beaches, reflecting the influence of beach orientation with respect to cyclic (3-5 d) summer weather patterns. In addition to local contamination sources and processes, conceptual or predictive models of Great Lakes beach water quality should consider regional weather patterns, lake hydrodynamics, and the influence of monitoring method variables (time of day, frequency).																			0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 1	2003	37	15					3275	3282		10.1021/es021062n	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es021062n								12966970					WOS:000184501900029
J	Chu, HB; Wei, JH; Wang, R; Xin, BD				Chu, Haibo; Wei, Jiahua; Wang, Rong; Xin, Baodong			Characterizing the interaction of groundwater and surface water in the karst aquifer of Fangshan, Beijing (China)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Correct understanding of groundwater/surface-water (GW-SW) interaction in karst systems is of greatest importance for managing the water resources. A typical karst region, Fangshan in northern China, was selected as a case study. Groundwater levels and hydrochemistry analyses, together with isotope data based on hydrogeological field investigations, were used to assess the GW-SW interaction. Chemistry data reveal that water type and the concentration of cations in the groundwater are consistent with those of the surface water. Stable isotope ratios of all samples are close to the local meteoric water line, and the H-3 concentrations of surface water and groundwater samples are close to that of rainfall, so isotopes also confirm that karst groundwater is recharged by rainfall. Cross-correlation analysis reveals that rainfall leads to a rise in groundwater level with a lag time of 2 months and groundwater exploitation leads to a fall within 1 month. Spectral analysis also reveals that groundwater level, groundwater exploitation and rainfall have significantly similar response periods, indicating their possible inter-relationship. Furthermore, a multiple nonlinear regression model indicates that groundwater level can be negatively correlated with groundwater exploitation, and positively correlated with rainfall. The overall results revealed that groundwater level has a close correlation with groundwater exploitation and rainfall, and they are indicative of a close hydraulic connection and interaction between surface water and groundwater in this karst system.					; Wei, Jiahua/AAA-8543-2019	Wei, Jiahua/0000-0003-1387-6442; 													1431-2174	1435-0157				MAR	2017	25	2					575	588		10.1007/s10040-016-1507-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-016-1507-7													WOS:000395001300019

Our findings indicate that micropollutants such as perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) can be transported via dual-source water diversion projects during water diversion and flood discharge, which may negatively impact both receiving water bodies. However, the sources, spatiotemporal variations, and fluxes of PFAAs under water diversion projects remain unclear. Here we report patterns of 18 PFAA compounds in the surface water at 14 sites of a dual-source water diversion project (Wangyu River) connecting the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake in China. We found multiple contamination hotspots with PFHxA and PFOA dominantly originating from industrial and domestic sources during water diversion from the Yangtze River to Taihu Lake. During the severe flooding in summer 2020, PFAA concentrations ranged from 82.0 to 114.0 ng L-1, while the concentrations and relative contributions of individual perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) increased along the mainstream due to the tributaries' contribution and high contamination level in the lake. Based on the spatiotemporal patterns of PFAA pollution, the flux of total PFAAs including both dissolved-phase and SS-phase into Taihu Lake was estimated as 26.6 kg in January 2020 as a reference value for water diversion. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the sources, occurrences, and transport of PFAAs in a dual-source water diversion project during water diversion and flooding. The results provide a novel perspective regarding the ecological safety of dual-source water diversion projects.

Radiation induced effects on viability and antioxidant enzymes of crustaceans from different habitats	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												The paper describes differential tolerance of two fresh water crustaceans Mesocyclops hyalinus and Allodiaptomus satanus to Co-50 gamma radiation. Mesocyclops hyalinus is dominant species at site 1, near a Thermal Power Plant at Kolaghat East Midnapore where fly ash deposition is a regular phenomenon. Allodiaptomus satanus is dominant species at site 2 at Kolkata, Ballygung where anthroponotic activities are more pronounced. M. hyalinus is naturally exposed to more stressful situation than A. satanus as revealed by comparing the hydrological parameters of the two habitats. Experimental exposure to ionizing radiation resulted in differential changes in viability morphology and antioxidant enzyme activities in the two selected species. Survival experiments showed greater tolerance of M. hyalinus compared to A. satanus up to 8Gy (absorbed dose) after which it showed drastic fall in survival More pronounced morphological changes were observed in A. satanus as compared to that in M. hyalinus. The pattern of changes in antioxidant enzyme activity is distinctly opposite in the two radiation exposed species. While in M. hyalinus stimulation in activity of both CAT (excepting at 10Gy absorbed dose) and SOD was observed A. satanus showed decrease in activity of both the enzymes when compared to their unirradiated counterparts.					selvaraj, Subhashini/W-6789-2019; Mukherjee, Dipanwita/AAR-3911-2021														0254-8704					MAY	2010	31	3					251	254											21046991					WOS:000277588800002
J	Grenfell, TC; Perovich, DK				Grenfell, TC; Perovich, DK			Seasonal and spatial evolution of albedo in a snow-ice-land-ocean environment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] In the course of a program studying Arctic coastal processes we have investigated the albedos for the range of surfaces in the region and their response to seasonal changes in a land-ice-ocean regime near Barrow, Alaska. From April through June in the years 2000, 2001, and 2002, spectral and wavelength-integrated albedos were measured along 200-m survey lines. These lines were installed at four sites and included sea ice, lagoon ice, fresh ice, and tundra. Initially, all sites were completely snow-covered, and the albedo was high (0.8 - 0.85) and spatially uniform. The concentration of absorptive contaminants in the snow was enough to produce a slight reduction below the pure snow values. As the melt season progressed, albedos decreased at all sites. The decrease was greatest and most rapid at the tundra site, where the albedo dropped from 0.8 to 0.15 in only 2 weeks. The spectral signature also changed as the wavelength of maximum albedo at the tundra site shifted from 500 nm for snow to 1100 nm for vegetation. As the snow cover melted, there was rapid and extensive ponding, resulting in a decrease of the spatially averaged, wavelength-integrated albedo from 0.6 to 0.2 in only 5 days. Extensive pond drainage and below-freezing temperatures caused the albedo to rebound briefly to 0.55 before resuming a steady decrease. Comparison of these results with data collected in the centralArctic show that albedos of fast ice in the coastal regime evolve significantly faster than pack ice albedos. Interannual seasonal variations showed additional melting phases that might be expected during protracted warming. The albedo evolution in the coastal lagoon was different each of the 3 years because of variations in sediment loading of the ice during freeze-up and in the melt/ freeze pattern the following spring. The record early melt in May 2002 followed by a pronounced freezing event 2 weeks later produced a distinct melt regime that gave rise to reduced melt pond coverage and higher albedo. Such events provide insight into processes associated with the melt ponds that will be important for modeling sea ice in a warming climate.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				JAN 2	2004	109	C1							C01001	10.1029/2003JC001866	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003JC001866													WOS:000188284100001

Community science to the rescue: capturing water quality data during the COVID-19 pandemic	FACETS												In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted all aspects of human activity, including environmental research and monitoring. Despite a lack of laboratory access and other restrictive measures, we adapted an existing community science monitoring program to continue through the summer of 2020. We worked with local community groups to recruit 58 volunteers who collected lake water samples from 60 sites on 16 lakes in south-central Ontario from June to September 2020. We organized drop-off depots and had volunteers freeze samples to monitor nearshore nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) and chlorophylla. A survey was distributed to volunteers to analyze lake-front property owners' activities during the pandemic. We found spatial patterns in nearshore water quality across the lakes, with sub-watershed development being a significant predictor of nutrients and chlorophyll-a. Additionally, pre-pandemic (2019) and pandemic (2020 and 2021) nutrient concentrations were compared, but there was no clear impact of the pandemic on nearshore nutrient concentrations, despite changes in lake-front property owners activities. Overall, this study demonstrated the ability of community science to provide water quality data on a large spatial scale despite a major societal disruption, providing insight into regional nutrient trends during the first year of the pandemic.

Comparative microscopic analysis of cyanobacterial morphology (n = 36) was performed during the formation period (W-1), stationary period (W-2), decline period (W-3) and decomposition period (W-4). Simultaneously, sequence analysis was performed on microbial 16S rRNA genes in sediments (n = 36) by high-throughput sequencing. The coverage of the sequencing library was very high (100%) indicating that the sequencing results well represented the microbes present in samples, among which the species richness in W-4 was the highest, while the species distribution uniformity was low. The microbial abundance distribution in all four periods showed that Firmicutes (33.45%), Cyanobacteria (30.44%), Proteobacteria (27.17%) and Bacteroidetes (7.2%) were the dominant flora, with W-1 dominated by Cyanobacteria, W-2 dominated by Firmicutes, W-3 dominated by Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, and W-4 dominated by Proteobacteria. There were significant differences in microbial species abundance and distribution observed during each cyanobacterial bloom period and synchronous microorganisms in the sediment regulated bacterial abundance and distribution through signal transduction of various proteases. The findings of this study help to establish the impact of cyanobacteria blooms on the sediment environment and benefit the comprehensive assessment of hazard presented by cyanobacteria to the aquatic environment.

Since the mobility of many metals decrease with increasing pH of the water, application of lime directly into the lake might increase metal deposition to the sediments. The aim of this project is to investigate the difference in metal deposition to the sediments in limed and non-limed lakes. Surface sediments from 11 limed and 10 non-limed lakes were collected during the summers of 1998 and 1999 and analysed for a number of elements (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, V and Zn). With reference to treatment method or acidification status, the lakes were divided into four sub-groups and the weighted mean areal metal burdens were statistically compared. Generally, the highest metal burdens were found in the surface limed group and the lowest burdens were found in the acidified reference group. Potential factors influencing the metal deposition were also evaluated by a multivariate analysis (PLS). The PLS indicated that liming is an important factor for the deposition of metals to lake sediments.																			1155-4339					MAY	2003	107		2				1349	1351		10.1051/jp4:20030551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/jp4:20030551													WOS:000183782500149

However, limited is known about the benthic algal community distribution and how they are influenced by geographic distance and environmental variables in alpine lakes. Here, we investigated the benthic algal community compositions in the surface sediments of six lakes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), China (salinity ranging from 0.8 to 365.6 g/L; pairwise geographic distance among the studied lakes ranging 8-514 km) employing an integrated approach including Illumina-Miseq sequencing and environmental geochemistry. The results showed that the algal communities of the studied samples were mainly composed of orders of Bacillariales, Ceramiales, Naviculales, Oscillatoriales, Spirulinales, Synechococcales, and Vaucheriales. The benthic algal community compositions in these QTP lakes were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with many environmental (e.g., dissolved inorganic and organic carbon, illumination intensity, total nitrogen and phosphorus, turbidity and water temperature) and spatial factors, and salinity did not show significant influence on the benthic algal community structures in the studied lakes. Furthermore, geographic distance showed strong, significant correlation (r = 0.578, p < 0.001) with the benthic algal community compositions among the studied lakes, suggesting that spatial factors may play important roles in influencing the benthic algal distribution. These results expand our current knowledge on the influencing factors for the distributions of benthic alga in alpine lakes.					; Liu, Wen/AAG-5987-2020; Wang, Beichen/GPT-1709-2022; Jiang, Hongchen/Y-9471-2018; Yang, Jian/LWI-5747-2024	Yang, Jian/0000-0003-4019-3671; Liu, Wen/0000-0002-1902-506X; Jiang, Hongchen/0000-0003-1271-7028; 													1664-302X					MAR 27	2018	9								578	10.3389/fmicb.2018.00578	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00578								29636745					WOS:000428401100002

The sediment and soil samples were collected from the river and drainage basin. Results showed that: (1) the particle size of the sand fraction of the sediments was 78-697 Am, accounting for 78.82% of the total samples; the average concentrations of eight heavy metals fell within the concentration ranges recommended by the Secondary National Standard of China, while the maximum concentrations of Pb, Cd, and Hg exceeded these standards; (2) results from multivariate statistical analysis indicated that Cu, Ni, As, and Zn originated primarily from natural geological background, while Cd, Pb, Hg and Cr in the sediments originated from human activities; (3) results of the enrichment factor analysis and the geo-accumulation index evaluation showed that Cd, Hg, and Pb were present in the surface sediments of the river at low or partial serious pollution levels, while Zn, Cr, As, Ni, and Cu existed at zero or low pollution levels; (4) calculation of the potential ecological hazards index showed that among the eight tested heavy metals, Cd, Pb, Hg, and Cr were the main potential ecological risk factors, with relative contributions of 25.43%, 22.23%, 21.16%, and 14.87%, respectively; (5) the spatial distribution of the enrichment factors (EFs), the Geo-accumulation index (I,), and the potential ecological risk coefficient (V) for eight heavy metals showed that there was a greater accumulation of heavy metals Pb, Cd, and Hg in the sediments of the central and eastern parts of the river. Results of this research can be a reference for the heavy metals pollution prevention, the harmony development of the ecology protection and the economy development of the oases of inland river basin of arid regions of China, Central Asia and also other parts of the world.

Effects of nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton in an alpine lake, Colorado, USA	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Deposition of atmospheric nitrogen from urban and agricultural sources has caused surface water nitrate concentrations to increase in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. To investigate the effects of sustained increases in nitrate concentrations on phytoplankton dynamics in an alpine lake, we conducted nutrient enrichment experiments in mesocosms amended with nitrate, phosphate, and phosphate plus nitrate on four dates in July and August 2002. During this period, phytoplankton species composition shifted as diatoms decreased in abundance. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a increased in the phosphate and phosphate plus nitrate enrichments, but did not increase in the nitrate only enrichments. Analysis of the phytoplankton community using Principal Component Analysis showed that 34% of the variance was accounted for by the primary axis, which was associated with different time periods, and 21% of the variance was explained by the secondary axis, which was associated with treatments. The response to phosphorus enrichment was taxon-specific, and the two chlorophyte species which became more abundant, Chlamydomonas sp. and Scenedesmus sp., were strongly weighted on the secondary axis. These results indicate that the productivity of this phytoplankton community is phosphorus-limited throughout the summer. Therefore, additional inputs of nitrogen are not expected to directly alter the productivity of the phytoplankton community.					; Miller, Matthew/A-4928-2016	MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533; Miller, Matthew/0000-0002-2537-1823													1523-0430	1938-4246				FEB	2008	40	1					55	64		10.1657/1523-0430(07-002)[GARDNER]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(07-002)[GARDNER]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000252869000006
J	SCHELSKE, CL				SCHELSKE, CL			HISTORICAL NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT OF LAKE-ONTARIO - PALEOLIMNOLOGICAL EVIDENCE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Recent studies of Lake Ontario show four periods of nutrient enrichment that can be identified from the sediment record in this phosphorus-limited system: pristine phosphorus loads (early 1800s before European settlement), moderate increase in phosphorus loading after settlement (beginning approximately 1850), exponential increase in phosphorus loading from urban sources (approximately 1940-70), and decreased phosphorus loading as the result of phosphorus abatement strategies (beginning in mid-1970s). Paleolimnological data are used to infer new paradigms about historical dynamics and cycling of major nutrients. The temporal pattern of organic carbon production closely parallels changes in phosphorus loading. Silica supplies which were replete for diatom production before forest clearance in the mid-1800s became limiting for diatom production in the summer epilimnion after 1865 and in the water column after 1950. Silica reserves were depleted by increased diatom production and sedimentation that resulted from increased phosphorus loading. Biologically induced precipitation of calcite began after 1940 as an indirect effect of increased urban phosphorus loading on primary productivity. Calcite began to be precipitated when historical increases in CO2 utilized for primary productivity increased epilimnetic pH and the calcium carbonate saturation product was exceeded.																			0706-652X					AUG	1991	48	8					1529	1538		10.1139/f91-181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-181													WOS:A1991GC70700021

Vertical Profiles of Ozone Concentrations in the Lower Troposphere Downwind of New York City During LISTOS 2018-2019	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												While surface concentrations of ozone are routinely monitored, ozone aloft is infrequently measured, but critical for a full understanding of ozone production and transport. In this study, twenty-six balloon-borne ozonesondes were launched near the north shore of central Long Island in the summers of 2018 and 2019 as part of the Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS). The observed vertical ozone profiles are presented and analyzed with additional data sources and modeling tools, including lidar wind profiles from the New York State Mesonet, back trajectories based on 3 km resolution high-resolution rapid refresh model data, and surface data, aircraft observations, sonde, and ozone lidar measurements from other LISTOS participants. Special attention is given to the region of interest for ozone pollution in the lower troposphere, from the surface to 2 km altitude. Cases analyzed in detail illustrate events with high ozone levels observed in the lower troposphere, often with pronounced vertical structure in the profile. Specifically, easily discernible layers are identified with ozone excursions of up to 40 ppb over short vertical distances. Analysis indicates that synoptic and local meteorological processes can combine to generate the observed vertical profiles. Hot, sunny days with high-pressure systems are accompanied by high precursor emissions due to increased power demands, plentiful radiation for photochemistry, and stagnation of synoptic winds. Under these conditions, meso- and smaller-scale flows like low-level jets and sea/bay/land breeze circulations may dominate synoptic flow to produce shearing and the complex vertical layered structure observed.					; Shrestha, Bhupal/GOP-1020-2022; Zhang, Jie/ABE-9530-2020; Schwab, Margaret/CAG-4711-2022; Schwab, Janie/CAG-4711-2022	Gronoff, Guillaume/0000-0002-0331-7076; Knepp, Travis/0000-0003-0326-029X; Lu, Cheng-hsuan/0000-0001-9960-5584; Shrestha, Bhupal/0000-0003-1459-0788; Couillard, Maxim/0000-0002-1973-8318; Schwab, Janie/0000-0002-0318-201X; Schwab, James/0000-0003-1343-4695; Zhang, Jie/0000-0003-2935-9220													2169-897X	2169-8996				DEC 16	2021	126	23							e2021JD035108	10.1029/2021JD035108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JD035108													WOS:000729996000012

The Peace-Athabasca Delta in northern Alberta, Canada, is a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance reliant on episodic river ice-jam flood events to recharge abundant perched lakes and wetlands. Improved and systematic monitoring of landscape-scale hydrological connectivity among freshwater ecosystems (rivers, channels, wetlands, and lakes) is needed to guide stewardship decisions in the face of climate change and upstream industrial development. Here, we use water isotope compositions, supplemented by measurements of specific conductivity and field observations, from 68 lakes and 9 river sites in May 2018 to delineate the extent and magnitude of spring ice-jam induced flooding along the Peace and Athabasca rivers. Lake-specific estimates of input water isotope composition (delta(I)) were modelled after accounting for influence of evaporative isotopic enrichment. Then, using the distinct isotopic signature of input water sources, we develop a set of binary mixing models and estimate the proportion of input to flooded lakes attributable to river floodwater and precipitation (snow or rain). This approach allowed identification of areas and magnitude of flooding that were not captured by other methods, including direct observations from flyovers, and to demarcate flow pathways in the delta. We demonstrate water isotope tracers as an efficient and effective monitoring tool for delineating spatial extent and magnitude of an important hydrological process and elucidating connectivity in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, an approach that can be readily adopted at other floodplain landscapes.

Estimating evaporation in semi-arid areas facing data scarcity: Example of the El Haouareb dam (Merguellil catchment, Central Tunisia)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The El Haouareb dam (Merguellil catchment) in central Tunisia, which is typical of semi-arid environments. Study focus: Most estimates of evaporation from water bodies located in semi-arid environments suffer from the lack of data, or biased field measurements. It is thus important for hydrologists to assess the relative performance of the various available methods used to estimate this water loss, as well as their uncertainties. We confronted physical approaches based on contrasted theoretical formulae (Dalton, simplified BREB, Penman) and geochemical approaches based on mass conservation (stable isotopes and chloride). We compared the results with Colorado pan measurements, and tested the methods' sensitivity to various physical parameters and data gaps. New hydrological insights for the region: In this region, where mean annual rainfall is 300 mm, estimates of evaporation of the El Haouareb Dam lake ranged from 1400 to 1900 mm a(-1), depending on the method and the year. The Penman approach was found to be the most robust and gave an annual mean of 1600 mm a(-1). Evaporation values were refined by combining results from the different methods. Mean interannual evaporation was estimated to be 1700 mm a(-1), with an uncertainty of 15%. From this work, we propose an annual Colorado pan conversion coefficient of 0.8 which can be adjusted, 1.0 for spring and 0.76 for the rest of the year. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Survival and behaviour of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) released from an experimental aquaculture operation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The potential for farmed fish that have escaped from open-cage aquaculture operations to affect native populations will depend on their survival and behaviour in the wild. We used standard commercial practices to rear 10 tonnes of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in a 23 ha lake at the Experimental Lakes Area (Ontario, Canada). Each fall (20032005), we released farmed rainbow trout (escapees) into the study lake and monitored their movements using automated positioning telemetry. Rainbow trout experienced high annual mortality (similar to 50%), with none surviving beyond 3 years. Farmed fish had narrowly defined pelagic distributions that comprised the upper few metres of the water column, even when at the cage site. Although released rainbow trout dispersed throughout the study lake, most spent significant portions of time at the cage site, especially during normal operation when commercial feed was available. Core use areas (50% Kernel) included the farm for half of the released fish. Surviving rainbow trout showed continued reliance upon the cage site in their second year. However, wide dispersal, high growth rate, and lack of reliance on the cage site by some escaped fish war-rant further research to assess potential effects of open-cage aquaculture in the water bodies where the industry occurs.

Photosynthesis, respiration, and stable isotopes of oxygen in a large oligotrophic lake (Lake Erie, USA-Canada)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, isotopic composition (O-18:16), and respiratory fractionation (alpha(r)) were measured in the east basin of Lake Erie to determine the patterns of planktonic photosynthesis ( P) and respiration ( R) and to assess a dual isotope, steady-state model for P/R ratios. Values of ar varied significantly between months but averaged close to a widely accepted norm for planktonic respiration (0.982). Isotope dynamics in situ predicted that 33%-53% of hypolimnetic oxygen consumption was by the sediments, consistent with previous knowledge. Except during fall turnover, DO was generally above, and O-18:16 below, atmospheric equilibrium in the surface mixed layer (SML), suggesting P/R is usually > 1 and agreeing with independent estimates by incubation experiments. P/R ratios calculated from the oxygen isotope model were often inconsistent with the DO and O-18:16 data, likely because of uncertainties in ar and nonsteady-state conditions in the SML. The autumnal transition to P/R < 1 was captured better in the DO and O-18:16 data than in the incubation experiments. Despite problems with the steady-state model, the isotope data were able to reveal spatial and temporal variations in lake metabolism and indicated a strong autochthonous basis for community metabolism in the SML.					; Smith, Ralph/F-3655-2010	Depew, David/0000-0003-2759-6759; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2008	65	11					2320	2331		10.1139/F08-134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F08-134													WOS:000261908500002

To know their role in the middle Loire where microalgae and rotifers can be numerous, the potamoplankton was studied fortnightly from June to October 1996, a period of low water flow. In 1996, excavation works has increased the suspended matter downstream, while chlorine was used upstream. The increase in dissolved oxygen, suspended matter, BOD5 and chlorophyll a, associated with the decrease in nutrients downstream, are typical of eutrophic rivers. Algae, with Chlorophytes and Bacillariophytes, were the principal components. Their density increased from the upper site to the lower, with respective maxima of 50.10(6) cells.l(-1) and 70.10(6) cells.l(-1). Following algal growth, a large ciliate community developed, with Oligotriches and Peritriches, with densities up to 6200 cells.l(-1) and 14 340 cells.l(-1) respectively. Simultaneously the rotifers increased, with Brachionids and Trichocercids up to 3610 ind.l(-1) and 1780 ind.l(-1) from upstream to downstream. In contrast to previous studies, their density decreased downstream, a consequence of excavation works. As in standing waters, the enrichment in organic matter is responsible for the increase in algae and bacteria consumers. The ratio of total heterotrophic to autotrophic biomass (WA ratio) decreased from 0.34 upstream to 0.17 downstream. Rotifers, whose downstream decrease, may be attributed to excavation works and was accentuated by invertebrate predation, were one of the causes of the increase of green algae at the lower site. The rotifer carbon biomass was globally higher than that of the ciliates; but from the end of summer, ciliates played an important role in the functioning of this lowland river.																			0003-4088						1998	34	1					35	48		10.1051/limn/1998004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1998004													WOS:000072955100004

The analyses indicate that most of the morphological features of this taxon are identical to Williamsella angusta Graeff, Kociolek & S.R. Rushforth, the type species of the genus Williamsella recently described from Blue Lake warm spring (Utah, USA). The criteria used to separate Williamsella from Fragilaria (i.e. the presence/absence of spines, the colonial formation, the preference for saline vs freshwater habitat, and the coverings of the areolae) are not supported and the genus is refuted. Instead the new combination Fragilaria crenophila comb. nov. is proposed for the Blue Lake species. The taxon from the Badain Jaran desert lakes represents a varietal population that is characterized by shorter valve length and lower stria density than the nominal variety, and is given the name Fragilaria crenophila var. sinensis. A discussion of the taxonomy, ecology and geographical distribution of this taxon is presented and a detailed comparison with Fragilaria asiatica Hustedt, a very similar species described from northern Tibet (China) is made.

However, the relationship between peatland initiation and climate controls is still poorly documented and understood. Understanding the responses of these C-rich ecosystems to past climate change will provide useful insights into projecting the fate of peatland C in the future. In this study, we present a detailed historical reconstruction of peatland development in northeast China based on 312 basal peat dates, and examine the relationship between Holocene peatland dynamics and climate sensitivity. Our results indicate that peatland initiation started in the early Holocene, and that the majority of peatlands were initiated by and developed during the late Holocene. After the most intensive initiation period of 4.2-0.8ka, the rate of peatland development slowed, which was concomitant with decreasing insolation and monsoon intensity. The widespread peatland initiation in the late Holocene might have been caused by the cool and moist climate patterns. The optimum timing of the peatland development was not uniform across northeast China, and these spatio-temporal differences indicate the influences of regional climate and terrain on peatland initiation. Peat-core data show variations in the long-term apparent rate of C accumulation (LORCA) during the Holocene, with an average rate of 37.2gCm(-2)a(-1). The peak LORCA occurred during 10.5-9.0ka, probably in response to higher temperatures and stronger East Asia summer monsoon intensities. Both temperature and humidity are important factors influencing the peatland initiation and C dynamics in this region.					; Guo, Wenyong/ABC-1030-2020; Wang, Guoping/A-8140-2008; Bao, Kunshan/HGC-3930-2022; Lu, Xianguo/AAL-2016-2021	Guo, Wenyong/0000-0002-4737-2042; Wang, Guoping/0000-0002-8350-812X; lu, xian guo/0000-0001-7638-2787; Xing, Wei/0000-0002-3484-2543													0300-9483	1502-3885				JUL	2015	44	3					575	587		10.1111/bor.12116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12116													WOS:000356626400009

Applying a reservoir functional-zone paradigm to littoral bluegills: differences in length and catch frequency?	PEERJ												Reservoirs exhibit gradients in conditions and resources along the transition from lotic to lentic habitat that may be important to bluegill ecology. The lotic-lentic gradient can be partitioned into three functional zones: the riverine, transitional, and lacustrine zones. We measured catch frequency and length of bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus) captured along the periphery of these areas (i.e., in the littoral zone of each functional zone) for four small reservoirs in Southeastern Ohio during the summer months of three years. Catch frequency differed between zones for two reservoirs, but these differences were not observed in other years. There was no relationship between reservoir zone and either standard length or catch frequency when the data for all reservoirs were pooled, but we did observe a bimodal length distribution in all reservoirs. A combination of ecological factors including inter and intraspecific competition, predation intensity, management practices, limnology, and assemblage complexity may be mitigating bluegill distribution and abundance in reservoirs. Therefore, a functional zone (categorical) approach to understanding bluegill ecology in reservoirs may not be appropriate.

Multiple risk factors associated with a large statewide increase in cryptosporidiosis	EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION												Cryptosporidium species have emerged as a major cause Of Outbreaks of diarrhoea and have been associated with consumption of contaminated recreational and drinking water and food as well as contact with infected attendees of child-care programmes. In August 2007, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment detected an increase in cryptosporidiosis cases over baseline values. We conducted a case-control study to assess risk factors for infection and collected stool specimens from ill persons for microscopy and molecular analysis. Laboratory-confirmed cases (n=47) were more likely to have swallowed untreated water from a lake, river, or stream [adjusted matched odds ratio (aOR) 8.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-48.1], have had exposure to recreational water (aOR 4.6, 95% CI 1.4-14.6), or have had contact with a child in a child-care programme or in diapers (aOR 3.8, 95% CI 1.5-9.6). Although exposure to recreational water is commonly implicated in summertime cryptosporidiosis outbreaks, this study demonstrates that investigations of increased incidence of cases in Summer should also examine other potential risk factors. This study emphasizes the need for public health education efforts that address the multiple transmission routes for Cryptosporidium and appropriate prevention measures to avoid future transmission.

J	Verweij, M				Verweij, M			Why is the river rhine cleaner than the great lakes (Despite looser regulation)?	LAW & SOCIETY REVIEW												In this article, I compare the efforts to protect two transboundary watersheds that are home to some of the largest industrial areas in the world: the Great Lakes basin in North America and the Rhine river in Western Europe. Specifically, I show that the industrial discharges into the Great Lakes have been more toxic than the releases into the Rhine. This is puzzling as the laws and international agreements pertaining to the Great Lakes have been more stringent than those concerning the Rhine. I solve this puzzle in three steps. First, I show that the many voluntary investments in water protection by companies along the Rhine have outdone the considerable efforts that the U.S. laws have required of Great Lakes corporations. Thereafter, I argue that these different inclinations to invest in water protection have sprung from two alternative modes of conducting environmental politics: an adversarial one in the Great Lakes basin and a more consensual one in the Rhine valley. Last, I use an historical-institutional approach to show which institutional differences (at both the domestic and international levels) have led to the emergence of these different modes of conducting environmental politics in the two basins.																			0023-9216						2000	34	4					1007	1054		10.2307/3115130	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3115130													WOS:000169037700005

After 11,000 B.P. organic-rich sediments were focused into the deeper parts of the basin, and no sediment accumulated in water < 5 m deep. Late-glacial particulate inorganic inputs were 33 times greater than modern losses from forested watersheds at Hubbard Brook. After trees became established, inorganic inputs fell sharply to modern levels. Late-glacial organic inputs were half the average during the last 11,000 yr. At 4 of the sites studied, accumulation rates reached a maximum between 7000 and 4000 B.P. The precise date varies from site, to site, suggesting that it would be misleading to link peak accumulation in a single core to events in the watershed. After 4000 B.P. organic sediment accumulation rates declined at all 4 sites. Parallel declines in accumulation rates of both pollen and inorganic sediments suggest that this decline is due to the process of sediment focusing rather than to a change in decomposition rates or in organic inputs related to autochthonous or allochthonous primary production.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	1					137	150		10.4319/lo.1982.27.1.0137	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.1.0137													WOS:A1982NA27100012

However, the data on such events are often insufficient for an objective evaluation of flooding characteristics such as their intensity. Therefore, we analyzed a C-14-dated sediment core recovered from near the Iinashi River mouth in Lake Nakaumi, western Japan, and reconstructed flooding records over the past 700 years from rock magnetism, grain-size distribution and sediment geochemistry. The sediment core contained three black layers, characterized by high magnetic susceptibility, low anhysteretic remanent magnetization to saturation isothermal remanent magnetization ratio, high total organic carbon (TOC) to total nitrogen ratio, and coarse mean grain size, which we identified as possible flooding event deposits. Moreover, the chemical index of alteration was low and the TOC to total sulfur ratio was high in these layers, indicating intensified erosion associated with more freshwater inflow due to the flood events. We tentatively correlated the three event deposits with historical floods along the Iinashi River in AD 1596, 1666 and 1826. The variations in rock magnetic and geochemical properties suggest that the flooding in AD 1666 may have been the least extreme of the events detected in the core.

The Glacier has been analysed using Corona KH-4B (1971), Landsat-TM (1999), field survey (2015), Google Earth (TM) (2015) and ASTER GDEM (2015) for frontal recession and area changes. Overall, from 1971 to 2015, the Glacier has retreated by 127 +/- 0.09 m i.e. (0.75 +/- 0.07%) at a rate of 2.9 +/- 0.004 ma(-1) with a simultaneous decrease in area from 49.5 to 48.8 km(2) i.e. 740 +/- 0.7 m(2) (1.5 +/- 0.09%) at a rate of 74 +/- 0.7 m(2)a(-1). However, during recent decade (1999-2015), the rate of glacier recession of 3.9 +/- 0.004 ma(-1) with a corresponding area loss of 500 +/- 0.74m(2) (1 +/- 0.1%) was higher than the retreat rate of 2.3 +/- 0.001 ma(-1) and an area loss of 240 +/- 0.02m(2) (0.48 +/- 0.08%) during 1971-1999. In the field, the evidences of glacier recession are present in the form of separated dead ice blocks from the main Glacier, recessional dumps/moraines, active ice calving activity and a small proglacial pond/lake at the terminus/snout of the Glacier. However, the recession over the studied period has been very slow and is controlled by its topographic configuration, particularly the large altitudinal range (6030-3620 m), almost northerly aspect and steep slope (average similar to 30 degrees).

A recently developed Bayesian hierarchical model that predicts peak bloom size as a function of Maumee River phosphorus load suggested an apparent increased susceptibility of the lake to HABs. We applied that model to develop load-response curves to inform revision of Lake Erie phosphorus load targets under the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. In this application, the model was modified to estimate the fraction of the particulate P (PP) load that becomes bioavailable, and it was recalibrated with additional bloom observations. Although the uncertainty surrounding the estimate of the bioavailable PP fraction is large, inclusion in the model improves prediction of bloom variability compared to dissolved reactive P (DRP) alone. The ability to characterize model and measurement uncertainty through hierarchical modeling allowed us to show that inconsistencies in bloom measurement represent a considerable portion of the overall uncertainty associated with load-response curves. The updated calibration also lends support to the system's apparent enhanced susceptibility to blooms. The temporal trend estimated by the model results in an upward shift of the load-response curve over time such that a larger load reduction is required to achieve a target bloom size today compared to earlier years. More research is needed to further test the hypothesis of a shift in the lake's response to stressors over time and, if confirmed, to explore underlying mechanisms.

Internal Structure and Geological Context of Ramparted Depressions, Llanpumsaint, Wales	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												In Europe, ramparted depressions have traditionally been interpreted as the relict forms of periglacial ground-ice mounds. In many cases, however, such interpretations have been based on limited subsurface evidence. We present detailed sedimentological and geophysical investigations of ramparted depressions from Llanpumsaint, Wales. These data are used to establish internal structure and to evaluate possible mechanisms for landform formation. Borehole and geophysical data have revealed a thick (similar to 30 m) sequence of glaciolacustrine sediments beneath the study site. The geological context (drainage of a large proglacial lake) would have been conducive to the formation of: (i) permafrost-related ground-ice mounds, at times when exposed frost-susceptible glaciolacustrine sediments were subject to permafrost aggradation; and (ii) craters associated with the in-situ meltout of blocks of glacier ice grounded in the lake during periods of falling water levels. Rampart deformation structures are consistent with both models, but units of sand and gravel within the ramparts favour a hypothesis that these landforms represent the collapsed remains of ground-ice mounds. This study highlights the importance of recognising and evaluating all possible (periglacial and non-periglacial) models for the development of ramparted depressions. We recommend that future studies carefully consider all possible mechanisms of formation, particularly where subsurface information is limited.

In inland systems of North America, toxic blooms have nearly eliminated fish populations in some systems. Modifying nutrient profiles through alterations to land or water use may be a viable alternative for golden alga control in reservoirs. The main objective of this study was to improve our understanding of the nutrient dynamics that influence golden alga bloom formation and toxicity in west Texas reservoirs. We examined eight sites in the Upper Colorado River basin, Texas: three impacted reservoirs that have experienced repeated golden alga blooms; two reference reservoirs where golden alga is present but nontoxic; and three confluence sites downstream of the impacted and reference sites. Total, inorganic, and organic nitrogen and phosphorus and their ratios were quantified monthly along with golden alga abundance and ichthyotoxicity between December 2010 and July 2011. Blooms persisted for several months at the impacted sites, which were characterized by high organic nitrogen and low inorganic nitrogen. At impacted sites, abundance was positively associated with inorganic phosphorus and bloom termination coincided with increases in inorganic nitrogen and decreases in inorganic phosphorus in late spring. Management of both inorganic and organic forms of nutrients may create conditions in reservoirs unfavorable to golden alga.

SOM from 26 basins of 11 Finnish lakes was analysed for quantity (sedimentation rates), quality (C:N:P stoichiometry) and origin (carbon stable isotopes, delta C-13). Hypolimnetic oxygen and temperature were measured from each site during summer stratification. Partial canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial regression analyses were used to quantify contributions of SOM, DO and TEMP to community composition and three macroinvertebrate metrics. The results suggested a major contribution of SOM in regulating the community composition and total biomass. Oxygen best explained the Shannon diversity, whereas TEMP had largest contribution to the variation of Benthic Quality Index. Community composition was most strongly related to delta C-13 of SOM. Based on additional delta C-13 and stoichiometric analyses of chironomid taxa, marked differences were apparent in their utilization of SOM and body stoichiometry; taxa characteristic of oligotrophic conditions exhibited higher C:N ratios and lower C:P and N:P ratios compared to the species typical of eutrophic lakes. The results highlight the role of SOM in regulating benthic communities and the distributions of individual species, particularly in oligotrophic systems.					; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011; Hämäläinen, Heikki/V-7868-2019	Hamalainen, Heikki/0000-0002-6856-1221; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2013	709	1					55	72		10.1007/s10750-012-1434-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1434-0													WOS:000317628300005

Comparative biodiversity of crustaceans and aquatic insects from various water body types in coastal Mediterranean wetlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes	JUN 05-09, 2005	Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS					Coastal wetlands are characterized by a high biodiversity. At the same time, biodiversity is one of the main criteria used to establish protection policy priorities, or to propose management actions. In this study, crustacean and aquatic insect species richness in the Emporda wetlands was investigated. These two groups contribute in an important way to the total biodiversity, and still they are seldom taken into account in the management of natural areas. Representative samples (38 points) of all aquatic water body types in the Emporda wetlands were taken monthly (dip net with 250 mu m mesh). Sampling was carried out between 1996 and 2000, but until present, only qualitative data have been extracted. A rich fauna of 125 crustacean taxa and 295 aquatic insect taxa were found. Some environments were characterized by low richness and high singularity (isolated artesian freshwater springs), some by high richness and high singularity (estuarine waters, brackish and meso-eutrophic freshwater wetlands), and others by low richness and low singularity (hypertrophic freshwater wetlands and hyperhaline wetlands). Factors determining singularity and richness are discussed. Comparison with crustacean richness of other western Mediterranean wetlands showed a similar high species richness in our study sites, probably due to high spatial heterogeneity of these areas.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												We collected zooplankton samples from 4x4 m enclosures located in two acidified lakes (pH<5) in Nova Scotia from June to August 1996. One lake had mean dissolved organic carbon concentrations greater than 10 mg l(-1) (brown water), while the other had values between 2 and 4 mg l(-1). In each lake, three enclosures were open to ambient light, while three were covered by Mylar(R) sheets which removed UVB and UVC wavelengths. Weekly sampling was done at all sites in July and near the end of August. Individuals were identified and the total community weighed. Analysis of results using both t-test and canonical analysis revealed small differences in populations between open and UVB covered clearwater sites in early July, but not later. There was no response of midsummer zooplankton communities in the humic lake which had a 95% extinction depth of 3 cm. In the clearwater lake (95% UVB extinction at 50 cm), the effect of radiation exclusion was relatively weak compared to most other published studies, but nevertheless statistically significant.

Since these altimetric measurements comprise of a large datasets and then are complicated to be used for our purposes, principal component analysis is adopted to reduce the complexity of large time series data analysis. Furthermore, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is applied for further analyzing and forecasting the time series. The ARIMA model is herein applied to the 1993-2006 time series of first principal component scores (sPC1). Subsequently, the remaining data acquired from sPC1 is used for verification of the model prediction results. According to our analysis, ARIMA (1,1,0)(0,1,1) model has been found as optimal representative model capable of predicting pattern of Caspian Sea level anomalies reasonably. The analysis of the time series derived by sPC1 reveals the evolution of Caspian Sea level pattern can be subdivided into five different phases with dissimilar rates of rise and fall for a 15-year time span.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2014	7	8					3339	3348		10.1007/s12517-013-1048-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-013-1048-5													WOS:000339817900029

The Invasion of the American Rotifer Kellicottia bostoniensis (Rousselet, 1908) (Rotifera: Brachionidae) into Vygozersky Reservoir (Republic of Karelia, Russia)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The American rotifer Kellicottia bostoniensis (Rousselet, 1908) has been found in the Vygozersky Reservoir, which is currently its northernmost habitat in Russia. The Vygozersky Reservoir is located at 63 degrees N and belongs to the White Sea catchment basin. It is a part of the White Sea-Baltic Canal. The first single individual of K. bostoniensis was noted in July 2007. In the summer of 2011, the rotifers were found in the pelagic zone of almost all lake regions, but were absent in the littoral zone and in the reservoir inflows. Rotifers occurred in all the areas of the reservoir in August 2017, and their abundance increased to 100-780 ind./m(3). The abundance of aboriginal species Kellicottia longispina (Kellicott, 1879) was 5-76 times greater than that of alien rotifer species in dependence on the environmental conditions. The rotifer invasion into the Vygozersky Reservoir could have occurred by bird migrations or water transport. The reservoir is a key area along the White Sea-Baltic Sea bird migration routes. At the same time, the reservoir is a part of the White Sea-Baltic Canal with active water transport traffic.

The fruits' physical attributes, physicochemical attributes, nutritional attributes, mineral content as well as consumers' acceptance were evaluated. The properties of the different water sources and their effect, on both the soil and the quality of the fruits, were evaluated. Analysis of the irrigation water revealed that treated waste water was of acceptable quality with reference to irrigation water quality guidelines, while the lake water used for irrigation fell short in several aspects. The different water sources used for irrigation in the farms affected the soil geochemical properties significantly. The quality of guavas harvested from the farms that were irrigated with different water sources was significantly different. Irrigation water qualities were observed to have positive effects on the quality of the fruits and consumers' acceptance as observed from the results of quality analysis and the consumers' acceptance test.

An original non-parametric image interpretation methodology was applied on late summer images. The combined GIS and statistical analysis of 217 coastal sections showed that the helophytic macrophyte belt, dominated by common reed (Phragmites australis), has rapidly widened during the last two decades, with an average expansion rate of 2.2 m per year. Statistical model revealed that the vicinity of large inflows had the strongest positive effect on the expansion of macrophytes, on average 1.6 times. In some sub-regions of the lake shore, we found the suppressing effect of the presence of small inflows on the change of helophytic belt width. This effect, however, was probably interconnected with the presence of human activity at the shoreline, which itself had statistically near-marginal suppressing effect on the widening of the reed belt. We showed that medium resolution satellite images can successfully be used for the retrospective monitoring of macrophyte vegetation in the littoral zone of large water bodies by applying very simple image classification methodology. As the lake coastal areas showed a tendency to become overgrown with reed and other macrophytes even in conditions of generally reduced agricultural intensity in the catchment area, we hypothesize that the clonal expansion of reed is probably triggered by the complex of drivers: large seasonal fluctuations in the water level create specific low water conditions in estuaries in combination with nutrients supply resolved from lake bottom or brought by rivers. Estuary areas are characterised by mineral sediments suitable for anchoring and protection-provision against destructive wave- and ice-action. Probably the most efficient biodiversity conservation policy to revealed macrophytic expansion is the reactivation of disrupted management activities along the coastline. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

Lake trout consumed significantly larger molluscs of all taxa than did round whitefish, and selected larger molluscs than were available on either rocky or soft-sediment habitats. Round whitefish were not size-selective on the snail Lymnaea, but were size-selective on the snail Valvata and on clams from the soft sediments. Round whitefish consumed fewer and smaller Lymnaea compared to lake trout. Because lake trout ate more Lymnaea and also tended to select larger, reproductive-sized individuals, this fish could potentially have a more detrimental impact on the Lymnaea population. Finally, differences in Lymnaea densities and size distributions between lakes with and without lake trout suggest that these fish may be responsible for the pattern of distribution, size, and density observed for Lymnaea in Toolik Lake and other area lakes.																			0018-8158					SEP 21	1992	240	1-3					225	233		10.1007/BF00013464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013464													WOS:A1992JQ94000019

Rods, single cones and twin cones constitute the visual cell layer which, together with the dense pigment layer, undergoes photomechanical changes common to most teleosts. Stages in the contraction and expansion of rods and cones, and the migration of pigments are depicted. In the laboratory, cultured sockeye salmon became well light-adapted in 20-25 minutes, whereas the time for dark-adaptation was of the order of 55-60 minutes. In the Lakelse River, a sample of natural-run sockeye and coho smolts was fully dark-adapted by about 10:00 p.m. when the light intensity at the water surface was 0.03 foot-candle. Pink and chum fry from Hooknose Creek were similarly dark-adapted by about 9.45 p.m. on an evening when the intensity had fallen below 0.002 foot-candle. At the start of evening migration retinal dark-adaptation in sockeye smolts had just started, whereas in pink and chum fry the retina was approximately half dark-adapted when migration commenced.																									1958	15	5					815	829		10.1139/f58-046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f58-046													WOS:A1958WZ01400007
J	ADAMS, WF				ADAMS, WF			RECENT CHANGES IN THE FRESH-WATER MOLLUSCAN FAUNA OF THE GREENFIELD LAKE BASIN, NORTH-CAROLINA	BRIMLEYANA												The molluscan fauna of the Greenfield Lake basin has undergone significant changes in recent years. In surveys conducted from January 1984 through October 1987, 16 species of mollusks [Campeloma decisum, Pseudosuccinea columella, Physella hendersoni, P. heterostropha, Gyraulus deflectus, G. parvus, Menetus dilitatus, Planorbella trivolvis, Helisoma anceps, Ferrissima fragilis, Rangia cuneata, Polymesoda carolinia, Anodonta cataracta, A. imbecilis, Musculium transversum, and Sphaerium occidentale] were found in the basin. Twelve of those species were recorded from the basin for the first time; 15 species previously recorded in the basin were not found. The most noticeable change was the almost total elimination of the Unionidae. Changes in the molluscan fauna of the Greenfield Lake basin have probably been caused by a combination of factors and events. Those agents of change are still at work today and undoubtedly keep the molluscan population of the lake from ever establising any type of equilibrium. Partial winter drawdowns are believed to be the most damaging aspect of the water management presently undertaken in the watershed. Pollution from non-point sources has probably also played a role in changing the fauna.																			0193-4406					JUL	1990		16					103	117																WOS:A1990DQ85400014

AMS C-14 dating and correlation of the five magnetic susceptibility records allowed establishment of a composite sedimentary record of the last 46 kyr. Our data suggest that mineral-magnetic changes result from changes in concentration of strongly ferrimagnetic terrigenous minerals and from preservation/dissolution cycles of detrital iron oxides (primarily high-coercivity Fe(III) phases such as hematite) in alternately oxic and anoxic depositional environments, High-coercivity iron oxide phases are restricted to stratigraphic intervals that are interpreted to represent dry periods with oxic conditions. Comparison with other paleoenvironmental proxies (pollen, total organic carbon, lithology) suggests that the sediments record relatively humid conditions before 22 kyr BP, and relatively dry conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the early Holocene. Such results contrast with the previous observations of relatively dry glacial conditions and humid mid-Holocene conditions in the summer rainfall area of East and SE Africa.

J	Kirchmann, H; Johnston, AEJ; Bergström, LF				Kirchmann, H; Johnston, AEJ; Bergström, LF			Possibilities for reducing nitrate leaching from agricultural land	AMBIO												Agricultural soil is a contributor of nitrate to natural waters. High nitrate levels in water leached from soils are related to high nitrate concentrations in drinking water, and excess levels change the ecological balance of rivers and lakes. In this paper, sound solutions to the major environmental issue of limiting nitrate leaching by modifying agricultural practices are discussed. The causes of nitrate leaching from agricultural land are briefly explained and existing measures for the reduction of nitrate losses are described, analyzed and evaluated. Reduction of nutrient leaching is not a question of organic or conventional farming, but rather of the introduction and use of appropriate countermeasures. We propose the following guiding principles to minimize leaching from agricultural soils. To some extent these principles require a new way of thinking; i) environmental indexing of fields and consideration of spatial variability within fields in relation to their contribution to leaching losses within a catchment; ii) reduction of nitrogen inputs to soil to levels slightly below those expected to give the optimum yield by applying less nitrogen fertilizer and by a further reduction in animal density; and iii) use of a range of counter-measures (catch crops, minimum tillage, control of biological processes, etc.) depending on how sensitive the farming system, soil and climate are to the risk of nitrate leaching.

J	Larsen, J; Jones, VJ; Eide, W				Larsen, Jorunn; Jones, Vivienne J.; Eide, Wenche			Climatically driven pH changes in two Norwegian alpine lakes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Two alpine lakes in the south-central part of Norway have been studied for recent changes in diatom assemblages preserved in their sediments. Both lakes experience a post 1980 AD increase in diatom valve accumulation rates possibly reflecting an increase in lake productivity. In addition there is an overall increase in diatom-inferred pH at both sites. Recovery from lake acidification can be disregarded as a possible cause of increased pH as the lakes are situated in catchments with high buffering capacities in areas that have received low amounts of acid deposition. We suggest that recent climate warming has influenced both sites with the important effect of increasing mineralization in the catchments, resulting in greater fluxes of nutrients and base cations to the lakes, leading to an increase in diatom-inferred pH. Taxa that have increased in abundance include Achnanthes minutissima, Achnanthes nodosa, Cyclotella spp., Navicula schmassmannii, Staurosirella lapponica, and S. pinnata. In one of the lakes, the maximum diatom-inferred pH values reached at the top of the core are as high as pH values reconstructed from the diatom assemblages deposited at the end of the Mid-Holocene thermal maximum c. 4000 cal.

Genomic vulnerability of a freshwater salmonid under climate change	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Understanding the adaptive potential of populations and species is pivotal for minimizing the loss of biodiversity in this era of rapid climate change. Adaptive potential has been estimated in various ways, including based on levels of standing genetic variation, presence of potentially beneficial alleles, and/or the severity of environmental change. Kokanee salmon, the non-migratory ecotype of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), is culturally and economically important and has already been impacted by the effects of climate change. To assess its climate vulnerability moving forward, we integrated analyses of standing genetic variation, genotype-environment associations, and climate modeling based on sequence and structural genomic variation from 224 whole genomes sampled from 22 lakes in British Columbia and Yukon (Canada). We found that variables for extreme temperatures, particularly warmer temperatures, had the most pervasive signature of selection in the genome and were the strongest predictors of levels of standing variation and of putatively adaptive genomic variation, both sequence and structural. Genomic offset estimates, a measure of climate vulnerability, were significantly correlated with higher increases in extreme warm temperatures, further highlighting the risk of summer heat waves that are predicted to increase in frequency in the future. Levels of standing genetic variation, an important metric for population viability and resilience, were not correlated with genomic offset. Nonetheless, our combined approach highlights the importance of integrating different sources of information and genomic data to formulate more comprehensive and accurate predictions on the vulnerability of populations and species to future climate change.

Among lakes with similar trophic levels but different distributions of phyto- and metazooplankton, the main forces acting on ciliate assemblages may be different. We investigated the relationship between ciliate communities and bottom up versus top-down variables based on a survey of four subtropical eutrophic lakes (China). Two of the lakes (Chaohu, Taihu) are located on the Mid-lower Yangtze Plain near sea level, and the other two (Dianchi, Xingyunhu) on the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau at 1700 m above sea level. Blooms of cyanobacteria developed during summer in Lakes Chaohu and Taihu and throughout the year in Lakes Dianchi and Xingyunhu. Ciliate functional feeding groups differed significantly between lakes. The results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and variation partitioning showed that cyanobacteria significantly influence ciliate species, whereas 'edible' algae (cryptophytes, diatoms) and cladocerans were the important variables in explaining the ciliate community structure of Lakes Dianchi and Xingyunhu compared with Lakes Taihu and Chaohu. Our results highlight the importance of consistent cyanobacterial blooms in shaping the ciliate community in subtropical eutrophic shallow lakes by interacting with top-down and bottom-up factors.

To evaluate the impact of a GLOF in the hydrography and biological components of the plankton in the Baker Fjord, we assessed the relative contributions of terrigenous versus marine plankton carbon sources to the particulate organic matter (POM) in the fjord before and after a GLOF in the austral summer 2014. We also evaluated whether terrestrial carbon brought into the fjord by the river may reach higher trophic levels via a deposit-feeding organism the juvenile pelagic Munida gregaria. Over a 10-day period, hydrographic profiles, water samples for POM, and zooplankton samples were collected daily from three stations and two depths along the fjord's inner section. Samples of suspended POM and tissue from M. gregaria were analyzed for stable-isotope composition of carbon (C-13). The GLOF arrival produced a thermal front in the fjord, followed by an oscillation of the pycnocline; an abrupt increase in the total organic carbon content of POM, which was attributed to terrestrial input; and a concurrent peak in the abundance of M. gregaria, suggesting an aggregation response to the GLOF. Understanding GLOF effects on local hydrography, productivity, and food web structure provides valuable insight on the potential responses of fjord ecosystems in general to climate change-induced variability. Given present climatic trends in high-latitude zones, more frequent GLOFs might be expected in Patagonian fjords and channels as well as in other high-latitude basins.

All population consisted of native apricot genotypes were examined with respect to fruit and tree characteristics for two years, and twenty-eight genotypes were selected for future breeding efforts. Their flowering habit and desirable fruit characteristics were determined in comparison with 'Hacihaliloglu'. All selected apricots grown at 1700 m in the region were not affected by late spring frosts. In the majority of genotypes, bud break, first flowering, full flowering and end of flowering occurred a few days earlier than the cultivar 'Hacihaliloglu' in both years, whereas, harvest was later than that. Some selections produced larger fruits than 'Hacihaliloglu'. All genotypes showed a range of 25-48 g for fruit weight, 11-21% for soluble solids and 0.19-2.90% for acidity. Soluble solids content was more than 20% in three selections (G12, G29 and G33), and the acidity was lower than 1% in five genotypes (G2, G12, G27, G29 and G33). Selections with attractive fruit colors had small to medium-sized fruits. Many genotypes were evaluated as promising for further breeding efforts.

J	Savage, KS; Tingle, TN; O'Day, PA; Waychunas, GA; Bird, DK				Savage, KS; Tingle, TN; O'Day, PA; Waychunas, GA; Bird, DK			Arsenic speciation in pyrite and secondary weathering phases, Mother Lode Gold District, Tuolumne County, California	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Arsenian pyrite, formed during Cretaceous gold mineralization, is the primary source of As along the Melones fault zone in the southern Mother Lode Gold District of California. Mine tailings and associated weathering products from partially submerged inactive gold mines at Don Pedro Reservoir, on the Tuolumne River, contain similar to 20-1300 ppm As. The highest concentrations are in weathering crusts from the Clio mine and nearby outcrops which contain goethite or jarosite. As is concentrated up to 2154 ppm in the fine-grained (< 63 mu m) fraction of these Fe-rich weathering products. Individual pyrite grains in albite-chlorite schists of the Clio mine tailings contain an average of 1.2 wt.% As. Pyrite grains are coarsely zoned, with local As concentrations ranging from similar to 0 to 5 wt.%. Electron microprobe, transmission electron microscope, and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) analyses indicate that As substitutes for S in pyrite and is not present as inclusions of arsenopyrite or other As-bearing phases. Comparison with simulated EXAFS spectra demonstrates that As atoms are locally clustered in the pyrite lattice and that the unit cell of arsenian pyrite is expanded by similar to 2.6% relative to pure pyrite. During weathering, clustered substitution of As into pyrite may be responsible for accelerating oxidation, hydrolysis, and dissolution of arsenian pyrite relative to pure pyrite in weathered tailings. Arsenic K-edge EXAFS analysis of the fine-grained Fe-rich weathering products are consistent with corner;sharing between As(V) tetrahedra and Fe(III)-octahedra. Determinations of nearest-neighbor distances and atomic identities, generated from least-squares fitting algorithms to spectral data, indicate that arsenate tetrahedra are sorbed on goethite mineral surfaces but substitute for SO4 in jarosite. Erosional transport of As-bearing goethite and jarosite to Don Pedro Reservoir increases the potential for As mobility and bioavailability by desorption or dissolution. Both the substrate minerals and dissolved As species are expected to respond to seasonal changes in lake chemistry caused by thermal stratification and turnover within the monomictic Don Pedro Reservoir. Arsenic is predicted to be most bioavailable and toxic in the reservoir's summer hypolimnion. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Understanding the impact of climate change on the glacier mass balance is crucial given that the Plateau is the "water tower" of East and Southeast Asia. However, the historical records of the glacier mass balance for the Tibetan Plateau are scattered and incomplete. In this study, we reconstructed the long-term glacier mass balance from 1975 to 2013 (the data can be downloaded at ) using the field observations for seven major glaciers and corresponding meteorological data extracted from the GLDAS CLSM (Global Land Data Assimilation Systems based on the Catchment Land Surface Model) data set. The effects of refrozen water and snow depth on the glacier mass balance was examined. In addition, the response of glacier mass balance to climate change was investigated. The results indicate that most of the glaciers experienced a mass loss during the study period. Large mass loss occurred in glaciers in the southeastern part of the plateau. The glacier in the northwestern part of the plateau (the Muztagh No.15 Glacier) shows a small mass gain. Regarding the mass components of the glacier mass balance, most mass balances are dominated by meltwater, while the Muztagh No. 15 has a component offset. Further analysis manifests that mass balances in the western glaciers heavily change to the change of moisture factor (precipitation), while for the eastern glaciers, mass balance changes respond strongly to the changes of heat factors (air temperature and net radiation). The differences in the mass balance changes are closely related to the westerlies and Indian summer monsoon.					A. Vaghefi, Saeid/N-7632-2016; Yang, Hong/AAA-5152-2020; Vaghefi, Seyed/N-7632-2016	A.

So far, however, the rate and magnitude of changes in the IM have still remained unclear. Here we report for the first time that the IM rapidly shifted northward at the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA). We used sediment proxies for humidity and moisture sources from the Taro Co Lake, which is located in the transition zone between the WS and IM. Our comprehensive survey of climate records for the TP and its peripheral mountain ranges revealed that the northern boundary of the IM (i.e., the southern boundary of the WS) lay along the southern slope of the Gandise Range (similar to 29.5 degrees N) in the late LIA. In contrast, it passed quickly over the Gandise Range by at least 1.5 degrees in latitude at the end of the LIA. Our results suggest that this rapid climatic shift was potentially triggered by the counteracting effects of blocking by the TP and its marginal orography, which hindered the northward movement of the IM, and the pulling thermal gradient of the TP.

Iron supply constrains producer communities in stream ecosystems	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The current paradigm that stream producers are under exclusive macronutrient control was recently challenged by continental studies, demonstrating that iron supply constrained diatom biodiversity and energy flows. Using algal abundance and water chemistry data from the National Water-Quality Assessment Program, we determined for the first time community thresholds along iron gradients in non-acidic running waters, i.e. 30-79.5 mu gL(-1) and 70-120 mu g L-1 in oligotrophic and eutrophic streams, respectively. Given that Fe concentrations fell below both thresholds in 50% of US streams, and below the eutrophic threshold in 75% of US streams, we suggest that Fe limitation is potentially widespread and attribute it to the restricted distribution of wetlands. We also report results from the first laboratory experiments on algal-iron interactions in streams, revealing that iron supplementation leads to significant biovolume and biodiversity increase in both nitrogen fixing and non-nitrogen fixing algae. Therefore, the progressive brownification of freshwaters due to rising dissolved organic carbon and iron levels can have a stimulating influence on microbial producers with cascading effects along the trophic hierarchy. Future research in running waters should focus on the role of iron in algal physiology and biofilm functions, including accumulation of biomass, fixing atmospheric nitrogen and improving water quality.					; Passy, Sophia/I-1449-2019	Larson, Chad/0000-0002-0329-8979; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				MAY	2015	91	5							fiv041	10.1093/femsec/fiv041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiv041								25873463					WOS:000355328100016

GEOMORPHOLOGY AND FLOODING SHAPE FISH DISTRIBUTION IN A LARGE-SCALE TEMPERATE FLOODPLAIN	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Natural river-floodplain systems are characterized by their dynamic hydrology and diverse geomorphology resulting in a wide range of habitats that support high fish diversity and production. Various factors (e.g. hydrological dynamics, water quality, and biotic processes) have been proposed to explain fish distribution in large river floodplains, but it is still widely acknowledged that the mechanisms involved may vary in diverse floodplain systems and that they are not fully understood. To determine how flooding dynamics and floodplain geomorphology influence fish species distributions across the Volga-Akhtuba floodplain, Russian Federation, we examined the distributions of eight species with respect to variables reflecting floodplain hydrology and geomorphology. On the basis of fish catches in 40 floodplain water bodies at the end of summer in 2006-2008, we found that frequency of occurrence of most fish species remained stable along the time. The distribution of fish species was strongly influenced by the size and shape of water bodies as well as flood extent. Therefore, the long-term flood variability that drives the geomorphic heterogeneity of the floodplain creates suitable habitats across ranges of fish flow guilds (rheophilic, eurytopic, and limnophilic), resulting in high diversity of the floodplain ichthyofauna. We conclude that this diverse habitat availability is a highly significant factor influencing fish distribution in the Volga-Akhtuba floodplain.

Can simple phosphorus mass balance models guide management decisions? A case study in the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, Canada	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We test the capacity of an existing simple mass-balance total phosphorus (TP) model to evaluate nutrient loading scenarios in the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, Canada. Our study examines whether model parameters and loading inputs are well characterized and relevant to the current conditions in the Bay of Quinte and its drainage areas. We also identify critical data gaps and influential assumptions in regard to the uncertainty of model outputs and the credibility of predictive statements about the achievability of delisting objectives of the system. Our analysis shows that the model closely reproduced the observed variability of the TP seasonal averages during the calibration period 1972-2001, but its performance was significantly reduced when the actual predictive capacity was assessed in the 2002-2009 validation period. The most troublesome result is the inability of the model to reproduce the observed TP variability at temporal scales that are more meaningful from an environmental management point of view (i.e., monthly averages or daily snapshots from the system). Sensitivity analysis shows that several parameters associated with the role of the sediments were significant drivers of the model outputs, suggesting that considerable uncertainty exists in regard to the characterization of the sediments. The loadings from Trent River and the TP levels of the inflowing water masses from Lake Ontario predominantly shape the variability in the upper and lower segments of the Bay of Quinte, respectively. We also present a critical review of the suitability of the existing water quality criteria to depict the trophic status throughout the system. Our study contends that the summer average TP concentrations do not adequately reflect the prevailing conditions and that the development of proper water quality criteria should place more emphasis on inshore sites, where the eutrophication problems are more frequently manifested. Finally, we pinpoint factors unaccounted for by the original model that are likely to modulate the response of the system in its present state. We also discuss important directions of model structure augmentation and ways to optimize the spatial segmentation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Under low flow conditions about 60 kg d-1 of P enters the river from Lake Rotoiti. The discharge to the sea, some 50 km downstream, approximates 300 kg d-1, about 77 kg d-1 of this total coming from the Auckland Farmers'' Freezing Company works at Rangiuru. By 2000 A.D. an additional 107 kg d-1 P may be added to the top of the river in treated sewage effluent from Roturua city. Inorganic N concentrations increase along the length of the river; about 40 kg d-1 enter the top at Okere Falls and under low flow conditions about 950 kg d-1 discharge to the sea. By 2000 A.D. the river may be carrying an additional 1000 kg d-1 of N derived from Rotorua''s treated sewage. The effect of the additional nutrient load on the trophic status of the river is likely to be slight, because water passes from Okere to the sea in about a day.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1978	12	1					23	27		10.1080/00288330.1978.9515719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1978.9515719													WOS:A1978FN25600003

Based on hyperspectral satellite remotely sensed vegetation phenology processes and related indices and the re-analysed climate datasets, we investigated the seasonal and inter-annual variability of GPP by using different light-use efficiency (LUE) models including the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approaches (CASA) model, vegetation photosynthesis models (VPMChl and VPMCanopy) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP products (MOD17A2H) during 2001-2020 over the Great Lakes region of Sub-Saharan Africa (GLR-SSA). The models' validation against the in situ GPP-based upscaled observations (GPP-EC) indicated that these three models can explain 82%, 79% and 80% of GPP variations with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 5.7, 8.82 and 10.12 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), respectively. The spatiotemporal variations of GPP showed that the GLR-SSA experienced: (i) high GPP values during December-May; (ii) high annual GPP increase during 2002-2003, 2011-2013 and 2015-2016 and annual decreasing with a marked alternation in other years; (iii) evergreen broadleaf forests having the highest GPP values while grasslands and croplands showing lower GPP values. The spatial correlation between GPP and climate factors indicated 60% relative correlation between precipitation and GPP and 65% correction between surface air temperature and GPP. The results also showed high GPP values under wet conditions (in rainy seasons and humid areas) that significantly fell by the rise of dry conditions (in long dry season and arid areas). Therefore, these results showed that climate factors have potential impact on GPP variability in this region. However, these findings may provide a better understanding of climate implications on GPP variability in the GLR-SSA and other tropical climate zones.					; Alphonse, Kayiranga/IST-2034-2023; Dilawar, Adil/JNT-5592-2023	Dilawar, Adil/0000-0001-7295-0361; Chen, Baozhang/0000-0001-8972-706X; Hategekimana, Yves/0000-0002-2430-8072														2071-1050				MAR	2022	14	5							2610	10.3390/su14052610	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14052610													WOS:000775768800001

To investigate the effects of cyanobacteria on VOC emissions, field campaigns were carried out in eutrophic Chaohu Lake at six sites with different microalgae densities during CBBs in summer 2019, and incubation experiments were performed in the laboratory. The results showed that the lake water was the primary source of VOCs at six sampling sites in Chaohu Lake during CBBs, with an average total VOC flux of 81.2 +/- 20.6 mu g m- 2 h-1. Alkanes were the most abundantly emitted VOCs, with a share of 23.1-63.7% of total emitted VOCs, followed by aromatics (16.6-46.3%). The fluxes of total VOCs were significantly greater at sites B and/or C than at site A in July, and at site B ' and/or C ' than at site A' in August in Chaohu Lake. The fluxes of total VOCs from living and decayed cyanobacteria in the experimental treatments were two orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding values in the control treatments in the laboratory incubation. Taken together, these results suggested that CBBs potentially enhanced VOC emissions from the eutrophic lake, and that cyanobacteria acted as an important source of VOCs. Additionally, non-methane hydrocarbons (i.e., alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics) predominated among the released VOCs during the stabilization and senescence stages, while oxygenated volatile organic compounds (i.e. alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, and furans) prevailed during the apoptosis stage and aromatics and volatile organic sulfur compounds predominated during the decomposition stage, suggesting that VOC emissions varied markedly at different life stages.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV	2021	202								111664	10.1016/j.envres.2021.111664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111664		JUL 2021						34256073					WOS:000704920100005

Monitoring of lake ice extent and ice phenology (i.e. dates associated with freeze-up/break-up and ice duration) is also valuable for improving numerical weather prediction (NWP) and for climate monitoring. The availability of free synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 A/B constellation provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop operational algorithms for lake ice cover mapping at a temporal frequency not available until now from SAR missions (ca. every 1-5 days depending on latitude). For NWP, rapid and accurate mapping of ice cover and open water areas in lake-rich regions is required. However, the classification of SAR imagery using traditional machine learning (ML) approaches is challenging due to the large data volume generated by imaging systems such as Sentinel-1 SAR as well as the complexity of radar signatures as a function of sensor and target characteristics. For lakes specifically, radar backscatter can vary greatly with incidence angle, polarization and surface properties (e.g. calm and wind-roughed open water, new thin ice, surface roughness due to the presence of pressure ridges, ice type, melting of ice and on-ice snow). To address the challenge of large-scale lake ice mapping, we investigate the GPU-boosted deep neural network approach that is efficient at handling big complex data. In this paper, we design a novel maximum a posterior (MAP) approach combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and conditional random field (CRF) for better addressing the challenges of operational lake ice mapping. The proposed approach is tested on 17 Sentinel-1 dual-polarization (VV and VH) SAR images, where eight are used for training and validation and nine used for out-of-sample testing. To identify the optimal network architecture, an independent validation set is used to evaluate the performance of a series of six CNNs with increasing model complexity. The best model overcomes the noise effect in Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and the lake ice signature ambiguity issue; it achieves average classification accuracies of 97.10% and 97.14% for open water and ice, respectively, on the validation set. Moreover, the best model outperforms the last-ranked model by about 2% in terms of mean overall accuracy (OA), demonstrating the improvement and importance of model selection. The use of CRF can consistently improve the CNN by reducing the artefacts and noise effect in ice maps, outperforming the CNN model when used alone by about 3% in terms of mean OA on the validation set. The proposed CNN-CRF approach also achieves high accuracy on the nine test scenes, achieving a mean OA of 93.10%, demonstrating strong generalization capability that is important for SAR lake ice mapping.

G.; Oviatt, Charles G.; Pathak, Manas; Fan, Yuxin			Testing and refining the timing of hydrologic evolution during the latest Pleistocene regressive phase of Lake Bonneville	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Lacustrine, fluvial, and wetland landforms present in the now desertified regions of Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) and the Sevier Desert in western Utah, record a fascinating history of falling lake level, river development, and establishment of wetland habitats in the Lake Bonneville basin between similar to 13 and 9 ka. This was not only a time of rapid climate change but also of human occupation into suitable habitats made available by decline of the large lake. Using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating methods we have determined depositional ages for sediment samples from bar features (reworked deltaic sands), braided fluvial channels, and topographically inverted fluvial channels collected from DPG. All samples analyzed showed good luminescence characteristics. An uncertainty estimate incorporated into Minimum Age Model analysis increased confidence in the equivalent dose (D-e) estimate for the majority of samples. OSL ages for five of six samples studied support the previously constructed model of overflow from the Sevier basin northwards to the Great Salt Lake basin at similar to 12-13 ka and rapid regression of Lake Bonneville at this time.

James			The Evolution of Lake-Effect Convection during Landfall and Orographic Uplift as Observed by Profiling Radars	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A pronounced snowfall maximum occurs about 30 km downwind of Lake Ontario over the 600-m-high Tug Hill Plateau (hereafter Tug Hill), a region where lake-effect convection is affected by mesoscale forcing associated with landfall and orographic uplift. Profiling radar data from the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems field campaign are used to characterize the inland evolution of lake-effect convection that produces the Tug Hill snowfall maximum. Four K-band profiling Micro Rain Radars (MRRs) were aligned in a transect from the Ontario coast onto Tug Hill. Additional observations were provided by an X-band profiling radar (XPR). Analysis is presented of a major lake-effect storm that produced 6.4-cm liquid precipitation equivalent (LPE) snowfall over Tug Hill. This event exhibited strong inland enhancement, with LPE increasing by a factor of 1.9 over 15-km horizontal distance. MRR profiles reveal that this enhancement was not due to increases in the depth or intensity of lake-effect convection. With increasing inland distance, echoes transitioned from a convective toward a stratiform morphology, becoming less intense, more uniform, more frequent, and less turbulent. An inland increase in echo frequency (possibly orographically forced) contributes somewhat to snowfall enhancement. The XPR observations reproduce the basic vertical structure seen by the MRRs while also revealing a suppression of snowfall below 600 m AGL upwind of Tug Hill, possibly associated with subcloud sublimation or hydrometeor advection. Statistics from 29 events demonstrate that the above-described inland evolution of convection is common for lake-effect storms east of Lake Ontario.					; Minder, Justin/K-5813-2017	Steenburgh, Jim/0000-0003-1028-4230; Campbell, Leah/0000-0001-6601-8770; Minder, Justin/0000-0001-7182-7898													0027-0644	1520-0493				NOV	2015	143	11					4422	4442		10.1175/MWR-D-15-0117.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-15-0117.1													WOS:000363696800007

THE FIRST ASTRO-GEODETIC REFERENCE FRAME IN NORWAY, 1779-1815	ACTA GEODAETICA ET GEOPHYSICA HUNGARICA												Military considerations in the early 1770s declared the need for a systematic mapping of the eastern regions of Norway along the border to Sweden. After a failed attempt of direct map sketching in the field, the geographical circle was introduced in 1779 to establish a triangular network as a backbone for further positioning of natural and man-made features. The resulting maps were used in preparation of fortresses and planning of defensive field operations. The scale of the triangular network was established by an astronomical baseline supported by linear baselines measured on frozen lakes during winter time. Many stations had latitude determinations from circum-meridian observations of the sun and stars to control the precision of the geodetic triangulation. When discrepancies became too large, a new baseline and a new reference point was selected. The original reference point was the flagpole of the fortress at Kongsvinger, which served as the zero-meridian for mapping in Norway until 1850. Other reference sites, for which accurate latitude and longitude were determined from several years of astronomical observations, were established in Trondheim, Bergen, and Kristiansand as the original triangular arc was expanded around the entire coast of southern Norway to close at Kongsvinger after 3 decades of observations. This allowed astronomical control of the geodetic results.																			1217-8977					MAR	2009	44	1					67	78		10.1556/AGeod.44.2009.1.7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/AGeod.44.2009.1.7													WOS:000263934600007

To further understand the influence of various inorganic nutrient forms on cyanobacterial blooms, a nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4), and orthophosphate (PO4) amendment experiment was conducted in a large shallow lake of China (Lake Taihu) during summer. The results showed that the photosynthetic performance of phytoplankton responded more positively to phosphorus (P) than nitrogen (N), and NH4 addition stimulated higher algal photosynthetic activities in P-enriched waters. Individual inorganic N or PO4 addition significantly activated cyanobacteria and green algae. Meanwhile, the N plus P amendment promoted higher biomass of the planktonic microbial community, and the dual addition of NH4 + PO4 yielded the highest chlorophyll a concentration. NH4 additions provisionally promoted higher green algae than cyanobacteria biomass in the beginning, while cyanobacteria dominated again with increasing NH4:PO4 ratios. These results revealed that increasing ammonium would enhance the increase in phytoplankton biomass in advance and prolong the duration of algal blooms. Hence, based on the control of P loading, the reduction in external inorganic N focusing on ammonium sources (such as ammonia N fertilizer) at the watershed scale would help to alleviate eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms over the long term in Lake Taihu.

Some freshwater watersheds are particularly at risk considering the threats to already imperiled wildlife. The consumption of tainted drinking water and contaminated food also raises concerns for human health. In the present study, a pilot survey was conducted in the riverine ecosystem of the Pike River Ecological Reserve (QC, Canada) near Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain. We examined the occurrence of multi-class cyanotoxins including 12 microcystins, anatoxins, cylindrospermopsin (CYN), anabaenopeptins (AP-A, AP-B), and cyanopeptolin-A in surface waters and wild-caught fish during the summer 2018. Out of the 18 targeted cyanotoxins, 14 were detected in bloom-impacted surface water samples; toxins peaked during early-mid September with the highest concentrations for MC-LR (3.8 mu g L-1) and MC-RR (2.9 mu g L-1). Among the 71 field-collected fish from 10 species, 30% had positive detections to at least one cyanotoxin. In positive samples, concentration ranges in fish muscle were as follows for summed microcystins (Sigma MCs: 0.16-9.2 mu g kg(-1)), CYN (46-75 mu g kg(-1)), AP-A (1.1-5.4 mu g kg(-1)), and AP-B (0.12-5.0 mu g kg(-1)). To the best of our knowledge, this is one the first reports of anabaenopeptins occurrence in wildlife. The maximum Sigma MCs in fish was 1.15-fold higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) daily intake recommendation for adults and nearly equated the derived value for young children. The concentration of CYN was also about 3-fold higher than the limit derived from the human health guideline values.

Growth and morphology in relation to temperature and light availability during the establishment of three invasive aquatic plant species	AQUATIC BOTANY												Invasive freshwater plants are currently spreading rapidly and this is likely to continue with further changes in global climate resulting in changes in physical and chemical conditions in freshwaters. We studied the effect of summer temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and light availability (25% and 50% of incident light availability) on shoot establishment in terms of growth rate, photosynthesis, and morphology of three invasive aquatic plants (Elodea canadensis. Egeria densa and Lagarosiphon major) in order to assess their interspecific competition. Light availability had an overall stronger effect on growth rate and plant morphology than temperature in the three species. Growth rate increased three-fold from low to high light, and low light reduced belowground biomass, increased stem length, and reduced branching and lateral spread. Photosynthetic rates were the only parameter for which temperature had an equal or stronger effect than light availability. The results show that E. canadensis has the most competitive establishment of the three species in both high and low temperature and light availability. E. densa is most competitive in warm water compared to colder water, whereas the opposite pattern is present for L major which is most competitive in colder water. In conclusion, we suggest that that E. densa will dominate warmer, shallower waters, whereas L major will dominate in colder, clear-water lakes, while E. canadensis continues its established role as a pioneer species that is quickly replaced by the two taller species after their arrival.

Methane production in the oxygenated water column of a perennially ice-covered Antarctic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Aerobic methane production in aquatic ecosystems impacts the global atmospheric budget of methane, but the extent, mechanism, and taxa responsible for producing this greenhouse gas are not fully understood. Lake Bonney (LB), a perennially ice-covered Antarctic lake, has cold hypersaline waters underlying an oxygenated freshwater layer. We present temporal methane concentration profiles in LB indicating methane production in the oxygenated (> 200% air saturation) water. Experiments amended with methylphosphonate (MPn) yielded methane generation, suggesting in situ methanogenesis via the carbon-phosphorus (C-P) lyase pathway. Enrichment cultures from the lake were used to isolate five bacterial strains capable of generating methane when supplied with MPn as the sole P source. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the isolates belong to the Proteobacteria (closely related to Marinomonas, Hoeflea, and Marinobacter genera) and Bacteroidetes (Algoriphagus genus). 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing confirms the presence of these taxa in LB. None of the isolated species were reported to be capable to produce methane. In addition, orthologs of the phosphoenolpyruvate mutase gene (PepM) and methylphosphonate synthase (MPnS), enzymes involved in phosphonate and MPn biosynthesis, were widely spread in the LB shotgun metagenomic libraries; genes related to C-P lyase pathways (phn gene clusters) were also abundant. 16S rRNA and mcrA genes of anaerobic methanogens were absent in both 16S rRNA and metagenomics libraries. These data reveal that in situ aerobic biological methane production is likely a significant source of methane in LB.					; Skidmore, Mark/I-4317-2018; liu, yongqin/LFF-8837-2024	Steigmeyer, August/0000-0002-6059-8046; Cho, Yong-Joon/0000-0003-3191-2670; Kim, Ok-Sun/0000-0003-1217-4780													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2020	65	1					143	156		10.1002/lno.11257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11257		JUL 2019											WOS:000476977600001

THE ORIGIN OF FLORAL LAGERSTATTEN IN COALS	PALAIOS												Floral Lagerstatten deposits (i.e., fossil sites with exceptional preservation and diversity) are preserved within the Miocene brown coals of the Latrobe Group, Gippsland Basin, Australia. Three independent mechanisms are conducive to their accumulation. Throughout the coal seams the conversion of plant material into charcoal (fusain) and its accumulation in a subaqueous setting provides one means of near-perfect preservation. A second and more uncommon example occurs in the form of a 20 cm thick leaf-litter horizon that extends for over two kilometers. In this case, flooding of freshwater tributaries and lakes during the early stages of low-gradient peat development resulted in an extensive, shallow, acidic and water-filled depression that subsequently accumulated and preserved the surrounding plant material. The third and most common form results from the deposition of plant material into small, isolated pools that formed as depressions on the ombrogenous (i.e., rain-fed) and domed surface of the peatlands. In all of these settings an essential component allowing detailed floral preservation is the delivery of plant material directly to the anaerobic catotelm (i.e., below the water table), hence avoiding the physical and chemical processes of degradation that typically occur in the surficial aerobic acrotelm (i.e., above the water table). Leaf litter that falls into low-energy acidic and anoxic water-filled depressions that lie below the acrotelm will likely be well-preserved.

Our goal was to test the prophylactic addition of glucose to inhibit HCB development, using Microcystis and the toxin microcystin as the HCB model. Water samples were collected weekly, from 4 June to 2 July, from Harsha Lake in southwestern Ohio during the 2021 algal bloom season. From each weekly sample, a 25 mL aliquot was frozen for a 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. Then, 200 mL of Harsha Lake water was added to each of the three culture flasks, and glucose was added to create concentrations of 0 mM (control), 1.39 mM, or 13.9 mM glucose, respectively. The microcystin concentration in each flask was measured after 1 and 2 weeks of incubation. The results showed an 80 to 90% reduction in microcystin concentrations in glucose-treated water compared to the control. At the end of the second week of incubation, a 25 mL sample was also obtained from each of the culture flasks for molecular analysis, including a 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR-based quantification of Microcystis target genes. Based on these analyses, the glucose-treated water contained significantly lower Microcystis and microcystin producing gene (mcy) copy numbers than the control. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis also revealed that Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria were initially the most abundant bacterial phyla in the Harsha Lake water, but as the summer progressed, Cyanobacteria became the dominant phyla. However, in the glucose-treated water, the Cyanobacteria decreased and the Proteobacteria increased in weekly abundance compared to the control. This glucose-induced proteobacterial increase in abundance was driven primarily by increases in two distinct families of Proteobacteria: Devosiaceae and Rhizobiaceae. In conclusion, the prophylactic addition of glucose to Harsha Lake water samples reduced Cyanobacteria's relative abundance, Microcystis numbers and microcystin concentrations and increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria compared to the control.																				2075-1729				MAR	2022	12	3							385	10.3390/life12030385	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life12030385								35330137					WOS:000775044900001

The predominant lithology consists of andesitic-dacitic rocks, with limited occurrences of rhyolitic rocks. The LV geothermal system exhibits surface manifestations, including over 20 hot springs reaching 47 C-degrees along the lake's southern margin. The upflow zone is represented by the fumarolic field in the Nevado Ojos del Salado volcano, 25 km southwest of LV. Lithium concentrations range from 2.76 to 4.46 mg/L in thermal water and 0.59 to 0.76 mg/L in the Penas Blancas river water, which feeds into LV after passing through a volcanic environment rich in lithium -bearing rocks. However, the thermal waters contribute over six times more lithium than non -thermal waters, highlighting their significance in releasing and transporting lithium from the source rocks to its eventual accumulation in LV. This natural laboratory at LV provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate the association between geothermal fluids and lithium -rich brines, offering valuable insights into the processes involved in lithium enrichment in similar geological and climatic conditions in other geographic areas.

Forecasting the magnitude and composition of phytoplankton blooms in a eutrophic lowland river (Riviere Yamaska, Que., Canada)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The mechanisms controlling phytoplankton biomass and composition in the lower reach of the eutrophic (total phosphorus > 100 mu g P.L-1) Riviere Yamaska were studied over six consecutive summers characterized by high (2008-2009) and low (2012-2013) discharge conditions. In the lower river reach, periods of low river discharge favoured planktonic blooms (> 20 mu g Chl-a.L-1) dominated by centric diatoms, in sharp contrast with numerous public reports of simultaneous occurrence of cyanobacterial proliferation in the upstream lakes and reservoirs. Daily cycles of hourly dissolved oxygen production were disrupted by floods but resumed in the days following flow abatement and persisted under low discharge conditions, suggesting that booms in the lower river reach resulted from local production rather than advection from upstream reservoirs. Motile, flagellate chlorophytes and cryptophytes were more important under extreme high and low discharge conditions, whereas cyanobacteria co-occurred with centric diatoms under intermediate discharge and highly illuminated conditions. Although the Riviere Yamaska's flow remained sufficient to avoid cyanobacterial proliferation even under lowest discharge conditions, our results suggest that increasing water residence time, either through severe drought or river damming, will amplify the risk of toxic algal blooms in the free-flowing reaches of the lower Riviere Yamaska.					; Gagnon, Patrick/B-4327-2012	Hudon, Christiane/0000-0003-4629-0683; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	2017	74	8					1298	1311		10.1139/cjfas-2016-0305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0305													WOS:000406524600013

The financial and operational impact of these blooms on the drinking water industry is high as this species produces bad tastes and odours and clogs filters. In order to enable real-time forecasting for dinoflagellate blooms a hybrid evolutionary algorithm rule set for hypertrophic reservoirs in South Africa was developed. Data from three known hypertrophic systems were used for training and developing the rule set. Testing was done on two years respectively from the same reservoirs as the training data. The rule set was also tested on unseen data from two other hypertrophic reservoirs that are known to experience dinoflagellate blooms. The results show that the developed rule set predicts real-time dinoflagellate blooms quite accurately and the sensitivity analysis showed that the rule set developed on hypertrophic reservoirs in the summer rainfall and temperate region of South Africa, is applicable to reservoirs within the same climatic region and of the same hypertrophic status.					; Barnard, Sandra/B-7809-2017	Barnard, Sandra/0000-0002-9299-2769; 													0378-4738	1816-7950				JUL	2007	33	4					531	538																WOS:000248791400014

Park; Smerdon, Jason E.; Palmer, Jonathan G.; Cook, Edward R.; Stahle, David W.; Coats, Sloan			Cold Tropical Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures During the Late Sixteenth-Century North American Megadrought	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The late 16th-century North American megadrought was notable for its persistence, extent, intensity, and occurrence after the main interval of megadrought activity during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Forcing from sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Pacific is considered a possible driver of megadroughts, and we investigate this hypothesis for the late 16th-century event using two new 600-year long hydroclimate field reconstructions from Mexico and Australia. Areas represented by these reconstructions have strong teleconnections to tropical Pacific SSTs, evidenced by the leading principal component in each region explaining similar to 40% of local hydroclimate variability and correlating significantly with the boreal winter (December-January-February) NINO 3.4 index. Using these two principal components as predictors, we develop a skillful reconstruction of the December-January-February NINO 3.4 index. The reconstruction reveals that the late 16th-century megadrought likely occurred during one of the most persistent and intense periods of cold tropical Pacific SST anomalies of the last 600 years (1566-1590 C.E.; median NINO 3.4 = -0.79 K). This anomalously cold period coincided with a major filling episode for Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre in Australia, a hydroclimate response dynamically consistent with the reconstructed SST state. These results offer new evidence that tropical Pacific forcing was an important driver of the late 16th-century North American megadrought over the Southwest and Mexico, highlighting the large amplitude of natural variability that can occur within the climate system.					; Cook, Benjamin/H-2265-2012; Palmer, Jonathan/J-7834-2012; Williams, Park/IQU-0801-2023; Cook, Edward/ABV-5232-2022; Smerdon, Jason/F-9952-2011	Cook, Edward/0000-0001-7478-4176; Palmer, Jonathan/0000-0002-6665-4483; Williams, Park/0000-0001-8176-8166; COATS, SLOAN/0000-0001-6741-613X; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 27	2018	123	20					11307	11320		10.1029/2018JD029323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JD029323													WOS:000452000300002

Optimization of Wetland Environmental DNA Metabarcoding Protocols for Great Lakes Region Herpetofauna	ENVIRONMENTAL DNA												Many species of reptiles and amphibians (herpetofauna) rely on wetlands that are being degraded and lost at a high rate. Characterization of herpetofauna diversity in different wetland types may help guide conservation strategies. However, traditional survey methods often involve sampling within small temporal windows, and the gear deployed may be taxonomically biased, thus, they may fail to accurately characterize species presence/absence and diversity. In contrast, environmental (e)DNA metabarcoding has been shown to effectively survey entire aquatic communities and can provide a useful complement to traditional surveys. The objective of this study was to design and optimize eDNA sampling and laboratory protocols for wetland herpetofauna. Protocols evaluated included different water sampling approaches (point versus transect sampling), seasonality of sampling, and choice of metabarcoding marker (mitochondrial 12S versus 16S rDNA). Samples collected from 10 sites across southern Michigan detected 17 amphibian and five reptile species, including four species of conservation concern (Ambystoma texanum, Clemmys guttata, Rana palustris, and Sternotherus odoratus). We observed no difference in the number of species detected between point and transect samples (p = 0.70), but point sampling required less time (p = 0.03) and allowed significantly larger volumes of water to be filtered (p = 1.13e-5). No difference in species richness was observed between the 12S and 16S mitochondrial DNA markers (p = 0.96). However, a greater number of taxa were identifiable at the species level when using the 16S locus. There was also a significant difference in the number of species detected between early and late summer sampling periods (more species detected in the earlier period; p = 6.31e-6), and some species were only found in the early or late sampling period. Sampling during multiple periods to fully characterize species composition, the use of point sampling, and the 16S mtDNA marker for herpetofauna eDNA metabarcoding studies may increase efficiency and reliability of results.					; Robinson, John/KHD-9917-2024	Ruppert, Olivia/0009-0008-2836-6975; 													2637-4943					JAN	2025	7	1							e70047	10.1002/edn3.70047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/edn3.70047													WOS:001396515400001

Geometric morphometrics reveals surprising diversity in the Lake Malawi cichlid genus Labeotropheus	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Lake Malawi cichlid genus Labeotropheus has been a source of confusion among biologists and taxonomists. Although unique populations of both L. fuelleborni and L. trewavasae exist throughout the lake, these populations have not been elevated to species, despite taxonomists doing so for populations within other Lake Malawi cichlids. One reason for this oversight is the supposed consistent differences in morphology between Labeotropheus species; since, where they co-occur, L. fuelleborni is always deeper-bodied than L. trewavasae, it is thought that all deep-bodied populations of Labeotropheus are L. fuelleborni, and the slender ones are L. trewavasae. Using geometric morphometrics, we analyze 18 populations of Labeotropheus and show that body shape varies among populations, and does not always fall into a deep-body/slender-body dichotomy. These differences in body shape are not related to geographical distance among populations, but are possibly related to the type of habitat in which the populations are found. Further, head shape is extremely variable among populations, and we find two locations where there is convergence in head shape between sympatric L. fuelleborni and L. trewavasae. Our results suggest that the morphological criteria applied to the Labeotropheus are not accurate, and hamper the recognition of Labeotropheus biodiversity.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2015	748	1					145	160		10.1007/s10750-014-1941-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1941-2													WOS:000349968000011

Development and validation of an intervention package to improve lifejacket wear for drowning prevention among occupational boaters on Lake Albert, Uganda	INJURY PREVENTION												BackgroundOccupational drowning is a growing public health concern globally. The human cost of fishing is highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Although lifejackets prevent drowning, the majority of boaters in Uganda do not wear them. We developed and validated a peer-to-peer training manual to improve lifejacket wear among occupational boaters on Lake Albert, Uganda. MethodsThe intervention was developed in three stages. In stage one, we conducted baseline studies to explore and identify aspects of practices that need to change. In stage two, we held a stakeholder workshop to identify relevant interventions following the intervention functions of the behaviour change wheel (BCW). In stage three, we developed the content and identified its implementation strategies. We validated the intervention package using the Content Validity Index for each item (I-CVI) and scale (S-CVI/Ave). ResultsSeven interventions were identified and proposed by stakeholders. Training and sensitisation by peers were unanimously preferred. The lowest I-CVI for the content was 86%, with an S-CVI/Ave of 98%. This indicates that the intervention package was highly relevant to the target community. ConclusionThe stakeholder workshop enabled a participatory approach to identify the most appropriate intervention. All the proposed interventions fell under one of the intervention functions of the BCW. The intervention should be evaluated for its effectiveness in improving lifejacket wear among occupational boaters.

Predictors of bigheaded carp drifting egg density and spawning activity in an invaded, free-flowing river	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Successful reproduction of non-native species is a critical step in the invasion process, influencing establishment and spread. Predicting invasive species' reproduction is often based on information collected from species' native ranges; however, environmental variables within the invaded range may provoke different responses. Bigheaded carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) have successfully invaded many water bodies worldwide and are currently threatening the Laurentian Great Lakes. We examined bigheaded carp spawning in a mostly unregulated, invaded ecosystem (Wabash River, IN, USA) which has similarities to multiple Great Lakes tributaries; it can therefore provide insights into the potential spawning of bigheaded carp in the Great Lakes. Spawning was protracted, and while initiation of spawning has been reported to require changes in discharge in their native ranges, this association was not observed in the Wabash River. However, changing discharges did appear to influence egg density, with rises in late spring producing high drifting egg densities. Cumulative growing degree-day (sum of days where [(max temperature - min temperature / 2) - 10 degrees C base temperature] is >0) was the most influential factor predicting spawning initiation. Overall, it appears that bigheaded carp exhibit the ability to spawn under a variety of environmental conditions, with changing discharges targeting spawning to periods when reproductive success may be more likely. The successful establishment of invasive species may hinge on their ability to reproduce across wide-ranging environmental conditions. The reproductive plasticity displayed by bigheaded carp could therefore contribute to their successful reproduction in multiple invaded ecosystems, including Great Lakes tributaries.

A total of 200 specimens were captured (98 females, 86 males and 16 juveniles) and distributed into seven different age-classes (from 0+ to 6+). Specimens 6+ were exclusively females. The mean values of male length and weight were slightly higher than females ones but the differences were not significant between sexes. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth's curve were L infinity = 503.6 mm, k = 0.19. t(0) = -1.04 for males and L infinity = 512.6, k = 0. 18, t(0) = -1.05 for females. The final values of the Gompertz growth's curve for weight were: W-0 = 36.35. G = 10.61, g = 0.06 for males and W-0 = 31.81. G = 6.93, g = 0.11 for females. Reproduction took place in spring, Females mature older than males, in age-class 2+.

Citizen science for Saskatchewan lakes: a pilot project. Lake Reserv Manage. 35:77-89. We report on an initiative to establish a pilot citizen science program to monitor recreational lake water quality in Saskatchewan, Canada. We trained citizen volunteers at lakes in two provincial parks to conduct monthly water quality sampling during the summer of 2017 and compared results based on volunteer collections with those collected by trained limnologists. We additionally conducted surveys and assembled focus groups to determine the concerns for, and knowledge of, water quality by local citizens to aid in the future expansion of this project. Trained volunteers effectively collected samples for lake trophic status, toxins, total dissolved solids, and transparency, and we drew conclusions about lake water quality from these samples similar to conclusions for those collected by trained limnologists. Despite this sampling consistency, we identified several avenues for improvement of both sample collection and volunteer education, particularly for Secchi disk transparency and pH readings. Citizens were enthusiastic about participating in water quality monitoring and lake management, and were particularly concerned about lake trophic status and invasive species. This pilot suggests that expansion to additional sites in future years is warranted, particularly when informed by the methodological modifications outlined here.					; Hurlbert, Margot/AAL-2559-2020	Nanayakkara, Lushani/0000-0002-1651-9187; Finlay, Kerri/0000-0001-6835-8832; Hurlbert, Margot/0000-0003-3825-8413; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				JAN 2	2019	35	1					77	89		10.1080/10402381.2018.1538172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2018.1538172													WOS:000463661100008

We reconstructed temporal changes in carbon sources fuelling chironomid biomass in a small and shallow hemiboreal/boreal lake over the last 11 000 years. Results were compared with temporal dynamics of known potential controlling factors: summer air temperature, human activities, phytoplankton assemblages and organic matter composition. We report an abrupt rise in the contribution of methane-derived carbon to chironomid biomass. However, this sudden increase was not the consequence of drastic changes in the composition of sedimentary organic matter, mean air temperature, lake trophic state or human activities in the catchment area. Our results suggest that shallowing of the lake caused by sedimentary infilling processes was a possible driver of the expansion of anoxic zones, enhancing CH4 cycling in lake sediments. However, complementary studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms by which lake shallowing could affect carbon flows to aquatic consumers, and then better assess the natural dynamics of past carbon processing in the benthic food web of shallow lakes.

Moreover, the chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phycobilin composition as well as the size structure of chosen cyanobacteria were measured. Studied species revealed high diversity both in optical properties with the absorption spectra similarity index ranging from 0.67 to 0.94 and the pigment composition. The chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient at 440 nm a(ph)*(440) varied between 0.017 and 0.065 m(2) mg(-1). The influence of the package effect was only observed in the case of large filamentous cyanobacteria like N. spumigena or Nostoc sp. Interestingly, the package effect factor Q(a)*(675) for large-celled Anabaena sp. was 0.92. Besides chlorophyll a, only echinenone, beta-carotene, and phycocyanin were present in all analyzed cyanobacteria strains. Zeaxanthin, which is widely used as a marker pigment for cyanobacteria, was absent in the toxic N. spumigena and Anabaena sp., which are the species that occur in the Baltic Sea most frequently causing summer cyanobacterial blooms. The investigation also showed that the sample preservation technique can introduce some major errors within the absorption band affected by the phycocyanin absorption.					; Wojtasiewicz, Bozena/JCE-4175-2023	Ston-Egiert, Joanna/0000-0002-4274-8979; Wojtasiewicz, Bozena/0000-0002-2878-2134													0921-8971	1573-5176				AUG	2016	28	4					2299	2314		10.1007/s10811-015-0774-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-015-0774-3								27471342					WOS:000383571300018

The diel rates of carbon fixation were completely out of phase with light intensity, the effect being more pronounced at the surface than at depth. This inhibition could be quantitatively reduced by exposing the plankton to incident light passing a graded series of neutral density filters. A maximum rate was found at 20% of incident photosynthetic light at noon (0.10 langley/minute), while photosynthetic efficiency in another experiment had decreased down to 0.06 langley/minute close to the previous midnight The effect of temperature increase upon the photosynthetic uptake in highly inhibited plankton was investigated, and Q10 of about 7 determined. Benthic and noninhibited phytoplankton both had an average Q10 of about 2. A brief sunlight exposure of plankton kept in dim artificial light brought about a reversible depression of photosynthetic rate. The ecological importance of these results to phytoplankton production under the severe Antarctic conditions is discussed.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1963	8	3					313	322		10.4319/lo.1963.8.3.0313	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1963.8.3.0313													WOS:A1963WU65600001
J	Grover, JP				Grover, James P.			Sink or swim? Vertical movement and nutrient storage in phytoplankton	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												A simulation model of vertically migrating phytoplankton is presented, using a Lagrangian, individual based computational approach. Algal cells acquire and store nutrient at the bottom of the habitat, using stored nutrient to grow while in shallower waters. Stored nutrient also governs movement: cells sink when their nutrient quota falls below a threshold; otherwise they rise (or at least sink more slowly). Although the bottom of the habitat provides the growth-limiting nutrient, it also entails a risk of mortality. For a parameter set representing phosphorus-limited algae with a fixed nutrient storage capacity, neither continual sinking nor continual rising are optimal strategies. Instead, an adaptive dynamics approach suggests there is an optimal movement strategy in which cells rise when their storage capacity is partially filled, and otherwise sink. When the movement strategy is fixed in such a way and storage capacity is free to evolve, storage capacity approaches an optimal value several times higher than the minimal quota permitting population growth. Vertical movement and nutrient storage affect the vertical distribution of total nutrient. When cells always sink, total nutrient declines exponentially from the nutrient source at the bottom to a surface minimum. When cells always rise, there is a peak of total nutrient at the bottom, and another at the surface, with a minimum between. When cells move optimally, the vertical distribution of total nutrient can be close to uniform, or have a peak at mid-depth. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Smith, VH				Smith, Val H.			Effects of eutrophication on maximum algal biomass in lake and river ecosystems	INLAND WATERS												To further clarify empirical relationships between maximum phytoplankton biomass per unit total phosphorus (TP) and the maximum: mean phytoplankton biomass ratio, predictive models were created from a meta-analysis of datasets from lakes worldwide. Peak concentrations of planktonic chlorophyll a were on average 2.6 times greater than the mean, with most maximum: mean chlorophyll a ratios falling within less than an order-of-magnitude band (from 1.2 to 6 times the mean value). Peak concentrations of planktonic algal biovolume in 22 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) lakes were on average 3.3 times greater than the mean, with maximum: mean biovolume ratios ranging from 1.2 to 6.3. By contrast, the temporal dynamics of planktonic (suspended) algal biomass in Minnesota streams and rivers were far more constrained; peak concentrations of planktonic chlorophyll a were only on average 1.8 times greater than the mean, with maximum: mean chlorophyll a ratios ranging from 1.3 to 3.8. These data suggest regional differences in maximum chlorophyll a values may exist. Parallel analyses of periphyton biomass in streams and rivers showed far greater variability in the maximum: mean chlorophyll ratio for benthic algae. Peak concentrations of attached chlorophyll a were on average 4.3 times greater than the mean, with the observed maximum: mean chlorophyll a ratios exhibiting exceptionally high variability (ranging from 1.0 to 50 times the mean value), likely reflecting differences in the temporal dynamics of planktonic and benthic algal growth in freshwater ecosystems.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2016	6	2					147	154		10.5268/IW-6.2.937	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-6.2.937													WOS:000376486500005

From 40 to 30 ka, Cryptomeria japonica was dominant around the lake among pinaceous conifers and deciduous broad-leaved trees. During this period, fluctuations of C. japonica are correlated with Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles recognized from the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) record. Increases in the abundance of this taxon may have been caused by wetter summer conditions influenced by the East Asian monsoon or increased snowfall on the Sea of japan side of the Japanese archipelago. Between 29 and 14 ka, pinaceous conifer forests mainly composed of Pinus subgenus Haploxylon. Tsuga, and Picea trees developed. At approximately 23 ka, Picea trees increased in abundance as ARM values decreased. This expansion of Picea trees has been correlated with Heinrich event (HE) 2 in the North Atlantic. At about 14 ka, the distribution of broad-leaved forest (mainly composed of deciduous oaks) began to expand after D-O 1. Evidence of significant vegetation change related to the abrupt Younger Dryas cooling event has not been found. (C) 2010 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Prospective scenarios for water quality and ecological status in Lake Sete Cidades (Portugal):: The integration of mathematical modelling in decision processes	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The design of alternative strategies for water and ecological quality protection at the Lake Verde of Sete Cidades should be coupled with the assessment of future trophic states. Therefore, a mathematical model was developed to make prospective scenarios to reduce the risk of environmental degradation of the lake, and a modified Psenner scheme was used to characterize P distribution in the sediments. The model was able to describe thermal stratification, nutrient cycling (P, NH4 and NO3 dissolved O-2, and phytoplankton dynamics in the water column and adjacent sediment layers. Internal P recycling, resulting from thermal stratification and sediment anoxia, was identified as the main cause for the increase of P concentration in the hypolimnion followed by slow transfer to the epilimnion (about 20 mu g/L annual average). Cyanobacteria blooms during spring were explained by the availability of P and increased water temperature verified during this season. The most sensitive model parameter was sediment porosity. This parameter has a direct effect in dissolved 02 and P profiles and also in phyroplankton biomass. Finally, different water quality restoration scenarios were identified and their effectiveness assessed. Without the adoption of remediation measures (scenario control), Lake Verde water quality would deteriorate with annual average concentrations of total P and phytoplankton biomass (dry matter) reaching 34 mu g/L and 2 mg/L, respectively, after 10 years of simulation. The reduction of P loads (scenario PORAL) into the lake would improve water quality comparatively to the scenario control, reducing the annual average concentrations of total P from 34 mu g/L to 26 mu g/L and of phytoplankton from 2 mg/L down to 1.4 mg/L after 10 years of simulation. in scenario sediments, corresponding to a decrease in the organic content of the sediments, a reduction in the concentrations of total P and phytoplankton is expected in the first two years of simulation, but this effect, would be attenuated throughout the years due to organic matter sedimentation. The best strategy is obtained by combining external and internal measures for P remediation. Finally, it is recommended that the model be used to integrate the results of water quality monitoring and watershed management plans. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the surface water from Mikri Prespa and Kastoria lakes was assessed for its toxic, genotoxic, and cytotoxic effects. Water samples were collected during the spring of two different years (S1 and S2) in order to investigate the anthropogenic effects on both lakes. Physicochemical parameters were identified, while significant elements were determined via ICP-MS/MS. The in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay in cultured human lymphocytes and the Aliivibrio fischeri bioassay were applied to evaluate the genotoxic-cytotoxic and toxic effects, respectively. In the CBMN assay, significant differences were observed in genotoxic and cytotoxic indices between the different time periods. Decreased indices in S2 could be correlated with a potential diminution in the negative human effect on the environment along the lakes. In the Aliivibrio fischeri bioassay, no significant difference in the toxicity of the surface water samples from Mikri Prespa was observed, whereas significant differences were identified in the samples from Lake Kastoria. The differences in toxic, genotoxic, and cytotoxic effects reveal the impact and the influence of anthropogenic activities in the areas of land around the lakes in relation to their surface water quality.					; Vlastos, Dimitris/GSD-9592-2022; Triantafyllidis, Vassilios/AHH-7973-2022	Triantafyllidis, Vassilios/0000-0001-5733-3306; Vlastos, Dimitris/0000-0002-3157-7529; 														2073-445X				JAN	2023	12	1							119	10.3390/land12010119	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12010119													WOS:000950655600001

To evaluate this idea, 121 water bodies with 11 different habitat types were randomly sampled in the province of Kutahya. Water quality measurements indicated high to low (Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+) cations and relatively low (SO42- > Cl- > F-) anion concentrations with Ca2+ being the dominant ion. Sixteen of 23 species were new reports for the area. Alpha diversity (H' = 3.64) was found relatively high. Four most abundant species with ca. 93% of similarities contributed highest alpha values in warm to cooler (lower than 25 degrees C), alkaline (pH 8.22), and fresh to slightly brackish waters. Heterocypris sauna and Ilyocypris bradyi also revealed the highest tolerances for electrical conductivity. Based on habitat type, species were clustered into three main groups (I-III). Canonical Correspondence Analyses explained about 57.4% of correlation between species and environmental variables. Redox potential, pH, water temperature and electrical conductivity were found to be the most effective factors on species occurrences while habitat type and dissolved oxygen were not effective. Total number of species showed strong negative and positive relationships with water temperature and dissolved oxygen, respectively. Results clearly showed that cosmopolitan species exhibited relatively wide tolerance ranges to different environmental variables. Accordingly, having wide tolerance ranges seems to provide advantages to cosmopolitan species, increasing their survival chances in a variety of habitats.					; Akdemir, Derya/B-2635-2019; KÜLKÖYLÜOĞLU, OKAN/A-6441-2018; Dalkıran, Nurhayat/ABE-6749-2020	Yavuzatmaca, Mehmet/0000-0002-0398-6763; Akdemir, Derya/0000-0003-1253-3376; 													0003-4088	2100-000X				JUL 16	2018	54								26	10.1051/limn/2018017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2018017													WOS:000438818800002

We performed end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) of sedimentological data from 912 terrestrial sediment samples collected in the Donggi Cona catchment, north-eastern Tibetan Plateau. Up to the present, this is the largest sedimentological dataset on the Tibetan Plateau. EMMA resulted in the characterisation of three end-members that explain 88% of the variance within the dataset. The end-members all represent aeolian deposits. The first end-member EM 1 represents very fine dune sediments that were deflated from a former lake system. EM 2 represents medium sand deposits that were blown out from playa and alluvial fan sediments. EM 3 represents fine loess(-like) sediments mainly found at higher elevations. Different transformations, adding of a fourth end-member and adding of up to 200 loess samples do not change the composition of the end-members, demonstrating the robustness of the model. EMMA allows the synchronous interpretation of very large datasets, resulting in a general characterisation of sediment transport in a particular area. Performing EMMA on the dataset demonstrates the importance of aeolian transport in this part of the world. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mayo, AL; Davey, A; Christiansen, D				Mayo, Alan L.; Davey, Allen; Christiansen, David			Groundwater flow patterns in the San Luis Valley, Colorado, USA revisited: an evaluation of solute and isotopic data	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater systems in the San Luis Valley, Colorado, USA have been re-evaluated by an analysis of solute and isotopic data. Existing stream, spring, and groundwater samples have been augmented with 154 solute and isotopic samples. Based on geochemical stratification, three groundwater regimes have been identified within 1,200 m of the surface: unconfined, upper active confined, and lower active confined with maximum TDS concentrations of 35,000, 3,500 and 600 mg/L, respectively. The elevated TDS of northern valley unconfined and upper active confined systems result from mineral dissolution, ion exchange and methanogenesis of organic and evaporate lake sediments deposited in an ancient lake, herein designated as Lake Sipapu. Chemical evolutions along flow paths were modeled with NETPATH. Groundwater ages, and delta C-13, delta H-2 and delta O-18 compositions and distributions, suggest that mountain front recharge is the principle recharge mechanism for the upper and lower confined aquifers with travel times in the northern valley of more than 20,000 and 30,000 C-14 years, respectively. Southern valley confined aquifer travel times are 5,000 C-14 years or less. The unconfined aquifer contains appreciable modern recharge water and the contribution of confined aquifer water to the unconfined aquifer does not exceed 20%.																			1431-2174	1435-0157				MAR	2007	15	2					383	408		10.1007/s10040-006-0079-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-006-0079-3													WOS:000244821600015

However, community trait responses of macrophytes to the timing and duration of flood disturbance have been rarely quantified. In 2011-2019, we investigated plant species diversity, density, and biomass in three dominant macrophyte communities (Carex brevicuspis C.B. Clarke, Miscanthus sacchariflorus (Maxim.) Hackel, and Polygonum hydropiper L.) through monthly field surveys in Dongting Lake wetlands. Partial least squares regressions were used to analyze how the variations in hydrological regimes affected plant community traits. Apparent inter-annual fluctuations in plant community traits were detected during 2011-2019. The species richness and Shannon index of diversity of Miscanthus and Polygonum communities increased, whereas the Shannon index of diversity of Carex community decreased. Variation in flooding had a greater effect on Polygonum and Carex community traits than on Miscanthus community traits. Flooding disturbed all plant communities, especially when the duration and timing varied. Shorter inundation periods caused the biomass of Miscanthus community to decline, and that of Carex and Polygonum communities to increase. Earlier flood recession caused the species richness and Shannon index of diversity of Polygonum and Miscanthus community to increase, and those of Carex community to decrease. These findings imply that shorter inundation durations and earlier flood recession generated by the operation of the Three Gorges Dam have changed the macrophyte growth pattern.					; zeng, jing/JDW-4350-2023; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022	Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725; , Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X													1664-462X					MAY 28	2021	12								604677	10.3389/fpls.2021.604677	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.604677								34122461					WOS:000660055000001
J	Watmough, SA; Eimers, C; Baker, S				Watmough, Shaun A.; Eimers, Catherine; Baker, Scott			Impediments to recovery from acid deposition	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT					9th International Acid Rain Conference (Acid Rain)	OCT, 2015	Rochester, NY					In response to large reductions in sulphur (S) emissions over the past 30 years, sulphate (SO42-) concentrations in precipitation at Plastic Lake in south-central Ontario, Canada, have declined by more than 70%. More recent decreases in NOx emissions have similarly led to a reduction in nitrate deposition (NO3-) and consequently the pH of bulk precipitation has increased by approximately 0.8 pH units since 1980. Despite the large decrease in acidic deposition, chemical recovery of the streams, as measured by an increase in pH and decrease in aluminum (Al), has been much less than expected, primarily due to losses of base cations from the shallow, base-poor soils. While nitrogen (N) is almost totally retained within the terrestrial catchment, S export continues to exceed inputs measured in bulk deposition and during the early part of the record approximately 70% of the anions in streams were buffered by calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) compared with only 60% in 2011/12. In the wetland-draining stream (PC1), peak depressions in stream pH and peaks in SO42- and Al concentration in the fall are significantly positively correlated with annual drought days defined as the number of days when stream flow ceases. Even though reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions in Canada have resulted in large improvements in precipitation chemistry, the combined influence of soil acidification and climate-mediated biogeochemical processes occurring in wetlands cause acidification-related issues to persist. Forecasting the longer-term response of soils and surface waters in light of these observations is required to fully assess the need for further emission reductions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the possibility of a longer time difference for soil development before deposition of any tephra, we obtained analytical data and reexamined the study thinking that an age difference of 6000 yr would have implications for soil classification and possibly suggest new series. Holocene tephra in the very fine sand (vfs) fraction (0.05-0.10 mm) ranges from 1% in the ridges to 93% in the troughs. The mean of the vfs fraction tephra content of soils on ridges of the higher, and presumably older, terraces (11%) is significantly less than that of soils on ridges of the lower and younger terraces (45%). The mean tephra content in the troughs (77%) does not vary by terrace level. The maximum fine-earth (< 2 mm) allophane content of the youngest ridge is 96.3 g kg(-1) and that of the youngest trough is 95.4 g kg(-1). These amounts are greater than five times those of ridge soils on the older terraces. Only about 20 to 50% of the estimated Mount Mazama tephra fall remains on the older Bonner and Kootenai soils, whereas the older Rathdrum soil retains about 400% of the estimated Mount Mazama tephra fall. Minor amounts occur in the Histosol on the flood plain. Isotic 50- to 100-mu m thick coatings on some A and B horizon sands indicate that weathering has been minor. Low spodic-horizon indicators (Al-o and Fe-o in subsurface horizons), and high ammonium oxalate extract optical densities of surface horizons, also suggest no fulvic acid leaching. Below the tephra influence, however, the outwash grains have anisotropic clay minerals showing that some weathering may have occurred before deposition of the tephra. The higher allophane content, higher NaF pH, and higher P-retention of lower terrace ridge soils, as compared with higher terrace ridge soils, results mostly from variation in the amount of their tephra and now justifies classifying ridge soils on higher and lower terraces into different taxa and opens the possibility of differentiating soil series by terrace level.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				SEP-OCT	2005	69	5					1422	1431		10.2136/sssaj2000.0221	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2000.0221													WOS:000231817500008

Interplay between antipredator behavior, parasitism, and gut microbiome in wild stickleback populations	NPJ BIOFILMS AND MICROBIOMES												The impact of microbial composition on stress-related behavior in aquatic organisms is poorly understood. This study explored the link between antipredator behavior, parasitism, and the gut microbiome in wild stickleback from two lakes: clear, spring-fed Galtab & oacute;l and turbid, glacial-fed & THORN;ristikla. Behavioral analysis revealed differences between populations, with each exhibiting unique baseline behaviors. Microbiome analysis showed that a small proportion of its variation was explained by population, likely reflecting differences in lake environments. Only the marine genus Pseudoalteromonas abundance differed between populations. Our findings suggest that behavior and microbiome correlations may primarily reflect environmental adaptations and parasite status rather than direct gut-brain interactions. However, some tentative evidence suggests a potential innate connection between some antipredator behavior and microbiome composition. The study highlights the complexity of the gut-brain axis in wild populations and suggests future research directions, including experimental manipulations to uncover causal relationships between microbiome composition and behavior.

This salinisation process is investigated in more detail by two-and three dimensional models together with mearsurements in the area. Zeeland project FRESHEM has provided detailed isohaline maps of the area and Deltares is making transient isohaline maps based on measurements made by an ERT-cable which is situated in Rammegors. These data has been and will be used to investigate which factors; bathymetry, lithology, tides or regional groundwater flow, will have the largest impact on the salinization process in Rammegors. This investigation shows that discretization size has an influence on the speed and spatial distribution of salt plumes. Lithology has the largest influence on the salinization process, followed by bathymetry.

Storage dynamics and streamflow in a catchment with a variable contributing area	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Storage heterogeneity effects on runoff generation have been well documented at the hillslope or plot scale. However, diversity across catchments can increase the range of storage conditions. Upscaling the influence of small-scale storage on streamflow across the usually more heterogeneous environment of the catchment has been difficult. The objective of this study was to observe the distribution of storage in a heterogeneous catchment and evaluate its significance and potential influence on streamflow. The study was conducted in the subarctic Canadian Shield: a region with extensive bedrock outcrops, shallow predominantly organic soils, discontinuous permafrost and numerous water bodies. Even when summer runoff was generated from bedrock hillslopes with small storage capacities, intermediary locations with large storage capacities, particularly headwater lakes, prevented water from transmitting to higher order streams. The topographic bounds of the basin thus constituted the maximum potential contributing area to streamflow and rarely the actual area. Topographic basin storage had little relation to basin streamflow, but hydrologically connected storage exhibited a strong hysteretic relationship with streamflow. This relationship defines the form of catchment function such that the basin can be defined by a series of storing and contributing curves comparable with the wetting and drying curves used in relating tension and hydraulic conductivity to water content in unsaturated soils. These curves may prove useful for catchment classification and elucidating predominant hydrological processes.

Total enzymatic activity as well as specific activities (the ratios between APA and biomass expressed as dry weight, chlorophyll a, cell phosphorus) varied strongly but they followed a similar pattern during each year. The data were processed using correspondence analysis. Specific APA was never related to depth but highest activities were always associated with low particulate phosphorus and nitrogen, low dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations, low chlorophyll a to filament number ratio and zero nitrate in the waters, indicating P and N limiting conditions. However a high N/P ratio, close to Redfield optimum also occurred at these conditions. Low activities were associated only with high chlorophyll a to filament number ratio. The results suggest that, during summer P-depletion and as long as the N/P ratio is close or above an optimum value, the DIP enzymatically regenerated from DOP pool by phosphatases could temporarily contribute to the algal phosphorus supply.																			0018-8158					NOV 22	1990	207						233	240		10.1007/BF00041461	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00041461													WOS:A1990EW45800028

Microcystin mcyA and mcyE Gene Abundances Are Not Appropriate Indicators of Microcystin Concentrations in Lakes	PLOS ONE												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) are a primary source of water quality degradation in eutrophic lakes. The occurrence of cyanoHABs is ubiquitous and expected to increase with current climate and land use change scenarios. However, it is currently unknown what environmental parameters are important for indicating the presence of cyano-HAB toxins making them difficult to predict or even monitor on time-scales relevant to protecting public health. Using qPCR, we aimed to quantify genes within the microcystin operon (mcy) to determine which cyanobacterial taxa, and what percentage of the total cyanobacterial community, were responsible for microcystin production in four eutrophic lakes. We targeted Microcystis-16S, mcyA, and Microcystis, Planktothrix, and Anabaena-specific mcyE genes. We also measured microcystins and several biological, chemical, and physical parameters-such as temperature, lake stability, nutrients, pigments and cyanobacterial community composition (CCC)-to search for possible correlations to gene copy abundance and MC production. All four lakes contained Microcystis-mcyE genes and high percentages of toxic Microcystis, suggesting Microcystis was the dominant microcystin producer. However, all genes were highly variable temporally, and in few cases, correlated with increased temperature and nutrients as the summer progressed. Interestingly, toxin gene abundances (and biomass indicators) were anti-correlated with microcystin in all lakes except the largest lake, Lake Mendota. Similarly, gene abundance and microcystins differentially correlated to CCC in all lakes. Thus, we conclude that the presence of microcystin genes are not a useful tool for eliciting an ecological role for toxins in the environment, nor are microcystin genes (e.g. DNA) a good indicator of toxins in the environment.

Implications of Climate Change on the Heat Budget of Lentic Systems Used for Power Station Cooling: Case Study Clinton Lake, Illinois	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We use a numerical model to analyze the impact of climate change in particular higher air temperatures on a nuclear power station that recirculates the water from a reservoir for cooling. The model solves the hydrodynamics, the transfer of heat in the reservoir, and the energy balance at the surface. We use the numerical model to (i) quantify the heat budget in the reservoir and determine how this budget is affected by the combined effect of the power station and climate change and (ii) quantify the impact of climate change on both the downstream thermal pollution and the power station capacity. We consider four different scenarios of climate change. Results of simulations show that climate change will reduce the ability to dissipate heat to the atmosphere and therefore the cooling capacity of the reservoir. We observed an increase of 25% in the thermal load downstream of the reservoir, and a reduction in the capacity of the power station of 18% during the summer months for the worst-case climate change scenario tested. These results suggest that climate change is an important threat for both the downstream thermal pollution and the generation of electricity by power stations that use lentic systems for cooling.

Phosphorus in sediments of high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada (California): implications for internal phosphorus loading	AQUATIC SCIENCES												In high-elevation lakes of the Sierra Nevada (California), increases in phosphorus (P) supply have been inferred from changes in phytoplankton growth during summer. To quantify rates of sediment P release to high-elevation Sierran lakes, we performed incubations of sediment cores under ambient and reducing conditions at Emerald Lake and analyzed long-term records of lake chemistry for Emerald and Pear lakes. We also measured concentrations of individual P forms in sediments from 50 Sierra Nevada lakes using a sequential fractionation procedure to examine landscape controls on P forms in sediments. On average, the sediments contained 1,445 A mu g P g(-1), of which 5 % was freely exchangeable, 13 % associated with reducible metal hydroxides, 68 % associated with Al hydroxides, and the remaining 14 % stabilized in recalcitrant pools. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that sediment P fractions were not well correlated with soluble P concentrations. In general, sediments behaved as net sinks for P even under reducing conditions. Our findings suggest that internal P loading does not explain the increase in P availability observed in high-elevation Sierran lakes. Rather, increased atmospheric P inputs and increased P supply via dissolved organic C leaching from soils may be driving the observed changes in P biogeochemistry.

Here we present the results of studies investigating factors contributing to higher mercury concentrations in fish in many of these lakes. Twenty-two percent of lake trout, 33% of northern pike, and 50% of walleye populations had mean mercury concentrations > 0.5 mu g/g, the guideline for the commercial sale of fish. Higher mercury concentrations were strongly associated with the relatively old age of MRB predatory fish; mean age ranged from 7.6 to 24.9 years for the three species. In contrast, none of the lake trout sampled in eight lakes further south in northern Saskatchewan and Alberta had mean mercury concentrations > 0.5 mu g/g; fish also were younger (mean age 6 years for the 8 lakes). Mercury concentrations in MRB fish generally increased with fish length, age, and trophic feeding although the nature of these relationships varied with the lake. Mean length was a good predictor of mean mercury concentrations in walleye populations across the study lakes but not for whitefish, lake trout, and pike; age was a good predictor for lake trout and walleye. Mercury concentrations in water and invertebrates were similar to those observed in more southerly regions where fish do not have elevated mercury concentrations. Mercury concentrations tended to be higher in fish in smaller vs. larger lakes and as a probable consequence of higher summer epilimnion temperatures, which favour a higher net methylation rate, and higher mercury and methyl mercury concentrations in water which enter these lakes from the watershed. Increasing fishing pressures on MRB lakes may be a means of reducing mean fish age, improving growth rates, and decreasing mercury body burdens. Increased global warming may result in higher mercury concentrations in fish through increased water temperatures, a longer ice free season, and increased release of stored mercury from the watershed into these takes.

The most significant changes were decreased loads from Lake Huron caused by mussel-induced oligotrophication of the lake, and decreased loads from upgraded Great lakes Water Authority sewage treatment facilities in Detroit. By comparing lake St. Clair inputs and outputs, we demonstrated that on average the lake retains 20% of its TP inputs. We also identified for the first time that loads from resuspended Lake Huron sediment were likely not always detected in US and Canadian monitoring programs due to mismatches in sampling and resuspension event frequencies, substantially underestimating the load. This additional load increased over time due to climate-induced decreases in Lake Huron ice cover and increases in winter storm frequencies. Given this more complete load inventory, we estimated that to reach a 40% reduction in the Detroit River TP load to Lake Erie, accounting for the missed load, point and non-point sources other than that coming from Lake Huron and the atmosphere would have to be reduced by at least 50%. We also discuss the implications of discontinuous monitoring efforts. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great lakes Research.

J	Simon, J				Simon, Janek			Age and growth of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) in the Elbe River system in Germany	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Models to describe the stock dynamics of the endangered European eel, Anguilla anguilla, are needed on river system level to develop conservation management strategies. For these models, estimations of age and growth of local eel stocks are important prerequisites. To investigate the variation of these two parameters I collected 160 European silver eels grouped by 100 mm size classes at capture from the lower part of the Elbe River in Germany during fall 2011. Length of collected eels ranged from 360 mm to 957 mm and age from 7 years to 23 years. Mean age and growth, estimated by otolith increments, were higher for females (14 years, growth 52 mm year(-1)) than for males (13 years, 35 mm year(-1)). Larger females were older and grew faster as compared to smaller females. Across all size classes at capture, the weighted mean age and annual length increment based on the percentage of eels per size class of the migrating silver eels were 13 years and 50 mm year(-1), respectively. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth model L-infinity, k and to for silver eels are given, which can be used to model the dynamics of the eel stock of the Elbe River system.

J	Xu, Y; Koper, KD; Burlacu, R				Xu, Yan; Koper, Keith D.; Burlacu, Relu			Lakes as a Source of Short-Period (0.5-2s) Microseisms	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												We identify and document microseisms produced by wave action in six lakes: The Great Slave Lake, Lake Ontario, Yellowstone Lake, Dianchi Lake, Fuxian Lake, and Erhai Lake. The lakes span more than 2 orders of magnitude in size (areas of 210-27,000km(2)) and sample a range of climatic and tectonic regimes in Canada, the U.S., and China. Lake-generated microseisms create spectral peaks at periods near 1s and are often polarized as Rayleigh waves propagating away from the lake. In contrast to ocean-generated microseisms, lake-generated microseisms are only observed within about 25-30km of the shoreline. This is consistent with the well-known high attenuation of short-period Rayleigh waves (R-g). It is unclear if lake-generated microseisms are produced by a linear shoaling process, analogous to primary ocean microseisms, or a nonlinear wave-wave interaction process, analogous to secondary ocean microseisms. If they are mainly produced by shoaling, lake-generated microseisms might provide a spatially integrated measure of shoreline erosion. Regardless of the source mechanism, lake-generated microseisms appear to provide a record of ice phenology for lakes that freeze in the winter. Such data could contribute to assessing the effects of climate change on high-latitude lakes in remote areas. Finally, it is likely that lake-generated microseisms are useful for imaging the geological structure of the shallow crust, information that is important for quantifying seismic hazard and can be difficult to obtain in urban areas where active source imaging is not feasible.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				OCT	2017	122	10					8241	8256		10.1002/2017JB014808	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JB014808													WOS:000418577900042

Expt. Station and the Lake States Forest Expt. Station was initiated in Richland County, Wis., in the spring of 1940 to obtain information on (a) the productivity of renovated and untreated pastures, (b) the seasonal distribution of the production of such pastures, and (c) the duration of the effects of renovation. Renovated pastures in the 15 to 25% and 26 to 35% slope classes produced av. annual yields of 3,367 and 3,054 lb. of dry matter per acre, respectively, during the 5-yr. period, 1941-45, inclusive. The av. annual yields of dry matter produced by untreated pastures in the 15 to 25% and 26 to 35% slope classes during the same period was 1,776 and 1,131 lb. per acre, respectively. The yields of dry matter were significantly higher from renovated pastures than from untreated pastures in both slope classes during each of the 5 yrs. following renovation. Increases in production results from the lime, fertilizer, seed and tillage required for renovation were obtained at a cost of $4.15 and $3.44 per ton of dry matter from pastures in the 15 to 25% and 26 to 35% slope classes, respectively. The produc-tion of the renovated pastures was more uniformly distributed throughout the growing period during the first 3 yrs. following renovation than that of the untreated pastures. There were approx. only 1/4 and 1/5 as many weeds and 2/5 and 2/3 as many white grubs (Phyllaphaga sp.) per acre in renovated pastures in the 15 to 25% and 26 to 35% slope classes, respectively, as in comparable untreated pastures.																			0095-9650						1946	38	10					914	922																WOS:A1946UC58300007

Using treated wastewater to save wetlands impacted by climate change and pumping	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Wetlands occur where the watertable which underlies much of Perth intersects the land surface. Regional groundwater levels have been falling since the 1970s as a result of lower rainfall and increased extraction causing a loss of environmental and social values. This paper examines a scheme to add almost 2 GL/yr of treated wastewater to infiltration galleries immediately down-gradient of Perry Lakes so that the wetlands may be restored. Modelling suggest that groundwater levels would be raised up-gradient of the galleries, increasing both lake levels and groundwater supplies in the vicinity. It is not envisaged that wastewater will enter the lakes. Adding treated wastewater to nearby trial galleries has shown that phosphorus, pathogens and organic carbon are greatly reduced within 5 to 50m. Nitrogen levels are less reduced but are similar to those in the lakes and nearby aquifer. It is estimated that the wetlands add about $54 m to land prices near the lakes and would add more than $24M to the sale price of proposed nearby land if they contain water. If successful, the proposal could be a test case for the use of treated wastewater to create hydraulic barriers against salt water intrusion into coastal areas.					; Bekele, Elise/F-3740-2011; Tapsuwan, Sorada/G-5869-2010; Smith, Anthony/A-8060-2008; McFarlane, Don/A-7256-2013	Tapsuwan, Sorada/0000-0002-8160-3828; McFarlane, Don/0000-0002-3828-4964; Bekele, Elise/0000-0003-0459-7847; 													0273-1223	1996-9732					2009	59	2					213	221		10.2166/wst.2009.847	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2009.847								19182330					WOS:000262863600003
J	MORI, S				MORI, S			GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATIONS IN FRESH-WATER POPULATIONS OF THE 3-SPINED STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS, IN JAPAN	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												This paper describes an investigation of morphological variation among six freshwater populations (dominantly low-plated morph) of the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, in Japan. Such populations are mainly distributed in restricted water areas within a band from Ise to Wakasa Bays, the most constricted part of Honshu Island. According to some differences in morphological variation, i.e. plate morph, number of lateral plates, body size, body shape and body colour, they were classified into two types corresponding to occurrence in the Ibi River and Lake Biwa water system. The former type was monomorphic dominated by low-plated morphs in spring-fed water, whereas the latter was a dimorphic population consisting of low- and partially-plated morphs. My results suggest that the plate morph type is not correlated with climate nor predation but is related to geological isolation patterns during the course of the landlocking process. Conversely, variations in meristic (number of dorsal and anal fin rays and gill rakers) and morphometric (body shape and body colour) characteristics may have been related to different environmental conditions. This study also provides supporting evidence that the freshwater three-spined stickleback is a distinct species from the anadromous stickleback, G. aculeatus.																			0021-5090	1884-7374				JUN 10	1987	34	1					33	46		10.1007/BF02904141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02904141													WOS:A1987H775300004

Habitat associations with counts of declining Western Grebes in Alberta, Canada	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												During the past several decades, numbers of Western Grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis) have declined throughout their breeding and wintering ranges in North America. We estimated Western Grebe abundance and documented habitat factors between 2007 and 2009 from 43 lakes in Alberta, Canada where Western Grebes historically have occurred, to (1) compare Western Grebe abundance with the relative probability of persistence, and (2) identify habitat correlates of grebe abundance. The relative probability of Western Grebe persistence was correlated with abundance in the study area, although only 19% of the variation in persistence probability was explained by abundance. Western Grebe abundance was positively correlated with the shoreline extent of emergent bulrush (Scirpus lacustris), which is consistent with past studies and underlies the importance of protecting emergent vegetation in efforts to conserve Western Grebes. Grebe abundance also was positively correlated with a longer shoreline perimeter, but was inversely correlated with the amount of forested backshore, which occurred on lakes primarily at the northern margins of Western Grebe range. The amount of backshore development was positively associated with Western Grebe abundance, which might reflect a preference for similar lake characteristics by humans and grebes. These relationships are important to consider in the context of implementing and managing recovery of the Western Grebe in Alberta.

We studied the spatiotemporal within-lake variability of length, sexual size dimorphism (SSD) and sex ratio of A. ephemerella pupae and of larval population densities. Population densities at three sampling sites strongly increased from July to August and were significantly higher at the Reichenau site in July. Acentria ephemerella sex ratio was male-biased at the Guttingen and Hagnau sites, but showed unbiased or slightly biased sex ratios at Reichenau. The SSD was strongly female-biased. Female size and SSD declined during summer, possibly due to reduced food quantity/quality. The SSD was highest at Reichenau, with little to no differences between Hagnau and Guttingen. At Reichenau, the high population size in July coincided with an unbiased sex ratio, and large SSD/female size due to multiple, possibly interacting factors, including fish predation.

Protist diversity in a permanently ice-covered Antarctic Lake during the polar night transition	ISME JOURNAL												The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica harbor numerous permanently ice-covered lakes, which provide a year-round oasis for microbial life. Microbial eukaryotes in these lakes occupy a variety of trophic levels within the simple aquatic food web ranging from primary producers to tertiary predators. Here, we report the first molecular study to describe the vertical distribution of the eukaryotic community residing in the photic zone of the east lobe (ELB) and west lobe (WLB) of the chemically stratified Lake Bonney. The 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) libraries revealed vertically stratified populations dominated by photosynthetic protists, with a cryptophyte dominating shallow populations (ELB-6 m; WLB-10 m), a haptophyte occupying mid-depths (both lobes 13 m) and chlorophytes residing in the deepest layers (ELB-18 and 20 m; WLB-15 and 20 m) of the photic zone. A previously undetected stramenopile occurred throughout the water column of both lobes. Temporal variation in the eukaryotic populations was examined during the transition from Antarctic summer (24-h sunlight) to polar night (complete dark). Protist diversity was similar between the two lobes of Lake Bonney due to exchange between the photic zones of the two basins via a narrow bedrock sill. However, vertical and temporal variation in protist distribution occurred, indicating the influence of the unique water chemistry on the biology of the two dry valley watersheds.

However, few studies have distinguished the amount of meltwater from the total water nourishment of these lakes. We quantified the retained glacial meltwater in glacial lakes by comparing the water balance of glacier-fed and non-glacier-fed lakes in High Mountain Asia (HMA). Results showed that 8.18 +/- 0.64 Gt of meltwater was retained by 8115 (-44 %) of the glacier-fed lakes in HMA from 1990 to 2020 and the annual contribution of glacier melt in HMA to sea-level rise may have therefore been overestimated by -1.5 %. In the glaciation zones, the retained meltwater from glaciers was 6.94 x 103 m3/km2 with a spatial variability over the past 30 years from 0.40 x 103 to 25.29 x 103 m3/km2 across different subregions. Retained glacial meltwater substantially contributed to the increased volume in glacier-fed lakes with an average contribution rate of 92 % across different subregions of HMA.

Deep chlorophyll maxima, spatial overlap and diversity in phytoplankton exposed to experimentally altered thermal stratification	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Although theoretical mechanisms permitting phytoplankton co-existence have been extensively examined, few empirical field tests exist. Competition theory predicts greater diversity when species occupy heterogeneous habitats creating spatial niches. In a whole-lake experiment, we deepened thermoclines in two of three lake basins to examine alterations to the degree to which major algal groups showed spatial overlap (SO), in the vertical water column, and the consequences for diversity. Deeper thermoclines were expected to lead to less SO if species selected different depth positions in the water column in the absence of a thermal barrier, but to lead to greater SO if increased entrainment of phytoplankton in the mixed layer occurred. Increased diversity was expected to accompany less SO. Phytoplankton SO was determined using spectral group depth profiles from a FluoroProbe, and community diversity was estimated using high-performance liquid chromatography-estimated pigment diversity on daily samples taken over a 3-week focal period during the stratified summer period. SO declined and deep chlorophyll maxima were thicker when thermoclines were deepened. Unexpectedly, increases in SO preceded increased diversity by 5-7 days in all basins. This response likely arose from positive growth by most species within the unmanipulated deep chlorophyll maximum. The surprising result of our study, although supported by some theory, stresses the importance of large-scale field tests to validate hypotheses generated by resource-ratio theory.

Bioamplification and the Selective Depletion of Persistent Organic Pollutants in Chinook Salmon Larvae	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The maternal provisioning of yolk to eggs transfers significant quantities of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). As yolk utilization progresses via metabolic activity, there is a potential to realize further increases in POP concentrations if yolk lipids are depleted at a faster rate than POPs, a condition referred to as bioamplification. This study investigated the bioamplification of POPs in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eggs and larvae. Chinook eggs were sampled from the Credit River, ON, Canada, and brought to an aquaculture facility where they were fertilized, incubated, and maintained posthatch until maternally derived lipid reserves became depleted (approximately 168 days). The loss of chemicals having an octanol water partition coefficient (log K-OW) greater than 5.8 was slow to negligible from days 0-135. However, during the increase in water temperatures in early spring, K-OW-dependent elimination of POPs was observed. Bioamplification was maximized for the highest log K-OW POPs, with an approximate 5-fold increase in lipid equivalents concentrations in 168 day old larvae as compared to newly fertilized eggs. This study demonstrates that later yolk-sac Chinook larvae (before exogenous feeding) are exposed to higher lipid equivalents POP concentrations than predicted by maternal deposition, which could lead to underestimates in the toxicity of critical life stages.

Survival and Growth of Walleye Fingerlings Stocked at Two Sizes in 24 Wisconsin Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We compared the performance of walleye Sander vitreus fingerlings of two different sizes that were stocked into Wisconsin lakes during 2004-2007. Small fingerlings were stocked in June at a total length of 1.0-2.0 in. Large fingerlings were stocked in September at a length of 7.0-8.0 m. The study lakes ranged from 120 to 515 acres in surface area and were dispersed north and south across the state. We electrofished the entire shoreline of each study lake with a boomshocker and two dippers during the spring after stocking. The mean age-l catch per effort (CPE) was significantly higher for large fingerlings (11.2/mi) than for small fingerlings (2.8/mi). Location in the state was not significantly related to age-1 CPE. Stocked year-classes were detected for 11 of 12 large-fingerling stocking events but only 7 of 12 small-fingerling stocking events. The total length of age-1 walleyes was not significantly related to size at stocking but varied significantly among locations. Stocking large walleye fingerlings in September at a density of 10/acre resulted in an age-1 CPE that was 4 times greater than small fingerlings stocked in June at a density of 50/acre. Large fingerling stocking also produced more consistent year-classes.																			0275-5947					AUG	2009	29	4					996	1000		10.1577/M08-163.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-163.1													WOS:000272025000016

The pollen data confirm the presence of Meiendorf Interstadial, the first interstadial after the Pleniglacial. The former shallow lake was formed at the end of the Pleniglacial and partly dried out between the Bolling and the Allerod. Lake Laach tephra (12,880 warve yr BP) marks the top of this profile. The intensive colonization with ostracods at the beginning of the Meiendorf Interstadial is characterized by great instability of their populations. Only ostracods from the upper littoral zones of lakes, ponds or temporary pools were found. The stable isotope data (delta O-18, delta C-13) of the valves of the Cypridopsis vidua, Herpetocypris reptans, and Candona candida reflect the different microhabitats of these three species and show a general climatic development during the Meiendorf Interstadial with two summer temperature peaks, one at the beginning and a weaker one in the second half of the Meiendorf Interstadial.

J	QUENSIERE, J				QUENSIERE, J			INFLUENCE OF DROUGHT ON FISHERIES OF CHARI DELTA (1971-1973)	CAHIERS ORSTOM HYDROBIOLOGIE												Monthly inquiries among fishermen were used to study fishing changes within the Chari Delta from Sept. 1972-Dec. 1973. Estimates for the main parameters (unit effort catch, total fishing effort, total catch) are given. The main technique used was gillneting with driffnets. Unit effort catches were not very high at the beginning of the period and only reached 0.26 kg/h per 100 m2 during low water. Such a drop in the catch is connected to hydrological changes which took place in the Sahel at drought time. Drought influence on fish populations is shown at the mains stages within biological cycles. Fall fishermen first concentrate downstream and then leave for better fishing grounds (the northern part of the lake). By April 1973 there was no more commercial fishing within the the Chari delta. The influence of drought fish population structures was studied by means of multivariale analysis. Alestes baremoze and A. dentex were the most important species from 1966-1971, they were then replaced by less stable fish populations (mostly Mochocidae) having greater diversity.																			0373-9422						1976	10	1					3	18																WOS:A1976CA17900001

Morphology of Lakes of the Central Tunguska Plateau (Krasnoyarsk Krai, Evenkiya): New Data on the Problem of the Tunguska Event of 1908	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												The bottom morphology and thickness of bottom sediments of Zapovednoye and Peyungda lakes, which were located on the territory of the Tunguska State Nature Reserve, were studied by echo-sounding and seismic reflection profiling. The lakes are situated at a distance of 50 and 60 km, respectively, from the supposed epicenter of the blast of the Tunguska Event-a massive explosion of unknown nature that occurred in 1908. It is revealed that both lakes have a circular shape and funnel-like morphology with depths of 60 and 34 m, respectively. They are similar in shape and size to Cheko Lake, which, according to some researchers, is a trace of the fall of a celestial body as a result of the Tunguska Event. Previously, the unusual shape of Cheko Lake was assumed to be unique to the area. This fact was one of the main arguments in favor of its impact origin. With the example of Zapovednoye and Peyungda lakes, we showed that the shape of Cheko Lake is not unique to this area; the age of the bottom sediments of Zapovednoye and Peyungda lakes exceeds several thousand years. The similarity of the shape of these three lakes and their location in river channels indicate their common origin and testify against the hypothesis about the impact origin of Cheko Lake as a result of the Tunguska Event of 1908.

Using six different media with pH values ranging from 2.5 to 4.3, 117 isolates were obtained that grouped into 38 different strains, including 27 putative new species with respect to the closest characterized strains. Among the isolated strains, 22 strains were able to oxidize Fe(II), 34 were able to reduce Fe(III) in schwertmannite, the dominant iron oxide in this lake, and 21 could do both. All isolates falling into the Gammaproteobacteria (an unknown Dyella-like genus and Acidithiobacillus-related strains) were obtained from the top acidic sediment zones (pH 2.8). Firmicutes strains (related to Bacillus and Alicyclobacillus) were only isolated from deep, moderately acidic sediment zones (pH 4 to 5). Of the Alphaproteobacteria, Acidocella-related strains were only isolated from acidic zones, whereas Acidiphilium-related strains were isolated from all sediment depths. Bacterial clone libraries generally supported and complemented these patterns. Geobacter-related clone sequences were only obtained from deep sediment zones, and Geobacter-specific quantitative PCR yielded 8 X 10(5) gene copy numbers. Isolates related to the Acidobacterium, Acidocella, and Alicyclobacillus genera and to the unknown Dyella-like genus showed a broad pH tolerance, ranging from 2.5 to 5.0, and preferred schwertmannite to goethite for Fe(III) reduction. This study highlighted the variety of acidophilic microorganisms that are responsible for iron cycling in acidic environments, extending the results of recent laboratory-based studies that showed this trait to be widespread among acidophiles.

J	BUCHER, EH				BUCHER, EH			POPULATION AND CONSERVATION STATUS OF FLAMINGOS IN MAR CHIQUITA, CORDOBA, ARGENTINA	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												This paper presents the results of a 19-year (1969-1987) aerial survey of flamingos carried out in Mar Chiquita, an extensive salt lake of more than 2,000 km2 located in central Argentina. The Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) was the more abundant species, reaching a peak of 66,366 birds counted in February 1975. Breeding was recorded in several years, with a maximum productivity of 29,227 young in 1977. The Andean Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus andinus) is a winter visitor with a population of around 1000 birds. A few james Flamingos (Phoenicoparrus jamesi) were detected. Breeding ceased after 1977 because of the flooding of all breeding habitats, and the adult population decreased sharply. Although flamingos are not seriously endangered at present, I detected several potential threats, including illegal capture for zoos, tourism development, and water pollution. The unpredictable nature of the salt lakes environment and the adaptations developed by the flamingos require long-term research. Habitat preservation is needed at the regional level to ensure the existence of alternative sites for feeding and breeding under varying water level-rainfall conditions.																			0738-6028						1992	15	2					179	184		10.2307/1521451	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521451													WOS:A1992KC53000002
J	Booth, AJ				Booth, AJ			Determination of cichlid-specific biological reference points	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Cichlid-specific biological reference points (BRI's) were calculated with combinations of two stock-recruit relationships within deterministic and stochastic frameworks. From a deterministic perspective, it was shown that spawner biomass-per-recruit should not be reduced to below 31% of pristine levels Such that the risk of recruitment failure is reduced while maintaining at least 75% of maximum yield. Stochastic simulations were more conservative and suggested that with the inclusion of recruitment variability and error in accurately calculating a reference point that spawner biomass-per-recruit should not be reduced to below 40-50%. It is, therefore, suggested that fishing mortality be maintained at no more than that required to reduce spawner biomass-per-recruit to 40% of pristine levels if the form of the spawner-recruit relationship is Unknown. It is further argued that a Beverton-Holt spawner-recruit relationship is possibly the most plausible given current knowledge on cichlid life histories. Spawner biomass-per-recruit Should, therefore, given process uncertainty not be allowed to fall below 45% of unfished levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

S. namaycush) and the progeny of the backcross between splake males and lake trout females are discussed. The planted fish were piscivorous throughout age-groups II-V with rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), sticklebacks (Pungitius [?]) and alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) the dominant food organisms. Hybrid stocks grew more rapidly but attained a somewhat smaller asymptotic length than did lake trout. The F1 hybrids were the earliest to mature with 34% of the males and 4% of the females spawning at age II. Earliest maturity occurred in the backcrosses at age III, in contrast to lake trout which matured predominantly at ages VI and VII. The backcrosses demonstrated a slightly broader thermal and bathymetric distribution during summer than did lake trout, while the F1 hybrids tended to concentrate in the thermocline. Total annual mortality rates (attributed mostly to predation by sea lampreys, Petromyzon marinus) ranged from 62-95% for all of the planted stocks.																									1976	33	11					2402	2407		10.1139/f76-286	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-286													WOS:A1976CL11000002

Washings from 1043 free-flying beetles attracted to 2 types of bait traps from March 30 to June 26 in the Carlos Avery Wildlife Management Area, near Wyoming, were plated on agar media. C. fagacearum was isolated from 7 nitidulids: one collected April 1 and all others collected from May 18 to June 19, 2-3 wk after large numbers of sporulating fungus mats were detected. C. piceae was recovered from 7 beetles trapped during 3 wk. C. fagacearum was recovered from 80 and C. piceae from 17 of 98 nitidulids collected on 5 dates from mats on northern pin oaks at Eagle Lake, near Big Lake. About 30-760,000 viables spores of C. fagacearum were present on the beetles. By scanning electron microscopy, conidia and ascospores of C. fagacearum were found on all external body parts of the insects. Conidia were the predominant spore type on beetles collected in April; ascospores prevailed in May. By carrying C. piceae, nitidulids may play a role in the natural biological control of C. fagacearum.																			0031-949X	1943-7684					1983	73	8					1164	1168		10.1094/Phyto-73-1164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-73-1164													WOS:A1983RJ24000017

Manifestation of climatic change in the ice phenology of Lake Ladoga over the past 55 years	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The article presents results of monitoring changes in some phenological characteristics of the ice cover of Lake Ladoga over the past 55 years. A steady tendency has been observed for a decrease in the duration of ice formation and the area of fast ice since the beginning of the 90s. A comparison is made of the average spatial patterns of ice formation dynamics between the periods 1964-1994 and 1993-2019. Since the beginning of the 90s, there has been a change in the ice characteristics of Lake Ladoga, directly related to a reduction in the duration of the cold period. The duration of ice events averaged over the past 30 years has decreased by about a month compared with the previous thirty-year period. Fast ice began to cover only 30% of the lake surface compared to 80% in previous years. The frequency of winters with incomplete freeze-up (remaining ice free areas) increased from two to six years per decade. The warming effect is most clearly seen in the central part of the lake. Such significant changes in the dynamics of ice phenology cannot but affect the functioning of the entire ecosystem of Lake Ladoga.																			2076-6734	2412-3765					2021	61	2					241	247		10.31857/S2076673421020085	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S2076673421020085													WOS:000655410200007

Temperature and leaf nitrogen affect performance of plant species at range overlap	ECOSPHERE												Plant growth and survival near range limits are likely sensitive to small changes in environmental conditions. Warming temperatures are causing range shifts and thus changes in species composition within range-edge ecotones; however, it is often not clear how temperature alters performance. Through an observational field study, we assessed temperature and nitrogen effects on survival and growth of co-occurring temperate (Acer saccharum) and boreal (Abies balsamea) saplings across their overlapping range limits in the Great Lakes region, USA. Across sampled ranges of soil texture, soil pH, and precipitation, it appears that temperature affects leaf nitrogen for A. saccharum near its northern range limit (R-2 = 0.64), whereas there was no significant leaf N; temperature relationship for A. balsamea. Higher A. saccharum leaf N at warm sites was associated with increased survival and growth. Abies balsamea survival and growth were best modeled with summer temperature (negative relationship); performance at warm sites depended upon light availability, suggesting the shade-tolerance of this species near its southern range limits may be mediated by temperature. The ranges of these two tree species overlap across millions of hectares, and temperature and temperature-mediated nitrogen likely play important roles in their relative performance.

Late Quaternary mega-lakes fed by the northern and southern river systems of central Australia: Varying moisture sources and increased continental aridity	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Optically stimulated and thermoluminescence ages from relict shorelines, along with accelerator mass spectrometer C-14 ages from freshwater molluscs reveal a record of variable moisture sources supplied by northern and southern river systems to Lake Mega-frome in southern central Australia during the late Quaternary. Additional lacustrine, palynological and terrestrial proxies are used to reconstruct a record that extends back to 105 ka, confirming that Lakes Mega-frome and Mega-Eyre were joined to create the largest system of palaeolakes on the Australian continent as recently as 50-47 ka. The palaeohydrological record indicates a progressive shift to more arid conditions, with marked drying after 45 ka. Subsequently, lake Mega-Frome has filled independently at 33-31 ka and at the termination of the Last Glacial Maximum to volumes some 40 times those of today. Further sequentially declining filling episodes (to volumes 25-10 those of today) occurred immediately prior to the Younger Dryas stadial, in the mid Holocene and during the medieval climatic anomaly. Southern hemisphere summer insolation maxima are a poor predictor of palaeolake-filling episodes. An examination of multiple active moisture sources suggests that palaeolake phases were driven independently of insolation and at times by some combination of enhanced Southern Ocean circulation and strengthened tropical moisture sources.

J	Löffler, R; Steinicke, E				Löffler, R; Steinicke, E			Counterurbanization and its socioeconomic effects in high mountain areas of the Sierra Nevada (California/Nevada)	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Resettlement of peripheral areas ("counterurbanization") is driving population growth in the central Sierra Nevada of California and Nevada. The present study analyzes the impact of "urban refugees" on socio-economic conditions in rural high mountain regions (above 1800 m). From 1960 onward, the High Sierra counties have ranked among Californian high mountain regions with the heaviest relative population growth. Tourism provides the most important impulse for the diffusion of metropolitan populations to high altitude areas, and constitutes the major source of employment there. People who migrate to the study areas (Lake Tahoe region and Mammoth Lakes area) tend to be white, well-educated, with considerable household earnings, but do not fall into the senior citizen category. There is no doubt that their demand for vacation or permanent homes has increased housing prices enormously. Planning problems, that tend to come with settlement expansion in high mountain regions represent a certain potential for conflict between people who have been living here for a long period (more than 15 years) and recent, affluent amenity migrants ("newcomers").

To achieve the purpose, this paper proposes an active service framework for flood monitoring based on Sensor Web services and an active model for the concrete implementation of the active service framework. The framework consists of two core components-active warning and active planning. The active warning component is based on a publish-subscribe mechanism implemented by the Sensor Event Service. The active planning component employs the Sensor Planning Service to control the execution of the schemes and models and plans the model input data. The active model, called SMDSA, defines the quantitative calculation method for five elements, scheme, model, data, sensor, and auxiliary information, as well as their associations. Experimental monitoring of the Liangzi Lake flood in the summer of 2010 is conducted to test the proposed framework and model. The results show that 1) the proposed active service framework is efficient for timely and automated flood monitoring. 2) The active model, SMDSA, is a quantitative calculation method used to monitor floods from manual intervention to automatic computation. 3) As much preliminary work as possible should be done to take full advantage of the active service framework and the active model.

Flies expand the repertoire of protein structures that bind ice	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												An antifreeze protein (AFP) with no known homologs has been identified in Lake Ontario midges (Chironomidae). The midge AFP is expressed as a family of isoforms at low levels in adults, which emerge from fresh water in spring before the threat of freezing temperatures has passed. The 9.1-kDa major isoform derived from a preproprotein precursor is glycosylated and has a 10-residue tandem repeating sequence xxCxGxYCxG, with regularly spaced cysteines, glycines, and tyrosines comprising one-half its 79 residues. Modeling and molecular dynamics predict a tightly wound left-handed solenoid fold in which the cysteines form a disulfide core to brace each of the eight 10-residue coils. The solenoid is reinforced by intrachain hydrogen bonds, side-chain salt bridges, and a row of seven stacked tyrosines on the hydrophobic side that forms the putative ice-binding site. A disulfide core is also a feature of the similar-sized beetle AFP that is a beta-helix with seven 12-residue coils and a comparable circular dichroism spectrum. The midge and beetle AFPs are not homologous and their ice-binding sites are radically different, with the latter comprising two parallel arrays of outward-pointing threonines. However, their structural similarities is an amazing example of convergent evolution in different orders of insects to cope with change to a colder climate and provide confirmation about the physical features needed for a protein to bind ice.					; Davies, Peter/KLZ-9236-2024; Graham, Laurie/KJM-7070-2024	Campbell, Robert/0000-0002-5473-5876; Graham, Laurie/0000-0001-7478-1557													0027-8424					JAN 20	2015	112	3					737	742		10.1073/pnas.1422272112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1422272112								25561557					WOS:000348040700039

From the viewpoint of greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting wetland functions comprise sequestration of carbon under anaerobic conditions and methane release. The investigated area in central Siberia covers boreal and sub-arctic environments. Small inundated basins are abundant on the sub-arctic Taymir lowlands but also in parts of severe boreal climate where permafrost ice content is high and feature important freshwater ecosystems. Satellite radar imagery (ENVISAT ScanSAR), acquired in summer 2003 and 2004, has been used to derive open water surfaces with 150 m resolution, covering an area of approximately 3 Mkm(2). The open water surface maps were derived using a simple threshold-based classification method. The results were assessed with Russian forest inventory data, which includes detailed information about water bodies. The resulting classification has been further used to estimate the extent of tundra wetlands and to determine their importance for methane emissions. Tundra wetlands cover 7% (400 000 km(2)) of the study region and methane emissions from hydromorphic soils are estimated to be 45 000 t d(-1) for the Taymir peninsula.

Fluctuations in numbers of great white pelicans at Lake St Lucia in response to changing water-levels	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In January 2004, Lake St Lucia, a major part, of the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park, was reduced to a Fraction of its normal capacity as it result of a severe drought in this region of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. After rains in the area, the lake level rose and then fluctuated considerably over the next 42 months. During the first 38 months the mouth of the estuary into the sea wits closed. The area entered it second severe period of prolonged drought from mid 2005 through to the spring of 2006. Great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus Linnaeus, 1758) numbers and lake levels were monitored during these 42 months. Pelican numbers were highly variable ranging from 0 to 6000. When lake levels were very low or too high, no pelicans were present. Pelican numbers appeared more indicative of food availability. Implications of these trends to the management of the lake and the conservation of the avifauna are discussed. It is suggested that the great white pelican could be used as an indicator species for the fish dynamics of the lake at medium to low lake levels.

Community monitoring of environmental change: College-based limnological studies at Crazy Lake (Tasirluk), Nunavut	ARCTIC												In light of the difficult logistics and high cost of polar research into climate change, involvement of local people can contribute immensely to important data collection. One can use the knowledge and skills of human resources that are already present-teachers, students, and community members. An example is the long-term Arctic monitoring program established at Crazy Lake (63 degrees 51' N, 68 degrees 28'W) near Iqaluit, Nunavut, to monitor snow and ice thickness, biological components, and water chemistry. Nunavut Arctic College students collected basic limnological data at Crazy Lake during spring field camps held between 10 and 16 April in 2005 and 2006. Mean snow depth +/- SD for Crazy Lake was 0.46 +/- 0.13 m (n = 24). White ice averaged 0.13 +/- 0.12 m and black ice 1.38 +/- 0.28 m. Total ice thickness (white ice + black ice) ranged between 0.91 and 1.91 m (mean = 1.51 +/- 0.22 m). The total lake cover (snow + ice) averaged 1.97 +/- 0.20 m. Water depth ranged from 1.48 to 18.58 m (mean = 10.10 +/- 4.99 m).																			0004-0843	1923-1245				MAR	2007	60	1					55	61																WOS:000245373400008
J	Wilkie, JA; Hering, JG				Wilkie, JA; Hering, JG			Rapid oxidation of geothermal arsenic(III) in streamwaters of the eastern Sierra Nevada	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Arsenic redox cycling was examined in source waters of the Los Angeles Aqueduct specifically at Hot Creek, a tributary of the Owens River. Elevated arsenic concentrations in Hot Creek result from geothermal inputs. Total arsenic and As(III) concentrations were determined in the creek and in hot spring pools along its banks. Samples were processed in the field using anion-exchange columns to separate inorganic As(III) and As(V) species. Downstream of the geothermal inputs, decreasing contributions of As(III) to total arsenic concentrations indicated rapid in-stream oxidation of As(III) to As(V) with almost complete oxidation occurring within 1200 m. Based on assumed plug flow transport and a flow velocity of about 0.4 m/s, the pseudo-first-order half-life calculated for this reaction was approximately 0.3 h. Conservative transport of total dissolved arsenic was observed over the reach. Pseudo-first-order reaction rates determined for As(III) oxidation in batch studies conducted in the field with aquatic macrophytes and/or macrophyte surface matter were comparable to the in-stream oxidation rate observed along Hot Creek. In batch kinetic studies, oxidation was not observed after sterile filtration or after the addition of antibiotics, which indicates that bacteria attached to submerged macrophytes are mediating the rapid As(III) oxidation reaction.																			0013-936X					MAR 1	1998	32	5					657	662		10.1021/es970637r	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es970637r													WOS:000072307100041
J	Cottle, HJ				Cottle, HJ			Studies in the vegetation of southwestern Texas	ECOLOGY												The grassland vegetation of an extensive portion of the Trans-Pecos country in southwestern Texas was studied, with especial reference to grazing. The region consists of broad flat valleys lying between detached ranges of low mountains. The altitude of the flats is about 4,000 feet, that of the mountains approximately 7,000. The soils are variable but usually consist of a silt loam of good water-retaining capacity underlaid at about 2 feet with porous, gravelly subsoil. Deep, less pervious clay soils are found in depressions such as ancient lake beds. The annual precipitation is 14 inches; most of it falls July-Oct. Because of the meager but torrential rainfall the drainage is immature and erosion great. Clear weather with high day and low night temp. is a characteristic of the climate. Humidity is relatively low and evaporation often extremely high. The most important factors, water content and evaporation, were measured at 4 stations. No consistent differences were found in the evaporation rates, but the xerophytism of the types of vegetation corresponded in general with the texture and structure of the soil. The less xeric types of vegetation and, in general, the best ground cover occurred on soils with the least run-off and greatest water-holding capacity. However, the density of the cover at all stations was profoundly reduced by over-grazing. At three, the xeric cover, chiefly of Bouteloua gracilis and B. hirsuta, but with Scleropogon brevifolius where overgrazing was worst, cured on the ground during intermittent and extended periods of drought, when available water was exhausted to a depth of 2 feet. The subclimax Hilaria mutica at the lake-bed station had a much larger and more constant water supply, but it too suffered occasional drought. Root relations were determined at all stations. In general, absorption was greatest in the surface soil, but occurred throughout the first 2 feet. Due to overgrazing and breaking of the grass cover, various elements of the xeric woodland, and especially of the desert scrub, are extending into the grassland. Quadrat studies at 4 stations showed that the ground cover varied from 1.2 to 8%. A single year of protection increased it to an average of 7.5%, and 3 years of protection to 12%. Forage production was increased 862% by 3 years of protection, when the forage was removed in the fall. Methods of restoring the range to maximum production are suggested.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1931	12						105	155		10.2307/1932936	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932936													WOS:000200209800006

Bioaccumulation of newly deposited mercury by fish and invertebrates: an enclosure study using stable mercury isotopes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Enriched stable mercury (Hg) isotopes were added to four 10 m diameter enclosures in Lake 239 at the Experimental Lakes Area to increase inorganic Hg loading. Our main objectives were to (i) follow low-level additions (spikes) of isotope-enriched Hg through the biogeochemical cycle and into the food web and (ii) determine the relative contribution of newly deposited Hg to methyl Hg (MeHg) accumulation by fish and other biota. The experiment ran for two summers (2000, 2001), with different enriched Hg isotopes being added each year. Within 1 month of beginning additions in 2000, spike Hg was detected in water, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates as MeHg, and in fish as total Hg (THg; the sum of inorganic and organic Hg). In 2001, concentrations in water of inorganic spike Hg added in 2000 were near detection limits, but concentrations of 2000 spike MeHg in water and biota remained unchanged or greater. Despite comparatively large increases in inorganic Hg loading, accumulation of ambient, non-spike MeHg predominated in all organisms, and spike MeHg never comprised more than 15%, even after 1 year. Our results suggest that changes in Hg loading will affect MeHg concentrations in fish and other biota, but that steady state may not be achieved for at least 10-30 years under conditions similar to our enclosures.

Dynamics of the last four glacial terminations recorded in Lake Van, Turkey	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A well-dated suite of Lake Van climate-proxy data covering the last 360 ka documents environmental changes over 4 glacial/interglacial cycles in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. The picture of cold and dry glacials and warm and wet interglacials emerging from pollen, organic carbon, authigenic carbonate content, elemental profiling by XRF and lithological analyses is inconsistent with classical interpretation of oxygen isotopic composition of carbonates pointing to a more complex pattern in Lake Van region. Detailed analysis of glacial terminations allows for the constraining of a depositional model explaining different patterns observed in all the proxies. We hypothesize that variations in relative contribution of rainfall, snowmelt and glacier meltwater recharging the basin have a very important role for all sedimentary processes in Lake Van. Lake level of glacial Lake Van, predominantly fed by snowmelt, was low, the water column was oxic, and carbonates precipitating in the epilimnion recorded the light isotopic signature of inflow. During terminations, increasing rainfall and significant supply of mountain glaciers' meltwater contributed to lake level rise. Increased rainfall enhanced density gradients in the water column, and hindered mixing leading to development of bottom-water anoxia. Carbonates precipitating during terminations show large fluctuations in their isotopic composition. Full interglacial conditions in lake Van are characterized by high or slowly falling lake level. Rainfall and snowmelt feed the lake but due to re-established mixing, the isotopic composition of authigenic carbonates is heavier and closer to that of evaporation-influenced lake water than that of runoff representing snowmelt and atmospheric precipitation.

This study presents a detailed analysis of sediments from the Donggi Cona catchment on the north-eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. Long- and short-distance sediment transport leads to a complex pattern of aeolian sediment deposition that depends on climatic changes as well as on the availability of sediments. Based on the largest dataset of OSL datings (51) from a single catchment on the Tibetan Plateau so far, different periods of increased sediment transport have been reconstructed. Increased aeolian deposition in this high elevation environment started in the early Holocene with the accumulation of sands from around 10.5 to 7 ka. Loess sediments have been preserved from a period from 10.5 to 7.5 ka. Both archives are related to the strengthening of the Asian summer monsoons characterized by wetter and warmer climate. This change in climate supported the trapping of aeolian sediments. Under full monsoon conditions from around 9 ka onwards fluvial processes resulted in erosion of the aeolian archives and the formation of colluvial sediments until 6 ka. A dry and cooler climate resulted in the reactivation of dune sands from 3 ka to present, possibly in combination with stronger human influence. Aeolian sediments on the Tibetan Plateau therefore indicate two different climatic modes. During the early Holocene wetter conditions were favourable to retain aeolian sediments. The reactivation of sediment in the late Holocene due to small-scale disturbances in the vegetation cover, points to a cooler and drier climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

White sucker (Catostomus commersoni) and walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) were the most common species. The median date of larval drift for walleye was significantly earlier than for all other species. Capture rates of all species were significantly greater during the night than during the day. Larval abundance was positively related to river discharge in the 35 d preceding the median date of larval drift. Larval abundance was also positively related to mature female biomass in Dauphin Lake for walleye, but not for white sucker. Year-class strength of a cohort (catch per unit effort of 3- or 4-year-old fish) in Dauphin Lake was positively related to total larval drift of the same cohort (3 or 4 years earlier) in the Valley River for walleye, but not for white sucker. Our results suggest that the year-class strength of Dauphin Lake walleye is determined very early in the life history and that factors which enhance the natural production of walleye larvae will enhance walleye recruitment.

Characterization of a cold-active bacterium isolated from the South Pole "Ice Tunnel"	EXTREMOPHILES												Extremely cold microbial habitats on Earth (those below -30 degrees C) are rare and have not been surveyed for microbes as extensively as environments in the 0 to -20 degrees C range. Using cryoprotected growth media incubated at -5 degrees C, we enriched a cold-active Pseudomonas species from -50 degrees C ice collected from a utility tunnel for wastewater pipes under Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica. The isolate, strain UC-1, is related to other cold-active Pseudomonas species, most notably P. psychrophila, and grew at -5 degrees C to +34-37 degrees C; growth of UC-1 at +3 degrees C was significantly faster than at +34 degrees C. Strain UC-1 synthesized a surface exopolymer and high levels of unsaturated fatty acids under cold growth conditions. A 16S rRNA gene diversity screen of the ice sample that yielded strain UC-1 revealed over 1200 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) distributed across eight major classes of Bacteria. Many of the OTUs were Clostridia and Bacteriodia and some of these were probably of wastewater origin. However, a significant fraction of the OTUs were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria of likely environmental origin. Our results shed light on the lower temperature limits to life and the possible existence of functional microbial communities in ultra-cold environments.						Sattley, W.

The aim of the studies was to obtain initial data to assess the current ambient conditions of the study area, as well as to develop the project of cleaning the upper stretch of the Tikhomandritsa riverbed and spillway structure construction. Water, bottom sediments and soil contamination levels were identified. It is found that the water quality in the studied water bodies belongs to the contaminated category. Bottom sediments at the upper stretch of the river up to a distance of 2.5 km from its source are pure and can be used in agriculture without restrictions. Bottom sediments samples taken at a distance of 5.5 km from the river source and its mouth contain dangerous level of coliform bacteria. Basing on the territory survey a tree and shurberry felling plan was drawn up and the volume of works of the river purification was determined. The project implementation will help to increase the river flow in dry water years, increase its self-cleaning velocity and environmental improvement of the area. In addition, the increase of water flow into Udomlya lake will provide Kalinin NPP with additional water resources for its process water supply. The conceptual scheme of this study is largely applicable for the basins of other small rivers.

Although Chaohu algae (CHA) is a pollutant, it represents a possible renewable energy source. This work aims to analyze the pyrolysis kinetics of CHA for the production of biochar and show the potential of the biochar for electrochemical applications. The thermal degradation features of CHA were studied using thermogravimetric and TG-FTIR analysis. Meanwhile, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose methods were applied for the evaluation of kinetic parameters. CHA was then pyrolyzed using the microwave-assisted method to obtain biochar. The biochar structure and components were characterized by SEM, XRD, and Raman spectra. And the electrocatalytic performance was measured via cyclic voltammetry (CV) test with the biochar-modified electrode. It was found that the volatile products mainly contained water, methane, carboxylic acid, ketones, aldehyde groups, and NH3 indicated by the real-time online FTIR spectra. And the comprehensive characterization showed that the CHA-derived biochar had unique properties as a superior functionalizing material for electrochemical applications. To sum up, we innovatively proposed to apply the biochar from the pyrolysis of CHA as an electrode functionalizing material and further evaluated the detection performance of the modified electrode.					; 瞿, 昊/AAO-6551-2020; wu, haohao/HGC-4633-2022	Wang, Lu/0000-0001-5440-5511; 													0363-907X	1099-114X				APR	2021	45	5					8083	8090		10.1002/er.6317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/er.6317		DEC 2020											WOS:000598815500001

We use altimeter data from Cryosat-2, SARAL, ICESat, and Jason-2 to detect lake level changes at different spatial and temporal resolutions over 2003 - 2017 (Jason-3 data in 2017 for validation). Cryosat-2's SARIn mode provides precise water level time series over 59 lakes. SARAL's waveforms are retracked to generate near monthly, high-quality measurements at 31 lakes. Jason-2 provides a reference for removing inter-altimeter biases, enabling coherent records over lakes with Jason-2 passes. After a decade of rise since the ICESat record of 2003, the lake levels of Nam Co, Selin Co, Ngangzi Co, and Chibuzhang Co became flat in 2014 - 2016 and started to fluctuate or decline after 2016. Such positive-flat-negative trends are consistent with the trend variations of mass change from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). SARAL detected persistent lake level declines over 2013 - 2016 in southern Tibet that may signify the onset of decadal reduced flows of the Yarlung Tsangpo and Brahmaputra River that could affect the water supply for their downstream regions in India and Bangladesh. Cryosat-2 and Jason-2 detected sudden lake level rises and falls around Zhuonai, Kusai, and Salt Lake associated with a 2011 lake outburst, which is confirmed by lake volume changes from two Landsat-7 images. With a careful processing and calibration, multiple altimeters allow for determining and cross-validating long-term and episodic lake level changes unachievable by a single altimeter.

Here, we present novel chronologically resolved, zooarchaeological taxonomic and taphonomic analysis, and stable isotope analysis of human and faunal tooth enamel, from the site of Panga ya Saidi (c. 78-0.4 ka), Kenya. Zooarchaeological data provide rare insights into the fauna associated with, and utilized by, Late Pleistocene-Holocene human populations in tropical coastal eastern Africa. Combined zooarchaeological and faunal stable isotope data provide some of the only dated, 'on-site' archives of palaeoenvironments beyond the arid interior of eastern Africa for this time period, while stable isotope analysis of humans provides direct snapshots of the dietary reliance of foragers at the site. Results demonstrate that humans consistently utilized tropical forest and grassland biomes throughout the period of site occupation, through a transition from Middle Stone Age to Later Stone Age technological industries and the arrival of agriculture in the region. By contrast, while coastal resources were obtained for use in symbolic material culture, there is limited evidence for consumption of marine resources until the Holocene. We argue that the ecotonal or heterogeneous environments of coastal eastern Africa may have represented an important refugium for populations during the increasing climatic variability of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, and that tropical environments were one of a diverse series of ecosystems exploited by H. sapiens in Africa at the dawn of global migrations.

Land use and ostracod community structure	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Ostracods are important members of the benthos and littoral communities of lake ecosystems. Ostracods respond to hydrochemistry (water chemistry) which is influenced by climatic factors such as water balance, temperature, and chemicals in rainfall runoff from the land. Thus, at local scales, environmental preferences of ostracods and characteristics of lakes are used to infer changes in climate, hydrology, and erosion of lake catchments. This study addresses potential drivers of ostracod community structure and biodiversity at multiple spatial scales using NMS, CART(A (R)), and multiple regression models. We identified 23 ostracod species from 12 lake sites. Lake area, maximum depth, spring conductivity, chlorophyll a, pH, dissolved oxygen, sedimentary carbonate, and organic matter all influence ostracod community structure based on our NMS. Based on regression analysis, lake depth, chlorophyll a, and total dissolved solids best explained ostracod richness and abundance. Land uses are also important community structuring elements that varied with scale; locally and regionally agriculture, wetlands, and grasslands were important. Nationally, using regression tree analysis of lakes sites in the North American Non-marine ostracod database (NANODe), row-crop agriculture was the most important predictor of biodiversity. Low agriculture corresponded to low species richness but greater landscape heterogeneity produced sites of high ostracod richness.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2011	668	1					203	219		10.1007/s10750-011-0711-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0711-7													WOS:000290177300016

In our previous study, we assessed the geomorphological effects of freeze-thaw fluctuations occurring within the cliff of Jeziorsko Reservoir (central Poland). Based on those findings, we have now determined the number of freeze-thaw cycles to assess their historical impact on the studied cliff. We have also traced the directions and the pace of changes in freeze-thaw processes in Poland. The results reveal a gradually decreasing role of freeze-thaw action in the process of the recession of the cliff of Jeziorsko Reservoir throughout its existence. The same is true nearly across Poland, although with some regional variation. Within 1951-2018, the impact of freeze-thaw action declined most significantly in north-western and central Poland, i.e. the area with the smallest annual number of freeze-thaw cycles. Consequently, this is also where the impact of geomorphological results of freeze-thaw cycles will be the least pronounced. It was only in the north-eastern edges of the country, which are under the dominant influence of continental air masses, where no significant changes in the impact of freeze-thaw processes were identified. The obtained results strongly legitimise the conclusion that global warming in the mid-latitude zone of the temperate climate has reduced the role of freeze-thaw processes in the geomorphological transformation of cliffs developed within river banks and lake or water reservoir shores.					; Kaczmarek, Halina/AEF-4328-2022; Krzemiński, Michał/Z-3520-2019	Bartczak, Arkadiusz/0000-0002-9285-6273; Badocha, Michal/0000-0002-5315-4404; Krzeminski, Michal/0000-0002-5596-366X; Kaczmarek, Halina/0000-0002-0650-8134; Tyszkowski, Sebastian/0000-0001-7861-5492													0341-8162	1872-6887				JUL	2021	202								105259	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105259		MAR 2021											WOS:000643594100028

Salt flats in the closed basins in arid northern Chile are extremely important ecological niches. The Salar del Huasco, one of these salt flats located in the high plateau (Altiplano), is a Ramsar site located in a national park and is composed of a wetland ecosystem rich in biodiversity. The proper management of the groundwater, which is essential for the wetland function, requires accurate estimates of recharge in the Salar del Huasco basin. This study quantifies the spatio-temporal distribution of the recharge, through combined use of isotopic characterization of the different components of the water cycle and a rainfall-runoff model. The use of both methodologies aids the understanding of hydrological behavior of the basin and enabled estimation of a long-term average recharge of 22 mm/yr (i.e., 15 % of the annual rainfall). Recharge has a high spatial variability, controlled by the geological and hydrometeorological characteristics of the basin, and a high interannual variability, with values ranging from 18 to 26 mm/yr. The isotopic approach allowed not only the definition of the conceptual model used in the hydrological model, but also eliminated the possibility of a hydrogeological connection between the aquifer of the Salar del Huasco basin and the aquifer that feeds the springs of the nearby town of Pica. This potential connection has been an issue of great interest to agriculture and tourism activities in the region.

Radiological investigations at the "Taiga" nuclear explosion site: Site description and in situ measurements	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												In the summer of 2009, we performed a field survey of the "Taiga" peaceful underground nuclear explosion site, the Perm region, Russia (61.30 degrees N, 56.60 degrees E). The explosion was carried out by the USSR in 1971. This paper provides an extended summary of the available published data on the "Taiga" experiment. A detailed description of the site is illustrated by original aerial and ground-level photos. A large artificial lake (700 m long and 350 m wide) currently occupies the central area of the experimental site. The ground lip surrounding the lake is covered by a newly grown mixed forest. In situ measurements, performed in August 2009, revealed elevated levels of the gamma-ray dose rate in air on the banks of the lake "Taiga". Two hot spots were detected on the eastern bank of the lake. The excess of the gamma-ray radiation is attributable to the man-made radionuclides Co-60 and Cs-137. The current external gamma-ray dose rate to a human from the contaminations associated with the "Taiga" experiment was between 9 and 70 mu Sv per week. Periodic monitoring the site is recommended.

Overall, eutrophication and water-level changes (partly inferred by bisaccate pollen grains) are well-reflected in changes in sedimentation rates of pigments, diatom and cladoceran species composition and other proxies (e.g. Rhabdocoela oocytes). In particular, the stepwise decrease in relative abundance of Pediastrum simplex compared to P. boryanum/P. duplex proved to be a good indicator for eutrophication intensity. Furthermore, reductions in the body size (i.e. coenobia diameter) of Pediastrum simplex were clearly related to phases of low visibility that were caused by lake damming in the 1950 s and by accelerating eutrophication in the 1990 s. During the latter period, strong algal growth led to turbid conditions, which are indicated by the co-occurrence of the diatoms Fragilaria crotonensis, Aulacoseira ambigua and A. granulata, the green algae Staurastrum sp. as well as the cladoceran Anthalona cf. milleri. This study highlights that subfossil remains, which are often found in, for instance, standard cladoceran analysis (green algae such as Pediastrum spp. and Staurastrum spp. or bisaccate pollen grains), can add valuable information to the reconstruction of past environmental conditions and biotic response. Such better and more holistic understanding of freshwater ecosystems is crucial to meet future challenges in a rapidly changing world.					; Chen, Guangjie/AEO-1991-2022; Klamt, Anna-Marie/AAL-9887-2021; Li, Rui/HLW-3197-2023	Chen, Guangjie/0000-0001-8035-6565; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2021	129								107891	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107891		JUN 2021											WOS:000685000000004

Disruption in water quality patterns along the river continuum by a large bottom release dam	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Understanding longitudinal variation in water quality along rivers and how they are influenced by large dams is important for both ecological theory and river management. This study examines longitudinal changes in water quality downstream of a large bottom release dam (Lake Copeton) on the Gwydir River, Australia. We compared longitudinal changes in water quality variables from sites upstream and downstream of Lake Copeton over a two-year period and a total river distance of approximately 200 km. Lake Copeton acted as a source of nitrogen as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and phosphorus as filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP). A significant increase in the concentration of NOx and FRP was evident downstream of the dam, particularly in summer with elevated concentrations detected up to 60 km downstream. Significantly lower chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations and electrical conductivity (EC) were evident below the dam. Mean nutrient concentrations declined with increased distance downstream of Lake Copeton while Chl-a concentrations increased, suggesting uptake by autotrophs. This study suggests that Copeton Dam disrupts the river continuum for nutrients, Chl-a and EC as predicted by the serial discontinuity concept, with recovery occurring approximately 60 km downstream.

Spatial variation in dinoflagellate recruitment along a reservoir ecosystem continuum	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Physical and chemical gradients across ecosystems, such as stream-to-lake continua within human-made reservoirs, provide valuable opportunities to examine how organisms respond to changing environments. We quantified the rate of dinoflagellate recruitment across a small reservoir to test the hypothesis that organisms are controlled by different factors along a reservoir continuum. We predicted that recruitment would be tightly coupled with reservoir physics in the riverine zone and closely related to water chemistry in the lacustrine zone. For the dominant dinoflagellate genus in the reservoir, Peridinium, recruitment from the sediments accounted for a median of 16% of increases in pelagic cell abundance throughout the summer. As predicted, Peridinium recruitment rates at the riverine site were correlated with physical variables, while at the lacustrine site, recruitment rates were highly correlated with water chemistry (e.g. nutrient ratios and dissolved oxygen). Recruitment patterns of the second most common genus, Gymnodinium, were not correlated with environmental variables, though Gymnodinium's much lower densities suggest that its dynamics were controlled by other factors. Our results reveal that the physical-biological coupling controlling algal recruitment, which can play a large role in pelagic population growth and bloom formation, can vary substantially on a spatial gradient within even a small reservoir.

In a 1st step, the percent cover of every species in each community served to calculate the similarity between the 44 sites. The data were then analyzed by principal coordinate analysis and hierarchic agglomeration cluster analysis. The study of the ordination and the dendrogram revealed 12 principal groups. Subsequently, a discriminant analysis, based on 6 physical parameters, identified the parameters which most contribute to discrimination between the groups. Those parameters are pH, depth, alkalinity and amount of dissolved O2. The classification resulting from the discriminant analysis agrees in a proportion of 72.97% with the original classification based on the floristic composition. A contingency table was analyzed to establish the role of each individual parameter on every one of the groups. The causality of this discrimination is discussed in relation to fine partitioning of shallow waters in the littoral zone.																			0008-4026						1983	61	2					400	411		10.1139/b83-047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b83-047													WOS:A1983QF41300003

Fate of polycyclic aromatic compounds from diluted bitumen spilled into freshwater limnocorrals	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Diluted bitumens (dilbits) are produced by mixing highly viscous bitumen with lighter petroleum products to facilitate transport. The unique physical and chemical properties of dilbit may affect the environmental fate and effects of dilbitderived chemical compounds when spilled. To further explore this, we monitored experimental spills of Cold Lake Winter Blend (CLWB) dilbit for 70 days in limnocorrals installed in a freshwater boreal lake. A regression design with 2 controls and 7 treatments was used to assess the fate and behaviour of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) as they partitioned from the dilbit into the air, water column and sediments. Treatments ranged from 1.5 to 180 L of CLWB, resulting in oil:water ratios ranging between 1:71000 to 1:500 (v:v). We began to detect elevated concentrations of PACs as early as 6 h post-addition in the air, 12 h post-addition in the water column, and 15-28 d post-addition in the sediments. By the end of the experiment, concentrations of PACs had largely declined in the water column but remained elevated in the sediments. Our results demonstrate that under conditions typical of temperate boreal lakes, only a small proportion of PACs from dilbit enters the aquatic system, but even so, may produce concentrations of ecotoxicological concern, especially in the sediments, which is the ultimate sink for dilbit-derived PACs.

Their dating and forcing mechanisms have however remained controversial. Even more crucially, it is uncertain whether earlier events represent climatic regimes similar to the LIA. Here we produce and analyse a new 7500-year long palaeoclimate record tailored to detect LIA-like climatic regimes from northern European tree-ring data. In addition to the actual LIA, we identify LIA-like ca. 100-800 year periods with cold temperatures combined with clear sky conditions from 540 CE, 1670 BCE, 3240 BCE and 5450 BCE onwards, these LIA-like regimes covering 20% of the study period. Consistent with climate modelling, the LIA-like regimes originate from a coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice North Atlantic-Arctic system and were amplified by volcanic activity (multiple eruptions closely spaced in time), tree-ring evidence pointing to similarly enhanced LIA-like regimes starting after the eruptions recorded in 1627 BCE, 536/540 CE and 1809/1815 CE. Conversely, the ongoing decline in Arctic sea-ice extent is mirrored in our data which shows reversal of the LIA-like conditions since the late nineteenth century, our record also correlating highly with the instrumentally recorded Northern Hemisphere and global temperatures over the same period. Our results bridge the gaps between low- and high-resolution, precisely dated proxies and demonstrate the efficacy of slow and fast components of the climate system to generate LIA-like climate regimes.					; Stoffel, Markus/A-1793-2017; Jones, Philip/C-8718-2009; Matskovsky, Vladimir/O-7929-2016; Hall, Richard/A-3931-2013	Helama, Samuli/0000-0002-9777-3354; Arppe, Laura/0000-0003-4445-6096; Jones, Philip/0000-0001-5032-5493; Oinonen, Markku/0000-0002-0881-7643													0930-7575	1432-0894				JUN	2021	56	11-12					3817	3833		10.1007/s00382-021-05669-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-021-05669-0		FEB 2021						34776646					WOS:000615560100003

Results show that several altitude-related variables are significantly relevant for the distribution of all mollusks (i.e., temperature, sediment organic content). Others respond more precisely to some variables: fine substrate proportion increases the probability of finding Pisidium sensu lato (mostly Euglesa species), and the latter, the macrophyte presence, and Ampullaceana balthica. Despite the low acid-neutralizing capacity in many of the lakes, only the distribution of A. balthica was significantly constrained by this factor, independent from elevation. The results confirm a likely altitudinal expansion of the distributions of all species, particularly toward lakes with a summer surface temperature increasing above 12 degrees C. The pace of change is expected to differ among species according to different nonlinear thresholds in thermal response, which temperature value increases from Pisidium s.l. to Ampullaceana to Ancylus, and the taxon-specific sensitivity to substrates and chemical conditions.

Evaporation from a shallow, saline lake in the Nebraska Sandhills: Energy balance drivers of seasonal and interannual variability	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Despite potential evaporation rates in excess of the local precipitation, dry climates often support saline lakes through groundwater inputs of water and associated solutes. These groundwater-fed lakes are important indicators of environmental change, in part because their shallow water levels and salinity are very sensitive to weather and climatic variability. Some of this sensitivity arises from high rates of open-water evaporation, which is a dominant but poorly quantified process for saline lakes. This study used the Bowen ratio energy budget method to calculate open-water evaporation rates for Alkali Lake, a saline lake in the Nebraska Sandhills region (central United States), where numerous groundwater fed lakes occupy the landscape. Evaporation rates were measured during the warm season (May October) over three consecutive years (2007-2009) to gain insights into the climatic and limnological factors driving evaporation, as well as the partitioning of energy balance components at seasonal and inter annual time scales. Results show a seasonal peak in evaporation rate in late June of 7.0 mm day(-1) (on average), with a maximum daily rate of 10.5 mm day(-1) and a 3-year mean July-September (JAS) rate of 5.1 mm day(-1), which greatly exceeds the long-term JAS precipitation rate of 1.3 mm day(-1). Seasonal variability in lake evaporation closely follows that of net radiation and lake surface temperature, with sensible heat flux and heat storage variations being relatively small, except in response to short-term, synoptic events. Interannual changes in the surface energy balance were weak, by comparison, although a 6-fold increase in mean lake level over the three years (0.05-0.30 m) led to greater heat storage within the lake, an enhanced JAS lake-air temperature gradient, and greater sensible heat loss. These large variations in water level were also associated with large changes in absolute salinity (from 28 to 118 g kg(-1)), with periods of high salinity characterized by reductions in mass transfer estimates of evaporation rate by up to 20%, depending on atmospheric conditions and absolute salinity. Energy balance estimates of evaporation, on the other hand, were found to be less sensitive to variations in salinity. These results provide regional insights for lakes in the Nebraska Sandhills region and implications for estimation of the energy and water balance of saline lakes in similar arid and semi-arid landscapes.

There are significant differences in the spatiotemporal evolution of C-4 plant abundance at different latitudes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and the factors responsible remain debated. In this study, we reconstructed the spatiotemporal pattern of C-4 plants in China since the LGM, based on a synthesis of delta C-13 records of soil organic matter from paleosol sequences and delta C-13 records of individual n-alkanes from lake and marine sediments. The results indicate that, spatially, maximum C-4 abundance during the LGM was in South China; while maximum C-4 abundance occurred in the Chinese Loess Plateau in North China during the early and mid-Holocene. Temporally, in North China, C-4 plant abundance initially increased since the LGM, reached a maximum during the early and mid-Holocene and then decreased; however, the opposite trend occurred in South China. Combined with a physiological-process model used to study the sensitivity of C-3 and C-4 plants to changes in climate and atmospheric pCO(2) in different regions, our results reveal that temperature was the dominant factor driving C-4 plant expansion in North China, whereas atmospheric pCO(2) and precipitation were the main factors controlling C-4 plant abundance in South China.

J	Söderberg, J				Soderberg, Johan			Land prices and pure economic rents in the late medieval crisis	SCANDIA												The late medieval agrarian crisis has been discussed in Swedish research for a long time. While there is general agreement that rents declined from the mid-fourteenth century and onwards, there are different opinions with regard to the chronology of this process. There is also disagreement regarding the extent to which the Church was affected by this crisis. In order to achieve a more reliable view of the crisis, we need to gather the available information on land prices and rents in a more systematic way. This article presents a long time series based on about 1,300 purchases of real estate property in the Lake Malar provinces and about 2,100 quotations relating to the size and composition of the rent during the period of 1274-1540. In these provinces, farm sizes were often set in a number of oresland. These oresland were not fixed areas but rather a measure of the production capacity of the farm. As a rough average, one oresland corresponded to about three hectares of land, out of which half was sown each year. Using this information, it is possible to construct a time series of land prices and rents per oresland. The main source used here is SDHK (Svenskt Diplomatariums huvudkartotek), a digital publication providing information on about 44,000 documents up to 1540. The main results may be summarized as follows. Land prices rose substantially before the Black Death and remained at a very high level up to about 1370. A long period of falling prices followed until about 1420/30. There was no clear trend during the remainder of the fifteenth century, while the first four decades of the sixteenth century were characterized by a downward pressure on land prices. The evolution of rent is fairly similar to that of land prices. However, rents rose relative to the land price during the first decades of the fourteenth century and reached a very high level before the Black Death. Subsequently, rents fell until the 1430s. Which social category was the most adversely affected by the declining rent? The answer depends on the time perspective. For the period as a whole, 1274-1540, the nobility suffered the greatest loss. During the century following the Black Death, however, the Church lost more than the nobility and the commoners, while the latter fared best. The Church retrogressed as a buyer of land in the second half of the fourteenth century. Despite increased activity during the latter part of the fifteenth century, it is clear that the Church was less successful as a buyer in the long run, compared to noblemen and commoners. The nobility advanced substantially as a buyer of land, particularly during the half-century following the Black Death. During the same period, the nobility also increased the size of their purchases, while they also paid a higher price per oresland compared to the other categories. However, the view of the nobility advancing strongly is modified when we not only study purchases but also sales. The net result of purchases and sales was positive for the Church, but negative for nobility and commoners. The Church sold only relatively small parts of their land. Commoners gradually became more active in the land market. In the long run, trade in land was to comprise larger units than previously. Before 1400, the median size of purchases was around 3 1/2 oresland, which was probably less than what was needed for subsistence. During the first half of the fifteenth century, the median size grew to four oresland, and in the second half of the century it exceeded five oresland. This trend is to be seen against the backdrop of falling land prices, enabling greater numbers of people to buy sufficiently large farms. It corresponds with the increased emphasis during the late medieval period on promoting the view that peasants should cultivate as much land as was sufficient for the provision of the household, taxes and other dues. Nor should the amount of land cultivated be too large. The law of 1442 outlawed a peasant to buy more freehold land than he needed for being adequately provisioned (fullsutten). This law was part of a broader set of anti-capitalist regulations aiming to limit the role of capital in the farmland trade. The late medieval land price decline may have produced favorable conditions for applying these regulations, thereby contributing to counteracting a deeper socioeconomic polarization among peasants. Finally, some calculations of profitability (the ratio of rent to price) have been carried out. They suggest that the average of this ratio was around five percent (a median of seven percent) during the fourteenth century as well as during the first half of the fifteenth century. Profitability rose somewhat during the second half of the fifteenth century, but a clear upward trend cannot be seen until the early sixteenth century. It may be surprising that profitability was stable for a long time after the Black Death, but we should keep in mind that land prices fell as much or even more than rents.																			0036-5483						2019	85	2					10	29																WOS:000506935200002

HORIZONTAL FLUX OF SUSPENDED PARTICLES SAMPLING BY BIG SPRING NUMBER EIGHT (BSNE) SAMPLER IN LAKE URMIA AREA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Lake Urmia has become one of the key dust sources in northwestern of Iran due to a sharp drop in its water level that caused an increasing dried land around the lake area. There has not been any studied concerning of how much dust is emitted and transported in this area. The aim of this research study was to measure the amount of dust suspended particles flux in the lake area. To implement this objective, 56 aeolian dust samplers were mounted at 0.15, 0.5, 1 and 2 m heights in 14 different poles and the suspended particles flux was measured during one year period. The data showed that the flux in March, June, and October accounted for 53% of the annual total. The suspended particles flux decrease rapidly with increasing height of soil surface. The obtained data showed that the suspended particles flux is strongly correlated with the amount of monthly precipitation and mean wind velocity but there was no significant relationship between monthly suspended particles flux and speed of the strongest wind. The result also showed that the wind direction did not influence flux. Different heights of the soil surface, sampling times and sampling sites had significant (P = 0.01) effects on flux.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2018	16	2					1313	1327		10.15666/aeer/1602_13131327	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1602_13131327													WOS:000429542000025

Study sites were selected using a probability sample and the digitized version of the 1:100,000 scale USGS map stream network as the sample population. Both classified Thematic Mapper (TM) and USGS Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) data were used to quantify land cover in the study watersheds. On average, the most common land cover was forest (77 %) followed by agriculture (20 %), and urban (1 %). Multiple regression analysis showed that concentrations of Cl-, nutrients, acid neutralization capacity, and base cations were the analytes most strongly related to watershed land cover. Despite large differences in resolution and age of the TM and LULC data sources, similar results were obtained with the two sources. Using a greater number of land cover subclasses did not greatly improve the land cover-chemistry relationships. Ecoregions with predominantly forested land cover had weaker relationships than ecoregions with more agricultural and/or urban land cover. In studies or databases without land cover information, Cl- concentration is a good surrogate indicator for general human disturbance in the watershed.					; Herlihy, Alan/R-2172-2017; Johnson, Colleen/HJI-8052-2023; Stoddard, John/H-5594-2013	Stoddard, John/0000-0002-2537-6130; Herlihy, Alan/0000-0001-5812-7408; 													0049-6979					JUL	1998	105	1-2					377	386		10.1023/A:1005028803682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005028803682													WOS:000075277100035
J	Pitman, KJ; Moore, JW				Pitman, Kara J.; Moore, Jonathan W.			The role of large, glaciated tributaries in cooling an important Pacific salmon migration corridor: a study of the Babine River	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Climate change and its associated symptoms, such as warming air temperatures, glacier retreat, reduced snowpack, and increased variability in precipitation, are warming rivers and lakes. Such warming water temperatures threaten cold-water fishes in some regions. For instance, warm water temperatures can kill or harm anadromous Pacific salmon as they migrate upstream to spawning grounds. In this study, we assessed how tributaries, and their relative watershed properties, shape temporal and spatial dynamics of temperatures during the summer months in a salmon migratory river. We focused on the mainstem of the Babine River of British Columbia, an important migratory corridor for steelhead and the five eastern Pacific salmon species, but particularly for sockeye salmon that spawn in stream reaches above the Babine Lake, at the river's headwaters. We discovered that large glacier- and snowpack-fed tributaries cooled the Babine River by approximately 2 degrees C over its 96 km length. Different tributaries played different temperature functions. Cooler and more glacierized rivers were associated with a bigger change in temperature between upstream and downstream sites. Understanding how water temperatures change during adult salmon migration, especially within riverscapes on the edge of potentially harmful temperatures, can help inform proactive management options in a warming world.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2021	104	10					1263	1277		10.1007/s10641-021-01152-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-021-01152-1		OCT 2021											WOS:000702613400002

By the end of 1986 the artificial lake will be taken up to an elevation of 270 m, enlarging it to a surface area of 4,300 km2. The Guri empoundment is oligotrophic. It has a single period of deep circulation from January to June. During stratification multiple thermoclines are formed between 2 and 40 m depth. Oxiclines usually correspond with the thermoclines Damming of the Caroni River has reduced the distribution of those fish species that are associated with falls and rapids. However, other species have benefitted from the extension of their habitats and some species that were absent from the original river have colonized the empoundment. A faunal inventory carried out in the cone to be flooded indicated 35 species of amphibians, 76 species of reptiles, 326 species of birds and some 100 mammal species for this area. It was decided that a global wildlife salvage operation was not justified. The vegetation to be submerged was evaluated with the object of providing baseline data for the interpretation of future environmental changes in the lake.																			0378-1844					NOV-DEC	1986	11	6					325	333																WOS:A1986E714100010

The dam creates a 3.7 km long reservoir, with a very popular linear park running alongside. This water body has esthetic value and allows recreational boating. With its anti-tidal gates, the dam protects from flooding during very high spring tides in the St. Lawrence. However, the dam has completely changed the formerly natural estuary into a channel with sedimentation formed from the organic and inorganic sediment influx coming from the semi-urban, urban and forest watershed. Highly productive fish runs up the St. Charles are a thing of the past and significant reduction in dissolved oxygen is now often observed. Furthermore, the dam may actually increase the risk of flooding in the Lower Town under high flows. One-dimensional simulations (HEC-RAS) were performed to assess the dam's impact on flood risks for different bottom gate settings and two-dimensional simulations (RIVER 2D) were performed to assess the dam's impact on river velocities and sedimentation processes.																			0315-1468	1208-6029				NOV	2016	43	11					1007	1016		10.1139/cjce-2016-0241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjce-2016-0241													WOS:000388094500008

Reconstruction of the Peretolchin Glacier fluctuation (East Sayan) during the 20th century inferred from the bottom sediments of proglacial Lake Ekhoi	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												We present results of study of the bottom sediments of proglacial Lake Ekhoi, which is fed with the Peretolchin Glacier meltwater (East Sayan). The bottom deposit sequence, formed from 1885 to 2013, was investigated with a year-season time resolution, using X-ray fluorescence with synchrotron radiation (with and without scanning), the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, and color processing of core photos. The depth-age model of the core was based on counting of annual laminate layers with control by Pb-210, Cs-137, U-238, and Ra-226 chronology. Intense glacier thawing was calculated from the amount of clastic matter supplied by the glacier meltwater into the lake. The elemental composition of the bottom sediments includes three groups reflecting periods of displacement of the glacier front and the intensity of evolution of aquatic biota. The first group of elements (Ca, K, Ti, Fe, and Mn) characterizes the supply of clastic matter without serious changes in the glacier edges. The second group (Ni, Cu, Br, and U) is responsible for the intensity of evolution of aquatic biota. Finally, the third group (Rb, Sr, Zr, Nb, Y, and Th) can describe the intensity of displacement of the glacier front. Intensive glacier thawing has proceeded since 1920; however, the glacier retreat was insignificant till 1947. From 1947 to 1970, the glacier rapidly retreated, especially in the period 1953-1970. This was induced by steady high regional summer surface temperature in 1938-1970. The following glacier retreat was during 1980-2000, synchronously with the global temperature anomaly in the Northern Hemisphere. Since 2000, the melting has slowed. (C) 2015, V.S.

First, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was able to complex with Cu2+, and the reaction product, the copper-PVA complex, was precipitated in excess acetone. Sequentially, the precipitate was separated by decantation and dissolved in a minimum amount of water. Finally, the copper ions were determined by the sodium diethyldithiocarbamate spectrophotometric method. Some related parameters that might affect the recovery of the copper were investigated in detail. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the detection limit is 0.014 A mu g mL(-1) and the linearity range is from 0.025 to 3.00 A mu g mL(-1). The relative standard deviation (n = 11) is 1.1%. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of copper in spring water, ground water, tap water, lake water and electroplating waste water. A possible mechanism of the method is also proposed.																			0026-3672	1436-5073				APR	2009	165	1-2					103	107		10.1007/s00604-008-0105-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00604-008-0105-3													WOS:000264487000014

Palaeomagnetism and geochronology of mafic dykes in south Siberia, Russia: the first precisely dated Early Permian palaeomagnetic pole from the Siberian craton	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												New palaeomagnetic and geochronological data from mafic dykes emplaced into the basement of the Siberian Craton on the southwestern coast of the Baikal Lake are present. The concordant zircon U-Pb SHRIMP age of these dykes is 275 +/- 4 Ma. Palaeomagnetic study of the dykes isolated a stable primary remanence with steep upward direction supported by a positive baked contact test. The palaeomagnetic pole (50.5 degrees N, 121.4 degrees E, A(95) = 16.7 degrees) is the first precisely dated Siberian pole between similar to 360 and 260 Ma. It falls near the interpolated Siberian APWP and suggests that Siberia had not joined Eurasia by 275 Ma. The studied dykes are the first reported evidence of Permian magmatic activity in the cratonic part of southern Siberia. They are probably related to the prominent 300-260 Ma magmatic event recognized in Trans-Baikalia. The comparison of our new result with recently published palaeomagnetic data from Trans- Baikalia suggests that differential movements between the Siberian Craton and blocks of Trans-Baikalia around 275 Ma are unlikely. This confirms tectonic models considering Trans-Baikalia as an Andean-type active margin of the Siberian continent in Permian times.					; Pisarevsky, Sergei/T-2882-2019; Donskaya, Tatiana/B-1034-2014	Pisarevskiy, Sergei/0000-0002-8033-5630; De Waele, Bert/0000-0003-3396-7878; Donskaya, Tatiana/0000-0003-1141-0518													0956-540X	1365-246X				NOV	2006	167	2					649	658		10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03160.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03160.x													WOS:000241766800017
J	Boronat, MD; Miracle, MR				Boronat, MD; Miracle, MR			Size distribution of Daphnia longispina in the vertical profile	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th International Symposium on Cladocera	AUG 08-15, 1996	POSTOJNA, SLOVENIA	Natl Inst Biol, Ljubljana, Ecol Assoc Slovenia				D. longispina of the meromictic lake El Tobar is a round-headed form. It never has a helmet, but in summer a small proportion of immature individuals (0.9-1.2 mm females and males) have one or two neck teeth. The size structure of this Daphnia population, as well as the vertical distribution and migration of different size-classes, were studied in September and November of 1991 and April of 1992. The large variation in mean size and size at first reproduction, as well as the occurrence of different patterns of vertical migration are interpreted as responses to different predator situations. At the end of April, when Daphnia mortality by visually hunting predators is dominating, a typical nocturnal migration is adopted and size distribution is biased to smaller size classes. In November, when mortality is mainly attributed to the nocturnally migrating Chaoborus, Daphnia shows a reversed migration pattern. In September, when the population of Daphnia is responding to both visual (fish) and non-visual predators (Chaoborus), it adopts a pattern of twilight migration. The presence of neck teeth in vulnerable size classes in September might be an additional adaptative response to Chaoborus predation. In September, the size structure of the Daphnia population is shifted to larger classes and the vertical distribution of size classes shows a pronounced segregation between juveniles and adults. Juveniles are found closer to the surface, while adults dwell predominantly in the rich, deep waters near the oxicline. This suggests that an additional advantage of the ascent of the adult Daphnia exploiting those deep resources is the release of young in more oxygenated and warmer waters. The Daphnia population of lake El Tobar is known to be clonally diverse, and the changing frequency of genotypes could play an important part in the observed seasonal differences in behaviour and size.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC 24	1997	360						187	196		10.1023/A:1003173504463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003173504463													WOS:000073482200022

This study illustrates how an ancestral marine community has undergone radical simplification leaving a small number of well-adapted species. Our objective was to investigate the species composition and annual dynamics of dinoflagellate communities in three saline Antarctic lakes. We observed that dinoflagellates occur year-round despite extremely low PAR during the southern winter, which suggests significant mixotrophic or heterotrophic activity. Only a small number of dominant dinoflagellate species were found in each lake, in contrast to the species-rich Southern Ocean from which the lake communities are believed to be derived. We verified that the lake species were representatives of the marine polar dinoflagellate community, and not freshwater species.

To better characterize the health risk posed by this emerging waterborne pathogen, we investigated the occurrence of Arcobacter spp. in Lake Erie beach waters. During the summer of 2010, water samples were collected 35 times from the Euclid, Villa Angela, and Headlands (East and West) beaches, located along Ohio's Lake Erie coast. After sample concentration, Arcobacter was quantified by real-time PCR targeting the Arcobacter 23S rRNA gene. Other fecal genetic markers (Bacteroides 16S rRNA gene [HuBac], Escherichia coli uidA gene, Enterococcus 23S rRNA gene, and tetracycline resistance genes) were also assessed. Arcobacter was detected frequently at all beaches, and both the occurrence and densities of Arcobacter spp. were higher at the Euclid and Villa Angela beaches (with higher levels of fecal contamination) than at the East and West Headlands beaches. The Arcobacter density in Lake Erie beach water was significantly correlated with the human-specific fecal marker HuBac according to Spearman's correlation analysis (r = 0.592; P < 0.001). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that most of the identified Arcobacter sequences were closely related to Arcobacter cryaerophilus, which is known to cause gastrointestinal diseases in humans. Since human-pathogenic Arcobacter spp. are linked to human-associated fecal sources, it is important to identify and manage the human-associated contamination sources for the prevention of Arcobacter-associated public health risks at Lake Erie beaches.

The swamp, moor and bog forest. vegetation of Central Alberta	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The climax formations of Alberta consisting of northern spruce-fir forest, cordilleran coniferous forest, poplar parkland and prairie grassland are briefly described and mapped. The swamp and bog forests in the first 3 of these formations are described in detail. In morainic basins about the lake margins in the cordilleran region are bands of sedge moor, of Betula glandulosa and of bog forest dominated by Picea mariana together with some Larix laricina. The floor of the forest is covered with Hypnum cristata-castrensis and Hylocomium and a scanty non-ericaceous flora. In the northern forest region the succession is similar but sphagnum is more common, spreading into the cariceta with ericaceous vegetation. The low moors have a pH of 5.0-6.5 and the high moors 4.0-5.5. In the parkland, reed-swamps and low moors are associated with sloughs and lakes. The low moors are dominated bv cariceta, saliceta, and gramineta and the high moors by Ledum., bog forests being rare. The destruction of moors by burning, drainage, and by the influx of springs rich in Ca salts is described.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1928	16						19	70		10.2307/2255842	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2255842													WOS:000200131800002

In this region, the Wda River flows in polygenetic valleys, typical for the young glacial landscape of the northern central European lowlands. The middle section of this river provides a suitable setting to demonstrate the environmental and hydrological changes in the Late Glacial and early Holocene, because (1) it is a small and well-defined area and (2) the existence of a morphologically preserved river valley from late glacial period. In this study, we focused on a short terrestrial sediment core (48 cm) that represents four phases of landscape evolution during the early Holocene: telmatic, lacustrine, lacustrine-fluvial and alluvial. Abrupt changes in lithology and sediment structures exhibit rapid changes and threshold processes in environmental conditions. The AMS C-14 dating of terrestrial plant remains revealed an age for the basal sediments of 11 223 +/- 23 cal BP and thus falls within the Preboreal biozone. Plant macrofossil indicators provide evidence of water level and edaphic changes in the basin. The results of our study demonstrate a strong influence of melting buried ice blocks on the geomorphological development, hydrological changes in the catchment, and the biotic environment in the early Holocene.

Six 1-year-old females and males and six 2-year-old or older (adult) females and males were slaughtered and their carcasses were processed. The chemical composition, mineral contents and fatty acid composition of the loin were measured. No marked influence of gender or age was noted in the chemical composition of loin. In the mineral contents, significant differences were noted. The potassium and sulfur contents were lower and the sodium content was higher in adult deer meat (P<0.05, respectively) and the potassium content was higher in male deer meat (P<0.05). Arsenic, cadmium or lead were not detected. In the unsaturated fatty acid, a significant interaction was detected (P<0.05), and it was high in 1-year-old female deer meat and low in 1-year-old male deer meat.

J	Rowe, DK; Chisnall, BL				Rowe, DK; Chisnall, BL			Ontogenetic habitat shifts by Galaxias gracilis (Galaxiidae) between the littoral and limnetic zones of Lake Kanono, New Zealand	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Diel and spatial differences in distribution were determined for the larvae, juveniles, and adults of Galaxias gracilis (Galaxiidae) in a New Zealand dune lake during summer months. Larvae (mostly 10-25 mm TL) and juveniles (25-40 mm TL) inhabited shallow (0-3 m) waters of the limnetic zone and fed predominantly on two limnetic zooplankton species; Bosmina meridionalis and a calanoid copepod. At about 40 mm TL, fish moved from the limnetic to the littoral zone and expanded dietary breadth from two to over seven main prey species, including five species of littoral invertebrates. After reaching a size of about 60 mm TL, most fish moved back offshore to the deeper waters (5-15 m) of the limnetic zone during the day, moving back to the littoral zone at night to feed on invertebrates. The selection of different intra-lacustrine habitats by the various size groups of G. gracilis, and the movements between them, are interpreted as adaptive responses to the interaction between ontogenetic changes in feeding requirements and predation risk.																			0378-1909					JUL	1996	46	3					255	264		10.1007/BF00005001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005001													WOS:A1996UV98000005
J	Ferrer, FM; Hobart, K; Bailey, JV				Ferrer, Fernando Medina; Hobart, Kathryn; Bailey, Jake, V			Field detection of urease and carbonic anhydrase activity using rapid and economical tests to assess microbially induced carbonate precipitation	MICROBIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY												Microbial precipitation of calcium carbonate is a widespread environmental phenomenon that has diverse engineering applications, from building and soil restoration to carbon sequestration. Urease-mediated ureolysis and CO2(de)hydration by carbonic anhydrase (CA) are known for their potential to precipitate carbonate minerals, yet many environmental microbial community studies rely on marker gene or metagenomic approaches that are unable to determinein situactivity. Here, we developed fast and cost-effective tests for the field detection of urease and CA activity using pH-sensitive strips inside microcentrifuge tubes that change colour in response to the reaction products of urease (NH3) and CA (CO2). The urease assay proved sensitive and useful in the field to detectin situactivity in biofilms from a saline lake, a series of calcareous fens, and ferrous springs, finding relatively high urease activity in lake samples. Incubations of lake microbes with urea resulted in significantly higher CaCO(3)precipitation compared to incubations with a urease inhibitor, showing that the rapid assay indicated an on-site active metabolism potentially mediating carbonate precipitation. The CA assay, however, showed less sensitivity compared to the urease test. While its sensitivity limits its utility, the assay may still be useful as a preliminary indicator given the paucity of other means for detecting CA activity in the field. Field urease, and potentially CA, activity assays complement molecular approaches and facilitate the search for carbonate-precipitating microbes and theirin situactivity, which could be applied toward agriculture, engineering and carbon sequestration technologies.

The maximum phytoplankton pigment concentrations are located differently depending on the type of thermal stratification and light availability. In general, there were three situations observed during the summer stratification: the euphotic zone did not extend to the thermocline and the highest chlorophyll concentration developed above the thermocline level, at the bottom of the euphotic zone (type I); the euphotic zone reached beyond the thermocline, and the maximum chlorophyll concentration occurred above the thermocline (type II); or the euphotic zone was much greater than the thermocline depth and the peak phytoplankton density was located below the thermocline (type III). In metalimnetic samples, the most dominant cyanobacteria belonged to the Reynolds Functional Groups (RFG) H1, S1 , and Lo ; their occurrence differed depending on the types of light and thermal regimes. It was assumed that vertical heterogeneity affects the ecological status assessment based on phytoplankton. Calculating the two applied indices (TI index and Q index) based on metalimnetic and epilimnetic data (as opposed to only epilimnetic data) yielded worse ecological status in > 70% of cases.					; Pasztaleniec, Agnieszka/AAO-9883-2021; Ochocka, Agnieszka/HKO-2499-2023	Pasztaleniec, Agnieszka/0000-0001-5857-1189; Ochocka, Agnieszka/0000-0002-3863-4696													1642-3593	2080-3397				OCT	2021	21	4					760	774		10.1016/j.ecohyd.2021.05.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2021.05.001		DEC 2021											WOS:000748798800016
J	Haugland, RA; Siefring, SC; Wymer, LJ; Brenner, KP; Dufour, AP				Haugland, RA; Siefring, SC; Wymer, LJ; Brenner, KP; Dufour, AP			Comparison of Enterococcus measurements in freshwater at two recreational beaches by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and membrane filter culture analysis	WATER RESEARCH												Cell densities of the fecal pollution indicator genus, Enterococcus, were determined by a rapid (3 h or less) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) analysis method in 100ml water samples collected from recreational beaches on Lake Michigan and Lake Erie during the summer of 2003. Measurements by this method were compared with counts of Enterococcus colony-forming units (CFU) determined by Method 1600 membrane filter (MF) analysis using mEI agar. The QPCR method had an estimated 95% confidence, minimum detection limit of 27 Enterococcus cells per sample in analyses of undiluted DNA extracts and quantitative analyses of multiple lake water samples, spiked with known numbers of these organisms, gave geometric mean results that were highly consistent with the spike levels. At both beaches, the geometric means of ambient Enterococcus concentrations in water samples, determined from multiple collection points during each sampling visit, showed approximately lognormal distributions over the study period using both QPCR and MF analyses. These geometric means ranged from 10 to 8548 cells by QPCR analysis and 1-2499 CFU by MF culture analysis in Lake Michigan (N = 56) and from 8 to 8695 cells by QPCR and 3-1941 CFU by M F culture in Lake Erie (N = 47). Regression analysis of these results showed a significant positive correlation between the two methods with an overall correlation coefficient (r) of 0.68.

J	Frishfelds, V; Murawski, J; She, J				Frishfelds, Vilnis; Murawski, Jens; She, Jun			Transport of Microplastics From the Daugava Estuary to the Open Sea	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												This study considers the transport of microplastics (MPs) from inland waters (rivers and lakes) to coastal waters and then to the open sea. A three-dimensional MP Eulerian tracer model based on the HIROMB-BOOS model (HBM) with wave-induced transport and biofouling process is used. Multilayer two-way nested model grids with 3-0.5-0.25-0.05 nautical mile resolutions are applied to resolve relevant riverine-estuarial-coastal hydrodynamics with a focus on the southern waters in the Gulf of Riga. The major river of the Gulf of Riga, Daugava, is governed by the Riga Hydro Power Station (RHPS) with high daily and weekly variability of the runoff creating more intense outflows during its working hours. This gives additional complexity when calibrating this model. The model results are validated against MP observations that are collected on various cruises in the summer of 2018 in the Gulf of Riga. There exists a strong synoptic variability in the observations, which are also reproduced. As the rivers are the primary source of MPs, a special backtracking algorithm was developed to find the most possible source of pollutants at a given location and time. The backtracking algorithm includes optimization with respect to salinity in order to prefer trajectories coming from freshwater and, consequently, MP sources. Lagrangian drift studies are performed for events with high precipitation in the estuary domain when sewer overflow at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can occur, and the results are compared with different MP components in observations.

Walleye in the Grand River, Ontario: An overview of rehabilitation efforts, their effectiveness, and implications for eastern Lake Erie fisheries	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Walleye (Sander vitreus) from the Grand River (Ontario) are recognized as geneticalty and physiologically distinctfrom other Lake Erie stocks. The low abundance of these walleye in the earty 1980s triggered rehabilitation efforts that included intensive research, transfers of walleye from the Thames River (Ontario), supplemental stocking from local hatcheries, construction of a fishway, and creation of additional spawning habitat. Walleye migrating from Lake Erie are currently hindered from reaching 90% of potential riverine spawning habitat by a dam 7 km upstream. Although increased wait-eye catch rates were reported following construction of a fishway in 1995, recent assessment has shown that access is still severely restrained. Catch rates of young-of-the-year walleye during fall surveys have increased notably since 1999, coincident with direct transfers of mature adults over the barrier. Recent successful year classes have contributed to a population dominated by young (< 5 y) fish. Genetic analyses show that fish culture contributed between 3% and 25% to five recent year classes of Grand River walleye. Facilitating access to spawning habitat above the Dunnville dam may be the most effective way to increase the productivity of this stock, with consequent strengthening of walleye fisheries and the fish community in the eastern basin of Lake Erie.

J	Bayer, TK; Burns, CW; Schallenberg, M				Bayer, Tina K.; Burns, Carolyn W.; Schallenberg, Marc			Application of a numerical model to predict impacts of climate change on water temperatures in two deep, oligotrophic lakes in New Zealand	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We applied a numerical hydrodynamic model (DYRESM) to two large, deep New Zealand lakes that are characterised by deep thermoclines and high wind forcing, to assess their sensitivity to changes in climate. Modifications to standard model parameters were necessary for the successful application of DYRESM. Predictions from downscaled global circulation models suggest an increase in mean air temperature, rainfall, and wind speeds. Modelling the hydrodynamics of the lakes suggests that increasing air temperatures would offset the cooling influences of increased rainfall and river flows, resulting in warmer overall lake temperatures, and an earlier, longer, and shallower thermal stratification. These physical changes could affect phytoplankton production as their light limitation would decrease in duration and intensity. However, deeper mixing caused by increases in wind speed would negate this reduction of thermocline depth. While warmer air temperatures appear to be the dominant driver of changes in thermal structure, changes in other meteorological factors, especially wind speed, are important in predicting future hydrodynamics. Compared to large, deep lakes in the Northern Hemisphere, the predicted warming rates in Lakes Wanaka and Wakatipu are slower, due partly to a lower predicted rate of atmospheric warming and the absence of winter ice cover in these lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2013	713	1					53	71		10.1007/s10750-013-1492-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1492-y													WOS:000319080900004

J.; Carrier, Patrick; Boutin, S.; Boonstra, R.; Hofer, Elizabeth			Mushroom crops in relation to weather in the southwestern Yukon	BOTANY												Epigeous mushroom production in the boreal forest ecosystem varies dramatically from year to year. We tested the hypothesis that the above ground production of epigeous mushrooms in the Kluane region, Yukon, could be predicted by summer rainfall. There is a single crop in this part of the boreal zone with maximum production during the first 2 weeks of August. We measured standing crops from 1993 to 2007 at 13 areas along 210 km of the Alaska Highway and Haines Road in the Southwestern Yukon. Above ground mushroom crops averaged 24 kg/ha wet weight but varied from 0.0 to 117 kg/ha over the 15 years Of Study, with a coefficient of variation among years of 143%. Epigeous mushroom production could be predicted from June rainfall of the current year and May rainfall of the year previous with R-2 = 0.85. Part of the lack of a perfect fit to rainfall was due to the constraint that years of high mushroom crops could not be followed by another high year, no matter what the rainfall pattern. We were not able to identify the species of mushrooms in this study but we confirm from natural history observations that mushrooms are a critical food for several of the small mammal species in the Yukon boreal forest.

J	Al-Weshah, RA				Al-Weshah, RA			The water balance of the Dead Sea: an integrated approach	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The Dead Sea is the lowest spot on Earth. It is a closed saline lake located in the middle of the Jordan Rift Valley between Lake Tiberias and the Red Sea. Its major tributaries are the Jordan River itself and the Dead Sea side wadis. The Dead Sea has a unique ecosystem and its water has curative, industrial and recreational significance. The level of the Dead Sea has been continuously falling since the early 1930s at an average rate of 0.7 m per year. The water level, as of February 1998, is about 410.9 m below mean sea level. In this paper, a water balance model is developed for the Dead Sea by considering different hydrological components of this water balance, including precipitation, runoff, evaporation and groundwater flow. This model is calibrated based on historical levels of the Dead Sea. Different scenarios are investigated, including the proposed Dead Sea-Red Sea Canal. This project is supposed to halt the shrinking of the Dead Sea and restore it to pre-1950 levels in the next century. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, the underlying conditions of emergence and spread of avian influenza viruses (AIV) have not been studied in detail, particularly the complex spatiotemporal interplay of viral transmission between wild and domestic ducks, two major actors of AIV epidemiology. In this synthesis, we examine the risks of avian influenza spread in Poyang Lake, an area of intensive free-ranging duck production and large numbers of wild waterfowl. Our synthesis shows that farming of free-grazing domestic ducks is intensive in this area and synchronized with wild duck migration. The presence of juvenile domestic ducks in harvested paddy fields prior to the arrival and departure of migrant ducks in the same fields may amplify the risk of AIV circulation and facilitate the transmission between wild and domestic populations. We provide evidence associating wild ducks migration with the spread of H5N1 in the spring of 2008 from southern China to South Korea, Russia, and Japan, supported by documented wild duck movements and phylogenetic analyses of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 sequences.

Leaf litter degradation in the wave impact zone of a pre-alpine lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Contrary to streams, decomposition processes of terrestrial leaf litter are still poorly understood in lakes. Here, we examined the decomposition of two leaf species, beech (Fagus sylvatica) and poplar (Populus nigra 'italica') in the littoral zone of a large pre-alpine lake at a wave exposed site. We focussed on the shredding impact of benthic invertebrates in a field experiment and on the effects of wave-induced disturbances under field and mesocosm conditions. In contrast to our expectations, benthic shredders did not reveal an important role in leaf processing under the conditions of the field experiment (early spring time, wave impact zone). Strong wave turbulence during storm events significantly reduced leaf mass, FPOM and invertebrate densities at field conditions. Several reasons can explain the low importance of shredders in our field study: (a) phenology of the shredder species, (b) feeding preferences and alternative food sources for gammarids, (c) generally low abundance of the native gammarid species due to the recent occurrence of an invasive predator, (d) disturbance of shredder activity due to high wave impact and (e) relatively low food value of the offered leaves. We suggest that leaf litter decomposition in lakes occurs in specific process domains, which largely depend on the hydraulic characteristics and on water-level fluctuations.

J	Luoto, TP; Nevalainen, L				Luoto, Tomi P.; Nevalainen, Liisa			Solar and atmospheric forcing on mountain lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We investigated the influence of long-term external forcing on aquatic communities in Alpine lakes. Fossil microcrustacean (Cladocera) and macrobenthos (Chironomidae) community variability in four Austrian high altitude lakes, determined as ultra-sensitive to climate change, were compared against records of air temperature, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and solar forcing over the past similar to 400 years. Summer temperature variability affected both aquatic invertebrate groups in all study sites. The influence of NAO and solar forcing on aquatic invertebrates was also significant in the lakes except in the less transparent lake known to have remained uniformly cold during the past centuries due to summertime snowmelt input. The results suggest that external forcing plays an important role in these pristine ecosystems through their impacts on limnology of the lakes. Not only does the air temperature variability influence the communities but also larger-scale external factors related to atmospheric circulation patterns and solar activity cause long-term changes in high-altitude aquatic ecosystems, through their connections to hydroclimatic conditions and light environment. These findings are important in the assessment of climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems and in greater understanding of the consequences of external forcing on lake ontogeny.

Geomorphic evolution of the Le Sueur River, Minnesota, USA, and implications for current sediment loading	MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION OF FLUVIAL SYSTEMS WITH BROAD HISTORICAL CHANGES AND HUMAN IMPACTS	Geological Society of America Special Papers				Annual Meeting of the Geological-Society-of-America	OCT 28-31, 2007	Denver, CO	Geol Soc Amer				There is clear evidence that the Minnesota River is the major sediment source for Lake Pepin and that the Le Sueur River is a major source to the Minnesota River. Turbidity levels are high enough to require management actions. We take advantage of the well-constrained Holocene history of the Le Sueur basin and use a combination of remote sensing, field, and stream gauge observations to constrain the contributions of different sediment sources to the Le Sueur River. Understanding the type, location, and magnitude of sediment sources is essential for unraveling the Holocene development of the basin as well as for guiding management decisions about investments to reduce sediment loads. Rapid base-level fall at the outlet of the Le Sueur River 11,500 yr B. P. triggered up to 70 m of channel incision at the mouth. Slope-area analyses of river longitudinal profiles show that knickpoints have migrated 30-35 km upstream on all three major branches of the river, eroding 1.2-2.6 x 10(9) Mg of sediment from the lower valleys in the process. The knick zones separate the basin into an upper watershed, receiving sediment primarily from uplands and streambanks, and a lower, incised zone, which receives additional sediment from high bluffs and ravines. Stream gauges installed above and below knick zones show dramatic increases in sediment loading above that expected from increases in drainage area, indicating substantial inputs from bluffs and ravines.					; Gran, Karen/NXX-5369-2025; Wilcock, Peter/A-3299-2010; Jennings, Carrie/I-3360-2019	Jennings, Carrie/0000-0002-0845-3253; Gran, Karen/0000-0001-9832-3016; 													0072-1077		978-0-8137-2451-5				2009	451						119	130		10.1130/2009.2451(08)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2009.2451(08)													WOS:000273004100009

However, water had the potential to flow as ground water from the upper to the lower wetland during only a few instances, A water-table trough adjacent to the lower semipermanent wetland was the most common water-table configuration during the first 4 years of the study, but it is likely that severe drought during those years contributed to the longevity and extent of the water-table trough, Water-table mounds that formed In response to rainfall events caused reversals of direction of flow that frequently modified the more dominant water-table trough during the severe drought. Rapid and large water-table rise to near land surface in response to intense rainfall was aided by the thick capillary fringe. One of the wettest summers on record ended the severe drought during the last year of the study, and caused a larger-scale water-table mound to form between the two wetlands. The mound was short in duration because it was overwhelmed by rising stage of the higher seasonal wetland which spilled into the lower wetland. Evapotranspiration was responsible for generating the water-table trough that formed between the two wetlands, Estimation of evapotranspiration based on diurnal fluctuations in wells yielded rates that averaged 3-5 mm day(-1). On many occasions water levels in wells closer to the semipermanent wetland indicated a direction of Bow that was different from the direction indicated by water levels in wells farther from the wetland. Misinterpretation of direction and magnitude of gradients between ground water and wetlands could result from poorly placed or too few observation wells, and also from infrequent measurement of water levels in wells.					; Rosenberry, Donald/C-2241-2013	Rosenberry, Donald/0000-0003-0681-5641; 													0022-1694					APR	1997	191	1-4					266	289		10.1016/S0022-1694(96)03050-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1694(96)03050-8													WOS:A1997XG47200014

F. Muller) Bergh. As one might expect from the eutrophic character of the ecosystem, the complete size-biomass spectrum is dominated by large phytoplankton and small zooplankton. The relation between numerical abundance (N, organisms per ml) and body size (V, mum3) for the overall size spectrum is described by the model log N = 7.25-0.99 99 log V (r2 = 0.93). However, the existence of tendencies in the points around the regression line suggest limiting linear scaling to the size range of unicells (log N = 6.34-0.51 log V, r2 = 0.85). The size structure shows the less negative slope at the level of the thermocline and when the bloom of C. hirundinella reaches its maximum. In the epilimnion, important taxonomic changes have no effect on the size structure, which appears to be a conservative character of the planktonic community at this level.

PATTERNS OF ORGANIC-CARBON ENRICHMENT IN A LACUSTRINE SOURCE ROCK IN RELATION TO PALEO-LAKE LEVEL, CONGO BASIN, WEST AFRICA	DEPOSITION OF ORGANIC-CARBON-RICH SEDIMENTS: MODELS, MECHANISMS, AND CONSEQUENCES	Society for Sedimentary Geology Special Publication											The Barremian Marnes Noires Formation is a rich lacustrine source rock in the Congo Basin, West Africa. Organic matter was derived largely from algae, altered by bacterial action. Detailed profiles of % total organic carbon (TOC) from long cores demonstrate that lake hydrology and deposition of organic matter are closely related. Two-to four-fold decreases and increases in %TOC correspond to falls and rises in lake level, respectively, varying at time scales of several hundred thousand years. Smaller-scale %TOC cycles have developed over time periods of approximately 10,000 to 80,000 years. %TOC values correlate positively with the carbon isotope compositions of organic matter and with the Al2O3 content of shale. These relationships are interpreted to reflect a productivity-controlled process, with high %TOC values associated with high influxes of nutrients during periods of high rainfall and chemical weathering. TOC content shows no correlation with organic and inorganic geochemical and paleontological proxies for redox condition, indicating that the rift lake was generally depleted in oxygen but not anoxic and suggesting that oxygen levels did not exert a significant influence on variation in source-rock quality.					; Freeman, Katherine/H-5140-2011	Freeman, Katherine/0000-0002-3350-7671; 													1060-071X		978-1-56576-110-0				2005	82						103	123																WOS:000269050600006

Foreseen Effects of Climate-Impacted Scenarios on the Photochemical Fate of Selected Cyanotoxins in Surface Freshwaters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Cyanobacteria populate most water environments, and their ability to effectively exploit light and nutrients provide them with a competitive advantage over other life forms. In particular conditions, cyanobacteria may experience considerable growth and give rise to the so-called harmful algal blooms (HABs). HABs are often characterized by the production of cyanotoxins, which cause adverse effects to both aquatic organisms and humans and even threaten drinking water supplies. The concentration of cyanotoxins in surface waters results from the budget between production by cyanobacteria and transformation, including photodegradation under sunlight exposure. Climate change will likely provide favorable conditions for HABs, which are expected to increase in frequency over both space and time. Moreover, climate change could modify the ability of some surface waters to induce phototransformation reactions. Photochemical modeling is here carried out for two cyanotoxins of known photoreaction kinetics (microcystin-LR and cylindrospermopsin), which follow different phototransformation pathways and for particular freshwater scenarios (summertime stratification in lakes, water browning, and evaporative water concentration). On this basis, it is possible to quantitatively predict that the expected changes in water-column conditions under a changing climate would enhance photodegradation of those cyanotoxins that are significantly transformed by reaction with the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ((CDOM)-C-3*). This is known to be the case for microcystin-LR, for which faster photodegradation in some environments would at least partially offset enhanced occurrence. Unfortunately, very few data are currently available for the role of (CDOM)-C-3* in the degradation of other cyanotoxins, which is a major knowledge gap in understanding the link between cyanotoxin photodegradation and changing dimate.					; Vione, Davide/A-4047-2008	ROSARIO-ORTIZ, FERNANDO/0000-0002-3311-9089; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 17	2021	55	16					10928	10934		10.1021/acs.est.1c03440	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c03440		AUG 2021						34342987					WOS:000687063400005

Efficacy of Iodine for Disinfection of Lake Sturgeon Eggs from the St. Lawrence River, New York	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Optimal fish husbandry to reduce the risk of disease is particularly important when using wild fish as the source for gametes. The propagation and reestablishment of Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens in New York waters to become a viable self-sustaining population is considered a high priority by managers. While standard hatchery egg disinfection practices have been used to prevent the transmission of diseases, data on the bacterial loads present on egg surfaces following iodine disinfection is lacking. Our study investigated the bacteria present on the outer surface of Lake Sturgeon eggs and the effectiveness of an iodine disinfection treatment in eliminating bacteria that could pose a threat to egg survival and cause hatchery disease outbreaks. During the springs of 2011-2013, 12 to 41 different species of bacteria were recovered fromthe outer egg surfaces prior to an iodine treatment; Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Shewanella, and Chryseobacterium were the most common genera identified. Cohort eggs treated using the standard protocol of a single treatment of 50 mg/L iodine for 30 min resulted in an average of 57.8% reduction in bacterial CFU/g. While this is a significant reduction, bacteria were not completely eliminated and hatchery managers should be aware that pathogens could remain on Lake Sturgeon eggs following the standard iodine disinfection treatment.

Spatio-temporal trends in the density and condition of a secondary consumer, Bythotrephes, in southern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Natural gradients in temperature, nutrient loading, and primary productivity contribute to broad scale regional differences in the food web structure of large lakes, such as Lake Michigan. These factors influ-ence spatial patterns of primary production and resource reliance of high trophic level consumers. Secondary consumers, such as larval fish and predatory zooplankton represent an important intermediate link within large lake food webs, but spatial patterns in their density and physiological condition have not been as thoroughly assessed. To analyze the spatial and temporal condition of secondary consumers in Lake Michigan, we sampled the ubiquitous spiny water flea, Bythotrephes cederstromii during the 2015 Cooperative Science and Monitoring field year in Lake Michigan. Monthly estimates of density, instar fre-quency, length-at-age, and RNA content of Bythotrephes were compared between the eastern and western shores of southern Lake Michigan. Condition indices differed seasonally between the eastern and western shores. During June-August, Bythotrephes were more abundant and in better condition along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, but in September, all indices were comparable between transects. While this study focused on a single year, other studies across multiple years have demonstrated consistent upwel-lings and cooler temperatures along the western shore of southern Lake Michigan relative to the eastern shore. A temporal lag in preferable environmental conditions along the western shore may be common and lead to delayed growth and reduced physiological condition of secondary consumers, such as preda-tory zooplankton and late spring emerging larval fish.Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Kirkland, DW				Kirkland, DW			An explanation for the varves of the Castile evaporites (Upper Permian), Texas and New Mexico, USA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Extraordinary sequences of conspicuous, pervasive and laterally persistent varves characterize the Castile evaporites. They occur as singlets (calcite laminae), couplets (calcite laminae interstratified with anhydrite laminae), thick couplets (calcite laminae interstratified with thin anhydrite beds) and triplets ( calcite and anhydrite laminae interstratified with thin halite beds). The varves accumulated in a deep (initially approximate to 550 m), persistently stratified, saline lake surrounded by an extinct reef. The lake had formed when the reef grew across a channel between an embayment and the ocean. Although located virtually on the palaeo-equator, the lake experienced negligible meteoric influx and extreme seasonality. During the season of high relative humidity, more marine groundwater entered the lake through the permeable reef barrier than exited as reflux and, secondarily, as evaporation. Consequently, the lake level rose by up to several metres to sea level. The 'refreshening' decreased salinity and replenished dissolved CO2 - the critical nutrient limiting growth of indigenous phytoplankton. Algae proliferated, pH increased and CaCO3 precipitated. It mixed with organic matter to form a thin, dark lamina. During the season of low relative humidity, tens of cubic kilometres of water evaporated from and, secondarily, leaked out through the surrounding reef. More water exited than entered, brine level fell below sea level, and salinity of the upper brine layer increased. Gypsum usually precipitated and rained onto the basin floor forming a couplet; infrequently, halite also precipitated forming a triplet. Every few thousand years, for < 50 to several hundred years, the lake became unstratified during the dry season, and wind-induced overturn allowed a layer of gypsum crystals up to ≈ 2 cm high to precipitate on the basin floor. Each layer, now thin beds of anhydrite nodules and anhydrite pseudomorphs after gypsum, and an underlying lamina of CaCO3 and admixed organic matter formed a thick couplet. The different varve types recur with a period of 1800 - 3000 years reflecting climatic changes on a millennial time scale.																			0037-0746					OCT	2003	50	5					899	920		10.1046/j.1365-3091.2003.00588.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3091.2003.00588.x													WOS:000185474200005

Clean technologies and digital optimization will go some way toward achieving this. But if we are to achieve the targets set by COP21 as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, we will also have to engage in a major transformation of our lifestyles. This concerns all spheres of activity, in particular mobility (including the questions of teleworking, business travel, etc.), housing and its energy consumption, household consumption of food and non-food products (including the question of online shopping, consumption of organic products, etc.). The article presents the research infrastructure of the "Lemanic Panel for analysis of sustainability of behaviors", a five-year project initiated by the EPFL and starting in autumn 2022, involving a sample of over 10,000 people living in the Lake Geneva region. After presenting the set-up and its scientific interest, the article focuses on the panel's mobility component, which includes GPS tracking. The conceptualization and implementation of Wave 1, used to recruit the panel, are presented. The same applies to GPS tracking. The weighting method is described in order to match the socio-demographic structure of the sample survey population. Three potential contributions of the Lemanic Panel are detailed, with the aim of showing the analytical potential of this innovative infrastructure in terms of its conceptualization and the data collected.																			0049-4488	1572-9435				2025 OCT 8	2025										10.1007/s11116-025-10634-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11116-025-10634-5		OCT 2025											WOS:001589153600001

In many cases, lakes, rivers and the sea are an efficient and cost-effective source of heat for heat pumps, even large ones. However, existing hydrothermal heat pump systems cannot be operated at low water temperatures due to the risk of freezing in the evaporator. This limits availability at the time when heating demand is at its highest. The triple-point process is realised in a vacuum ice system. Freezing water molecules provide the energy to vaporise neighbouring water molecules. The water vapour is compressed by means of a turbo compressor to a higher temperature level that can be used for the downstream stage of the heat pump cascade. The heat extraction from the river water creates a pumpable water-ice mixture (ice slurry) in the evaporator, which is returned to the river. The river water thus remains usable as a powerful and efficient heat source even at water temperatures around freezing point. At the same time, the volume of water circulating between the river and the heat pump is significantly reduced. As part of the AQVA HEAT 1 project, a 250 kW vacuum ice slurry generator was set up on the premises of "Stadtwerke Zittau" the local district heating provider and successfully tested in autumn 2022 to generate heat from the river Mandau. In addition to the technological issues, the ecological impact on the watercourse was also analysed. The article presents the experiences from this first short-term demonstration.																			0151-1637						2024							286	291		10.18462/iir.pcm.2024.0032	http://dx.doi.org/10.18462/iir.pcm.2024.0032													WOS:001307785500037

Land-To-Sea Sediment Fluxes From a Major Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Were Stepped Rather Than Instantaneous	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Glacial lake outburst floods can transport large volumes of sediment. Where these floods reach the coastline, much of the particulate matter is delivered directly to the marine environment. It has been suggested that offshore deposits, specifically in fjord settings, may provide a faithful record of past outburst flood events. However, a lack of observations means that the mechanics and the timing of sediment transport offshore following a glacial lake outburst event remain poorly constrained. Here, we document the changes in sea surface sediment dynamics following the 28 November 2020 Elliot Lake outburst flood in British Columbia, which transported similar to 4.3 x 106 m3 of sediment into an adjacent fjord (Bute Inlet) as a deep nepheloid layer directly following the event. However, analysis of sea surface turbidity using in situ measurements and satellite-derived estimates reveals that changes in fjord-head surface turbidity in the months following the major flood were surprisingly small. The highest measured sea surface turbidity instead occurred 5 months after the initial outburst flood. This delayed increase in seaward sediment flux coincided with the onset of the spring freshet, when the discharge of the rivers feeding Bute Inlet increases each year. We suggest that large quantities of sediment were temporarily stored within the river catchment and were only remobilized when river discharge exceeded a threshold level following seasonal snowmelt. Our results reveal a temporal disconnect, where onshore to offshore transfer of sediment is stepped following a glacial lake outburst flood, which could complicate the sedimentology of subsequent deposits.

The age model indicates accelerated loess deposition coincident with regional glacial advances during the local last glacial maximum. A weakly developed paleosol, the Jules Geosol, represents a period of significantly slower deposition, from 23,700 to 22,000 cal yr BP. A gastropod assemblage-based reconstruction of mean July temperature shows temperatures 6-10 degrees C cooler than modern during Peoria Silt deposition. Stable oxygen and carbon isotope values (delta O-18 and delta C-13) of gastropod carbonate do not vary significantly across the pedostratigraphic boundary of the Jules Geosol, suggesting slower loess accumulation was a result of reduced glacial sediment supply rather than direct climatic factors. However, a decrease in delta O-18 values occurred between 26,000 and 24,000 cal yr BP, synchronous with the Lake Michigan Lobe's southernmost advance. This delta O-18 decrease suggests a coupling of regional summer hydroclimate and ice lobe position during the late glacial period.

Aeromonad concentrations were independent of trophic status and did not correlate statistically with water quality parameters used to measure trophic state (total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and Secchi depth). Bacterial indicators (fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli) used to assess the public health safety of recreational waters correlated with mesophilic aeromonads only when sewage pollution occurred. Overall (n = 101-107) there were small negative correlations of aeromonad densities with dissolved oxygen (r = -0.30, P = <0.05), and total dissolved nitrogen (r = -0.30, P = 0.05). During frequent sampling from April through October 1991, mean mesophilic aeromonad concentrations ranged from 10(3-4) cells 100 ml(-1) with the lowest values measured during mid-summer. Over the course of twelve months, 273 aeromonad isolates were identified as belonging to the following biotypes: A, sobria (54%), A. hydrophila (29%), A. caviae (10%), and undetermined (7%). Seasonally, the frequency of isolation of A. sobria, considered the most pathogenic biotype, increased from 17 to 69% when water temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C in a hypereutrophic lake. These temperatures typically occur during periods of peak recreational usage. Phenotypic characteristics associated with virulence were positive in 70% (hemolysis) and 42% (autoagglutination) of glycerol-stored strains (n = 85), and in 15% (autoagglutination) of strains immediately processed (n = 73). S-layer proteins associated with invasiveness were not found in 14 strains which autoagglutinated. To evaluate the public health significance of aeromonads in nutrient enriched lakes, our results demonstrate a need to couple investigations of mesophilic aeromonad ecology with virulence and biotype assessments.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				NOV	1994	28	11					2241	2251		10.1016/0043-1354(94)90039-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)90039-6													WOS:A1994PJ23800001
J	Kratt, C; Calvin, W; Coolbaugh, M				Kratt, Chris; Calvin, Wendy; Coolbaugh, Mark			Geothermal exploration with hymap hyperspectral data at Brady-Desert Peak, Nevada	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We explore the use of Hymap (hyperspectral mapper) to remotely map unique geothermal indicator minerals over the Brady-Desert Peak geothermal fields. Geothermal-related minerals and rocks such as sinter, tufa, and sulfates, display diagnostic characteristics in the visible and shortwave infrared; their presence and distribution can be used to guide more detailed fieldwork for geothermal exploration. The Brady-Desert Peak geothermal fields are located about 80 km east of Reno, Nevada in the Hot Springs Mountains. North-northeast-striking en-echelon faults offset Tertiary volcanic and lacustrine rocks. Two geothermal power plants produce electricity from two separate geothermal systems, one with numerous fumaroles and mudpots, the other showing no active surface expression of geothermal activity. Surface occurrences of gypsum, calcium-carbonate, hematite, and opaline silica were identified at both sites with the hyperspectral data; these minerals when considered together are indicative of geothermal activity at both sites. Mapping results were synthesized with other spatial data in a geographic information systems (GIS) database that was used to help draw structural interpretations of faulting and fault controls at the Brady-Desert Peak area. The same processing methods can be applied to new hyperspectral data sets for future exploration in the Great Basin, especially in areas that lack obvious thermal expressions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Isotope-based investigation on the groundwater flow and recharge mechanism in a hard-rock aquifer system: the case of Ranchi urban area, India	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Ranchi urban area (257 km(2)) depends on aquifers for 30 % of its total drinking-water supply of 17 million m(3) year(-1). Local hydrostratigraphy is represented by a heterogeneous, weathered and fractured aquifer system, typical of the Precambrian suite of rocks in the Indian subcontinent. Intensive development of the fractured aquifers, up to 200 m below ground, has lowered the hydraulic head and resulted in dwindling yields from fractures during the summer. To understand the groundwater flow regime and aquifer recharge mechanism, the present study examines delta O-18 and delta D variation in aquifer-specific samples along with water levels, yield of the fractures, EC and Cl-. Three types of groundwater have been identified based on isotopic composition and d-excess values, each representing different recharge source-water and pathways. The major source of recharge for the aquifers is infiltration from rainfall. Two large reservoirs and an excavated lake within the study area contribute to the recharge process but insignificantly. Isotopic compositions and the relatively low EC and low Cl- concentrations of high-yielding bore wells in some places indicate the presence of fast-conducting fracture zones receiving copious recharge from rainfall. Such fractures can be developed further through bore wells for drinking supply with due provision for artificial recharge.

Measurements were made with an Optronic Laboratories OL 754-O-PMT spectrophotometer equipped with a fiber-optic cable and an underwater sensor. Fluxes greater than the instrument's noise equivalent irradiance (NET) level of 1 x 10(-5) Wm(-2) nm(-1) just below the sea surface were measured at wavelengths of greater than or equal to 294 Mn. At 310 nn, the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) ranged between 0.7 and 4.5 m(-1), with corresponding 10% depth penetrations between 4 and 0.5 m. This represents close to half of the summer mixed-layer water column in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The following correlation coefficients were found: 0.81 between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and K-d, 0.73 between chlorophyll a (Chl a) and K-d, and 0.73 between Chi a and DOC. The spectral variation of K-d suggests that yellow substance, and therefore DOC, is responsible for UV attenuation in these bodies of water.

J	BEETON, AM				BEETON, AM			THE VERTICAL MIGRATION OF MYSIS RELICTA IN LAKES HURON AND MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												During the day Mysis relicta could be taken only near the bottom of Lakes Huron and Michigan. In the evening they migrated into the overlying strata as the surface light intensity decreased from 15 to 1 foot-candles. Frequently the mysids migrated through the metalimnion when first ascending, but later in the night the majority occurred in or immediately below this layer. As the length of day decreased following the summer solstice, the mysids ascended progressively earlier each evening and descended later each morning (they descended when the surface light intensity was increasing from 10-3 to 10-2 foot-candle). Moonlight and fog influenced the extent and time of vertical migration. The optimum light intensity for mysids is so low that they are concentrated near the bottom during the day. As the light decreases at sunset, they move upward rapidly; possibly because of a positive reaction to decreasing light. Their night-time distribution is determined by their response to the existing light and thermal conditions. Their dawn descent may be due to a photonegative condition which originated during the night.																									1960	17	4					517	539		10.1139/f60-037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f60-037													WOS:A1960WV53200006

Hanensula anomala isolated from the Berkeley Pit, Butte, MT, is a metal-specific extremophile	MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM												A yeast-like extremophile organism, Hansenula anomala, has been isolated from the superfund site the Berkeley Pit Lake in Butte, Montana. Studies demonstrate H. anomala growth in some of the known Berkeley Pit Lake solutes. Microbial growth dynamics under controlled conditions were compared of H. anomala for multiple metal concentrations. Each solute/metal was tested separately at previously reported concentrations on the geochemistry of the Berkeley Pit lake in the first 0.2 m in spring (pH 2.5). H. anomala grew well with sulfur (S), MgSO4, CaSO4, potassium chloride (KCl), and NaSO4 and was inhibited with FeSO4, MnSO4, CuSO4, AlSO4, or ZnSO4. With the addition of elemental S, growth was observed for FeSO4 indicating minimal growth rescue. PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the organism using known ribosomal primers indicates the strain to be ATCC8168 (CBS 5759). From this data, it can be concluded that H. anomala ATCC8168 from the Berkeley Pit is an extremophile that exhibits metal-specific growth.						, Kyle Roessler/0009-0004-5021-1831													2165-0497					OCT 3	2024	12	10								10.1128/spectrum.00444-24	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00444-24		AUG 2024						39162504					WOS:001297349200025

The present study is the result of a study conducted in continental environments influenced by different hydrological systems and demonstrates the usefulness of these analyses in obtaining rainfall-related paleoclimatic data. The study area is located in the basalts of the Alto Uruguai region (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), known for its mineral riches such as amethyst geodes and hot springs. The methodology used integrates palynofacies and organic geochemistry techniques, complemented by radiocarbon dating. The results were obtained from three sedimentary profiles and showed a trend of relative decrease in rainfall levels in the region. However, the scale of these changes is also highly influenced by the hydrological system of the depositional environment that originated the sedimentary record at each site. Based on the data obtained, we advise the establishment of medium- and long-term policies involving better management of local natural resources in the investigated region.

Geochemistry of the Albano crater lake	COLLI ALBANI VOLCANO	Special Publications of IAVCEI											Albano Lake is within the youngest polygenetic crater of Colli Albani, from which several lahar-generating water overflows occurred up to early Roman times. The area has anomalous gas emissions and is affected by seismicity and uplift. The geochemistry of the lake have been systematically investigated since 2003 by measuring physico-chemical parameters along vertical profiles with a multiparametric probe and by collecting water samples for chemical and isotopic analyses. The lake is thermally and chemically stratified, with an anoxic hypolimnion from 70 m to the bottom ( 167 m). The isotopic composition of dissolved helium and total carbon is similar to that of the main gas emissions of Colli Albani and of the phenocryst inclusions of the Alban volcanics, suggesting that an endogenous gas of deep provenance is injected into the lake water. The dissolved CO2 content is, however, far from saturation, and no Nyos-type hazardous gas cloud emission may presently occur in the lake. Temperature and chemical time variations indicate that water rollover episodes occur in harsh rainy winters when the surface lake temperature cools below 8.5 degrees C. Such rollovers tend to homogenize the physico-chemistry of the lake water and reduce the dissolved CO2 content. They may cause an environmental hazard because of related toxic algal blooms.					; Tarchini, Luca/AAN-6002-2021; Lelli, Matteo/AAX-2090-2020	Tarchini, Luca/0000-0001-6045-0802; 													0579-5362		978-1-86239-307-3				2010		3					259	267																WOS:000282720200014
J	PETRIDIS, D; SINIS, A				PETRIDIS, D; SINIS, A			BENTHOS OF LAKE MIKRI PRESPA (NORTH GREECE)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												An extensive sampling of Lake Mikri Prespa was carried out in summer 1990, aimed at evaluating benthic abundance, recording the species involved and detecting their response to some environmental variables. Three oligochaete species are endemic to the region, Potamothrix prespaensis, Psammoryctides ochridanus variabilis and Psammoryctides ochridanus typica. The bathymetric curve of the benthos resembles that of eutrophic lakes. A great abundance of Chironomus plumosus and Chaoborus flavicans occurred. Four community patterns were revealed by TWINSPAN analysis, division level two, explicitly discriminated by the influence of substrate type, depth, C/N ratio and pH. Species richness and diversity was minimal in the profundal and maximal in the shallows, whilst the equitability index was high in all site groups. Depth and bottom type were the most important variables in defining species distribution. More precisely, Chironomus plumosus, Chaoborus flavicans and Potamothix hammoniensis were ubiquitous, preferring mostly deep waters. Tanytarsus sp., Einfeldia dissidens, Cladopelma lateralis, Tanypus punctipennis and Potamothrix prespaensis favoured shallower and less productive waters with a bottom rich in decaying plant fragments, and the Psammoryctides species showed a littoral origin and regular occurrence on gravel beds. A few species displayed a particular distribution with changes of depth, C/N ratio and pH.

The influence of calcium decline and climate change on the cladocerans within low calcium, circumneutral lakes of the Experimental Lakes Area	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Calcium (Ca) concentrations of many softwater lakes on the Canadian Shield have been in decline for decades as a response primarily to regional acid deposition and repeated cycles of forest harvesting. These Ca declines are of ecological interest, as many lakes have fallen to Ca levels detrimental to the fitness of ecologically important Ca-rich cladoceran taxa such as Daphnia pulex. However, distinguishing the impacts of reduced Ca from acidification (i.e., decreasing pH) on Ca-demanding fauna has proven difficult due to strong correlations between pH and Ca in softwater lakes. Here, we examine cladoceran sedimentary assemblages from low Ca lakes (mean present-day Ca < 2.0 mg l(-1)) in the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) of Ontario, Canada, where Ca concentrations have declined since the 1980s, despite being closed to forestry and remote from (i.e., not downwind of) major sources of acid deposition. Differences between present-day and pre-industrial cladoceran assemblages were greatest among planktonic taxa, including Bosmina spp. and Holopedium glacialis. However, daphniid remains were present in only three of the ten study lakes with minimal directional trends. Overall, in these ELA lakes, daphniid abundance was low historically, and impacts possibly attributable to Ca declines have been obscured by the effects of regional climate warming.

Our results showed that the ionic compositions of the streams and meltwaters predominantly reflect the atmospheric inputs, while lake waters have higher Na/Cl, Ca/Mg and HCO3/Cl ratios related to chemical weathering in lake sediments, but this did not allow for distinguishing purely silicate sources. Consistent with the trace and rare earth element data, various alteration indices and Index of Compositional Variability values denote the low degree of chemical weathering in the lake sediments. The records from the previously unexplored Mud Lake and Upper Lake suggest that the lakes of Admiralty Bay are better places to trace the impacts of a succession of environmental changes that have occurred in the watershed, while the stream channel sediments, when accompanied by water chemistry data, may provide a more representative composition of the source rocks than the lake sediments. These findings may help revealing the intensity of contemporary weathering in a colder climate with relatively few mineralogical changes accompanied by a lesser degree of elemental loss.

J	Barker, P; Gasse, F				Barker, P; Gasse, F			New evidence for a reduced water balance in East Africa during the Last Glacial Maximum: implication for model-data comparison	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Some syntheses of lake-level data for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in East Africa (10degreesN and 30degreesS, East of 25degreesE) show apparently wetter conditions than present for some basins, whereas palaeovegetation reconstruction indicates a generally dry climate. PMIP GCM simulations for the LGM support both scenarios for this region when run under different boundary conditions. Here. we compare three new records from lakes in the data-poor southern part of East Africa; Lake Malawi, Lake Massoko, and Lake Rukwa. We also re-assess previously published lake-level data and apply a salinity transfer function to the diatom record from Lake Manyara. Our results show that in contrast to previous interpretations, these lakes were at least as low as today at the LGM and are thus in agreement with the palaeovegetation data. Relative drought across East Africa is best simulated by GCMs that use computed SSTs rather than the higher CLIMAP values. Lower SSTs and the presence of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets must have been dominant over any monsoon precipitation rise caused by astronomically induced summer insolation enhancement in the southern African tropics.

Feasibly standardised angling methods such as ice fishing could produce representative catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) information on the abundance of different-sized fish in small lakes. Here, we first used standard Nordic multimesh gillnets to obtain number-per-unit-effort (NPUE), biomass-per-unit-effort (BPUE) and size structure data on Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) stocks in 11 small boreal lakes in summer. Second, the same lakes were ice-fished by voluntary anglers using a pre-defined, loosely standardised protocol to obtain angling-based NPUE, BPUE, and length frequency distributions. Effects of environmental variables such as water oxygen concentration and light penetration on angling catch rates were controlled statistically. Neither perch Nordic gillnet NPUE nor BPUE corresponded to ice-fishing CPUEs. However, the length distribution of the catch did not differ between methods. Our results imply that traditional ice fishing applying natural baits is relatively unselective for fish size and could produce valid length-based indicators for management purposes while angling CPUE was poorly related to Nordic gillnet CPUE.					; Olin, Mikko/I-9258-2012; Turunen, Aatu/JLM-7176-2023	Olin, Mikko/0000-0003-4240-6669; Turunen, Aatu/0000-0001-9512-6789; Vainikka, Anssi/0000-0002-0172-5615; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; 													0969-997X	1365-2400				FEB	2023	30	1					99	108		10.1111/fme.12603	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12603		NOV 2022											WOS:000884586900001
J	de Carvalho, LAS; Barbosa, CCF; Novo, EMLD; Rudorff, CD				Sander de Carvalho, Lino Augusto; Faria Barbosa, Claudio Clemente; Ledo de Moraes Novo, Evlyn Marcia; Rudorff, Conrado de Moraes			Implications of scatter corrections for absorption measurements on optical closure of Amazon floodplain lakes using the Spectral Absorption and Attenuation Meter (AC-S-WETLabs)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Amazon floodplain lakes range widely in concentrations of optically active constituents (OAC) driven by seasonality in hydrological and biogeochemical processes, but in general they are characterized by high turbidity (NTU from 90 to 1645) compared to coastal waters. In this work, instruments for measuring inherent optical properties (IOPs) of water bodies were evaluated for the first time in floodplain lakes in the lower Amazon River during the falling limb of the hydrograph. Water column profiles of total attenuation and absorption were measured using the Spectral Absorption and Attenuation Meter (AC-S-WETLabs), and of backscattering using Hydroscat. These measurements, however, are subject to uncertainties and require corrections for turbid waters. In this paper, we assessed the implications of scattering correction methods for the absorption tube, proposed by the AC-S manufacturer, in the simulation of the Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs). The closure experiment comparing Hydrolight (Mobley & Sundman, 2001) simulated R-rs and in situ R-rs demonstrated that neither of the corrections was able to thoroughly account for the scattering errors which were propagated to the absorption measurements with AC-S and backscattering with Hydroscat. The three scattering correction methods (Flat, Proportional and "Kirk") either under or overestimated the absorption coefficient that resulted in either under or overestimation of the simulated R-rs. Flat and Proportional Methods resulted in an underestimation of R-rs from 400 to 550 nm and overestimation from 600 to 700 nm, indicating that the assumption of zero (0) absorption in the near infrared does not apply to inland turbid water. The R-rs errors varied also according to water OAC composition. Overall, "Kirk" correction method provided the best results regarding the spectral shape of the R-rs however, failed to account for magnitude. Based on the tuning tests, the errors in spectra magnitude seem to be sensitive to the constant fraction of scattering (CFS) used in the Kirk method. Tests carried out with CFS values varying from 0.18 to 038 indicated that magnitude error can be partially overcomed by tuning CFS according to water composition.

The use of common reed as biomass for the production of solid fuels can significantly reduce the use of fossil fuels. Common reed is a freely available resource in the overgrown lakes of Latvia. Common reed solid biofuel production technology after grinding provides briquetting to required density. The purpose of the work is theoretically to determine the resistance characteristic for the pressing mechanism modelling. In laboratory experiments briquettes were produced from grinded common reed particles. The main tasks of the laboratory experiments were determination of the compacting force - displacement characteristics for compacting of different size common reed particles. On the basis of the results of the compacting experiments non-linear particle compression resistance characteristic with Mathcad programme was developed. The mechanical model contains a spring incorporated in the rhomboid mechanism. Comparing the results of experiments and modelling the maximal difference 4.96 % (screen size 1.5 mm), 1.98 % (screen size 6 mm), 8.45 % (screen size 12 mm) and 6.94 % (screen size 20 mm) was determined.

Seepage in Volcanic Lakes, Hints from Numerical Simulations	VOLCANIC LAKES	Advances in Volcanology											The existence and survival of volcanic lakes require the accomplishment of a delicate balance between meteoric recharge, evaporation, and water loss by infiltration within the volcanic edifice, commonly referred to as seepage. A deep-seated, volcanic component may participate to a variable extent to the lake's evolution, depending on volcanic activity. In this work, we apply a numerical model of hydrothermal fluid circulation to study the interaction between the hot volcanic gases and the shallow lake water. We focus on the conceptual model developed for Poas volcano (Costa Rica), where a shallow magma intrusion drives the hydrothermal activity underneath and around the crater lake. Numerical simulations are carried out to assess the role of relevant system properties, including rock permeability, reservoir conditions, lake geometry, and meteoric recharge. Our results suggest that vertical seepage can be severely hindered by the ascent of volcanic gases, whereas horizontal infiltration through the vertical lake walls may ensure a long-term water loss. Our simulations also show that the permeability distribution, especially around the lake, determines the overall pattern of circulation affecting the development and spatial distribution of hot springs and fumaroles, and ultimately controlling the evolution of the lake.

Ecological degradation began with over exploitation of water resources, sharp shrink or disappearance of lakes and springs, and ecological deterioration occurred in accompany with sharp reduction of surface water and severe effect on groundwater circulation. Temporal and spatial characteristics of flow discharge at Zhengyixia are analyzed. Discharges in longitudinal, transversal and perpendicular directions are different, and durational distribution is peculiar. The relationship between such characteristics and ecological evolvement of the lower reaches is studied, revealing the ecological effect of flow discharge at Zhengyixia with respect of temporal and spatial characteristics. For the purposes of ecological stability and sustainable development, suggestions are put forward on water resources utilization planning of the Heihe River and ecological environment conservation in its lower reaches.					lifeng, yang/AAD-6519-2021																978-7-80621-676-7				2003							430	435																WOS:000260481300056
J	Xue, SR; Wang, F				Xue, Shengrong; Wang, Fei			Pretreatment of the Inoculum with Trichloromethane to Enhance Biohydrogen Production Via Two-Stage Batch Fermentation	WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION												Trichloromethane is often used as a chemical inhibitor to pretreat the inoculum to improve hydrogen yield in dark fermentation. In this study, five different doses of trichloromethane were used for methanogenic inhibition of methanogenic microbial community operating in stable (inoculum A) and anaerobic microbial community in natural environment (lake bottom slit, inoculum B). High concentrations of trichloromethane inhibited the activity of microbial community in the reactors and hindered the production of hydrogen and methane. At the same time, it would greatly reduce the pH, causing it to fall below the threshold of suitable hydrogen yield. In turn, ethanol-type fermentation was triggered, and the ethanol content of the system increased with increasing concentration of trichloromethane addition. The comprehensive assessment concluded that a 0.10% (v/v) trichloromethane concentration gave the best hydrogen yield performance in both inoculums. However, anaerobic microbial community in natural environment was able to produce hydrogen more efficiently than the operationally stable methanogenic microbial community. The highest cumulative hydrogen yield was 111.16, 34.36, and 72.76 mL/g VS in phase I (day 1-10), phase II (day 11-20), and the whole stage, respectively. In addition, the butyrate production in the reactor at this concentration was considerable, with an average yield of 21.3 g/L.

Risk factors for BU include proximity to slow flowing water, poor wound care and not wearing protective clothing. Man-made alterations of the environment have been suggested to lead to increased BU incidence. M. ulcerans DNA has been detected in the environment, water bugs and recently also in mosquitoes. Despite these findings, the mode of transmission of BU remains poorly understood and both transmission by insects or direct inoculation from contaminated environment have been suggested. Here, we investigated the BU epidemiology in the Mape basin of Cameroon where the damming of the Mape River since 1988 is believed to have increased the incidence of BU. Through a house-by-house survey in spring 2010, which also examined the local population for leprosy and yaws, and continued surveillance thereafter, we identified, till June 2012, altogether 88 RT-PCR positive cases of BU. We found that the age adjusted cumulative incidence of BU was highest in young teenagers and in individuals above the age of 50 and that very young children (, 5) were underrepresented among cases. BU lesions clustered around the ankles and at the back of the elbows. This pattern neither matches any of the published mosquito biting site patterns, nor the published distribution of small skin injuries in children, where lesions on the knees are much more frequent. The option of multiple modes of transmission should thus be considered. Analyzing the geographic distribution of cases in the Mape Dam area revealed a closer association with the Mbam River than with the artificial lake.

In this article, we describe dagger Rebekkachromis gen. nov. from the middle-to-late Miocene (c. 11 MYA) of the Central Kenya Rift within the East African Rift system. dagger Rebekkachromis is represented by two species that differ from all other fossil and extant African cichlids, except Etia, in possessing the unique character combination of two supraneural bones and a set of robust tricuspid oral teeth in the outer row of the dentition. Furthermore, dagger Rebekkachromis exhibits the only proposed morphological synapomorphy of the Haplotilapiini, namely the presence of tricuspid teeth in the inner row of the oral dentition. We show that dagger Rebekkachromis constitutes the oldest reliably identified fossil record of a haplotilapiine. The evolution of cichlid fishes possessing tricuspid teeth in the rivers and lakes of the Central Kenya Rift during the middle-to-late Miocene could have been facilitated by volcanic activity, as repeated ash falls may well have fostered the growth of algae and in particular diatoms. These fishes could thus have had a major advantage, because they could exploit the newly available, rich food resources.

Characterization of Alkane-Producing Nostoc sp Isolated from a Summer Bloom for Biofuel Potential	JOURNAL OF BIOBASED MATERIALS AND BIOENERGY												A filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, Nostoc sp. strain KNUA003, was axenically isolated from a freshwater bloom sample collected from Lake Daecheong, South Korea. Based on its morphological and molecular characteristics, the isolate was identified as a member of the genus Nostoc. Maximal growth was attained when the culture was incubated at 25 degrees C and approximately pH 7.0. Analysis of lipid composition revealed that strain KNUA003 could autotrophically synthesize heptadecane (C17H36), which can be used as a fuel directly, without transesterification. This cyanobacterium was deduced to possess the genes for alkane biosynthesis. In addition, strain KNUA003 was found to produce a high-value long-chain fatty alcohol, hexadecenol (C20H40O), as well as other common algal biodiesel constituents, including palmitic acid (C-16:0), palmitoleic acid (C-16:1), linoleic acid (C-18:2), and linolenic acid (C-18:3), as major cellular components. The proximate analysis determines the mass percentage of volatiles in fuel and it was shown that the volatile matter content was 75.3%. The ultimate analysis is a chemical analysis of the elements in biomass fuel and the results indicated that the higher heating value was 15.4 MJ kg(-1). Therefore, Nostoc sp. KNUA003 shows promise for application in cost-effective production of microalgae-based biofuels and as a biomass feedstock.

Of 389 adult walleye stomachs examined from June 1999 through March 2000, a total of 879 prey fish was found, but only one was identified as a smallmouth bass. In 303 smallmouth bass stomachs examined, 55 prey fish were found and no cannibalism was evident, nor were walleye preyed upon. Dietary overlap using the Schoener resource overlap index was 0.416, 0.293 and 0.205 for the months June, July and August 1999, respectively, indicating that there was not a significant dietary overlap during summer months. Because neither diet overlap nor predation appeared substantial in Big Crooked Lake, additional research on interactions among younger age classes of walleye, interactions at other times of the year, and interactions with other species are needed to elucidate limitations to smallmouth bass recruitment in this system.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2003	18	1					43	54		10.1080/02705060.2003.9663950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2003.9663950													WOS:000181291800005

B.S.P.) was determined in two peatland sites near Slave Lake, Alberta. At each site, 15 dominant-codominant black spruce were sampled for tree-ring growth at 30 cm height. The tree-ring indices for each site were related to precipitation and temperature data from Slave Lake. It was found that (i) tree-ring indices were positively correlated with June-August precipitation of the current year and of the 1st and 2nd years prior to the current year; June-August maximum temperatures of the current year and of the 1st and 2nd years prior to the current year were negatively correlated with tree-ring indices; (iii) tree-ring indices had a positive linear correlation with the June-August minimum temperature of the current year and polynomial correlations with June-August minimum temperatures of the 1st and 2nd years prior to the current year; and (iv) summer precipitation values greater than 325 mm probably had a negative impact upon the tree-ring growth. Maximum and minimum temperatures, however, were intercorrelated with precipitation.

The gene probes and their respective phenotypes were nahAB, for naphthalene degradation, merA, for narrow-spectrum mercury resistance, and merB, for broad-spectrum mercury resistance. Gene-probe-positive organisms could be placed into one of three categories: (1) organisms that could express their genetic information immediately upon isolation from the environment; (2) organisms that expressed their genotype only after cultivation before selection for the genotype; and (3) organisms that did not express their genotype at all in our hands. For all three probes it was found that most organisms fell into category 2. This phenomenon was also observed with bacteria isolated from lake water that probed positive with the nitrogenase (nifHDK) gene probe. The data suggest that the numbers of isolates identified by gene probes merely reflect the genetic potential of a community whereas various expression data suggest that differences in the actual activity of those genotypes exist in the natural environment.

The impact of cold North Atlantic sea surface temperatures on climate: implications for the Younger Dryas cooling (11-10 k)	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The sensitivity of global climate to colder North Atlantic sea surface temperatures is investigated with the use of the GISS general circulation model. North Atlantic ocean temperatures 18,000 B. P., resembling those prevalent during the Younger Dryas, were incorporated into the model of the present climate and also into an experiment using orbital parameters and land ice characteristic of 11,000 B. P. The results show that with both 11,000 B. P. and present conditions the colder ocean temperatures produce cooling over western and central Europe, in good agreement with Younger Dryas paleoclimatic evidence. Cooling also occurs over extreme eastern North America, although the precise magnitude and location depends upon the specification of ocean temperature change in the western Atlantic. Despite the presence of increased land ice and colder ocean temperatures, the Younger Dryas summer air temperatures at Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes in the model are warmer than those of today due to changes in the orbital parameters, chiefly precession, and atmospheric subsidence at the perimeter of the ice sheets.																			0930-7575	1432-0894				SEP	1986	1	1					2	33																WOS:000208440400002

However, its impact on soil microbial communities, soil quality, and rice yield, particularly when comparing the incorporation of green manure residue to mowing, remains insufficiently explored. Methods To address this gap, an 12-year field experiment was conducted in the Dongting Lake Plain, comparing three vetch management strategies under double-rice cropping system: winter fallow (CK), vetch rotation with residue incorporation (CMI), and vetch rotation with residue mowing (CMR). The soil quality index (SQI) was calculated based on abiotic [e.g., soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N)] and biotic [e.g., bacterial abundance, abundance-based coverage (ACE), Chao 1] factors. Results and discussion Results indicated that both the vetch management strategies significantly improved rice yield. Compared to CK, CMI and CMR enhanced early, late, and annual rice yields by 6.22%-10.77%, 7.50%-13.49%, and 7.03%-12.40%, respectively. Additionally, CMI improved soil redox potential, alkali-hydrolyzale nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and NO3-N, while CMR enhanced soil SOC, TN, NO3-N levels. Both CMI and CMR resulted in increases in the bacterial ACE index by 2.43%-2.53% and the Chao1 index by 0.92%-2.88% (P < 0.05). Furthermore, CMI reduced the Shannon index by 1.17% but increased the Simpson index by 19.35%, while CMR increased the Shannon index by 1.73% and elevated the Simpson index by 19.35% (P < 0.05). Principal component analysis indicated distinct bacterial community structures between CK and CMR. The dominant bacterial phyla included Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. Notably, CMR exhibited lower relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Acidobacteria compared to CMI. Compared to CK, CMI increased SQI by 6.92%, while CMR showed more modest improvements in soil quality. Moreover, a strong positive correlation between rice yield and SQI further confirmed the beneficial effect of vetch rotation on soil fertility. These findings underscore the potential of vetch rotation, particularly through vetch incorporation, to enhance soil quality and rice productivity, thereby offering valuable insights for sustainable agricultural practices.																			1664-462X					JUN 3	2025	16								1603434	10.3389/fpls.2025.1603434	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2025.1603434								40530295					WOS:001509943700001

Reconstructing Holocene climate from tree rings: The potential for a long chronology from the Scottish Highlands	HOLOCENE												Despite promising research in the 1980s showing the potential of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) for the reconstruction of past summer temperatures in the Scottish Highlands, little dendroclimatic work has been attempted in this region since. This reflects, in part, the limited number of sparsely distributed remnant natural/ semi-natural pine woodlands in the Scottish Highlands and the lack of old growth forest therein. On average, most of the pine trees dated in this region are around 225 years in age. Here, we present the first results of an ongoing interdisciplinary initiative to develop a long Scottish chronology through the acquisition of modern, historical and subfossil pine material from the native pinewoods, historic structures and lakes of the Scottish Highlands. Radiocarbon dating of 25 subfossil pine timbers recovered from lake sediments identified the presence of preserved material covering the last 8000 years with initial clusters focused on the last two millennia and early-mid Holocene. Although developing a well-replicated 8000 year pine chronology will take many years, this preliminary study indicates that a millennial length pine chronology from the northwest Cairngorm region is a feasible and realistic objective in the near future. The importance of such a record in this climatically important sector of northwest Europe cannot be underestimated.

Modeling the sensitivity of cyanobacteria blooms to plausible changes in precipitation and air temperature variability	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Many recent studies have attributed the observed variability of cyanobacteria blooms to meteorological drivers and have projected blooms with worsening societal and ecological impacts under future climate scenarios. Nonetheless, few studies have jointly examined their sensitivity to projected changes in both precipitation and temperature variability. Using an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) of Lake Champlain's eutrophic Missisquoi Bay, we demonstrate a factorial design approach for evaluating the sensitivity of concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl-a), a cyanobacteria surrogate, to global climate model-informed changes in the central tendency and variability of daily precipitation and air temperature. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and multivariate contour plots highlight synergistic effects of these climatic changes on exceedances of the World Health Organization's moderate 50 mu g/L concentration threshold for recreational contact. Although increased precipitation produces greater riverine total phosphorus loads, warmer and drier scenarios produce the most severe blooms due to the greater mobilization and cyanobacteria uptake of legacy phosphorus under these conditions. Increases in daily precipitation variability aggravate blooms most under warmer and wetter scenarios. Greater temperature variability raises exceedances under current air temperatures but reduces them under more severe warming when water temperatures exceed optimal values for cyanobacteria growth more often. Our experiments, controlled for wind-induced changes to lake water quality, signal the importance of larger summer runoff events for curtailing bloom growth through reductions of water temperature, sunlight penetration and stratification. Finally, the importance of sequences of wet and dry periods in generating cyanobacteria blooms motivates future research on bloom responses to changes in interannual climate persistence.

Possible paleohydrologic and paleoclimatic effects on hominin migration and occupation of the Levantine Middle Paleolithic	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												This paper explores the impact of major glacial/interglacial paleohydrologic variations in the Middle-Paleolithic Levant on hominin migration and occupation. The climatic reconstruction is based primarily on the most straight-forward paleohydrologic records recently published. These terrestrial proxies convey direct paleoenvironmental signals of effective precipitation and aquifer recharge. The two main proxies are temporal changes of terminal lake levels in the Dead Sea basin and periods of deposition or non-deposition of speleothems. Other records, such as stable isotopes, if interpreted correctly, correspond well with these two direct proxies. All the records consistently indicate that the last two glacial periods in the central Levant were generally wet and cool, while the last two interglacials were dry and warm, so more water was available for the ecosystem and thus hominins during glacial periods than during interglacials. Some proxies indicate that the higher precipitation/evaporation ratio during glacial periods involved higher precipitation rather than only reduced evaporation. Beyond the general mean glacial/interglacial climate suggested here, variations occurred at all temporal scales throughout glacial or interglacial periods. In the Sahara-Negev arid barrier, moister conditions occurred during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6a-5e, when Anatomically Modern Humans apparently migrated out of Africa. We suggest that this migration, as well as the later Neanderthal expansion from Southeast Europe or the Anatolian plateau into the Levant during early MIS 4, could be facilitated by the observed major climatic variations.

In this study, two late Pleistocene-Holocene aeolian loess-paleosol sections were identified based on detailed field investigations in the Maqu reach in the Yellow River source area on the NETP. A robust chronostratigraphic framework for these two sections was established using AMS C-14 dating, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, Bacon age-depth modelling and strati graphic correlation. Measurements of magnetic susceptibility, hygroscopic water, loss-on-ignition, grain-size, micromorphology, and chemical element analysis suggest that most stratigraphic units in these aeolian loesspaleosol sections are in weak weathering and pedogenesis, whereas the mid-Holocene paleosol approaches to the moderate weathering and pedogenesis, and the sediments are in initial weathering stage of Na+ and Ca2+ leaching is dominated by plagioclase weathering. The main pedogenesis in the mid-Holocene paleosol is calcification process. In terms of intensity of weathering and pedogenesis, the stratigraphic units can be ordered as follows: paleosol > modern soil > transitional loess > aeolian loess. Multi-index comparison shows that the local climatic evolution during the late Pleistocene-Holocene was closely related to the evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the Westerlies. Overall, the results provide a foundation for further exploration of the pedogenic and paleoclimatic evolution on the NETP.

J	Vaheddoost, B; Kocak, K				Vaheddoost, Babak; Kocak, Kasim			Temporal dynamics of monthly evaporation in Lake Urmia	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												As a UNESCO biosphere, Lake Urmia is a shallow hypersaline lake which is facing a rapid water surface degradation. Evaporation from the surface of the Lake, as a physical process which accelerates the Lake's degradation, was evaluated using chaos theory. Seven hydrometeorological stations scattered around the Lake were selected, and a 40-year time span between October 1974 and September 2014 was used at each station. Missing data in time series was removed and the whole time series was tested for consistency, randomness, and presence of trend. Since evaporation at each station was measured by means of class A evaporation pan, time series at each station was multiplied by a pan coefficient to incorporate the effect of saline water and free water surface environment simultaneously. Measurement errors arising from assumption of zero evaporation in winter were removed from the time series using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing method after which unification of time series into a single time series is achieved. Results of the data transformation and information loss were monitored by means of auto-correlation, partial-auto-correlation, mutual information, power spectrum, false nearest neighbor, and correlation dimension. A local prediction method is then used to capture the temporal dynamics of the evaporation with consideration of an appropriate time delay and embedding dimension. Finally, the representative model was projected on a 3-dimensional phase space to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the evaporation. Results indicate that the chaotic approach shows accurate predictions in advance.

In this paper, we propose the method and share the results: cost-effective framework to generate 2D and 3D underwater maps with digital imagery and a Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The proposed method consists of data acquisition, image processing, and color correction. 292 and 437 images were acquired from each study site located in Spring Lake in San Marcos, Texas, U.S.A. Agisoft Photoscan Pro software was used to generate 3D point cloud data and orthomosaic images after feature matching and image alignment from geo-tagged imagery. The mosaic images with high resolution (< 0.2 cm per pixel) were generated with 2D underwater images. After color correction, the red reduction effect was recovered, and the bluer color was removed. The 3D underwater map was generated directly from 3D dense point clouds including geo-coordinates and RGB color information. As a result, the Very High Resolution (VHR) 2D and 3D maps were generated and the topographic surface of underwater structures was obtained in great detail. Although the RMSE were about 1 m, the proposed method provided more detailed surface of underwater features.

J	El Banna, MM				El Banna, MM			Nature and human impact on Nile Delta coastal sand dunes, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												This paper deals with the types, distribution and origin, of recent sand dunes in the coastal sector extending between El Burullus Lake and the Damietta Nile River branch, Egypt. Sand samples were studied for grain size distribution and mineralogical composition. It has been found that most of the dunes in the study area have been subjected to deterioration and removal due to the construction of summer resort buildings and making the international coastal highway. The remnant constitutes a belt of foredunes on the shore of Baltium extending westward to Burg El Burullus village. The dune's origin is interpreted as the result of coastal drifting and the subsequent transport of the former Sebennitic Nile branch sediments eastward by the predominant longshore current and by Aeolian processes. The blown sand grains accumulated to form a belt of coastal sand dunes with longitudinal and crescentic forms. Urbanization of the coast has severely altered the landscape. Gaps and damaged dunes are included within the dune belt. The dune's natural cycle of advance and retreat is upset and attains its destruction phase. The consequences of its destruction are numerous and lead to hazardous impacts on the shoreline, coastal building and the nearby international highway.																			0943-0105					MAR	2004	45	5					690	695		10.1007/s00254-003-0922-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-003-0922-y													WOS:000220519700010

The aim of this study is to place current climatic changes within the past trajectories and natural climatic variability of the Holocene. For this we re-examine a sediment core retrieved at Lake Pergusa covering the last ca. 6700 years. A multiproxy investigation, and in particular the oxygen isotope composition of lacustrine carbonate (delta O-18(c)), allowed us to reconstruct decadal- to centennial-scale hydrological changes. The wettest period occurred between ca. 6700 and 6000 cal a bp. The delta O-18(c) record indicates a new period of wetter conditions between ca. 3700 and 2400 cal a bp. In particular, a delta O-18(c) minimum between 2850 and 2450 cal a bp overlaps with the period of the 'Great Solar Minimum' and corresponds to a dramatic reduction of arboreal pollen (AP%) and to an increase in synanthropic pollen, marking the onset of Greek colonization in the region. The longest driest interval corresponds to the Medieval Climate Anomaly, whereas the highest delta O-18(c) values are recorded in the last 150 years. The trend of the last 3000 years suggests that, considering future climate projections, the area will experience unprecedented drying exacerbated by human impact.					; Luppichini, Marco/ITT-3444-2023; Natali, Stefano/MGU-3883-2025; Sadori, Laura/E-4774-2015; Bini, Monica/B-8122-2018; Di Vito, Mauro/MEQ-2109-2025; Baneschi, Ilaria/AAC-1935-2021; De Smet, Marc/E-2451-2013; Vanniere, Boris/E-4002-2010; Vannière, Boris/E-4002-2010	Pasquetti, Francesca/0000-0001-7866-346X; Desmet, Marc/0009-0002-8970-4313; Sadori, Laura/0000-0002-2774-6705; Luppichini, Marco/0000-0002-0913-3825; Bini, Monica/0000-0003-1482-2630; Natali, Stefano/0000-0001-6457-591X; Baneschi, Ilaria/0000-0001-6924-1599; Vanniere, Boris/0000-0002-6779-6053; Zanchetta, Giovanni/0000-0002-7080-9599; 													0267-8179	1099-1417				OCT	2022	37	7					1280	1293		10.1002/jqs.3435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3435		JUN 2022											WOS:000804672000001
J	Prowse, TD; Brown, K				Prowse, Terry D.; Brown, Kirsten			Hydro-ecological effects of changing Arctic river and lake ice covers: a review	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Freshwater ice is an integral part of the hydrologic regimes of cold environments. It controls the ecology of related aquatic systems and is important economically, through the facilitation of winter transport and via generation of extreme hydrologic events. Given projected changes in future climate, concern has been raised about related changes in freshwater ice. This paper reviews the status and trends in records of lake and river ice around the circumpolar North from traditional observations, remote sensing and paleo-sources. The temporal and spatial variability in trends are evaluated with relation to climatic conditions. Rapid changes experienced in freeze-up and break-up timing for high-latitude lakes, compared to those at more southerly locations, are particularly notable. Also considered are the nature and implications of changes in future freshwater-ice regimes that will have cascading effects on cold-region hydrology and a suite of hydro-ecological conditions including UV radiation receipts, habitat quality and availability, fisheries productivity and contaminant pathways. Overall, the duration and event timing of river and lake ice are proving to be useful indicators of climate change. Considering the scope and significance of ice-cover changes on northern hydro-ecology, a recommendation is made to place more emphasis on long-term and spatially diverse monitoring of freshwater ice.																			1998-9563	2224-7955					2010	41	6					454	461		10.2166/nh.2010.142	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2010.142													WOS:000282363300002

Up to now, there was little information about the Francisella spp. situation in the environmental samples in Iran. In this study we aimed to determine the prevalence of Francisella spp. in the environmental samples in northwest of Iran. Materials and Methods: A total of 237 natural water samples from ponds, rivers, lakes, springs and other surface waters from north western provinces of Iran (Kurdistan and Western Azerbaijan) were collected from September to November 2015. All samples were cultured for Francisella and other bacterial species and Real Time TaqMan PCR was performed on the concentrated and DNA extracted samples. For detection of the presence of bacterial DNA in the samples, two different targets in the genome of Francisella, ISFtu2 and fopA were used. Results: Among the tested surface water samples, 40 (17.09%; 95% CI: 12.67-22.33%) and 12 (5.13%; 95% CI: 2.81-8.56%) samples were positive for ISFtu2 and fopA respectively. None of them was positive in culture. Conclusion: The prevalence of Francisella spp. in the environmental samples in the west of Iran is high and it is comparable with Turkey, Iran's neighboring country. Use of higher copy number genes or IS like ISFtu2 could improve the detection of this organism in the environmental samples.

Effect of hypolimnetic oxygenation on oxygen depletion rates in two water-supply reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												Oxygenation systems, such as bubble-plume diffusers, are used to improve water quality by replenishing dissolved oxygen (DO) in the hypolimnia of water-supply reservoirs. The diffusers induce circulation and mixing, which helps distribute DO throughout the hypolimnion. Mixing, however, has also been observed to increase hypolimnetic oxygen demand (HOD) during system operation, thus accelerating oxygen depletion. Two watersupply reservoirs (Spring Hollow Reservoir (SHR) and Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR)) that employ linear bubble-plume diffusers were studied to quantify diffuser effects on HOD. A recently validated plume model was used to predict oxygen addition rates. The results were used together with observed oxygen accumulation rates to evaluate HOD over a wide range of applied gas flow rates. Plume-induced mixing correlated well with applied gas flow rate and was observed to increase HOD. Linear relationships between applied gas flow rate and HOD were found for both SHR and CCR. HOD was also observed to be independent of bulk hypolimnion oxygen concentration, indicating that HOD is controlled by induced mixing. Despite transient increases in HOD, oxygenation caused an overall decrease in background HOD, as well as a decrease in induced HOD during diffuser operation, over several years. This suggests that the residual or background oxygen demand decreases from one year to the next. Despite diffuser-induced increases in HOD, hypolimnetic oxygenation remains a viable method for replenishing DO in thermally-stratified watersupply reservoirs such as SHR and CCR.

Lakes near the glacier Maliy Azau on the Elbrus (Central Caucasus): dynamics and outbursts	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The lake dynamics and the current state of them were analyzed on the basis of interpretation of aerial and satellite images of different years together with results of field surveys. Areas of six lakes existing in different years near the Maliy Azau Glacier had been determined. On August 22, 2011, the maximum area of one of the lakes was equal to 25.5 thousand m(2). The first outburst was caused by the landslide deformations of the moraine massif forming a part of the lake basin, while the second one was a result of degradation of the lake ice dam and the water overflow on top of it. The present-day lake dams (terminal-moraine ramparts and medial moraine ridges) are the result of the Maliy Azau Glacier advance in 1990s. The revealed feature of the lake dynamics on the mountain Elbrus was a drop of the water level and corresponding decrease of the lake areas in winter that was related to existence of the groundwater runoff into fractured volcanic rocks. At present, moraine dams of lakes and areas of the surface water runoff from the lakes are in stable condition due to which there is no threat of a lake outburst. However, the potential threat of outburst still remains because of high seismicity and possible volcanic activity in this region.																			2076-6734	2412-3765					2016	56	4					472	479		10.15356/2076-6734-2016-4-472-479	http://dx.doi.org/10.15356/2076-6734-2016-4-472-479													WOS:000408236300003

We studied the effects of diet, season and habitat occupation on the prevalence of plerocercoid larvae of the tapeworm Ligula intestinalis in two closely related small barbs and the effects of the parasites on the barbs life histories in Lake Tana (Ethiopia) during 1 year. In all affected barbs L. intestinalis caused retardation in gonad development, maturation at reduced size and lower absolute fecundity. Infection rate, averaged over all habitats was significantly higher in B. tanapelagius (10%) than in B. humilis (6%). Below a threshold of 48 mm the infection rate was zero for both barbs, this coincided with a very low proportion of copepods in their diets, increasing up to 90 and 55%, respectively, for their largest size class (81-90 mm). The relatively high infection rate in B. tanapelagius is explained by its obligatory zooplanktivorous feeding behaviour, ingesting a relatively high proportion of infected cyclopoid copepods. This is in contrast with B. humilis, which is a polyphagous species, feeding both on zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Significant seasonal effects in infection rates were observed. In both barb species infection rates were lower during the breeding season. Only for B. tanapelagius a significant negative correlation was observed between rain fall and infection rate, probably caused by an increased turbidity that decreases feeding efficiency on zooplankton. Habitat type had also a significant effect on infection rate. Barbus humilis showed a much higher infection rate in shallow clear water (10%) than in shallow turbid water (3%), whereas B. tanapelagius showed much higher infection rates in the shallow sublittoral (13%) than in the deeper pelagic (7%). Most likely, birds predate more efficiently on barbs in shallow clear waters than in shallow turbid and deep waters.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2006	556						109	117		10.1007/s10750-005-1187-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-1187-0													WOS:000234198800009

Readings of the quantity and quality of the solar radiation were made with a solarimeter and a pyrlimnometer. From these data the percentage of utilization of the solar energy by the algae at different depths was computed. Maximum percentages of utilization were found at 10 m. in Crystal Lake, namely 9.1 and 8.3% in 2 series. Trout Lake showed maxima of 4.0 and 6.2% at 10 m. The highly colored water of Helmet Lake yielded maxima of 95 and 11.3% at 1 m. The maximum percentages were found at depths where 1.2 to 6.0 gr. cal/cm2 were received in 3-hr, periods. In Crystal and Trout lakes, the maxima were found where 57% of the solar energy fell in the green and yellow spectral bands, but 78% of that at 1 m. in Helmet Lake was in the red band.																			0006-3185	1939-8697				AUG	1935	69	1					75	81		10.2307/1537359	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1537359													WOS:000201834700005
J	Bodo, AV; Arain, MA				Bodo, Alanna V.; Arain, M. Altaf			Effects of variable retention harvesting on canopy transpiration in a red pine plantation forest	ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES												Background Variable Retention Harvesting (VRH) is a forest management practice applied to enhance forest growth, improve biodiversity, preserve ecosystem function and provide economic revenue from harvested timber. There are many different forms and compositions in which VRH is applied in forest ecosystems. In this study, the impacts of four different VRH treatments on transpiration were evaluated in an 83-year-old red pine (Pinus Pinus resinosa) plantation forest in the Great Lakes region in Canada. These VRH treatments included 55% aggregated crown retention (55A), 55% dispersed crown retention (55D), 33% aggregated crown retention (33A), 33% dispersed crown retention (33D) and unharvested control (CN) plot. These VRH treatments were implemented in 1-ha plots in the winter of 2014, while sap flow measurements were conducted from 2018 to 2020. Results Study results showed that tree-level transpiration was highest among trees in the 55D treatment, followed by 33D, 55A, 33A and CN plots. We found that photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were major controls or drivers of transpiration in all VRH treatments. Our study suggests that dispersed or distributed retention of 55% basal area (55D) is the ideal forest management technique to enhance transpiration and forest growth. Conclusions This study will help researchers, forest managers and decision-makers to improve their understanding of water cycling in forest ecosystem and adopt the best forest management regimes to enhance forest growth, health and resiliency to climate change.					; Arain, M./ABA-9750-2020	Bodo, Alanna/0000-0002-2017-3609; 														2192-1709				MAR 18	2022	11	1							28	10.1186/s13717-022-00366-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-022-00366-0								35317218					WOS:000770623600002

However, a detailed examination of the distribution pattern of iso-and OH-GDGTs in lacustrine sediments is so far limited. To investigate the controls on the sedimentary GDGT distribution in lakes, we examined the archaeal GDGT distribution in surface sediments at different water depths from Lake Lugu, a deep alpine lake in southwest China. Our aim is to determine their distribution, sources and controlling factors. Based on the significant correlations between iso-and OH-GDGTs in deep-water sediments (> 20 m), we suggest that the main biological source of archaeal GDGTs in surface sediments is aquatic Group I.1a Thaumarchaeota (Nitrosoarchaeum). The depth-related variation of iso-and OH-GDGTs indicates that water depth is the main factor affecting the distribution of archaeal GDGTs in Lake Lugu, reflecting that Thaumarchaeota prefer to live in the deeper layer above the oxycline. This relationship leads to a positive correlation between %Cren, %OH-GDGTs, and Cren/Cren' with water depth, confirming their potential application for paleo-lake level recon-struction. Our study improves the understanding of the factors that control the archaeal GDGTs in a deep alpine lake and suggest that they might be used as lake-level indicators.

J	Quesada, CG; Miranda, LA				Quesada, Carina Gisele; Miranda, Leandro Andres			Effects of hypoxia on the reproductive endocrine axis of the pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis)	FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY												Recently, hypoxic areas have been identified in water bodies of the Pampas region due to human activity. The objective of this work was to study the effect of low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) on the reproductive endocrine axis of a pampas fish (Odontesthes bonariensis). Groups of 8 males and 8 females were subjected to severe hypoxia (2-3 mg l(-1)) and normoxia (7-9 mg l(-1)) in 3000 l tanks by duplicate during the reproductive season (spring). After 21 days, 4 males and 4 females from each tank were sacrificed, and blood was drawn to measure estradiol (E-2) and testosterone (T). The brain, pituitary gland and a portion of the gonads were extracted and processed to measure the expression of: gnrh1, cyp19a1b, fsh beta, lh beta, fshr, lhcgr and cyp19a1a. From the second experimental week, no spawning was found in the hypoxic females, while at the end of the treatment period no male released sperm. Fish under hypoxic conditions showed signs of gonadal regression, reduction of GSI and plasma levels of sex steroids. Furthermore, the expression of gnrh1 in both sexes, cyp19a1b and fshr in males and only fsh beta and cyp19a1a in females decreased in comparison with normoxic fish. After 40 days under normal conditions, signs of reproductive recovery were observed in the treated fish. The results obtained demonstrated that hypoxia generated an inhibition of some components of the pejerrey's reproductive endocrine axis, but the effect was reversible.

The different water types in the area have been sampled for geochemical and stable isotope (H-2 and O-18) investigations. Here we present the results of more than 300 isotope analyses of water from the fjord and from streams, lakes, springs and tufa columns. Fjord water samples identify a two-component mixing system (R-2 > 0.99) between freshwater runoff and sea water entering from the Davis Strait. The fresh- water samples have an average composition of -95.4 parts per thousand delta H-2 and -13.1 parts per thousand delta O-18. We find both seasonal and altitude effects in fresh water related to early (June-July) or late (August) sampling time. All freshwater samples excluding lakes but including previous precipitation data (GNIP,1963-1974) can be described by a Local Meteoric Water Line with slope of 6.43 +/- 0.12 and offsets between 6.34 and 6.56. Column water samples are mixed with fjord water but extrapolation to a chlorine-free composition defines an endmember composition of -102 parts per thousand delta H-2 and -14.2 parts per thousand delta O-18. These compositions identify precipitation on top of the igneous plateau at similar to 500 m altitude as the source for the column water.

Geomagnetic excursions reflect an aborted polarity state	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Geomagnetic excursions represent short episodes of a few thousand years at most during which the field considerably exceeds its normal range of variability during a polarity state. Paleomagnetic records have now been obtained with extremely high temporal resolution which have improved our knowledge of these short events. We have compiled the most detailed records of excursions that had occurred during the Brunhes and Matuyama chrons. We show that virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) of at least one record of each event are able to reach the opposite polarity. In the next step, we have computed different simulations of excursions during which the dipole progressively vanishes before growing back without reversing. This scenario produces very few reversed directions which are only visible at some latitudes. We infer that it is impossible to reach the ratio of reversed to intermediate VGPs present in the paleomagnetic records if the excursions were not associated with a short period of reversed dipole field. Therefore, excursions should be regarded as two successive reversals bracketing an aborted polarity interval. We propose that the same underlying mechanisms prevail in both situations (excursions or reversals) and that below a certain strength the field reaches an unstable position which preludes either the achievement of a reversal or its return to the former polarity.

S	Markel, D; Shamir, U; Green, P		Zohary, T; Sukenik, A; Berman, T; Nishri, A		Markel, Doron; Shamir, Uri; Green, Pinhas			Operational Management of Lake Kinneret and its Watershed	LAKE KINNERET: ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT	Aquatic Ecology Series											This chapter places Lake Kinneret in the framework of the Israeli national water sector as one of its principal water sources and an important storage reservoir that provides about 20-30 % of the country's freshwater supply. The lake is Israel's only surface freshwater source and reservoir. It resides within a 2,730 km(2) watershed, 25 % of which is outside Israel's borders. The watershed is populated and contains urban, agricultural, and minor industrial activities, which produce a variety of nutrient and pollution loads that endanger water quality in the lake. The 2012 Long-Term Master Plan for the National Water Sector states the dual role that the lake is to play in the national water policy: to be a source of freshwater supply and to provide environmental services, noting that ecological health of the lake is an essential condition for both. This chapter outlines the policy, decision-making process, monitoring program, the organizational structure, and the management frameworks of Lake Kinneret and its watershed that sustain these roles of the lake. The major lake and watershed management actions implemented during the last 4 decades are detailed with their possible impact on the lake's water quality. It is concluded that ongoing and expanded lake and watershed management are promising means for maintaining a healthy ecological system and improved water quality in Lake Kinneret.																			1573-4595	2543-005X	978-94-017-8944-8; 978-94-017-8943-1				2014	6						541	560		10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_31	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_31	10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8												WOS:000459771400032
J	BUCK, BJ; MACK, GH				BUCK, BJ; MACK, GH			LATEST CRETACEOUS (MAASTRICHTIAN) ARIDITY INDICATED BY PALEOSOLS IN THE MCRAE FORMATION, SOUTH-CENTRAL NEW-MEXICO	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH												The McRae Formation in south-central New Mexico contains paleosols that indicate a significant increase in aridity occurred during the latest Cretaceous (late Maastrichtian). The McRae Formation is approximately 420 m thick and consists of interbedded fluvial channel sandstone and conglomerate, floodplain mudstone and fine sandstone, and siliceous ash-fall tuff. It has been divided into a lower Jose Creek Member and an upper Hall Lake Member. A Lancian dinosaur fauna is present in both members, indicating a late Maastrichtian age for the McRae Formation. Jose Creek paleosols are classified as argillisols and probably formed under humid to subhumid conditions. Paleosols in the Jose Creek Member consist of A, +/-E, and Bt horizons and are associated with numerous in situ petrified stumps, the largest of which is 1.7m in diameter. The argillic B horizons (Bt) contain vertical clay-filled root traces, rhizoliths, blocky peds, embedded-grain argillans, and ped argillans. In contrast, paleosols in the Hall Lake Member are calcisols and vertic calcisols. These paleosols are characterized by Bw, Bt, Btk, Bk, and K horizons. The calcic horizons contain vertical calcite-filled tubules and carbonate nodules, in addition to calcans, spar coats, brecciated zones, alveolar-septal fabric and gypsum pseudomorphs. The vertic calcisols contain wedge-shaped peds and slickensides. The presence of calcic horizons in the Hall Lake Member suggests that the paleoclimate was significantly drier than during deposition of the Jose Creek Member. In addition, the vertic features indicate periods of wetting and desiccation (seasonality of precipitation!) during Hall Lake rime. Late Maastrichtian aridity, based on paleosols, has also been interpreted for the Big Bend region of Texas, central Utah, and for Alberta, Canada, suggesting that the increase in aridity found in south-central New Mexico occurred throughout the Western Interior of North America.

Riley			Storm-damaged saline-contaminated boreholes as a means of aquifer contamination	GROUND WATER												Saline water from a storm surge can flow down storm-damaged submerged water supply wells and contaminate boreholes and surrounding aquifers. Using data from conventional purging techniques, aquifer test response analysis, chemical analysis, and regression analysis of chloride/silica (Cl/Si) ratio, equations were derived to estimate the volume of saline water intrusion into a well and a porous media aquifer, the volume of water needed to purge a well shortly following an intrusion event, and the volume of water needed after delay of several or more months, when the saline plume has expanded. Purging time required is a function of volume of water and pumping rate. The study site well is located within a shoreline community of Lake Pontchartrain, St. Tammany Parish, in southeastern Louisiana, United States, which was impacted by two hurricane storm surges and had neither been rehabilitated nor chlorinated prior to our study. Chemical analysis of water samples in fall 2005 and purging of well and aquifer in June 6, 2006, indicated saline water had intruded the well in 2005 and the well and aquifer in 2006. The volume of water needed to purge the study well was approximately 200 casing volumes, which is significantly greater than conventionally used during collection of water samples for water quality analyses.

J	PSENNER, R; SCHMIDT, R				PSENNER, R; SCHMIDT, R			CLIMATE-DRIVEN PH CONTROL OF REMOTE ALPINE LAKES AND EFFECTS OF ACID DEPOSITION	NATURE												DESPITE the attention given in recent years to the issue of lake acidification by anthropogenic emissions, the question of how climate change might influence the acid-base equilibria of lakes has been little explored. Here we use palaeolimnological data to show that the acidity of two soft-water, high-altitude lakes in the central Alps was correlated with regional temperature during the entire nineteenth century, colder years being associated with lower pH. Our findings of high concentrations of organic matter and elevated Fe/Mn ratios in the corresponding sediment layers support the view that this relationship is dictated primarily by the temperature dependence of in-lake processes of alkalinity generation. The onset of anthropogenically derived acid precipitation at the beginning of the present century led to a breakdown of the pH-temperature relationship, with pH dropping steadily to values of 5.6-5.8. Nevertheless, temperature maxima around 1950 still coincide with peaks in pH, and some pH minima before 1900 fell as low as as the levels around 1970. It is an open question whether the very recent levelling off that we observe in the decline of pH is due to rising temperatures or to decreasing precipitation acidity.																			0028-0836					APR 30	1992	356	6372					781	783		10.1038/356781a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/356781a0													WOS:A1992HR18600045

The five species were Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis, N = 84), Ring-necked Duck (Aythya collaris, N = 57), Greater Scaup (Aythya marila, N = 54), Redhead (Aythya americana, N = 58), and Canvasback (Aythya valisineria, N = 112). The diets of these species reportedly differ in diversity as well as in amount of fibre, and interspecific differences in gut morphology, not explained by differences in body weight, were accounted for by general differences in diet. Canvasbacks, although the heaviest species, had the shortest ceca, short intestines and light gizzards, presumably because their diet contains the least fibre. Conversely, the relatively small-bodies scaup species had the longest small intestines, likely because of their diverse diets which include animal and plant material. Our results show that morphological differences in waterfowl guts reflect dietary differences at a particular time and location and also illustrate the importance of adjusting gut measurements to body weight before making interspecific comparisons.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1985	63	10					2339	2342		10.1139/z85-346	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z85-346													WOS:A1985AUC7700016

Irrigated agriculture influences selenium levels in an endangered marsh bird	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Selenium bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs poses risks to wildlife, particularly in wetlands receiving irrigation runoff. The Salton Sea, California's largest lake, is primarily sustained by agricultural drainage. This drainage creates wetland habitat along the lakeshore that many bird species depend on, including the federally endangered Yuma Ridgway's rail (Rallus obsoletus yumanensis). However, these marshes may pose an ecological trap - attracting rails despite high selenium exposure. We captured rails during the 2020-2023 breeding seasons and compared rail selenium levels within three types of marshes (fed with irrigation runoff, Colorado River water, or groundwater). We collected blood, breast feathers, and head feathers of rails in all three water sources for selenium comparisons. We tagged adult rails with GPS transmitters to locate nests and foraging locations where we collected eggshells, unhatched eggs, and prey. We assessed selenium exposure by collecting multiple prey species commonly eaten by rails in all three water sources. Selenium concentrations varied among sampling locations. Selenium concentrations in most sample types were predominately influenced by water source and marsh inflow velocity (sometimes in combination with marsh size). Distance to inflow, however, did not influence selenium concentrations in any sample type. Selenium concentrations were highest in agricultural-fed marshes compared to river-fed and spring-fed marshes. Increased marsh inflow velocities resulted in lower selenium concentrations. Given the risk of an ecological trap, our results suggest that supplementing wetlands with Colorado River water could mitigate selenium bioaccumulation in Yuma Ridgway's rails.

The influence of weather conditions on breeding dates of the common gull (Larus canus) in the south of Western Siberia	SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT												Aim. The purpose of this research was to find out what local weather factors influence the nesting timing of the common gull (Larus canus). Material and Methods. The time of egg laying by the common gull was determined using data obtained during regular surveys over 8 years (1996--1998, 2002-2003, 2006-2008) on the islands of Lake Boishie Chany. Weather and climatic factors were assessed using open-access databases. Results. It was been established that the start of egg-laying in the colony of the common gull is determined by wind strength, the number of rainy days, the associated atmospheric pressure during the second decade of April, and the air temperature - the transition date at which the average daily air temperature rose above 0 degrees C. In years with unstable spring temperatures, a relationship was revealed between the air temperature and the intensity of egg laying by the common gulls by day. In years when temperatures rise evenly, precipitation and wind speed become the main factors. Conclusion. We conclude that the egg-laying dates of the common gull is influenced by weather variables during the whole nesting season and not predominantly by early season variables. We also show the importance of large-scale climatic phenomena such as the EAWR in explaining variability in timing of the nesting of the common gull in Siberia. We suggest that future studies should focus on the effects of extremes in weather variables and global climatic phenomena.					; Yurlov, Alexander/R-4483-2016	Garyushkina, Maria/0000-0002-0280-9175; 													1992-1098	2413-0958					2021	16	3					8	18		10.18470/1992-1098-2021-3-8-18	http://dx.doi.org/10.18470/1992-1098-2021-3-8-18													WOS:000713783300001
J	Lövstedt, CB; Bengtsson, L				Lovstedt, Charlotta Borell; Bengtsson, Lars			Density-driven current between reed belts and open water in a shallow lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Differential heating of surface waters of lakes caused by shading from vegetation can induce convection, which could be significant for the ecosystem because the chemistry and biology can differ in the reed belt zone compared to the open lake. This process has been given little attention in the literature. In the present study surface currents just outside a reed belt as well as radiation and water temperature profiles within and outside the vegetated belt were measured in a shallow lake in southern Sweden to determine the lateral flux between the two zones. The measured surface current directed toward the vegetation was about 1 cm/s. Net radiation at the water surface was 85% lower within the vegetation than in the open lake. The water surface temperature during sunny days was on average 0.5 degrees C warmer outside the reed belt, and at maximum 1 degrees C warmer. The lateral heat flux from the open water into the water within the reeds was estimated to similar to 200 W/m(2) during midday on sunny days, which corresponded to a calculated maximum current of 1.5 cm/s. This current between the open water and the reed vegetation is presumably the main water exchange process between the two zones during sunny summer days with low wind speeds.																			0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT 21	2008	44	10							W10413	10.1029/2008WR006949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008WR006949													WOS:000260389400003

Apparent survival and detection estimates for PIT-tagged slimy sculpin in five small new Brunswick streams	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus is an abundant and widespread benthic fish that inhabits cold lakes and rivers in North America. The objective of this study was to estimate survival and detection probabilities for slimy sculpin in relation to several environmental and biological predictors. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags were implanted into 337 adult slimy sculpin in five tributaries of the Kennebecasis River, New Brunswick, Canada. A portable PIT tag antenna was used to search for marked individuals from June 2003 to July 2004. Cormack-Jolly-Seber open population models were used to test several predictions and to estimate apparent survival and detection probabilities. We found that survival was high (73-99%) among sampling events; the average period was about 4 weeks (range, < 1-22 weeks). Survival was positively related to fish length and negatively related to maximum stream discharge. The mean detection probability of tagged sculpin was 0.80, but it varied among sampling events and with respect to the minimum electrical current of our antenna and the percentage of boulder substrate at the site. This study demonstrates that a portable PIT tag system can be used in conjunction with capture-mark-recapture models to acquire an understanding of the basic life history characteristics of slimy sculpin and possibly other small-bodied fish in freshwater systems.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2007	136	1					281	292		10.1577/T05-131.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-131.1													WOS:000244312900024
J	Paposhvili, N				Paposhvili, Nika			Seasonal abundance and breeding biology of the Velvet Scoter Melanitta fusca at Lake Tabatskuri, Georgia	WILDFOWL												Velvet Scoters Melanitta fusca from the disjunct Turkey, Georgia and Armenia nesting population were studied during 2017-2020 at what is now their last known breeding site, at Tabatskuri Lake in southern Georgia. Paired birds returned to the lake soon after thaw in April and females and young remained into November in some years. Early failing females and most males migrate to moult elsewhere in late July, although 11-19 males remained to moult on the lake each year, departing in late September/early October. Annual summer maxima ranged from 77-92 individuals, typically comprised of 43-55% females during April-August (although inevitably fewer during incubation). Nests were totally confined to one island, where the number of breeding pairs recorded ranged from 23-33 (in 2018 and 2019, respectively). Nest success (at least one duckling hatched) varied from 74% (in 2018 and 2020) to 52% (2019), recorded for 23 (2018), 33 (2019) and 31 nests (2020), although more females were present early in the season in each year. Camera traps monitoring 11 nests recorded egg predation by Marsh Harriers Circus aerginosus on two occasions. Hatching success for all eggs laid was 54% (in 2018), 36% (2019) and 49% (2020), with overall survival of the eggs to fledging ranging from 2% (in 2018 and 2019) to 13% (in 2020). Duckling mortality was likely due to predation by Armenian Gulls Larus armenicus soon after hatching and to drowning in fishing nets. Local community engagement has stopped egg collecting on the island and contributed to reduced fishing disturbance for Velvet Scoters in the ducklings' nursery areas, when newly hatched young are most vulnerable to gull predation. Additionally, gull numbers were lower in 2020, which also likely contributed to the improved breeding success in that year. We urge continued vigilance and further research to confirm the direct causes of the Velvet Scoters' poor breeding success at the site, to improve the conservation status of the species in the region.																			0954-6324	2052-6458					2021	71						221	233																WOS:000726039300013
J	PALMER, MR; HELVACI, C				PALMER, MR; HELVACI, C			THE BORON ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE KIRKA BORATE DEPOSIT, WESTERN TURKEY	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We have measured the boron isotope composition of seventeen samples of borate minerals (colemanite, ulexite, and borax) and the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio in thirteen borate samples from the Kirka borate deposit in western Anatolia, Turkey. These Neogene deposits were formed by evaporation of playa lakes fed by geothermal springs. The delta(11)B values range from - 14.9 parts per thousand in colemanite to -1.6 parts per thousand in borax. To a first approximation the relative differences in the delta(11)B values of the borate minerals are consistent With their basic boron atomic configuration, but the magnitude of the boron isotope fractionation between the three minerals precludes their simultaneous precipitation from a brine with the same boron isotope composition and pH. Rather the data are consistent with precipitation of colemanite from a brine with lower pH than that required for ulexite precipitation, which in turn requires a lower pH than is needed for borax precipitation. The boron isotope data also suggest that the borate minerals did not maintain boron isotopic equilibrium with the brine after they precipitated. Rayleigh fractionation models indicate that during borax precipitation the delta(11)B value of the brine was slightly heavier than during precipitation of ulexite and colemanite.

J	Seilmaier, M; Guggemos, W				Seilmaier, M.; Guggemos, W.			Severe febrile illness with renal impairment after travel to Southeast Asia	INTERNIST												History. A 40-year-old teacher fell ill one week after returning from a two weeks back-packing trip to Thailand and Laos. He developed high fever, severe headache, myalgias and a conjunctivitis. Investigations. CRP and liver enzymes were elevated. The patient developed acute renal failure. Total leucocyte count was normal but the differential count showed an extreme left shift. Imaging procedures revealed hepato-splenomegaly and enlarged kidneys. Treatment, course and diagnosis. The patient was treated with moxifloxacin and ceftriaxon based on the initial suspicion of a severe infection potentially due to leptospirosis. This treatment led to a rapid improvement of the patient's condition and also of the laboratory findings. Leptospirosis could be confirmed by the seroconversion of specific antibodies to L. grippotyphosa 21/2 weeks after onset of complaints (initial serology negative). Conclusions. In febrile travelers returning from Southeast Asia, leptospirosis has to be considered especially in case of severe headache, myalgias, elevated liver enzymes and renal failure and a history of close contact to potentially contaminated water (rivers, lakes). Diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of specific antibodies.																			0020-9554	1432-1289				NOV	2008	49	11					1372	+		10.1007/s00108-008-2144-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00108-008-2144-6								18682907					WOS:000260510100009
J	Lin, P; Guo, LD				Lin, Peng; Guo, Laodong			Dynamic changes in the abundance and chemical speciation of dissolved and particulate phosphorus across the river-lake interface in southwest Lake Michigan	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phosphorus (P) concentrations and primary production in the Great Lakes have declined since the 1980s, but changes in biogeochemical cycling pathways of different P species remain poorly understood. Water samples were collected for the measurements of different P species to examine the dynamics of P in the water column across the river-lake interface from the Milwaukee River to open Lake Michigan. Dissolved inorganic P (DIP) concentrations were as high as 3049 nM in river waters, but decreased dramatically to as low as 1167 nM in open lake waters. Total dissolved P was mostly measured in the form of DIP in river waters (73% +/- 18%), whereas dissolved organic P (DOP) became the predominant species (85% +/- 18%) in lake waters. Colloidal P (>1 kDa) comprised 58% +/- 16% of the bulk DOP in river waters, but decreased to 23% +/- 5% in ologotrophic lake waters, showing again contrasting biogeochemical regimes between river and lake waters. Biological processes and coagulation/sedimentation were largely responsible for the removal of river-derived P species and active transformation between inorganic and organic P occurred in both dissolved and particulate phases across the river-lake interface. Increased water column P inventory over the winter of 2013-2014 likely resulted from an accumulative effect of both atmospheric and riverine inputs in the upper water column, and benthic nepheloid layer processes coupled with quagga mussels excretion for the lower water column, respectively. High partition coefficient values (logK(d) of 4.33-7.01) and a "particle concentration effect" on the partitioning of P between dissolved and particulate phases attested the particle-reactive nature of P in lake waters.

Crater floor polygons: Desiccation patterns of ancient lakes on Mars?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Global mapping of intermediate-size (100-200 m) polygonal troughs occurring mainly in impact crater floors was carried out using high-resolution images from spacecraft currently orbiting Mars. Earlier works have classified these polygonal networks as periglacial features on account of their apparent occurrence at higher latitudes and morphological similarities to thermal contraction polygons (TCPs). Crater floor polygons (CFPs) have diameters ranging from 15 to 350 m. They morphologically resemble terrestrial TCPs and desiccation cracks. Their size distribution, however, is significantly different from that of TCPs that are ubiquitous in the high latitudes. An analytical model based on fracture mechanics reveals that under current climatic conditions, the maximum fracture spacing attainable by thermal stresses alone is 75 m at the most. More reasonable values fall within 18 and 22 m, which is the range for TCPs on Mars. As a result, we propose desiccation to be a dominant mechanism for the formation of CFPs without ruling out thermal contraction as a possible contributor in some cases. This implies that lakes or water-rich sediments occupied the craters in the past. Many such aqueous environments have no apparent external source of water, and thus, hydrothermal processes occurring shortly after the impact event may be viable explanations for the observed evidence. The association of features, which correspond to terrestrial lakes such as sedimentary deposits, mounds, and shorelines, corroborates lake formation and their eventual desiccation to form CFPs. The variation of CFP sizes with location can be indicative of different hydrologic environments.

Influences of channel and floodplain modification on expansion of woody vegetation into Catahoula Lake, Louisiana, USA	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Ecosystem structure of wetlands in managed floodplains depends on hydrological processes controlled by geomorphology and water management. Overlapping effects of direct modifications and geomorphic adjustments to management can combine to trigger changes to floodplain ecosystem structure. We examined the case of woody vegetation encroaching into the depressional Catahoula Lake, Louisiana, in the context of regional hydrologic and geomorphic modification in the floodplain of the Mississippi River. Historical aerial photographs indicated woody encroachment into Catahoula Lake for at least 80 years, and the rate of expansion has increased in recent decades. Historical stage analysis revealed that the downstream Red-Atchafalaya-Mississippi River system controls the lower limit of the lake water level when the large rivers are high, but channel enlargement and other hydrological changes there have reduced the frequency of backwater flooding by 42% since 1880. In addition, operation of the water control structure on the lake has altered its hydrological regime to be more regular among years. Historic stage analysis revealed current lake levels are lower in the high-water spring, less variable in the dry period, and lack the extreme high-water events of 100+ years ago, all of which facilitate the expansion of woody vegetation.					; Joshi, Sanjeev/J-1949-2019; King, Stephanie/C-8633-2016; Keim, Richard/AAI-6514-2020	, Sanjeev/0000-0002-8040-8668; King, Sammy/0000-0002-5364-6361; Latuso, Karen/0000-0003-3524-2176; Dugue, Lincoln/0009-0003-9377-9323; Keim, Richard F./0000-0003-4488-9537													0197-9337	1096-9837				MAY	2022	47	6					1466	1479		10.1002/esp.5328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5328		FEB 2022											WOS:000754226000001

OBSERVATIONS OF SHOALING AND FEEDING BEHAVIOR OF JUNE SUCKER, CHASMISTES LIORUS, IN A REFUGE POPULATION	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Observations of shoaling and feeding behavior of the zooplanktivorous June sucker, Chasmistes horns, were made during summer 2003 in Red Butte Reservoir, Utah, Water clarity limited observations to 0.5-15 m below the water surface. Schools of adult suckers, ranging from a few to >200 fish, were observed on 20 days from May to September. I classified them as schools rather than shoals because the groups moved synchronously rather than appearing simply as an aggregation of fish. These schools were near the water surface, generally in areas of the reservoir with a water depth of >3 m, and presumably fed on the zooplankton in the epilimnion. juvenile suckers (age-1 and age-2) were observed only on a few occasions, near inundated vegetation. Age-0 suckers were observed in large shoals (aggregations Of hundreds of fish) near the surface in the shadows of inundated vegetation in July and August. juvenile suckers (age-0, age-1, and age-2) were always observed in age-specific shoals, while suckers in adult schools had a wider range of sizes.																			1527-0904					SEP	2008	68	3					390	395		10.3398/1527-0904(2008)68[390:OOSAFB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3398/1527-0904(2008)68[390:OOSAFB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000259937600014
J	Achterberg, EP; van den Berg, CMG; Boussemart, M; Davison, W				Achterberg, EP; van den Berg, CMG; Boussemart, M; Davison, W			Speciation and cycling of trace metals in Esthwaite Water: A productive English lake with seasonal deep-water anoxia	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The chemical speciation of Cu, Ni, and Cr and the dissolved and unfiltered concentrations of Mo, Ti, Co, Fe, Mn, and Zn were determined in the water column of a lake with a seasonally anoxic hypolimnion (Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, UK) during three surveys in the summer of 1991. Cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV) with ligand competition was used for this speciation study. The metal data, in conjunction with physical and nutrient data, were used to assess the biogeochemical processes controlling the distribution and speciation of the trace metals in the lake and their seasonal variation. Thermodynamic calculations were used to assess the dissolved trace metal speciation and the saturation state of metal-sulphide phases. The development of anoxia in the lake had an important influence on the redox speciation of dissolved Cr, with Cr(III), forming the major Cr species under anoxic conditions. Cobalt showed enhanced concentrations in the hypolimnion during anoxia, coinciding with enhanced Fe and Mn levels. Dissolved Cu, Ni, and Zn concentrations in the hypolimnion decreased dining anoxia, which could possibly be explained by particle scavenging (iron sulphides) and a decline in hypolimnetic supply as the season develops. Regeneration processes of sunken organic detritus on the sediment-water interface were the most likely causes for enhanced hypolimnetic concentrations of Ni, Cu, and Zn, during periods when the lake was completely oxic. Substantial organic Ni and Cu complexation was observed in Esthwaite Water, which was attributed to the eutrophic character of the lake. Between 25 and 80% of the dissolved Ni in Esthwaite Water was strongly complexed by natural ligands. The highest proportions of Ni complexation were observed in the epilimnion and hypolimnion, with a minimum in the thermocline. Strong Cu complexing ligands were observed in the lake, with dissolved ligand concentrations between 6.8 and 29.4 nM and conditional stability constants between 10(11.1) and 10(14.4). More than 94% of the dissolved Cu in Esthwaite Water was complexed by the natural ligands. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	YU, GE; HARRISON, SP				YU, GE; HARRISON, SP			HOLOCENE CHANGES IN ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PATTERNS AS SHOWN BY LAKE STATUS CHANGES IN NORTHERN EUROPE	BOREAS												Changes in lake status, a measure of relative water depth or lake level, have been reconstructed from geological and biological evidence for 87 sites in northern Europe. During the early Holocene, the lakes show conditions similar to or drier than present in a broad band across southern Britain, southern Scandinavia and into the eastern Baltic and wetter conditions along the west coast and in central Europe. This pattern is consistent with the effects of a glacial anticyclone over the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, namely enhanced southwesterly flow along the west coast and strengthened easterlies south of the ice. After c. 8000 BP a different lake status pattern was established, with conditions drier than present over much of northern Europe. Lakes higher than today were confined to the far north, the west coast. eastern Finland and western Russia. This pattern gradually attenuated after 4000 BP. Differences in lake status during the mid- to late Holocene are consistent with a strengthening of the blocking anticyclone over the Baltic Sea in summer, resulting in more meridional circulation than today. This strengthening of the blocking anticyclone during the mid-Holocene is interpreted as a consequence of insolation changes, enhanced by the fact that the Baltic Sea was larger than present.					; Harrison, Sandy/ADX-4692-2022	Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; 													0300-9483					SEP	1995	24	3					260	268																WOS:A1995TF71700007

Species-specific qPCR assays allow for high-resolution population assessment of four species avian schistosome that cause swimmer's itch in recreational lakes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE												Swimmer's itch is an allergic condition that occurs when the motile and infectious stage of avian schistosomes penetrate the skin of an individual. Flatworm parasites that cause swimmer's itch belong to the family Schistosomatidae. They utilize a variety of different species of bird and mammal as definitive hosts, and rely on different species of snail, in which they complete their larval development to culminate in a motile, aquatic, infectious stage called a cercaria. Recently, qPCR-based assays have been developed to monitor for swimmer's itch-causing trematodes in recreational water. This environmental DNA approach has been useful for quantifying the abundance of the free-living cercaria, the causative agent of swimmer's itch. However, the existing qPCR test amplifies from all known schistosome species, making it excellent for assessing a site for swimmer's itch potential, but not useful in determining the specific species contributing to swimmer's itch or the likely hosts (snail and bird) of the swimmer's itch-causing parasites. Thus, species-specific resolution built into a qPCR test would be useful in answering ecological questions about swimmer's itch cause, and efficacy of control efforts. This paper details bird, snail, and cercaria surveys conducted in the summer of 2018, that culminated in the development and deployment of four species-specific qPCR assays, capable of detecting Trichobilharzia stagnicolae, Trichobilharzia szidati, Trichobilharzia physellae, and Anserobilharzia brantae in recreational water. These assays were used to assess the relative abundance of each parasite in water samples collected from lakes in Northern Michigan.

Sediment cores from four subalpine lakes were sectioned and dated with 210Pb. The stratigraphic records of metals were used to detect trends in the deposition of Pb, Cu, Zn, and V because these metals are known to increase in areas receiving air masses polluted with fossil-fuel emissions. Diatom assemblages over time were used as indicators of change in lake water chemistry. Reconstructions of pH from four lakes were prepared using Index B, Index .alpha., and predictive equations derived from an additional 19 lake surface sediments. The metal stratigraphy, diatom stratigraphy, and inferred pH profiles of the four study lakes indicate no historical influence on pH attributable to atmospheric deposition. Common to all four cored lakes, however, is a persistent increase in the deposition rate of Pb starting in the period between 1855 and 1905. The most likely source of the Pb is airborne particles from mining activity in Colorado which began in the mid-1800s. Recent high levels of Pb within the sediments may be due in part to emissions related to automotive leaded gasoline combustion.

Such changes necessitate a more comprehensive understanding of climate-flood dynamics across river systems. A significant challenge in flood risk assessment is that instrumental data records cover only the last few decades and do not capture low-frequency, high-magnitude extremes. Another challenge is the non-stationarity of the leading atmospheric pattern over Scandinavia, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which requires a spatial understanding of extreme events through time. To address this issue, we use lacustrine sediments from southernmost Norway, aiming to extend flood records beyond the scope of instrumental and historical data by exploring a threshold lake that accumulates flood deposits only when river discharge exceeds a critical level. A multi-proxy approach, which includes X-ray fluorescence (XRF), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic susceptibility (MS), was applied to fingerprint the sediments. We detected thin layers of minerogenic sediments, which we interpreted as slackwater deposits accumulated in a lake environment during extreme flood events. These fine-grained minerogenic bands were quantified using XRF and CT data to reconstruct the frequency of major floods over the past similar to 7000 years. The minimum water discharge necessary for transporting sediments into the lake was assessed with the HEC-RAS hydraulic simulation software. Our record shows a high frequency of extreme floods from 7000 to 5000 cal yr BP before a significant decrease from 5000 to 2300 cal yr BP. The frequency has been high since 2300 cal yr BP, with a peak frequency after 1600 CE, coinciding with the Little Ice Age. There is a strong co-variability between a positive NAO index, winter precipitation, and major flood events over the past 120 years. A comparison between our flood record and other palaeorecords suggests that this relationship also holds on multi-millennial time scales.					; Sabatier, Pierre/ISU-8926-2023; Bakke, Jostein/AAI-1145-2020	van der Bilt, Willem/0000-0003-3157-451X; Cederstrom, Jan Magne/0000-0001-9126-1174													0277-3791	1873-457X				MAY 1	2024	331								108659	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108659		APR 2024											WOS:001292572800001

During 14 000-13 400 cal. a BP, primarily treeless pioneer tundra vegetation existed. Tree birch ( Betula sect. Albae) macro-remains and a high tree pollen accumulation rate indicate the presence of forest-tundra with birch and possibly pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees during 13 400-12 850 cal. a BP. Palaeobotanical data indicate that the colonisation and development of forested areas were very rapid, arising within a period of less than 50 years. Thus far, there are no indications of conifer macrofossils in Estonia to support the presence of coniferous forests in the Lateglacial period. Signs of Greenland Interstadial 1b cooling during 13 100 cal. a BP are distinguishable. Biostratigraphic evidence indicates that the vegetation was again mostly treeless tundra during the final colder episode of the Lateglacial period associated with Greenland Stadial 1, approximately 12 850-11 650 cal. a BP. This was followed by onset of the Holocene vegetation, with the expansion of boreal forests, in response to rapid climatic warming. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The specific question was to see if slight increases in the water regime of the lake (three scenarios), as part of a restoration programme, affect the timing of nesting and occupation of colonies by whiskered terns by way of changes in biomass of waterlily (Nymphaea alba) beds where colonies always establish. During the study period, egg-laying dates were progressively delayed up to 40-50 days (mid-May to early July) in relation to late appearance of suitable waterlily biomass (R(2) = 0.67, p = 0.01) associated with high spring water levels (1.10-1.25 m vs. 0.95 m). Simultaneously some nesting attempts were observed in sub-optimal habitats (adjacent wet grasslands) in high flooding conditions leading either to poor breeding success or colony desertion. We concluded that there is a need for compromise between the experimental water levels used to control waterlily biomass and the nesting requirements of the whiskered tern population in this lake of international importance (260-510 pairs in 1995-2002, >= 1% Ramsar level).

Hatchery-reared brown trout grew more slowly and had a smaller asymptotic length (293 +/- 71 mm CL) than native fish (391 +/- 56 mm CL). Hatchery-reared brown trout also exhibited significantly shorter life spans than native fish. This category consisted mainly of individuals aged 2+ and 3+ years, and only 1.5% of the specimens were aged greater than or equal to 5 years. The ages of the native fish in the sample were between 2 and 8 years, and the most abundant age groups of trout were 4+ and 5+ years. It is suggested that the differences in life-history characteristics are related to adaptations by the native trout to the local environmental conditions. In this reservoir, which has a limited food supply as a result of water level fluctuations and a high level of inter- and intraspecific competition, environmental effects might be significant.																			0969-997X					FEB	1999	6	1					47	61		10.1046/j.1365-2400.1999.00138.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2400.1999.00138.x													WOS:000082699100004

Pore-water concentrations of methane in the gravels of the riverbed were much lower throughout the year (71 nmol CH4 L-1), suggesting significant methane oxidation. To investigate the potential for methane oxidation as a novel chemosynthetic source of carbon to the food web, we made simultaneous measurements, in laboratory chambers, of primary production, respiration, and methane oxidation associated with the gravels. Biomass-specific net primary production was up to 2.7 mu mol O-2 mg(-1) chlorophyll (Chl) h(-1) and was similarly high for respiration (2.7 mu mol O-2 mg(-1) Chl h(-1)). We also found active methane (CH4) oxidation with the rate increasing in proportion to concentration. At the maximum rate of 0.18 mu mol CH4 mg(-1) Chl h(-1) and a growth efficiency of 0.8, net carbon fixation via methane oxidation was equivalent to 6% of the carbon fixed via net photosynthetic primary production. However, production via methane oxidation could be proportionately much greater under the shade of the profuse instream or riparian vegetation, deep in the gravels, and especially during winter, when light is limiting (< 25 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)).					; Trimmer, Mark/ABB-2336-2021; Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012	Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271; Maanoja, Susanna/0000-0001-6921-1672; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2010	55	2					560	568		10.4319/lo.2009.55.2.0560	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.55.2.0560													WOS:000276440000009
J	SOMERS, JD; GOSKI, BC; BARBEAU, JM; BARRETT, MW				SOMERS, JD; GOSKI, BC; BARBEAU, JM; BARRETT, MW			ACCUMULATION OF ORGANOCHLORINE CONTAMINANTS IN DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANTS	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Cormorant eggs and lipid samples from juvenile Cormorants were analyzed for 14 organochlorine contaminants. Low concentrations (geometric mean <0.05 mug/g) of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), lindane, oxy-chlordane, heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, endrin, mirex, DDD and DDT in eggs primarily reflected the wintering-ground origin of organochlorine contaminants. Overall geometric mean concentrations of DDE and PCBs in Cormorant eggs were 3.90 and 2.22 mug/g egg respectively, and would not affect reproduction or eggshell thickness. Eggshells averaged 0.44 mm in thickness and no correlation (r2 = 0.17) with log-transformed DDE residues in Cormorant eggs was evident. Only DDE and PCBs were detected in lipid samples from 5- to 8-week-old Cormorants (geometric mean approximately 1.0 mug/g lipid for each compound). The PCB: DDE ratios in Cormorant lipid from some individual colonies were 2-3.5 times greater than the ratio in eggs from the same colony, suggesting an accumulation of PCBs related to local diet. Juvenile Cormorants might serve as regional indicators of chemical residue contamination in Alberta, and provide a temporal perspective on changes in contaminant burdens in aquatic ecosystems.																			0269-7491						1993	80	1					17	23		10.1016/0269-7491(93)90004-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(93)90004-8								15091867					WOS:A1993KK07700003

Impacts of phosphorus loading temporal pattern on benthic algae growth in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Nuisance growth of the alga Cladophora has been a critical issue in the Laurentian Great Lakes for decades. Although loading of total phosphorus (TP) has been below target values since the 1990s, the nearshore of the lakes still experience Cladophora blooms. This study explores the effects of TP loading temporal pattern on Cladophora growth in Rochester Embayment in Lake Ontario, where Cladophora blooms are frequently observed. Long-term TP loadings from the Genesee River, which is the primary tributary to the embayment, are calculated with a hydrological model, and Cladophora indicators based on beach closures and satellite data are collected for 2008-2017 to analyze the TP loading temporal patterns and their relation with Cladophora abundance. Using time series clustering for both TP loading and Cladophora indicators, it is found that besides total annual TP loading, the timing of high TP loading also plays an important role for Cladophora growth. High TP loading in mid-March to mid-June, compared to that in January to mid-March, is found to produce higher Cladophora abundance in summer. This finding is supported and explained using an integrated hydrodynamic and ecological modeling framework that includes a state-of-the-art Cladophora module. This study suggests that future Cladophora control should consider not only the total annual TP loading mass, but also the temporal loading patterns.					; Saharia, Angshuman/ABD-6822-2020; hui, yuan/KEH-5562-2024; Zhu, Zhenduo/I-2736-2017	Zhu, Zhenduo/0000-0002-7711-7632; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUL	2021	598								126449	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126449		MAY 2021											WOS:000661813200177
J	Ueda, S; Hasegawa, H; Takaku, Y; Kondo, K				Ueda, S; Hasegawa, H; Takaku, Y; Kondo, K			Behavior of uranium under various redox conditions in a shallow brackish lake	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY												The behavior of uranium under various redox conditions was investigated in the brackish Obuchi lake surrounded by an uranium enrichment plant and facilities currently under construction for reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel in Rokkasho Village in northern Japan. Our investigation showed that uranium in water under oxic conditions can be explained by the simple mixing of freshwater and seawater, and the source of uranium in the lake is mainly seawater. The ratios of U-238/salinity under oxic conditions were approximately 0.09-0.12 mug.l(-1).psu(-1). However, the ratios of U-238/salinity in bottom layer water under anoxic condition in summer were lower (0.07-0.09 mug.l(-1).psu(-1)) than those in seawater. U-238 concentrations in pore water sampled under anoxic conditions were very low (0.05-0.06 mug.l(-1).psu(-1)). Moreover, the relationships between the U-238/Al ratios and the Fe/Al ratios of particle substances were strongly correlated. This suggests that uranium in the bottom-layer water may be precipitated to an insoluble form in the anoxic state, and Fe is the major carrier of insoluble uranium.

Berry			Water tracks and permafrost in Taylor Valley, Antarctica: Extensive and shallow groundwater connectivity in a cold desert ecosystem	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Water tracks are zones of high soil moisture that route water downslope over the ice table in polar environments. We present physical, hydrological, and geochemical evidence collected in Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, which suggests that previously unexplored water tracks are a significant component of this cold desert land system and constitute the major flow path in a cryptic hydrological system. Geological, geochemical, and hydrological analyses show that the water tracks are generated by a combination of infiltration from melting snowpacks, melting of pore ice at the ice table beneath the water tracks, and melting of buried segregation ice formed during winter freezing. The water tracks are enriched in solutes derived from chemical weathering of sediments as well as from dissolution of soil salts. The water tracks empty into ice-covered lakes, such as Lake Hoare, resulting in the interfingering of shallow groundwater solutions and glacier-derived stream water, adding complexity to the geochemical profile. Approximately four orders of magnitude less water is delivered to Lake Hoare by any given water track than is delivered by surface runoff from stream flow; however, the solute delivery to Lake Hoare by water tracks equals or may exceed the mass of solutes delivered from stream flow, making water tracks significant geochemical pathways. Additionally, solute transport is two orders of magnitude faster in water tracks than in adjacent dry or damp soil, making water tracks "salt superhighways" in the Antarctic cold desert. Accordingly, water tracks represent a new geological pathway that distributes water, energy, and nutrients in Antarctic Dry Valley, cold desert, soil ecosystems, providing hydrological and geochemical connectivity at the hillslope scale.					; Gooseff, Michael/N-6087-2015	Welch, Kathleen/0000-0003-1028-3086; Levy, Joseph/0000-0002-6222-139X; Gooseff, Michael/0000-0003-4322-8315													0016-7606	1943-2674				NOV-DEC	2011	123	11-12					2295	2311		10.1130/B30436.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B30436.1													WOS:000295402600011
J	Vinocur, A; Unrein, F				Vinocur, A; Unrein, F			Typology of lentic water bodies at Potter Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica) based on physical-chemical characteristics and phytoplankton communities	POLAR BIOLOGY												During austral summer 1995/1996, 26 ultraoligotrophic to hypereutrophic ponds and lakes on Potter Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica) were characterized on the basis of abiotic factors and the phytoplankton community. The influence of vegetation and animal presence in the catchment, morphometric variables of the water bodies and their proximity to the sea on composition and abundance of phytoplankton was also considered. Results of a Principal Component Analysis show that the characteristics of each catchment strongly influenced the abiotic parameter accounting for the obtained lake and pond ordination. In particular, five groups of water bodies were clearly defined primarily based on nutrients and suspended solid concentrations, and to a lesser extent on pH and conductivity. These groups could be classified into two assemblages distributed along a phytoplankton biomass gradient, which is regulated by the light availability in one case and by nutrient concentrations in the other. Among 140 algal taxa registered, 3 were new records for Antarctica and 18 taxa were new records for Potter Peninsula. Bacillariophyceae was the dominant class in terms of species number and density. Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria were subdominant. The tychoplanktonic habit was the best represented in almost all lakes.

Improving nutrient management practices in agriculture: The role of risk-based beliefs in understanding farmers' attitudes toward taking additional action	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A recent increase in the amount of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) entering the western Lake Erie basin is likely due to increased spring storm events in combination with issues related to fertilizer application and timing. These factors in combination with warmer lake temperatures have amplified the spread of toxic algal blooms. We assessed the attitudes of farmers in northwest Ohio toward taking at least one additional action to reduce nutrient loss on their farm. Specifically, we (1) identified to what extent farm and farmer characteristics (e.g., age, gross farm sales) as well as risk-based beliefs (e.g., efficacy, risk perception) influenced attitudes, and (2) assessed how these characteristics and beliefs differ in their predictive ability based on unobservable latent classes of farmers. Risk perception, or a belief that negative impacts to profit and water quality from nutrient loss were likely, was the most consistent predictor of farmer attitudes. Response efficacy, or a belief that taking action on one's farm made a difference, was found to significantly influence attitudes, although this belief was particularly salient for the minority class of farmers who were older and more motivated by profit. Communication efforts should focus on the negative impacts of nutrient loss to both the farm (i.e., profit) and the natural environment (i.e., water quality) to raise individual perceived risk among the majority, while the minority need higher perceived efficacy or more specific information about the economic effectiveness of particular recommended practices.																			0043-1397	1944-7973				AUG	2014	50	8					6735	6746		10.1002/2013WR015200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013WR015200													WOS:000342632300029

Dispersal of aquatic invertebrates by lesser black-backed gulls and white storks within and between inland habitats	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Waterbirds can transport aquatic invertebrates internally, contributing to metapopulation dynamics between aquatic habitats in a terrestrial matrix. However, research into this dispersal process to date has focused on individual field sites or laboratory studies. We investigated the invertebrates dispersed by endozoochory by the lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus wintering in Andalusia, south-west Spain in 2016-2017, comparing seven sites interconnected by their movements, with different degrees of anthropogenization [three landfills, two saltpan complexes, a natural lake, and a large (370 km(2)) ricefield area]. In the ricefields, we also compared invertebrates dispersed by gulls with those dispersed by the larger white stork Ciconia ciconia. A total of 642 intact invertebrates and their propagules (mainly plumatellid bryozoans, cladocerans, and other branchiopods) were recorded in excreta (faeces and pellets) from gulls and storks. A greater diversity and abundance of invertebrates were recorded in ricefields, notably 43 individuals of the alien snail Physella acuta. One snail was still alive in a gull pellet 3 weeks after being stored in a fridge. This represents the first record of snail dispersal within waterbird pellets. Viability was also confirmed for the cladoceran Macrothrix rosea recorded in ricefields, and the alien brine shrimp Artemia franciscana recorded mainly in saltpans. In ricefields, gulls and pellets had significantly fewer propagules and fewer taxa per gram of excreta than storks and faeces, respectively. Through their high mobility, gulls and storks can disperse invertebrates between different natural and artificial habitats, and even to landfills. They can promote metapopulation dynamics for native bryozoans and branchiopods, but also the spread of invasive snails and brine shrimp.					; Sánchez, Marta/E-9723-2010; Green, Andy/A-5189-2008; Hortas Rodriguez-Pascual, Francisco/Q-7437-2016; Hortas, Francisco/Q-7437-2016; Lovas-Kiss, Ádám/J-3746-2019; Sanchez, Marta I/E-9723-2010	Martin Velez, Victor/0000-0002-4846-8177; Hortas Rodriguez-Pascual, Francisco/0000-0003-0146-2605; Sanchez, Marta I/0000-0002-8349-5410													1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2022	84	1							10	10.1007/s00027-021-00842-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-021-00842-3													WOS:000730545300001

An Application of the T-TEL Assessment Method to Evaluate Connectivity in a Lake-Dominated Watershed after Drought	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Lakes are landscape features that influence connectivity of mass and energy by being foci for the reception, mixing, and provision of water and material. Where lake fractions are high, they influence hydrological connectivity. This behavior was exemplified in the Baker Creek watershed in Canada's Northwest Territories during a two-year drought in which many lake levels declined below outlet elevations. This study evaluated how lakes controlled surface runoff connectivity reestablishment following the drought using a new assessment method, T-TEL (time scales - thresholds, excesses, losses). Analysis of daily data showed that during a summer period following the drought, connectivity occurred between 0% and 41% of the time. The size of run-of-the-river lakes relative to their upstream watershed area, and the upstream lake fraction, are two factors for connectivity. These terms represent a lake's ability to control the size of storage deficits relative to rainfall, and evaporation and storage losses along pathways. The connectivity magnitude-duration curve only aligned with the watershed flow duration curve during high-water conditions, implying lakes functioned as individuals rather than as part of a perennial watercourse during much of the study. The T-TEL method can be used to quantify consistent metrics of hydrologic connectivity that can be used for regionalization exercises and understanding hydrologic controls on material transport.

J	Xu, Y; Huang, GH				Xu, Ye; Huang, Guohe			A Risk-Based Interval Two-Stage Programming Model for Agricultural System Management under Uncertainty	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING												Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution caused by agricultural activities is main reason that water quality in watershed becomes worse, even leading to deterioration. Moreover, pollution control is accompanied with revenue's fall for agricultural system. How to design and generate a cost-effective and environmentally friendly agricultural production pattern is a critical issue for local managers. In this study, a risk-based interval two-stage programming model (RBITSP) was developed. Compared to general ITSP model, significant contribution made by RBITSP model was that it emphasized importance of financial risk under various probabilistic levels, rather than only being concentrated on expected economic benefit, where risk is expressed as the probability of not meeting target profit under each individual scenario realization. This way effectively avoided solutions' inaccuracy caused by traditional expected objective function and generated a variety of solutions through adjusting weight coefficients, which reflected trade-off between system economy and reliability. A case study of agricultural production management with the Tai Lake watershed was used to demonstrate superiority of proposed model. Obtained results could be a base for designing land-structure adjustment patterns and farmland retirement schemes and realizing balance of system benefit, system-failure risk, and water-body protection.
