J	Back, RC; Gorski, PR; Cleckner, LB; Hurley, JP				Back, RC; Gorski, PR; Cleckner, LB; Hurley, JP			Mercury content and speciation in the plankton and benthos of Lake Superior	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					6th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant	OCT 15-19, 2001	MINAMATA, JAPAN					As part of a study is to assess the importance of watersheds in controlling sources, transport, fate, and bioavailability of monomethyl mercury (MeHg) in Lake Superior, biotic samples were collected and analyzed to determine total mercury (HgT) and MeHg content, and to examine size, species, trophic and geographic trends. Plankton was collected in two ways: vertical tows of non-metallic, 153 mum mesh net (bulk zooplankton), and by passively filtering near-surface water through stacked Nitex sieves, generating size-fractionated seston ( <35, 35-63, 63-112, and >112 mum). Benthos was sampled using a Ponar grab to collect sediment, and a non-metallic sieve to separate biota from substrate. Samples were processed to quantify dry weights, HgT and MeHg. Results for bulk zooplankton sampled offshore showed a range of approximately from 35 to 50 ng MeHg/gram dry weight (gdw) and from 80 to 130 ng HgT/gdw during April, and from 15 to 25 ng MeHg/gdw and from 20 to 70 ng HgT/gdw during August. Results from sieved, near-surface water from offshore sites in April showed a dominance by the <35 mum size fraction both in total mass and mass of MeHg compared to other size fractions. On a dry weight basis, however, we found little difference between the size fractions in April (MeHg ranges from 2 to 10 ng/gdw). During the summer cruise, we found similar concentrations in the <35 mum fraction, but higher in the 112-243 mum size fraction (MeHg 14-16 ng/gdw). The MeHg concentration in Mysis relicta ranged from 33 to 54 ng/gdw throughout the lake. Chironomid larvae were 8 ng MeHg/gdw and amphipods were 32 ng MeHg/gdw. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Matthews, DA; Stehman, SV; Effler, SW				Matthews, DA; Stehman, SV; Effler, SW			Limnological and statistical issues for monitoring the impact of a lake source, cooling facility: Cayuga Lake, NY	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Limnological data collected for two years at nine sites in the southern end of Cayuga Lake, NY, before the start-up of a cooling water facility (summer 2000), are analyzed to identify appropriate measures of trophic state and estimate the capability of a monitoring program to identify changes associated with the operation of this facility. The concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl) is found to be the preferred indicator of trophic state. The concentration of total phosphorus and clarity are compromised as trophic indicators in this system because of the contributions of inanimate particles (tripton) to these measures associated with the hydrology and morphometry of the lake and the occurrence of the whiting phenomenon. A Before-After-Control-Impact design is used to assess the ability of the monitoring program to detect potential impacts associated with operation of the cooling water facility. Statistical power analyses conducted with the pre-operational monitoring data indicate the current bi-weekly sampling program will detect a 30% change in Chi with a probability of 0.7. Attributing causation of any future change in Chl coincident with the start-up and operation of the cooling water facility is problematic because of potential confounding effects associated with variation in phosphorus loading from wastewater treatment facilities, natural variation in meteorological conditions, and water quality changes associated with zebra mussel populations.

Here, we explore these controls on the deposition of the Lima Conglomerate, Peru. We use a combination of quantitative methods to explore the age of sediment accumulation, the provenance of the material and the paleo-erosion rates recorded by these deposits. Isochron burial dating with cosmogenic Be-10 and Al-26 yield an age of c. 500ka for the base (490 +/- 70ka) and the uppermost sample situated c. 30m higher upsection (490 +/- 80ka). Results of paleo-erosion rate estimates with concentrations of in situ(10)Be show a c. 60% increase from 105 +/- 10mmka(-1) for the base to 169 +/- 14mmka(-1) for the uppermost sample. Finally, provenance tracing with in situ U/Pb ages on detrital zircon implies that the material has been derived from the entire drainage basin. The combination of results suggests that sediment accumulation occurred in response to an erosional pulse, which affected the entire basin within a short time interval. Because Be-10 data represents a large spatial record of erosion, we exclude the possibility where a breakout of a lake or a focused release of material in response to earthquakes, were responsible for the large material flux. Instead, the erosional pulse was likely to have occurred at the scale of the entire basin, supporting the idea of a larger-scale, most likely climate driven control. In this context, the accumulation age of c. 500ka falls into an orbital cycle fostering the emerging picture in the literature that sediment routing in the Andes have most likely been driven by climate and cyclic changes. We suggest that the Andean mountain range offers an ideal laboratory to explore the erosional history in relation to climate patterns, at least in Peru. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Landscape patterns of carbon fluxes in natural and disturbed ice-wedge-polygon tundra	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The degradation of ice-rich permafrost ecosystems due to climate change and infrastructure development strongly impacts carbon exchange dynamics in tundra landscapes. This study investigates the effects of surficial geology and infrastructure disturbances from road dust and flooding on vegetation and trace gas fluxes in polygonal ice-wedge tundra in arctic Alaska. We compared CO2 and CH4 fluxes from closed-chamber measurements at common landform elements (polygon centers, troughs, and rims) at a natural site and a disturbed site within the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. Relationships among environmental parameters, plant species composition, and trace gas fluxes were assessed through nonmetric multidimensional scaling. Map extrapolations showed spatial variations in midsummer landscape-level ecosystem productivity and CH4 efflux at the various geologic landforms. Highest carbon uptake occurred in ice-rich drained thaw lake basins with aquatic, graminoid-dominated polygon troughs. In contrast, wet, featureless areas associated with more recently drained, ice-poor thaw lake basins showed a net carbon loss even during summer. The damming effect of road infrastructure led to deeply flooded, minimally vegetated troughs with low ecosystem respiration and high CH4 fluxes close to the road. This work highlights the importance of the complex interactions among surficial geology, landform elements, vegetation type, and disturbance factors in understanding carbon exchange dynamics in ice-rich permafrost environments.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				DEC 31	2024	56	1							2391244	10.1080/15230430.2024.2391244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2024.2391244													WOS:001308378700001

Here, we present a chironomid-based quantitative reconstruction of mean July air temperatures (T-July) throughout the Holocene for a remote high-mountain lake, Schwarzsee ob Solden, situated above the treeline at 2796 m a.s.l. in the Austrian Alps. Applying a chironomid-temperature inference model developed from lakes of the Alpine region to a high-resolution chironomid record from the lake provides evidence for early Holocene (ca 10000-8600 cal yr BP) T-July of up to 8.5 degrees C i.e. >4 degrees C above the modern (1977-2006) mean July temperature. The reconstruction reveals the so-called '8.2-ka cold event' centered at ca 8250-8000 cal yr BP with temperatures ca 3 degrees C below the early-Holocene thermal maximum. Rather warm (ca 6 degrees C) and productive conditions prevailed during ca 7900-4500 cal yr BP. The chironomid record suggests a climate transition between ca 5200 and 4500 cal yr BP to cooler T-July. A distinct cooling trend is evident from ca 4500 until ca 2500 cal yr BP. Thereafter, the study site experienced its coldest conditions (around 4 degrees C or less) throughout the rest of the Holocene, with the exception of the warming trend during the late 20th century. Beside other factors, the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation seems to be the major driving force for the long-term trends in T-July at high altitudes in the Eastern Alps. Due to the extreme location of the lake and the limited temperature range represented by the applied calibration data set, the chironomid-based temperature reconstruction fails to track phases of the late-Holocene climatic history with T-July cooler than 4 degrees C. Further chironomid-based palaeoclimate model and down-core studies are required to address this problem, provide more realistic T-July estimates from undisturbed high-altitude lakes in the Alps, and extract a reliable regional temperature signal.

Geothermal play fairway analysis, part 1: Example from the Snake River Plain, Idaho	GEOTHERMICS												The Snake River Plain (SRP) volcanic province overlies the track of the Yellowstone hotspot, a thermal anomaly that extends deep into the mantle. Most of the area is underlain by a basaltic volcanic province that overlies a mid-crustal intrusive complex, which in turn provides the long-term heat flux needed to sustain geothermal systems. Previous studies have identified several known geothermal resource areas within the SRP. For the geothermal study presented herein, our goals were to: (1) adapt the methodology of Play Fairway Analysis (PFA) for geothermal exploration to create a formal basis for its application to geothermal systems, (2) assemble relevant data for the SRP from publicly available and private sources, and (3) build a geothermal PFA model for the SRP and identify the most promising plays, using GIS-based software tools that are standard in the petroleum industry.The study focused on identifying three critical resource parameters for exploitable hydrothermal systems in the SRP: heat source, reservoir and recharge permeability, and cap or seal. Data included in the compilation for heat source were heat flow, distribution and ages of volcanic vents, groundwater temperatures, thermal springs and wells, helium isotope anomalies, and reservoir temperatures estimated using geothermometry. Reservoir and recharge permeability was inferred from the analysis of stress orientations and magnitudes, post-Miocene faults, and subsurface structural lineaments based on magnetics and gravity data. Data for cap or seal included the distribution of impermeable lake sediments and clay-seal associated with hydrothermal alteration below the regional aquifer. These data were used to compile Common Risk Segment maps for heat, permeability, and seal, which were combined to create a Composite Common Risk Segment map for all southern Idaho that reflects the risk associated with geothermal resource exploration and identifies favorable resource tracks.Our regional assessment indicated that undiscovered geothermal resources may be located in several areas of the SRP. Two of these areas, the western SRP and Camas Prairie, were selected for more detailed assessment, during which heat, permeability, and seal were evaluated using newly collected field data and smaller grid parameters to refine the location of potential resources. These higher resolution assessments illustrate the flexibility of our approach over a range of scales.					; Liberty, Lee/JQW-4701-2023; Gasperikova, Erika/D-1117-2015; Dobson, Patrick/D-8771-2015; Newell, Dennis/B-4676-2011; Sonnenthal, Eric/A-4336-2009; Siler, Drew/D-1508-2015	Evans, James/0000-0002-2181-3866; Shervais, John W./0000-0003-4370-7500; Liberty, Lee/0000-0003-2793-8173; Sonnenthal, Eric/0000-0003-2987-3481; Newell, Dennis/0000-0001-9628-739X; 													0375-6505	1879-3576				FEB	2024	117								102865	10.1016/j.geothermics.2023.102865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2023.102865		NOV 2023											WOS:001119271300001
J	Ji, LY; Gong, P; Wang, J; Shi, JC; Zhu, ZL				Ji, Luyan; Gong, Peng; Wang, Jie; Shi, Jiancheng; Zhu, Zhiliang			Construction of the 500-m Resolution Daily Global Surface Water Change Database (2001-2016)	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Surface water is the most dynamic land-cover type. Transitions between water and nonwater types (such as vegetation and ice) can happen momentarily. More frequent mapping is necessary to study the changing patterns of water. However, monitoring of long-term global water changes at high spatial resolution and in high temporal frequency is challenging. Here we report the generation of a daily global water map data set at 500-m resolution from 2001 to 2016 based on the daily reflectance time series from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Each single-date image is classified into three types: water, ice/snow, and land. Following temporal consistency check and spatial-temporal interpolation for missing data, we conducted a series of validation of the water data set. The producer's accuracy and user's accuracy are 94.61% and 93.57%, respectively, when checked with classification results derived from 30-m resolution Landsat images. Both the producer's accuracy and user's accuracy reached better than 90% when compared with manually interpreted large-sized sample units (1,000mx1,000m) collected in a previous global land cover mapping project. Generally, the global inland water area reaches its maximum (similar to 3.80x10(6)km(2)) in September and minimum (similar to 1.50x10(6)km(2)) in February during an annual cycle. Short-duration water bodies, sea level rise effects, different types of rice field use can be detected from the daily water maps. The size distribution of global water bodies is also discussed from the perspective of the number of water bodies and the corresponding water area. In addition, the daily water maps can precisely reflect water freezing and help correct water areas with inconsistent cloud flags in the MOD09GA quality assessment layer. Plain Language Summary Daily global inland surface water maps are produced from more than 1.9 million frames of satellite images for the period of 2001-2016 with a spatial resolution of 500m. From this time series of maps, we found that the inland surface water on Earth varies greatly in area within an annual cycle. It can reach more than 3.8 million square kilometers in September and reduce to approximately 1.5 million square kilometers in February. We demonstrate that (1) short-duration water bodies in arid areas, which are particularly important to life, can be detected from these daily water maps; (2) sea level rise effects on land submersion can be detected over some gentle-slope coasts like west Florida; and (3) different types of rice field use exist in the world. For example, in California, United States, rice fields are filled with water after harvest to help create a wetland environment for wild birds in the winter.					; Shi, Jiancheng/HIU-0908-2022; wang, jie/HGD-3146-2022; Gong, Peng/AAM-1516-2021; Ji, Lucy/LPR-0756-2024; Zhu, Zhiliang/I-2686-2018; Wang, Jie/HGD-3146-2022	Luyan, Ji/0000-0001-5369-4200; Gong, Peng/0000-0003-1513-3765; wang, jie/0000-0002-9663-3165; shi, jian cheng/0000-0002-6163-2912; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC	2018	54	12					10270	10292		10.1029/2018WR023060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023060													WOS:000456949300015

Five of these cores were selected for palaeoenvironmental studies. Five stratigraphic units are recognised, which together with volcanic ash beds and magnetic susceptibility profiles, were used to correlate the cores. A geochronology for the cores has been established by means of Pb-210 assays of the uppermost part of the record, radiocarbon dating and varve counts. Radiocarbon age determinations on bulk organic matter spanning the last similar to24,000 years are complicated by the presence of variable quantities of reworked organic debris and a calibration correction of 450 years has been provisionally assumed. Three facies: laminites (varves), homogenites, and unlaminated clays were recognised and used to interpret the depositional environment. The varved sections provide the first high-resolution varve chronology from the southern tropics. The uppermost varved section provides an outstanding basis for elucidating Lake Malawi's response to historically documented climatic, volcanic and seismic events in the region. Beds of homogeneous clay or silty clay (homogenites) were probably deposited from muddy turbidity flows, and are particularly abundant in the section spanning the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, when the lake level of Lake Malawi fell dramatically. Homogenite deposition at this time was probably due to reworking of newly exposed, unconsolidated muddy sediments. Some younger homogenites can be correlated across large distances and may have originated from turbidity flows triggered by seismic shocks. The new sedimentary record provided by these cores is difficult to reconcile with current understanding of lake-level history. Although our new data are consistent with previously inferred lowstand conditions in the Early Holocene, our interpretation of die oldest section recovered in the cores also suggests lowstand rather than highstand conditions at around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum,					Johnson, Thomas/C-1423-2010																1-4020-0772-8				2002	12						369	391																WOS:000179074600015

The goal of this study is to identify key parameters that characterize the Aller & oslash;d-Younger Dryas boundary, 12.9-12.8 ka in sedimentary sections, and are representative of broader paleobasin dynamics in the eastern Baltic region. Two new Late Glacial sediment archives, the Kulikovo and Sambian, provide data on this time interval. Geochronological and lithological (grain size and loss on ignition) analyses of the sequences indicate a change in sedimentation during 12.9-12.8 ka, which is manifested by a peak of terrigenous, coarser-grained material and an accompanying peak of organic matter in sediments. A review of the published data shows that this lithological situation is also characteristic of other paleobasins in the eastern Baltic region and beyond for layers dated to the onset of the Younger Dryas. This probably indicates an environmental event that caused a short-term increased input and deposition of organic matter, accompanied by a surge in erosional processes. The environmental shift triggered by the event is also recorded in a remarkable drop in pollen concentration and species diversity in the overlying layer. The sediment horizon in Late Glacial (Aller & oslash;d-Younger Dryas) sequences corresponding to these parameters can be considered an important and reliable geochronological marker of the 12.9-12.8 ka interval. The organic-rich layer in the Kulikovo section, as well as other similar layers in the Baltic, can be considered a "black mat" phenomenon related to the onset of the Younger Dryas.

J	LaVigne, MJ				LaVigne, Mary Jane			Katharine Tighe Fessenden: Midwife of Paradise	F SCOTT FITZGERALD REVIEW												In July 1919, F. Scott Fitzgerald famously quit a low-level advertising job in New York City to return home to St. Paul, Minnesota. It was his last-ditch effort to rewrite a manuscript that had been rejected twice by Charles Scribner's Sons. He hoped a publishing contract might finally convince Zelda Sayre to marry him. That novel, This Side of Paradise, established him as the voice of his generation and ushered in the Jazz Age. Although scholars are well-aware of the major changes Fitzgerald made to the manuscript that summer, they largely ignore the role that a childhood friend played in the revision that became Paradise. This article explores the author's relationship with St. Paul native Katharine Tighe, who worked closely with Fitzgerald on this third revision before its final submission to Maxwell Perkins. Although James L. W. West III catalogues her input in the 1995 Cambridge edition of the novel, little biographical information about Tighe has surfaced. This article demonstrates why she was the right person to serve as a "midwife" to the manuscript. Tighe understood the St. Paul, Eastern prep-school, and college milieux of the story. She had her own Great War experience, treating the wounded after completing Vassar College's training camp for nurses. Like Fitzgerald, the Great Influenza epidemic claimed the life of one of her friends. Although it is doubtful Tighe and Fitzgerald saw each other after 1922, the pair corresponded as late as 1940, just months before Fitzgerald's death. Although biographers Henry Dan Piper and Andrew Turnbull interviewed her during their research, Katharine Tighe Fessenden represents a rare unexplored aspect of Fitzgerald's otherwise closely examined life.																			1543-3951	1755-6333					2021	19						1	31		10.5325/fscotfitzrevi.19.0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.5325/fscotfitzrevi.19.0001													WOS:000858863500002
J	Larocque-Tobler, I; Pla-Rabès, S				Larocque-Tobler, Isabelle; Pla-Rabes, Sergi			Using paleolimnology to find restoration solutions: the case of Lake Muzzano, Switzerland	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Lake Muzzano (45 degrees 59'50 '' N 8 degrees 55'41 '' E, 337 m a.s.l.) is a hyper-eutrophied lake located in the Tessin region of Switzerland. Almost every year, algal blooms (Microcystis) cover the lake with a thickness of 1-2 cm. These blooms associated with periods of anoxia in summer have led to fish kills in 1967 and 1994. In the hope of avoiding these blooms, a bypass bringing water away from the lake has been established in 1999. This solution was not adequate as blooms kept reoccurring. Sediment removal was then proposed by the Tessin Canton as a possible remediation technique and The L.A.K.E.S Institute had a mandate in 2010 to study the lake (present and past state) to determine the reasons creating anoxia and algal blooms. The present state of the lake shows that anoxia is still occurring when the algal bloom covers the lake's surface. Subfossil diatom and chironomid analyses show that the baseline conditions were those found before 1922 AD when the lake was oligotrophic and supported a diversified community of chironomids suggesting good oxygenation. After 1922 AD, circulation to the lake was cut out and nutrients accumulated in the lake leading to anoxia and the establishment of Microcystis. Heavy metal analysis in the sediment shows that the concentration is above the national recommendation and thus sediment should not be removed or should be stored with hazardous material. Based on the present status of the lake and paleolimnological results, two solutions are proposed: to further decrease the nutrients coming in the lake (possibly using filtrating plants) followed by flushing to increase lake water circulation. Physical capping of the sediment to avoid exchange of heavy metals and phosphorus release at the water/sediment interface could also be envisaged once the two prime solutions are in place.

Morphology and life history divergence in cave and surface populations of Gammarus lacustris (L.)	PLOS ONE												Cave animals provide a unique opportunity to study contrasts in phenotype and life history in strikingly different environments when compared to surface populations, potentially related to natural selection. As such, we compared a permanent cave-living Gammarus lacustris (L.) population with two lake-resident surface populations analyzing morphology (eye- and antennal characters) and life-history (size at maturity, fecundity and egg-size). A part of the cytochrome coxidase subunit I gene in the mitochondrion (COI) was analyzed to contrast genetic relationship of populations and was compared to sequences in GenBank to assess phylogeography and colonization scenarios. In the cave, a longer life cycle was implied, while surface populations seemed to have a shorter life cycle. Egg size, and size at maturity for both sexes, were larger in the cave than in surface populations, while fecundity was lower in the cave than in surface populations. The cave population had longer first- and second antennae with more articles, longer first- and second peduncles, and fewer ommatidia than surface populations. The cold low-productive cave environment may facilitate different phenotypic and life-history traits than in the warmer and more productive surface lake environments. The trait divergences among cave and surface populations resembles other cave-surface organism comparisons and may support a hypothesis of selection on sensory traits. The cave and Lake Ulvenvann populations grouped together with a sequence from Slovenia (comprising one genetic cluster), while Lake Lille Lauarvann grouped with a sequence from Ukraine (comprising another cluster), which are already recognized phylogenetic clusters. One evolutionary scenario is that the cave and surface populations were colonized postglacially around 9 000-10 000 years ago. We evaluate that an alternative scenario is that the cave was colonized during an interstadial during the last glaciation or earlier during the warm period before onset of the last glaciation.

Microparticles in Wild and Caged Biota, Sediments, and Water Relative to Large Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant Discharges	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Anthropogenically modified microparticles including microplastics are present in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents; however, it is unclear whether biotic exposures are elevated downstream of these outfalls. In the fall of 2019, the present study examined whether microparticle levels in resident fish, environmental samples, and caged organisms were elevated near the Waterloo and Kitchener WWTP outfalls along the Grand River, Ontario, Canada. Wild rainbow darters (Etheostoma caeruleum) were collected from a total of 10 sites upstream and downstream of both WWTPs, along with surface water and sediment samples to assess spatial patterns over an approximately 70-km river stretch. Amphipods (Hyalella azteca), fluted-shell mussels (Lasmigona costata), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were also caged upstream and downstream of one WWTP for 14 or 28 days. Whole amphipods, fish digestive tracts, and mussel tissues (hemolymph, digestive glands, gills) were digested with potassium hydroxide, whereas environmental samples were processed using filtration and density separation. Visual identification, measurement, and chemical confirmation (subset only) of microparticles were completed. Elevated abiotic microparticles were found at several upstream reference sites as well as at one or both wastewater-impacted sites. Microparticles in amphipods, all mussel tissues, and wild fish did not show patterns indicative of increased exposures downstream of effluent discharges. In contrast, elevated microparticle counts were found in trout caged directly downstream of the outfall. Across all samples, cellulose fibers (mainly blue and clear colors) were the most common. Overall, results suggest little influence of WWTP effluents on microparticles in biota but rather a ubiquitous presence across most sites that indicates the importance of other point and nonpoint sources to this system.

A mathematical model, TOXFATE, is used to run simulations of the fate of Mirex in Lake Ontario, a relatively small part of the total system, using a mass balance approach. TOXFATE features simulations of the fate of Mirex in lake water, plankton, benthos, suspended and bottom sediments, small and large fish (sculpins and salmonids). A friendly user interface (TOXSHELL) facilitates running the program on microcomputers. Concentrations of ''dissolved'' (the fraction not removed by high-speed centrifugation) persistent toxic organic chemicals in the Niagara River are in the ng L(-1) or ng m(-3) range, yet, the total load transported into Lake Ontario can be considerable given the high discharge of some 6000 m(3) sec(-1). The river draining Lake Ontario is the St. Lawrence, and PCB loads actually double due to the various sources along the river. The insecticide and flame retardant, Mirex was essentially introduced from only two point sources, the Niagara and Oswego Rivers. The chemical is still detectable some 1000 km downstream of the main site near Niagara Falls of its original introduction to this river-lake-estuary system. The system's recovery from Mirex pollution is related to the major natural aquatic processes of the system and is not compounded by continuing point and non-point source inputs. Simulations show the fast response of Mirex concentration in water following a reduction in loadings in the early 1960s and a much slower reaction of bottom sediments and fish to the same loadings reduction.																			0160-4120						1995	21	5					557	569		10.1016/0160-4120(95)00058-S	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-4120(95)00058-S													WOS:A1995RY65000014

These declines have been attributed in part to anthropogenic threats in freshwater ecosystems (e.g., habitat fragmentation, overharvest, water pollution, watershed development). An understanding of variability in juvenile productivity and growth is critical to developing restoration approaches. We characterized variability in juvenile river herring growth among 11 freshwater lakes in the northeastern USA. We used age estimates from otoliths and length measurements to calculate growth rates of juvenile river herring (n = 1452). We tested the effects of juvenile river herring densities, zooplankton (biomass and size), habitat area (based on thermocline depth), and water quality (temperature, nutrients, chlorophyll a) on juvenile growth. Mean monthly growth rates ranged from 0.56 to 1.41 mm/d and typically increased throughout the summer. Increased juvenile growth was best predicted by lower juvenile density (beta = - 0.104, P < 0.001) and higher zooplankton biomass (beta = 0.032, P < 0.05). Combined with information about juvenile densities and mortality, these results broaden the understanding of anadromous juvenile river herring productivity, provide information that can contribute to refining stock assessment and life cycle models, and help to better understand the potential impacts of habitat conservation and restoration decisions.

J	Pangle, KL; Sutton, TM; Brown, PB				Pangle, KL; Sutton, TM; Brown, PB			Evaluation of practical and natural diets for juvenile lake herring	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Juvenile lake herring Coregonus artedi were cultured over a 5-week period in a laboratory experiment to evaluate the effects of two practical diets (dry and moist formulated feeds) and two natural diets (nauplii and decapsulated cysts of brine shrimp Artemia sp.) on hatchery production attributes. Although all fish had similar initial sizes, the final mean lengths and weights of fish fed dry formulated (82.2 mm and 4.5 g) and moist formulated (85.3 mm and 5.1 g) diets were significantly greater than those fed Artemia nauplii (66.9 mm and 2.2 g) and decapsulated cysts (59.4 mm and 1.5 g). Specific growth rates also differed among feed treatments, with lake herring that were fed formulated diets having greater mean daily percent increases in length and weight than fish fed natural diets. The mean Fulton condition factors of fish fed dry (0.78) and moist formulated diets (0.81) were significantly greater than those of fish fed Artemia nauplii (0.72) and decapsulated cysts (0.68). Greater weight gain (%) and feed efficiency were also observed in fish fed practical diets than in those fed natural diets. Mean final whole-body lipid content was greatest for lake herring fed the moist formulated diet (10.9%), followed by fish fed the dry formulated diet (8.1%), those fed Artemia nauplii (4.5%), and those fed decapsulated cysts (3.2%). Survival was high for all fish (range, 91-100%) and did not differ significantly among treatments. Based on these results, we recommend using moist formulated diets to rear juvenile lake herring in intensive culture environments.

However, little is known about the responses of TP lakes to climate change, especially saline ones. We investigated the thermal responses of the largest freshwater lake (Ngoring Lake) in the TP and its nearby small saline lake (Hajiang Salt Pond) to climate change using the improved lake scheme in the Community Land model (CLM4-LISSS), in which we primarily developed the salinity parameterizations previously evaluated in the Great Salt Lake in USA and further considered the effect of salinity on the temperature of the maximum density of saline water in the present study. The improved lake model with salinity parameterizations was first applied to a saline lake in the TP, where saline lakes make up the majority of water bodies. The CLM4-LISSS model could effectively simulate lake surface water temperature (LSWT), lake water temperature (LT) and ice thickness in Ngoring Lake. Additionally, the model including our salinity parameterizations significantly improved simulations of LSWT and LT in Hajiang Salt Pond, especially in winter. The LSWT of the two completely opposite lakes were warming in the simulations at a rate above 0.6 degrees C/decade. Meteorological forces were the main driving factor, with increasing downward longwave radiation, air temperature and air humidity, as well as weakening winds contributing to LSWT increase. Compared to a hypothetical shallow freshwater lake, the greater depth of Ngoring Lake made its surface warm faster, and salinity slightly accelerated the warming of Hajiang Salt Pond. Monthly mean LSWT differences between the two lakes were induced by salinity effects in cold periods and lake depth in the unfrozen period. In response to a warming climate, the LSWT in the ice-free Hajiang Salt Pond rapidly increased from January to April due to the warming climate, whereas the LSWT of Ngoring Lake increased faster in the first and last month of the ice-cover period due to later ice-on and earlier ice-off. This study will provide a useful tool for saline lakes in the TP and help deepen our knowledge about the responses of TP lakes, especially the saline lakes, to climate change, as well as response differences between freshwater and saline lakes and the reasons for these differences.

J	Acevedo, YS				Segura Acevedo, Yadira			Dystopia and intertextuality in El ano del verano que nunca llego by William Ospina	ROMANICA OLOMUCENSIA												The latest novel by the Colombian writer William Ospina, El ano del verano que nunca llego, is written on the basis of an important literary palimpsest, grounded in two great myths of nineteenth-century literature - Frankenstein, by the English writer Mary W. Shelley, and The Vampire, by the British author John William Polidori. Given the dystopian characteristics of Shelley's work, the study performed by Ospina in his novel focuses on Frankenstein, a story in which the creation of life and artificial intelligence finds its maximum expression in the irrational nature of one of the most famous monsters of universal literature. In this sense, intertextuality is an essential literary resource, insofar as it is what determines the dystopian nature of the work of the Colombian writer. El ano del verano que nunca llego, then, becomes a significant hypertext, an echo of a nineteenth-century dystopian text in a sort of pluridirectional flashback. Indeed, the author, rather than the literary diegesis, is interested in the network of pre-existing connections that made this myth created by the young writer possible. Thus, it can be conduded that, from the intertextual perspective, the work of William Ospina is fundamentally a dystopian story in which the author recreates a surprising novel, started in a night of a stormy summer in Switzerland, at the Villa Diodati, on the shores of Lake Geneva.																			1803-4136						2019	31	1					121	136		10.5507/ro.2019.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.5507/ro.2019.009													WOS:000476774800009
J	Johnson, KR				Johnson, KR			Vegetation of some mountain lakes and shores in Northwestern Colorado	ECOLOGY												The 4 mountain lakes here considered range in altitude from 6,750 to 8,900 feet above sea level. The climate at all 4 lakes is cold with great range existing in day and night temps.; frost is frequent in June and Aug. Grand Lake is of glacial origin with few aquatic plants, and only in a few scattered places along shore are definite belts of marsh, willow thicket, or meadow. Ponderosa pine dominates the coniferous forest surrounding the lake with scattered areas of lodgepole pine in dry rocky soil and Engelmann spruce in moist areas on north-facing slopes. Little Columbine Lake, Lake Aldrich, and Lake John all have submersed plants that occupy large parts of the lake with Potamogeton filiformis the commonest. During the latter part of summer the shallower portions of the lakes are covered with the water smart-weed, Persicaria coccinea. Sedges and willows form definite zones around the shores but are broader at inlet and outlet regions. A chaparral appears to be the climax for the Lake Aldrich area with Quercus gunnisonii, Amelanchier alnifolia, and Symphori-carpos oreophilus the major dominants. Climax vegetation for the Lake John area is sagebrush scrub. A low annual rainfall (9 in.) and the fine-grained soil make conditions unsuited for forest. The coniferous forest of the Little Columbine Lake area is of Engelmann spruce with scattered lodgepole pine and small aspen groves. A total of 359 spp. of seed plants has been collected from the 4 lakes, the average being 131.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JUL	1941	22	3					306	316		10.2307/1929616	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929616													WOS:000200151300006

The highest level of Cd was accumulated in the liver, followed by the gills, brain, and muscle. The accumulation of Cd was significantly correlated with the duration of exposure and the concentration in brain, gill, and liver tissue, but not in muscle tissue, and the rate of accumulation increased with Cd concentration. The expression of metallothionein II (MT II) mRNA exhibited a similar pattern as Cd accumulation, especially in that the expression of MT II mRNA decreased in muscle tissue with increases in exposure duration. In contrast, the expression of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) mRNA was highest in the liver, followed by brain, muscle, and gill tissues, and in gills and muscle tissue of Cd-exposed fish, the expression of CYP1A mRNA fell below that of the control fish. Overall, the liver of black sea bream was the most sensitive to Cd exposure, and the expression of MT II mRNA was 200-fold greater than the control fish. These findings indicate that the detoxification mechanisms of black sea bream are influenced by both MT II and CYP1A and that the genes participate in the detoxification of different tissues.																			1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2017	52	2					231	242		10.1007/s12601-017-0022-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12601-017-0022-7													WOS:000404650600006

However, the water transfer engineering could not significantly enhance water exchange in the Meiliang and Zhushan bays, the most polluted areas of Lake Taihu. Recently, new Meiliang pump station has been put into practice to accelerate the water exchange and mitigate the eutrophication in Lake Taihu. The process and effectiveness of Meiliang pump station and water transfer project were investigated in this study by using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC), based on the concept of water age. Model results showed that the effectiveness of water transfer projects was strongly associated with the inflow or outflow rate of Meiliang pump station and the winds condition. In terms of flushing effect and cost, the economically effective influent flow rate from Wangyu River was predicted to be 120 m3/s, and the corresponding most suitable outflow rate from the Meiliang pump station was about 15 to 20 m3/s based on multi-objective programming. Southeasterly winds-dominant in the summer-could enhance the performance of water transfer on improving water quality in Meiliang Bay and eastern areas of the lake. In general, new-built Meiliang pump station played a supplementary role for Yangtze River water transfer engineering in mitigating eutrophication in parts of the lake rather than the entire lake, suggesting that water transfer projects can only be used as an emergency measure for alleviating algal bloom in part of Lake Taihu.																					978-7-302-33544-3				2013							2432	2441																WOS:000343761503001
J	Nicoletti, PG; Parise, M				Nicoletti, PG; Parise, M			Seven landslide dams of old seismic origin in southeastern Sicily (Italy)	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper focuses on origin, morphology and evolution of seven landslide dams in southeastern Sicily. These landforms are part of a set of 146 landslides recently recognised in this area, which was hitherto considered to have little or no slope instability. Southeastern Sicily consists of a plateau (the Hyblaean Mountains) incised by canyons and surrounded by lower lands. It is underlain mostly by subhorizontal, moderately to well-lithified carbonate rocks. Relief is low. Several lines of evidence justify the assumption of a seismic trigger for the landslides in this area: (1) the geo-climatic environment is not favourable to landsliding, (2) low-angle basal shear surfaces are very frequent, (3) landslide distribution is consistent with the known magnitude-distance relationships for earthquake-induced landslides, (4) historical documents testify to earthquake-triggered slope instability and (5) a specific landslide can be exactly dated. The phenomena illustrated here include six rock slides (one with a debris-flow component) and one rock fall. Slip surfaces are mostly non-circular. Landslide volume ranges from about 50 x 10(3) to 34 x 10(6) m(3). With reference to the Costa and Schuster [Geol. Sec. Am. Bull. 100 (1988) 1054] classification of landslide dams, five cases belong to type II (spanning the entire valley), and two to type IV (failures from both valley sides, with frontal or side contact between failed masses). With reference to Crozier and Pillans [Catena 18 (1991) 471] classification of landslide lakes, all cases show a main valley lake while tributary valley, back and supra lakes are sporadically present. One damming is attributable to the 1693 earthquake with certainty; another damming, to the same earthquake with high probability. Three dams were reincised, one breached or reincised, one is slightly reincised and two more or less intact; correspondingly, five silting up deposits were reincised, one is being reincised at present and two are still under formation.

Clupeid Response to Stressors: The Influence of Environmental Factors on Thiaminase Expression	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Over the past five decades, a reproductive failure related to thiamine deficiency, referred to as thiamine deficiency complex (TDC), has been observed in valuable salmonine fishes in the Great Lakes and Finger Lakes in North America and the Baltic Sea in Europe. The cause of TDC has been linked to the consumption of clupeid fish, which contain high levels of a thiamine-destroying enzyme called thiaminase I (hereafter referred to as thiaminase). High activities of thiaminase have been reported from clupeids such as Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum and Atlantic (Baltic) Herring Clupea harengus, but no consistent explanation has accounted for the wide range of observed variation in levels of thiaminase in clupeids. Chronic stress can suppress the immune systems of Alewife and other fishes, thereby reducing the number of circulating white blood cells available to suppress bacteria. Because the presence of thiaminase has been associated with thiaminolytic bacteria isolated from Alewife viscera, we hypothesized that stressful conditions, which can potentially limit clupeid immune response or alter internal physiological conditions, could allow for thiaminase to be produced more efficiently by bacteria or thiaminolytic bacteria could proliferate, or both events could occur, resulting in a subsequent increase in thiaminolytic activity. In this study, Alewives and Gizzard Shad were exposed to severe winter temperatures and low food availability, respectively, in replicated pond experiments to evaluate the influence of stressful conditions on clupeid thiaminase activity. Though responses in circulating white blood cell counts and metrics of fish condition indicated that experimental treatments affected these clupeids, these effects were not related to increased thiaminase activity. The only significant treatment effect on clupeid thiaminase was an increase in mean thiaminase activity in Gizzard Shad from ponds where only high quality energy sources were available. These data indicate that variability in clupeid thiaminase may be related to diet composition.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-flagellated and pleomorphic bacterium, designated HJR-2(T), was isolated from a junction between the ocean and a freshwater lake on the East Sea, South Korea. It grew optimally at 30 degrees C, at pH 7.0-8.0 and in the presence of 0-1.5% (w/v) NaCl. In the neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain HJR-2(T) clustered with the type strains of Vasilyevaea enhydra and Vasilyevaea mishustinii and this cluster fell within the clade comprising the type strains of Devosia species. Strain HJR-2(T) exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 97.2 and 97.0 % to the type strains of V. enhydra and V. mishustinii, respectively, and 93.9-96.2% to the type strains of Devosia species. Strain HJR-2(T) contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C-18:1 omega 7c, 11-methyl C-18:1 omega 7c and C-16:0 as major fatty acids. Major polar lipids of strain HJR-2(T) were phosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified glycolipids. The DNA G+C content was 66.0 mol% and its mean DNA-DNA relatedness values with the type strains of V. enhydra and V. mishustinii were 11-17 %. Differential phenotypic properties, together with its phylo genetic and genetic distinctiveness, revealed that strain HJR-2(T) is separated from V. enhydra, V. mishustinii and Devosia species. On the basis of the data presented, strain HJR-2(T) (= KCTC 52211(T) = NBRC 112271(T)) is considered to be the type strain of a novel species of the genus Devosia, for which the name Devosia confluentis sp. nov. is proposed. In this study, it is also proposed that V. enhydra and V. mishustinii be reclassified as members of the genus Devosia.																			1466-5026	1466-5034				OCT	2016	66		10				3935	3941		10.1099/ijsem.0.001291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/ijsem.0.001291								27393696					WOS:000386871600028

In order to research the evolutionary characteristics of the saline lake and its response effect to the regional paleoclimate and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau in the Late Paleogene, the Hejiakouzi section of Qingshuiying Formation in the north of the Ningnan Basin was selected. The features of the strata, gypsum petrology, and S and Sr isotopes of synsedimentary gypsum were studied. Furthermore, the relationship of the evolution of the saline lake to the regional paleoclimate and the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau are discussed. The results showed that the lithology of Qingshuiying Formation was mainly celadon-aubergine mudstone and gypsum. S and Sr isotopic values of synsedimentary gypsum were 8.2-12.3 parts per thousand and 0.7105-0.7113, respectively. The sedimentary environment of Qingshuiying Formation was generally a weak continental saline lake, which can be further divided into 4 kinds of sedimentary environment, namely deep saline lake, semi-deep saline lake, shallow saline lake, and brackish lake. At 45-40Ma, the first uplift of the Tibetan Plateau occurred with a humid climate, and a brackish lake was mainly germinated. At 40-30Ma, the climate was dry and hot, and deep and semi-deep saline lakes mainly developed. At 30-27Ma, the climate became dry and cold, and a shallow saline lake mainly developed. At 27-23Ma, the second uplift of the Tibetan Plateau occurred, the climate became humid and cold due to the East Asian summer monsoon, and a brackish lake mainly developed, and the evolution of saline lake was completed by this time.

Fickian and Non-Fickian Diffusion in Heavy Oil plus Light Hydrocarbon Mixtures	ENERGY & FUELS												Diffusive mass transfer is expected to play a key role in existing and proposed solvent-added processes for heavy oil production. Compositiondistance profiles arising during free diffusion scale as a function of the joint variable (distance/time<^>n(w)). Simple fluids are governed by Fickian diffusion, where n(w) = 0.5. For nanostructured fluids, the value of n(w) can be as low as n(w) = 0.25, known as the single-file limit, but more typically, the value for the exponent falls between these two limits and is composition-dependent. In this work, five published data sets, comprising free diffusion composition profiles for Athabasca bitumen fractions and for Cold Lake bitumen + light hydrocarbons obtained using diverse apparatus, are probed from this perspective. Additional experimental results are provided for Athabasca bitumen + toluene mixtures over the temperature range of 273-313 K, and results from positive and negative control experiments for two well-defined mixtures-(0.25 mass fraction carbon nanotubes + polybutene) + toluene, and polybutene + toluene-are also provided. The value of n(w) for the negative control experiment remains at 0.50 +/- 0.05 over the entire composition range, and for the positive control experiment, the value drops to n(w) = 0.30 +/- 0.02 at low toluene mass fraction. Although the quality of the diffusion profile data in the data sets analyzed is variable, the values of the exponent n(w) are shown to be light-hydrocarbon-dependent and increase from n(w) similar to 0.25 at low light-hydrocarbon mass fraction up to n(w) similar to 0.50 at high light-hydrocarbon mass fraction. Secondary convective effects are also noted in free diffusion experiment outcomes at long times. The industrial applications of these findings are currently being evaluated, but it is clear that the time for light hydrocarbons to penetrate a fixed distance into nano- and micro-structured hydrocarbon resources is greater than the value anticipated for unstructured fluids.

Local context and connectivity determine the response of zooplankton communities to salt contamination	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Salt, primarily NaCl, is commonly used to de-ice winter roads. The usage of road salt is steadily increasing as the area of urbanised land expands, and chloride concentrations in many lakes and flowing waters near roads have been steadily increasing through time. In some waterbodies, these concentrations are reaching levels that are toxic to freshwater organisms, such as zooplankton which are integral to the structure and function of freshwater communities. 2. We currently have a poor understanding of the impact of road salt contamination on zooplankton communities, and particularly the variation in response among lakes. Zooplankton communities differ in factors that could influence the impacts of elevated chloride, such as local species composition, exposure history and regional connectivity. Assessing and predicting how increasing road salt usage affects natural, freshwater zooplankton communities requires studies that investigate how communities vary in the impacts of elevated chloride, and in their response to dispersal 3. We conducted a field mesocosm experiment that examined the effects of salt (NaCI) addition on two different zooplankton communities, which were also subjected to repeated introductions of zooplankton dispersers from the regional species pool. These treatments allowed us to determine whether communities differed in the impacts of salt, and how the effects of salt differed between communities that did and did not receive zooplankton dispersers. 4. We found variation in the effects of salt and dispersal between our experimental communities. For one lake community, salt drove zooplankton species composition towards dominance by littoral cladocerans. Zooplankton dispersal into this community ameliorated these impacts of salt by returning species composition to a state more similar to our "Control" communities. Conversely, for the other lake community, salt alone had minimal effects on zooplankton, while the combination of salt and dispersal led to declines in adult copepods. 5. Our experiment found that the impacts of salt varied between two zooplankton communities, causing a range of negative, positive and neutral community effects, and that dispersal from the regional species pool could serve as an ameliorating or exacerbating influence. Efforts to understand and predict the impacts of road salt on freshwater communities would therefore benefit from an evaluation of the potential role played by local (e.g., exposure history and biotic interactions) and regional (e.g., connectivity to possible sources of immigrants context in the response of communities to elevated chloride.

J	Takano, O; Waseda, A				Takano, O; Waseda, A			Sequence stratigraphic architecture of a differentially subsiding bay to fluvial basin: the Eocene Ishikari Group, Ishikari Coal Field, Hokkaido, Japan	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Eocene Ishikari Group, deposited in a bay to fluvial basin in central Hokkaido, Japan, provides important information on fluvial sequence stratigraphy in a differentially subsiding ocean-connected setting. The Ishikari Group consists of four mill ion-year-order depositional sequences (Isk-1, Isk-2, Isk-3 and Isk-4), composed mainly of meandering/braided fluvial systems. Each depositional sequence contains marine or lacustrine incursion beds, which show lake or bay to bay-margin tidal facies, at maximum flooding surface horizons. This indicates that marine or lacustrine incursion into fluvial environments took place when the increase rate of accommodation space due to relative sea-level rise exceeded the rate of accumulation. Fluvial channel stacking density varies in response to stratigraphic position within a depositional sequence, namely, high channel density in the lower part of the transgressive interval (Trs: LST to TST) and the upper part of the regressive interval (Rgr: HST), and low channel density in upper Trs and lower Rgr. Multistory channels tend to be developed in lower Trs, whereas single-story channels predominate in upper Trs and Rgr. These patterns in the distribution of fluvial channels resulted from changes in accommodation space in response to relative sea-level changes. Sequence boundaries are recognized at fluvial incision surfaces at the base of Trs, but the development of incised valleys is minor because of the relatively high subsidence rate, which obscured the effect of relative sea-level fall. Syndepositional differential subsidence within the paleo-Ishikari basin resulted in selective development of relatively downstream depositional systems in the more rapidly subsiding area. High-frequency depositional cycles are also prominently developed in the subsiding area where sedimentation rate was sufficiently high to record high-frequency relative sea-level cycles or autocycles of deposition.

Radar signals of 320-370 MHz penetrate ice at sub-freezing temperatures but are reflected from the top of layers of ice which are at the melting point and contain water. Radar signals of 5-20 MHz, on the other hand, see through both the cold and the temperate ice down to the glacier bed. Radio-echo soundings at these frequencies have been used to investigate the thermal regimes of four polythermal glaciers in Svalbard: Kongsvegen, Uversbreen, Midre Lovenbreen and Austre Broggerbreen. In the ablation area of Kongsvegen, a cold surface layer (50-160 m thick) was underlain by a warm basal layer which is advected from the temperate accumulation area. The surface ablation of this cold layer may be compensated by freezing at its lower cold-temperate interface. This requires that the free water content in the ice at the freezing interface is about 1% of the volume. The cold surface layer is thicker beneath medial moraines and where cold-based hanging glaciers enter the main ice stream. On Uversbreen the thermal regime was similar to that of Kongsvegen. A temperate hole was found in the otherwise cold surface layer of the ablation area in a surface depression between Kongsvegen and Uversbreen where meltwater accumulates during the summer (near the subglacial lake Setevatnet, 250 m a.s.l.). Lovenbreen was frozen to the bed at the snout and along all the mountain slopes but beneath the central part of the glacier a warm basal layer (up to 50 m thick) was fed by temperate ice from two cirques. On Austre Broggerbreen, a temperate basal layer was not detected by radio-echo soundings but the basal ice was observed to be at the melting point in two boreholes.

By using monthly monitoring dataset (2000-2017) from Lake Taihu and empirical dynamic modelling to construct causal networks, we quantified the strengths of causal feedbacks among phytoplankton, local environments, zooplankton, meteorology as well as global climate oscillation. Prevalent bidirectional causal linkages between phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) and the tested drivers were found, providing holistic and quantitative evidence of the ubiquitous feedback loops. Phytoplankton biomass exhibited the highest feedbacks with total inorganic nitrogen and ammonia and the lowest with nitrate. The feedbacks between phytoplankton biomass and environmental factors from 2000 to 2017 could be classified into two groups: the local environments (e.g., nutrients, pH, transparency, zooplankton biomass) -driven enhancement loops promoting the response of the phytoplankton biomass, and the climate (e.g., wind speed)driven regulatory loops suppressing it. The two counterbalanced groups modified the emergent macroecological patterns. Our findings revealed that the causal feedback networks loosened significantly after 2007 following nutrient loading reduction and unsuccessful biomanipulation restoration attempts by stocking carp. The strength of enhancement loops underwent marked decreases leading to reduced phytoplankton responses to the tested drivers, while the climate (decreasing wind speed, warming winter) -driven regulatory loops increased- like a tug-of-war. To counteract the self -amplifying feedback loops, the present eutrophication mitigation efforts, especially nutrient reduction, should be continued, and introduction of alternative measures to indirectly regulate the critical components (e.g., pH, Secchi depth, zooplankton biomass) of the loops would be beneficial.					; Fu, Hui/L-4752-2016; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019	hui, Fu/0000-0001-7720-0463; cai, guo jun/0000-0003-3011-970X; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 25	2024	913								169601	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169601	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169601		JAN 2024						38159751					WOS:001155967700001

Material was collected in late summer. The response of the meiozoobenthos to the industrial waste water load was compared with that of the macrozoobenthos. Reference material was also collected from an area loaded with municipal effluents and from the least polluted part of Vanajavesi. The response of the meiozoobenthos to heavy pollution was similar to that o the macrozoobenthos. The zoobenthos was scarce or totally eliminated below the pollution outfall. Cyclopodia was the only group which thrived on these anoxic bottoms. The most tolerant sedentary meiofaunal species were some nematodes and Rotaria neptunia, which were found in low numbers at a station where the conditions were too extreme for the most tolerant macrofaunal species Chironomus plumosus. The diversity of meiofauna and macrofauna increased downstream where the O2 conditions improved. The total abundance of meiofauna and macrofauna reached a maximum in a zone where the O2 concentration was 0-4 mg/l. Downstream from this point the abundance decreased to a normal level. The industrial effluents (mainly from the wood-processing industry) and the municipal waste waters caused similar changes in the meiozoobenthos. Potentially toxic effects were not easy to detect because the O2 depletion was the main limiting factor. There were specific changes in the composition of the meiozoobenthos which may be valuable in the biologicl assessment of the degree of pollution, such as the composition of the macrofauna.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1981	18	4					243	251																WOS:A1981MZ58400008

Scott; Moossen, Heiko; Seki, Osamu			New insights into Holocene hydrology and temperature from lipid biomarkers in western Mediterranean alpine wetlands	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Alpine regions of the Mediterranean realm are among the most climatically sensitive areas in the world. Thus, alpine wetlands from the southern Iberian Peninsula, in the westernmost part of the Mediterranean region, are highly sensitive sensors of environmental changes. Difficulties have surfaced in separating controls by temperature and/or precipitation in previous paleoenvironmental studies from alpine environments in this area. We present a Holocene biomarker record (n-alkanes and long-chain diols) from a high elevation lake, Laguna de Rio Seco (LdRS), in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, which contributes to the identification of these forcing mechanisms. The hydrological history of the area, primarily water availability and evapotranspiration, is reconstructed by means of the n-alkane record, including the indices of average chain length, portion aquatic, and carbon preference index, as well as hydrogen isotopes (delta D) of aquatic (delta D-aq) and terrestrial (delta D-wax) n-alkanes. Temperatures are also estimated using the algae derived long-chain diols. We interpret delta D-aq and delta D-wax fluctuations as showing changes in the source and amount of precipitation throughout the LdRS record. An Atlantic precipitation source appears to have predominated during the early-middle Holocene, but an occasional Mediterranean influence with an isotopic enrichment in precipitation is detected in the middle-late Holocene that is likely related to the setting of the current atmospheric pattern in southeastern Iberia under the joint control of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Western Mediterranean dynamics, such as the Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO). Our new record from LdRS is consistent with a generalized trend of a humid early-middle Holocene with low temperature variability, evolving towards an arid middle-late Holocene with abrupt temperature changes. In addition to these long-term trends during the last similar to 10,500 years, two phases of climate instability, evidenced by abrupt depletions in delta D-aq, have been identified at the end of these periods, one between similar to 6500 and 5500 cal yr BP and another in the last similar to 500 years. These episodes would represent strengthened winter cold conditions that favoured the persistence of snowpack and frozen soil in the catchment, causing reduced terrestrial plant growth and low lake evaporation. According to the long-chain diol record, temperatures during these phases were relatively low, but experienced abrupt increases at the end of each period. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Microbial processes and factors controlling their activities in alkaline lakes of the Mongolian plateau	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												A striking feature of the Mongolian plateau is the wide range of air temperatures during a year, -30 to 30A degrees C. High summer temperatures, atmospheric weathering and the arid climate lead to formation of numerous alkaline soda lakes that are covered by ice during 6-7 months per year. During the study period, the lakes had pH values between 8.1 to 10.4 and salinity between 1.8 and 360 g/L. According to chemical composition, the lakes belong to sodium carbonate, sodium chloride-carbonate and sodium sulfate-carbonate types. This paper presents the data on the water chemical composition, results of the determination of the rates of microbial processes in microbial mats and sediments in the lakes studied, and the results of a Principal Component Analysis of environmental variables and microbial activity data. Temperature was the most important factor that influenced both chemical composition and microbial activity. pH and salinity are also important factors for the microbial processes. Dark CO2 fixation is impacted mostly by salinity and the chemical composition of the lake water. Total photosynthesis and sulfate-reduction are impacted mostly by pH. Photosynthesis is the dominant process of primary production, but the highest rate (386 mg C/(La (TM) d)) determined in the lakes studied were 2-3 times lower than in microbial mats of lakes located in tropical zones. This can be explained by the relatively short warm period that lasts only 3-4 months per year. The highest measured rate of dark CO2 assimilation (59.8 mg C/(La (TM) d)) was much lower than photosynthesis. The highest rate of sulfate reduction was 60 mg S/(La (TM) d), while that of methanogenesis was 75.6 mu L DDe(4)/(La (TM) d) in the alkaline lakes of Mongolian plateau. The rate of organic matter consumption during sulfate reduction was 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than that associated with methanogenesis.

J	Granéli, W				Granéli, W			Internal phosphorus loading in Lake Ringsjon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Ringsjon did not respond with decreased algal production following a substantial reduction in external phosphorus loading. This is typical of many shallow lakes which for decades have received excessive amounts of nutrients. The inertia is due to large amounts of phosphorus (P) stored in sediments and biota, causing internal phosphorus loading. Much of this phosphorus is thought to be released from the organic-rich profundal sediments. In Lake Ringsjon, only one third of the total bottom area is covered by such sediments, the rest being dominated by sand and silt. In the profundal sediments bulk P content was not exceptionally high (approximately 2 mg P(.)g DW-1), while the pore water phosphate concentrations, especially in Satofta Basin, were very high, indicating large potential for phosphorus release to the water. This is also indicated by the large proportion of Fe- and Al-bound P in the sediments of Satofta Basin. Although there are no direct quantifications of phosphorus release from the sediments in Lake Ringsjon, measurements of phosphorus concentrations in the water mass as well as budget calculations for the three basins clearly show a high capacity for internal loading. Phosphorus concentrations generally increase during summer, when external additions are minimal. Until 1980, the annual external phosphorus addition to Lake Ringsjon greatly exceeded the output, showing that the lake was an efficient phosphorus trap. Since then, input and output have been balanced, but in recent years signs that the lake is once again retaining phosphorus on an annual basis are evident. There are marked differences between the three basins, with Western Basin generally retaining phosphorus, while the upstream Eastern Basin and Satofta Basin during the 1980s often exported phosphorus. It is not possible to evaluate the effects of the fish biomanipulation on the internal loading of phosphorus from the sediment.																			0018-8158					JUN	1999	404						19	26		10.1023/A:1003705520085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003705520085													WOS:000083700800005

Extensive alluvial fans had developed in the mountain-basin systems of this region during the late Pleistocene. Based on geomorphic/stratigraphic studies and the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology, we investigated numerous alluvial sequences in the drainage basin of the coupled mountain-basin system on the NETP. Sedimentologic analyses showed that these alluvial sediments mainly comprise crudely meter and decimeter beds of fanglomerate and sandy lenticles, which occasionally contain boulders in the thinner layers. OSL dating results showed that the alluvial sediments were mainly developed during the late MIS 5, MIS 3, and Last Glaciation and Deglaciation (maximum aggradations), while little had occurred during the early Holocene. Comparing our ages and their probability density curves with those of glacial advances from the northeastern/eastern TP, the consistency of both records during different stages since the late Pleistocene suggested that the development of alluvial fans was driven by glacier activities, which yielded abundant outwash, feeding alluvial aggradations. Based on this finding, together with results of previous studies, we argued that the dynamics of alluvial geomorphic processes had a paleoclimatic origin rather than surface uplifts. Further studies indicated that the precipitation of glaciations originated from the ISM northward intrusion during the late MIS 5, MIS 3, and Holocene; however, it was mainly influenced by the westerlies during the Last Glaciation and Deglaciation. Therefore, the development of alluvial fans on the NETP represents coupling signals of the ISM and the westerlies on the interglacial-glacial cycle timescales. The coupling evolution of glacier activities and alluvial aggradations in the drainage basins of mountain-basin systems on the NETP provides a model for assessing the linkages between regional geomorphic processes and atmospheric circulations on hemispheric scales.

The study of nitrogen isotope ratios of riverine nitrates could offer an elegant means to assess the extent of denitrification and thus confirm these budgets, as it is known that denitrification results in a natural N-15 enrichment of residual nitrates. The results reported here, for the Seine river system ( France), demonstrate the feasibility of this isotopic approach at the scale of large watersheds. On the basis of in situ observations carried out in a large storage reservoir in the upstream Seine catchment (Der Lake), where intensive benthic denitrification occurs, as well as on the basis of laboratory experiments of denitrification under controlled conditions, it is shown that the isotopic discrimination associated with benthic denitrification is minimal (epsilon of NO3-N ranging from -1.5 to -3.6parts per thousand), probably because the rate-limiting step of the process consists of nitrate diffusion through the water-sediment interface. Riparian denitrification on the contrary, when it implies nitrate reduction during convective transfer through reducing environements, causes a much more significant isotopic enrichment of N-15 of residual nitrate (epsilon about -18parts per thousand). The authors report measurements of nitrogen isotopic composition of nitrate from rivers of various stream orders in the Seine river system under summer conditions. Anomalies in the data with respect to the values expected from the mixture of the various sources of nitrate are here attributed to riparian denitrification. However, the authors show that because of the patchy distribution of actively denitrifying riparian zones within the drainage network, the isotopic signature conferred to residual nitrate in river water intrinsically provides only a minimum estimate of the extent of denitrification.					; SEBILO, Mathieu/AAG-5983-2019	Sebilo, Mathieu/0000-0002-3118-7416; 													0168-2563					APR	2003	63	1					35	51		10.1023/A:1023362923881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023362923881													WOS:000182297600003

They are experiencing rapid changes due to global warming, but their relationships during the Holocene are less well known due to limited coupled geological records. Here, we analyzed the delta C-13(-VPDB) and delta O-18(-VPDB) values and ion content of calcite and aragonite in a 407-cm-long sediment core from Guozha Co, a closed basin on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau supplied by glacial meltwater, in order to understand how the lake responded to glacier changes during the Holocene. Our results indicate that the glacial meltwater lowered the lake's temperature and the delta O-18(lake water) and delta O-18(endogenic + authigenic carbonate) values and diluted the ion concentrations in the lake water. Three stages of evolution, 8.7-4.0, 4.0-1.5, and 1.5 kyr BP to present, are distinguished based on the decrease in glacial meltwater recharge. Guozha Co has been a closed basin since at least 8.7 kyr BP, and it has changed from a fresh water lake during 8.7-1.5 kyr BP to a brackish lake from 1.5 kyr BP to present due to several climate events. The famous 4.2 kyr BP cold event was identified in the core at 4.0 kyr BP, while warm events occurred at 6.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.9, and 0.4 kyr BP. Both glaciers and lakes in this area are controlled by climate, but they exhibit opposite changes, that is, glaciers retreat and lakes expand, and vice versa. Our results provide an accurate interpretation of the cold events based on carbonate minerals and carbon-oxygen isotopes in glacial meltwater-recharged lake sediments.

This impression however is more apparent rather than real and constitutes the consequence of the coverage of the Earth's crust by oceans over some 2/3 of the surface. The other major factor is the dynamic nature of the Earth, including the accretion and subduction of tectonic plates as well the intensive erosional processes, which obscure its impact history. Thus asteroid impact records on Earth are mostly concealed and are the subject of extensive exploration, using structural, geophysical, petrological and geochemical methods. It is the stable cratons which cratons contain the best preserved impact records, including exposed and filled-in craters and deep-seated impact-rebound dome structures. Documentation of the impact records of the Australian continent and marine shelves includes impact ejecta/fallout units, exposed impact structures, buried impact structures, meteorite craters and ring and dome geophysical anomalies of unproven origin. The identification of impact structures and impact ejecta/fallout deposits is fraught with complications. Initial references to circular morphological and drainage patterns, round lakes and oval depressions may provide a hint to possible underlying ring or dome structures, requiring field tests or drilling. Where impact structures have been destroyed, the presence of impact ejecta/fallout in sediments allows further insights into the impact history of the Earth.

J	Xu, Y; Liang, YZ				Xu, Y; Liang, YZ			Sensitive determination of trace lead in lake and drinking waters with ETAAS using Ni-NH4H2PO4-NaOH modifier	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												A method has been developed for the direct determination of trace lead in Lake Michigan and two sources of drinking water. This method uses electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry with platform atomization and a combined modifier of nickel, ammonium dihydrogenphosphate and sodium hydroxide (Ni-NH4H2PO4-NaOa). The optimal temperature program and modifier mass allowed quantitative stabilization of lead in water solution up to 1400 degrees C. The characteristic mass and detection limit of the proposed method are 3.4 pg and 0.038 mu g/l for a 20 mu l sample. The detection limit is 20 times lower than the USEPA standard method and 17.6 times lower than the manufacturer's recommended method (without modifier). The detection method can also tolerate interference of 0.6 mg/ml Cl-, 0.8 mg/ml SO42- and 0.7 mg/ml CO32-. The recoveries of lead spiked in the samples from Lake Michigan, a commercial spring water and a fountain were between 85% and 97%. The lead concentrations in these samples were found to be in the range of 0.12-0.25 mu g/l and 0.11-0.30 mu g/l when sample volumes of 10 and 20 mu l were used, respectively. Because of the low detection limit and the tolerance to interference, the proposed method offers a low-cost solution to the determination of trace lead in drinking and natural waters.																			0306-7319						1997	68	3					369	376		10.1080/03067319708030501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319708030501													WOS:000076138000005

Nirmal; Soni, Hiren; Kumar, Rita N.; Bhatt, Ira			Macrophytes in Phytoremediation of Heavy Metal Contaminated Water and Sediments in Pariyej Community Reserve, Gujarat, India	TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A phytoremediation study was carried out at Pariyej reservoir, an internationally important wetland listed in Asian Directory of Wetlands, designated as a "Wetland of International Importance" and a proposed community reserve of Gujarat State, India, to ascertain the degree of heavy metal contamination. The study focused oil assessment of heavy metal accumulation in certain aquatic macrophytes used as biomonitors, in comparison with water and sediments (abiotic monitors) for phytoremediation. Roots, steins and leaves of native aquatic plants (biomonitors) represented by seven species: lpomoea aquatica Forsk, Eichhornia crassipes, (Mart.) Solms, Typha angustata Bory & Chaub, Echinochloa colonum (L.) Link, Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle, Nelumbo nucifera Gaerth. and Vallisneria spiralis L. along with surface sediments and water, were analyzed for Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, PI) and Zn contamination. The greater accumulation of heavy metals was observed in Nelumbo nucifera and the poor content in Echinochloa colonum. Based on the concentration and toxicity status observed in the lake's vegetation, the six heavy metals are arranged in the following descending order: Zn > Cu > Ph >Ni > Co > Cd compared with the standard, normal and critical toxicity range in plants. The detected values of Cd and Ph fall within normal range, while that of Co and Ni were within the critical range. However, Zn and Cu showed the highest accumulation with alarming toxicity levels, which are considered as one of the most hazardous pollutants in Pariyej reservoir. Species like Typha angustata and Ipomoea aquatica are also proposed as bioremediants, which are the two most useful plant species in phytoremediation studies due to their ability to accumulate heavy metals in high concentration in the roots. The results showed the significant differences in accumulation of metals like Zn, Cu and Pb in different plant organs, in roots than that of stems and leaves. High positive correlation between combinations of different metal pairs in plant's root, stein or leaf system was established. The potential use of these wetland plants in phytoremediation is also discussed.

As ponds are now recognized as freshwater habitats clearly distinct from lakes and running waters. there is a need for standardized tools for assessing their ecological integrity and status, and particularly their biodiversity. 2. A standardized method was developed for sampling and assessing the species richness of ponds. Experiences accumulated in previous studies, together with data gathered from 80 Swiss ponds, provided the basis of the proposed method. 3. Five taxonomic groups were chosen as complementary representatives of pond inhabitants: aquatic plants, aquatic Gastropoda, aquatic Coleoptera, adult Odonata and Amphibia. 4. To sample aquatic flora, quadrats are located along transects perpendicular to the longest axis of the pond. The number of quadrats is calculated from a relationship with pond area. A nonparametric estimator (Jackknife-1) is used to estimate the true species richness from the observed richness. 5. Aquatic invertebrates (Gastropoda, Coleoptera) are collected with a hand net. Sampling is stratified within the dominant habitats. The number of samples is calculated from a relationship with pond area. As with the Vegetation, the Jackknife-1 estimator is used to estimate the true species richness. 6. The species richness of adult Odonata is assessed using a standardized field survey method combining observations from early and late summer. The species richness is corrected with an abundance-based estimator (Chao1). The species richness of Amphibia is obtained from an exhaustive inventory. 7. For the assessment of biodiversity, species richness values derived from measurements are compared to values predicted for conditions that enable a high species richness. Generalized Additive Models are used to predict species richness from environmental predictors characterizing the pond. The ratio of measured richness to predicted richness allows the allocation of a quality status to each pond. Results are divided into five biological quality classes, as recommended in the EC Water Framework Directive (WFD). Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Mitchell, MJ; McHale, PJ; Inamdar, S; Raynal, DJ				Mitchell, MJ; McHale, PJ; Inamdar, S; Raynal, DJ			Role of within-lake processes and hydrobiogeochemical changes over 16 years in a watershed in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State, USA	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Joint US-Japan Seminar on Forest Hydrology and Biogeochemistry	FEB 01-04, 2000	HONOLULU, HAWAII	NSF, JSPS, IGBP, BACH				Hydrological and biogeochemical relationships were evaluated for the Arbutus Watershed in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. Wet-only precipitation inputs (weekly) and discharge losses were evaluated from 1983 to 1998. Precipitation from 1983-98 had significant (p < 0.05) decreases in concentrations of Ca2+ (-0.10 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Mg2+ (-0.07 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), K+ (-0.01 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Na+ (-0.04 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Cl- (-0.07 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), SO42- (-0.82 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)) and H+ (-0.55 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), whereas NH4+ and NO3- concentrations did not change. For the same period, there were decreases in solute concentrations in the Arbutus Lake outlet for Ca2+ (-1.18 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Mg2+ (-0.32 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), K+ (-0.33 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Cl- (-0.17 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)) and SO42- (-1.90 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)) and a significant increase in NH4+ concentrations (+0.07 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)). For the period from 1995 through 1998 the discharge measurements for the outlet and the major inlet of Arbutus Lake were combined with weekly chemical measurements supplemented with storm sampling. At the inlet there were significant relationships (p < 0.05) between discharge rates and the concentrations of all solutes except Cl-, but only for Na+, NO3-, H+ and Al did these relationships explain more than 20% of the variation in solute concentrations. April had the greatest rates of discharge and solute Bur of any month due to spring snowmelt. The dormant season (October-May) accounted for > 80% of the discharge in the inlet and outlet of Arbutus Lake and > 78% of the flux of all solutes. For 1995-98 the mass balances of discharge losses from the catchment draining into Arbutus Lake inlet I versus precipitation inputs suggest that internal watershed processes resulted in net generation of Ca2+ (-1342 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)), Mg2+ (-313 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)), K+ (-35 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)), SO42- (-635 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)) and Cl- (-45 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)) and net retention of inorganic N solutes (NO3- + NH4+: 204 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)) and H+ (424 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)). Concentrations and fluxes of Ca2+, H+, NO3-, SO42- and Al were lower at the lake outlet compared with the inlet. A comparison of mass balances at the Arbutus Lake inlet and outlet suggested that these decreases may have been due to within-lake biotic processes and/or dilution from other water sources to the lake.

While ongoing research has illustrated the unequal impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on minority populations, research in this area has been unable to fully explain the mechanisms that produce these findings. To understand why some groups have been at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, we employ structural inequality theory to better understand how inequality may impact disease transmission in a pandemic. We used a novel approach that enabled us to focus on the microprocesses of structural inequality at the zip code level to study the impact of stay-at-home pandemic policies on COVID-19 positive case rates in an urban setting across three periods of policy implementation. We then analyzed data on traffic volume, income, race, occupation, and instances of COVID-19 positive cases for each zip code in Salt Lake County, Utah (USA) between 17 February 2020 and 12 June 2020. We found that higher income, percent white, and white-collar zip codes had a greater response to the local stay-at-home order and reduced vehicular traffic by nearly 50% during lockdown. The least affluent zip codes only showed a 15% traffic decrease and had COVID-19 rates nearly 10 times higher. At this level of granularity, income and occupation were both associated with COVID-19 outcomes across all three stages of policy implementation, while race was only predictive of outcomes after the lockdown period. Our findings illuminate underlying mechanisms of structural inequality that may have facilitated unequal COVID-19 incidence rates. This study illustrates the need for more granular analyses in policy research and adds to the literature on how structural factors such as income, race, and occupation contribute to disease transmission in a pandemic.

A hydrogeological, hydrochemical, and geophysical approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Villafafila lakes are a natural reserve included in the intergovernmental RAMSAR agreements for conservation of wetlands, with special interest for their brackish-saline waters. These lakes are located at the western margin of the Duero basin, whose aquifer system has no evaporitic rocks upstream. Understanding the origin of the lake's salinity, the groundwater circulation and the distribution of the brackish-saline waters in the area is important not only for the preservation and management of the natural reserve, but for human water consumption as well. Three types of waters have been identified according to their chemical composition. Type 1 are calcium-bicarbonate fresh waters identified in the local recharge areas (surrounding hills); Type 2 are mixed waters dominated by sodium and chloride-bicarbonate, identified at the toe of the hills; Type 3 are brackish to saline sodium-chloride waters from the lakes, springs and boreholes. Time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) profiles have revealed the existence of a basement elevation that forces brackish regional groundwater flow to rise. Radiocarbon age of regional groundwaters points to residence times of 20-30 Ky. Villafafila lakes are through-flow lakes nourished by meteoric waters (direct precipitation and shallow groundwaters) as deduced by stable isotopes (delta O-18(H2O), delta D-H2O), while the solutes are provided by ascendant deep groundwater flows in the lakes bottom and in the surrounding area. Sulphate stable isotopes (delta O-18(SO4=); delta S-34(SO4=)) suggest that deep groundwaters have been in contact with Triassic and Cenozoic evaporites. Below the lake's bottom there is a brine (TDS 27 g/L) contained within the lake-sediment aquitard that is concentrated by evaporation in the vadose zone and by salt recycling. A salinity inversion has been observed below the brine. The lack of saline crusts on the lake's bottom is favored by the SW outflow of the brine. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Hepatic transcriptional responses to copper in the three-spined stickleback are affected by their pollution exposure history	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Some fish populations inhabiting contaminated environments show evidence of increased chemical tolerance, however the mechanisms contributing to this tolerance, and whether this is heritable, are poorly understood. We investigated the responses of two populations of wild three-spined stickleback (Gas-terosteus aculeatus) with different histories of contaminant exposure to an oestrogen and copper, two widespread aquatic pollutants. Male stickleback originating from two sites, the River Aire, with a history of complex pollution discharges, and Siblyback Lake, with a history of metal contamination, were depurated and then exposed to copper (46 a) and the synthetic oestrogen ethinyloestradiol (22 ng/L). The hepatic transcriptomic response was compared between the two populations and to a reference population with no known history of exposure (Houghton Springs, Dorset). Gene responses included those typical for both copper and oestrogen, with no discernable difference in response to oestrogen between populations. There was, however, some difference in the magnitude of response to copper between populations. Siblyback fish showed an elevated baseline transcription of genes encoding metallothioneins and a lower level of metallothionein induction following copper exposure, compared to those from the River Aire. Similarly, a further experiment with an F1 generation of Siblyback fish bred in the laboratory found evidence for elevated transcription of genes encoding metallothioneins in unexposed fish, together with an altered transcriptional response to 125 mu g/L copper, compared with F1 fish originating from the clean reference population exposed to the same copper concentration. These data suggest that the stickleback from Siblyback Lake have a differential response to copper, which is inherited by the F1 generation in laboratory conditions, and for which the underlying mechanism may include an elevation of baseline transcription of genes encoding metallothioneins. The genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms contributing to this inherited alteration of metallothionein transcription have yet to be established. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

During summer 2009, a massive outbreak of viral GE associated with contamination of municipal drinking water (Norovirus) occurred in San Felice del Benaco (Lake Garda, Italy). To investigate the natural history of a community outbreak of viral GE, and to assess the incidence of PI-IBS and functional gastrointestinal disorders, we carried out a prospective population-based cohort study with a control group. METHODS: Baseline questionnaires were administered to the resident community within 1 month of the outbreak. Follow-up questionnaires of the Italian version of Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS, a 15-item survey scored according to a 7-point Likert scale) were mailed to all patients responding to baseline questionnaire at 3 and 6 months, and to a cohort of unaffected controls, living in the same geographical area, at 6 months after the outbreak. The GSRS item were grouped in five dimensions: abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation. At month 12, all patients and controls were interviewed by a health assistant to verify Rome III criteria of IBS. Student's t-test and. chi(2)- or Fisher's exact test were used as appropriate. RESULTS: Baseline questionnaires were returned by 348 patients: mean age +/- s.d. 45 +/- 22 years, 53% female. At outbreak, nausea (scored >= 4), vomiting, and diarrhea lasting 2-3 days or more were reported by 66, 60, and 77% of patients, respectively. A total of 50% reported fever and 19% reported weight loss (mean 3 kg). Follow-up surveys were returned at month 6 by 186 patients and 198 controls: mean GSRS score was significantly higher in patients than in controls for abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation. At month 12, we identified 40 patients with a new diagnosis of IBS (Rome III criteria), in comparison with 3 subjects in the control cohort (P < 0.0001; odds ratio 11.40; 95% confidence intervals 3.44-37.82). The 40 cases of PI-IBS were subtyped according to the predominant stool pattern as follows: 4 IBS with constipation, 7 IBS with diarrhea, 16 with mixed IBS, and 13 with unsubtyped IBS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that Norovirus GE leads to the development of PI-IBS in a substantial proportion of patients (13%), similar to that reported after bacterial GE.					; Magni, Alessandro/M-4260-2015	Zanini, Barbara/0000-0002-1733-9938; 													0002-9270	1572-0241				JUN	2012	107	6					891	899		10.1038/ajg.2012.102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2012.102								22525306					WOS:000306142100012
J	Peiffer, L; Taran, Y				Peiffer, Loic; Taran, Yuri			Heat and mass fluxes monitoring of El Chichon crater lake	REVISTA MEXICANA DE CIENCIAS GEOLOGICAS												El Chichon crater lake is characterized by important variations in volume (40, 000 m 3 to 230, 000 m(3)) and in chemical composition alternating between acid-sulfate and acid-chloride-sulfate composition (Cl-/SO42- = 0-79 molar ratio). These variations in volume can occur very fast within less than a few weeks, and are not always directly correlated with the precipitation rate; the seepage rate of lake water is also an important parameter to consider in the lake mass balance. In this study, we present for the first time continuous physical data (temperature, depth, precipitation, wind velocity, solar radiation) of the crater lake registered by a meteorological station and two dataloggers. A heat and mass balance approach is proposed to estimate the heat and mass fluxes injected into the lake by the sublacustrine fumaroles and springs. Tracing the evolution of such fluxes can be helpful to understand this highly dynamic lake and offers an efficient way of monitoring the volcanic activity. During the observation period, the hydrothermal heat flux was estimated to be 17-22 MW, and the mass flux 10-12 kg/s (error on both values of +/-15%). These fluxes are mainly counterbalanced by the loss of heat and mass by evaporation, respectively of 20-24 MW and 8-10 kg/s. Furthermore, the seepage rate of the lake waters was estimated and shown to be a highly variable parameter (12-42 kg/s), depending on the lake surface. This new data set constitutes a baseline to monitor the future activity of El Chichon volcano. In case of volcanic activity renewal, one of the first precursor signals would probably be the full evaporation of the lake.

The samples were collected during the summer of 2022 from Ain Fayda (lake water) and Al-Ain cement factory (groundwater). This study investigates the effectiveness of the ceramic membrane for treating water samples and removing solid particles. A dead-end filtration mode with a filtration flux of 3 m(3)/m(2)/d was used. For the Ain Fayda Lake water sample, the transmembrane pressure during filtration reached 120 kPa (temperature adjusted to 25 degrees C); air blowing was used to reduce the transmembrane pressure to around 70 kPa and Total Suspended Solids were reduced from 1.4 to <1 mg/L during 160 min of filtration. For the Al-Ain cement factory water sample, the transmembrane pressure during filtration reached 160 kPa (temperature adjusted to 25 degrees C); air blowing reduced the transmembrane pressure to around 65 kPa and the Total Suspended Solids from 9.1 to <1 mg/L during 130 min of filtration. Both water samples belong to the Na-Cl water type. Overall, this work shows the effectiveness of the Ceramic Membrane-based Produced Water Treatment Technology for reducing Total Suspended Solids in sampled waters; thus, we recommend this approach for treating surface waters in Al-Ain to improve the environment and possible usage in agriculture.

Ring-Shaped Seismicity Structures in the Areas of Sarez and Nurek Water Reservoirs (Tajikistan): Lithosphere Adaptation to Additional Loading	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												Seismicity characteristics in the areas of Sarez Lake and the Nurek water reservoir are studied. Ring-shaped seismicity structures in two depth ranges (0-33 and 34-70 km) formed prior to the Pamir earthquake of December 7, 2015 (M-w = 7.2). Seismicity rings cross each other near the Usoi Dam, which formed after the strong earthquake in 1911 and led to the formation of Sarez Lake, and near the epicenter of the Pamir earthquake. In addition, three out of the four strongest events (M >= 6.0) recorded in the Pamir region at depths of more than 70 km since 1950 have occurred near Sarez Lake. An aggregate of the data allows us to conclude that the Pamir earthquake, despite its very large energy, refers to events related to induced seismicity. Ring-shaped seismicity structures in two depth ranges also formed in the Nurek water reservoir area. It is supposed that the formation of ring-shaped structures is related to the self-organization processes of a geological system, which result in the ascent of deep-seated fluids. In this respect, the lithosphere is gradually adapting to the additional load related to the filling of the water reservoir. The difference between Nurek Dam (and many other hydroelectric power stations as well) and Usoi Dam is the permanent vibration in the former case due to water falling from a height of more than 200 m. Such an effect can lead to gradual stress dissipation, resulting in the occurrence of much weaker events when compared to the Pamir earthquake of December 7, 2015, in the areas of artificial water reservoirs.

J	Okello, MM; Wishitemi, BEL; Lagat, B				Okello, Moses; Wishitemi, Bobby; Lagat, Benjamin			TOURISM POTENTIAL AND ACHIEVEMENT OF PROTECTED AREAS IN KENYA: CRITERIA AND PRIORITIZATION	TOURISM ANALYSIS												Tourism is a big revenue-generating industry in Kenya, hence interest in its stability and status. But this industry is very sensitive to a number of factors that affect its performance. To help bridge realized and potential tourism of protected areas as tourist destinations, this study compared the influence of these factors and how they affected tourism achievement. Six factors (biodiversity attributes, physical landscape attributes, cultural attractions, marketing campaigns, facility endowments, and health/security risks) were considered. Scores were assigned for each factor for each protected area and mean scores determined. The mean score of factors for each protected area was considered an index of its tourism potential. This tourism potential index was used to assess whether each protected area had significant tourism potential, had achieved it, or exceeded it (tourism achievement). Only 12 (22.6%) of the protected areas had achieved and/or exceeded their tourism potential, and only 22 out of 53 protected areas (41.51%) had any meaningful potential for tourism. Generally, tourism potential scores were higher than those based on tourist numbers alone (Wilcoxon signed rank test, T = 3.00, p = 0.003), implying that tourist visits alone were not sufficient in evaluating the tourism potential of protected areas. Protected areas that had a high tourism achievement index were: Aberdares, Lake Nakuru, Buffalo Springs, Tsavo West, Nairobi, Tsavo East, Maasai Mara, Lake Bogoria, and Amboseli, respectively. Generally, biodiversity and facility endowment influenced tourist performance, and specifically the marketing campaigns, communication facilities, accessibility, and the diversity of large mammal species. These findings confirm that Kenyan tourism is mainly wildlife based and strongly influenced by facilities and infrastructure. A national tourism-based conservation strategy should be targeting protected areas that have tourism potential but have failed by improving facilities and infrastructure, rather than the current ad hoc approach.																			1083-5423	1943-3999					2005	10	2					151	164		10.3727/154427205776330491	http://dx.doi.org/10.3727/154427205776330491													WOS:000213777200005

At 60 degrees C the pH range for growth determined at 25 degrees C [pH(25 degrees C)] was 7.15 to 9.5, with an optimum between 8.1 and 8.9 (pH(60 degrees C) Of 7.6 and 8.1). At a pH(25 degrees C) of 8.5 the temperature range for growth was from 52 to 70 degrees C, with an optimum between 60 and 66 degrees C, The shortest doubling time was around 1 h. In pure culture the bacterium grew in a mineral base medium supplemented with yeast extract, tryptone, Casamino Acids, betaine, and crotonate as carbon sources, producing acetate as a major product and constitutively a lipase. During growth in the presence of olive oil, free long-chain fatty acids were accumulated in the medium but the pure culture could not utilize olive oil, triacylglycerols, short- and long-chain fatty acids, and glycerol for growth, In syntrophic coculture (Methanobacterium strain JW/VS-M29) the lipolytic bacteria grew on triacylglycerols and linear saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with 4 to 18 carbon atoms, but glycerol was not utilized, Fatty acids with even numbers of carbon atoms were degraded to acetate and methane, while from odd-numbered fatty acids 1 mol of propionate per mol of fatty acid was additionally formed. 16S rDNA sequence analysis identified Syntrophospora and Syntrophomonas spp, as closest phylogenetic neighbors.					; Rainey, Fred/AAG-7996-2019	Wiegel, Juergen/0000-0002-6343-6464; 													0020-7713					OCT	1996	46	4					1131	1137		10.1099/00207713-46-4-1131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/00207713-46-4-1131								8863447					WOS:A1996VL86700044
J	HAKANSON, L				HAKANSON, L			A MODEL TO PREDICT GROSS SEDIMENTATION IN SMALL GLACIAL LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study is an attempt to quantify and rank variables of significance to predict gross sedimentation (i.e., net sedimentation plus resuspension) in small glacial lakes. Sediment traps were placed in 25 Swedish lakes and exposed for about 110 days during the summer for four years. Average values of rates of gross sedimentation in bottom traps were compared to catchment and morphometric parameters determined from different types of maps. Various hypotheses concerning the factors regulating gross sedimentation in lakes were formulated and tested. Different statistical tests were used to separate random influences from causal influences. The most important 'map parameters' were: the relative depth, linked to resuspension and the form and size of lakes, the forest and open land percent of the so-called near area (= the proximate area of the lake as determined by the drainage area zonation method), the distribution of mires and lakes in the catchment, the relief of the drainage area and the theoretical lake water retention time. Each of these variables only provides a limited degree of (statistical) explanation of the variability in gross sedimentation among the' lakes. The predictability of models for gross sedimentation can be markedly improved by accounting for the zonation problem, i.e., the distribution of the characteristics in the drainage area. The stability of the final model, which gives a r2-value of 0.78, has been tested with positive results. The model allows mean values of gross sedimentation to be estimated from readily available data of 'geological' characteristics of the lake and its drainage area. The variability in gross sedimentation from other factors/variables, such as temperature, precipitation, wind, and load of nutrients, may then be quantitatively differentiated from the impact of these 'geological' factors/constants.																			0018-8158					MAY 13	1994	284	1					19	42		10.1007/BF00005729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005729													WOS:A1994NR89500004

We explore how extreme drought and ICOLL entrance management intersect to influence the geochemical cycling of iron. Opening the ICOLL entrance just prior to an extreme drought in 2019 led to prolonged extremely low water levels, thereby exposing intertidal/subtidal sulfidic sediments and causing oxidation of sedimentary pyrite. Subsequent reflooding of exposed sediments for -4 months led to extremely elevated Fe-(aq)(2+) ( >10 mM) in intertidal hyporheic porewaters, consistent with Fe2+(aq) release via pyrite oxidation and via reductive dissolution of newly -formed Fe(III) phases. Re -opening the ICOLL entrance caused a rapid fall in water levels (-1.5 m over 7 d), driving the development of effluent groundwater gradients in the intertidal zone, thereby transporting Fe2+ -rich porewater into surface sediments and surface waters. This was accompanied by co -mobilisation of some trace metals and nutrients. On contact with oxic, circumneutral-pH estuarine water, the abundant Fe (2+) (aq) oxidised, forming a spatially extensive accumulation of poorly crystalline Fe(III) oxyhydroxide floc (up to 25 % Fe dry weight) in shallow intertidal zone benthic sediments throughout the ICOLL. Modelling estimates -4050 x 10 3 kg of poorly -crystalline Fe was translocated into surficial sediments. The newly formed Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides serve as a metastable sink encouraging enrichment of both phosphate and various trace metal(loid)s in near -surface sediments, which may have consequences for future cycling of nutrients, metals and ICOLL ecological function. The additional Fe also may enhance ICOLL sensitivity to similar future drought events by encouraging pyrite formation in shallow ( <5 cm) benthic sediments. This system -wide translocation of Fe from deeper sediments into surficial benthic sediments represents a form of geochemical hysteresis with an uncertain recovery trajectory. This study demonstrates how climate extremes can interact with anthropogenic management to amplify ICOLL hydrological oscillations and influence biogeochemistry in complex ways.

J	Gurshin, CWD				Gurshin, Christopher W. D.			Target Strength Measurements of Juvenile Blueback Herring from the Mohawk River, New York	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Target strength (TS) was estimated from in situ and ex situ measurements of juvenile blueback herring Alosa aestivalis during their fall downriver migration at the Crescent Hydroelectric Project in the Mohawk River, New York. The blueback herring is an ecologically important anadromous species that must transit fish passage facilities at hydroelectric dams. Measurements of TS are necessary to distinguish juvenile blueback herring from other fishes as well as to scale echo integration results to numerical fish densities during hydroacoustic studies. This study presents the first measurements of TS for juvenile blueback herring. The TS measurements were collected from an echosounder operating at 420 kHz with two split-beam transducers (one down-looking and one side-looking). Single echo detections associated with tracked fish echoes and the echoes at the periphery of schools in the headrace of the powerhouse were used in estimating in situ TS. Mean total length (TL) of 192 individuals captured by cast net was 75 mm. A single dead fish (70 mm TL) was tethered and suspended by monofilament line in both transducer beams, each orientated down; the mean TS of this fish was -52.3 decibels (dB) for the 15 degrees beam and -52.8 dB for the 6 degrees beam. The mean in situ TS was -46.0 dB in the down-looking beam and -48.6 dB in the side-looking beam. The in situ TS estimates were similar to those reported for similar-sized fish from published TS-TL relationships. The mean in situ TS for the down-looking beam was 0.1-0.5 dB higher than the predicted TS for similar-sized alewives A. pseudoharengus measured at 70 kHz in two studies. Results indicate that blueback herring and alewives have similar TSs and emphasize the importance of swim bladder condition and body orientation in influencing TS estimates for scaling acoustically derived fish density estimates.																			0275-5947						2012	32	2					381	386		10.1080/02755947.2012.678562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.678562													WOS:000303601100018

Sub-bottom and bathymetry sonar inspection of postglacial lacustrine infill of the alpine lakes (Tatra Mts., Slovakia)	CATENA												An acoustic survey using sub-bottom sonar (SBS) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle EcoMapper (AUVEM) combined with coring was used for the investigation of bottom topography, thickness of the sediments, and geodynamic factors influencing the postglacial deposition in Tatra Mts. lakes. This combined study of seven lakes shows four basic acoustic units and four subunits that are interpreted in terms of stratigraphy and lithology. However, the presence of particular acoustic units may not be encountered in all the lakes due to the effects of local and internal lake processes. Thick horizontal reflections with high amplitude reflectors characterize the bedrock or the infill with a thickness of more than 6 m. Chaotic internal reflection configuration and high amplitude reflectors are common and reflect the glacigene deposits of unknown thickness in the bottom of the lakes. Above the signals of glacigene sediments lie reflections with weak to moderate amplitude reflectors, and with a parallel and chaotic configuration. They correspond to the glaciolacustrine laminated clay and silt and postglacial gyttja that contain clastic outwash from various mass movement deposits. The transition zone between these two SBS reflections is formed by a discontinuous, parallel and wavy configuration with the acoustic bottom. This type of signal is interpreted as a mixture of cobbles, boulders, and fine-grained sediments. The exact lithological content and the presence of the acoustic units are determined by other factors that may not be visible around the lakes and can cause stratigraphic hiatuses. As a prominent and un-recognized factor in the Tatra Mts. until now is the presence of the bottom springs (pockmarks) of the non-karstic origin, which effectively disturb the fine clastic and organic matter deposition and hence can limit the use of the lake deposit for palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological studies. The mass movement processes - debris flow, rockfall - forming the mountain geo-relief are frequent and their products are visible in the marginal facies. The sonar inspection also provides evidence of mass movement deposits, which have no indication on the terrestrial environment and thereby represent intralacustrine landslides as a result of bedrock instability due to the late Pleistocene deglaciation or Holocene climatic variability.

J	Hofmann, MH; Hendrix, MS				Hofmann, Michael H.; Hendrix, Marc S.			Depositional processes and the inferred history of ice-margin retreat associated with the deglaciation of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet: The sedimentary record from Flathead Lake, northwest Montana, USA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A series of piston cores from Flathead Lake, Montana, USA and a new radiocarbon date from the sedimentary record provide the basis for describing sedimentary processes related to deglaciation of the Flathead Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet and for interpreting the retreat history of the lobe. The oldest part of Flathead Lake sediment core records is Late Pleistocene in age and consists of cm-scale rhythmites of silt and clay, interpreted here as annual varves. Each varve contains a light-colored coarser-grained portion, inferred to represent deposition during peak annual runoff, and a darker-colored finer-grained portion interpreted to represent sediment accumulation during seasonal low-flow conditions. The coarser-grained portions, especially in the stratigraphically older sections of each core, contain sedimentary structures that reflect traction transport. Based on these sedimentary structures, their facies characteristics, and their spatial distribution within the lake, we interpret the thicker, light-colored portion of each varve to be deposited by hyperpycnal flows caused by seasonal melt events rather than more classic turbidity currents. Immediately overlying Late Pleistocene rhythmites in all Flathead Lake cores is a unique, significantly coarser-grained dm-scale silt bed with a median grain size up to 50 mu m. This silt bed has a sharp, locally erosional base and fines upward but does not contain any other sedimentary structures. In contrast to the rhythmites, we interpret this silt bed to represent a single, short-lived catastrophic sedimentation event generated by a large glacial outburst flood. Overlying this distinct bed are several other cm-scale beds of mainly silt that exhibit a basal upward-coarsening followed by an upward-fining median grain size profile. We interpret these beds and their grain size trends as reflecting the rising and falling hydrograph limbs of outburst floods derived from more distal sources located in the upstream parts of the upper Flathead watershed. The sediment record from Flathead Lake, together with results from geologic and geomorphologic 1:24,000 scale mapping around the lake margins, provide a series of constraints regarding the paleogeographic evolution of the area during deglaciation. Overall upward-thinning and upward-fining of the varved portion of the sediment core records reflects northward retreat of the southern Flathead Lobe ice margin starting at latest 14,475 +/- 150 cal yr BP, the depositional age of the oldest varve in any of our cores. The depositional age of silt beds overlying the varved records is constrained as between 14,150 +/- 150 cal yr BP and 13,180 +/- 120 cal yr BP. Within the available chronostratigraphic constraints, the outburst floods interpreted to have delivered this silt to the Flathead Lake basin also downcut a bedrock nick point below the Flathead Lake outlet, oriented a series of large boulders downstream, and deposited a series of large flood bars on the lower Flathead River floodplain.

The specific effects of three types of anthropogenic forcing (nutrient concentrations, climate change and fisheries management practices) on the benthic invertebrate community over the last 150 years in a re-oligotrophicated large, deep subalpine lake were investigated using chironomid remains. The structural changes in the chironomid assemblages in different habitats were assessed based on subfossil remains retrieved from sediment cores sampled along a depth gradient (30, 56 and 65 m) and analysed at a high temporal resolution (2-5 years). 2. Until the 1940s, the chironomid assemblages were strongly depth specific and were characterised by oxyphilous taxa at all studied depths. Subsequently, the assemblages drifted towards domination by common hypoxia-tolerant taxa. The scores of the first axis of principal component analyses for each studied depth were used as a proxy for community structure, and the influence of anthropogenic forcings on axis scores was assessed using general additive models. The temporal variability of the contribution of each covariate to our model estimates allowed their specific effects to be clarified. 3. The sensitivity of the chironomid assemblages to the considered forcings was depth dependent. Profundal chironomid assemblages (65 m) responded mainly to nutrient enrichment, whereas assemblages at shallower depths (56 and 30 m) were mainly affected by top-down effects of the fish community on the pelagic food web, triggering increasing losses of organic matter from the pelagic to the benthic zone. Since the late 1980s, increased air temperatures have probably been responsible for changes in assemblages at all sampled depths, potentially through their effect on the strength and duration of thermal stratification, possibly coupled with changes in mixing efficiency during winter. 4. Our results highlight linkages between the pelagic and benthic food webs and identify possible temporal substitutions among anthropogenic forcings that successively drive the chironomid assemblages. These findings provide additional evidence of the multiple environmental controls structuring chironomid assemblages and highlight the associated difficulties in predicting chironomid assemblage trajectories following mitigation efforts.

J	MAYO, AL; KLAUK, RH				MAYO, AL; KLAUK, RH			CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SOLUTE AND ISOTOPIC GROUNDWATER GEOCHEMISTRY, ANTELOPE-ISLAND, GREAT-SALT-LAKE, UTAH	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The 110 km2 Antelope Island is predominantly composed of Precambrian gneiss similar to rocks in the Wasatch Range 32 km to the east. Three types of island groundwater systems have been identified on the basis of aquifer composition and dissolved solute content. The systems include ground waters which discharge from either crystalline or sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary groundwater systems contain ground water which is either Na-Cl rich or poor. All island ground water has anomalously high Na+, Cl-, or SO42-concentrations when compared with ground waters that issue from similar bedrock in nearby areas. Island groundwater systems may be statistically distinguished from each other and from other ground water in the region. The solute chemistry of island ground water cannot be accounted for by the simple dissolution of aquifer minerals, and the water does not plot along fault controlled thermal water-precipitation or parent aquifer-precipitation Cl-/SO42- mixing lines. Discharge elevations and Cl-/SO42- also rule out mixing with residual salts from paleo Lake Bonneville or brines of the Great Salt Lake for most island ground water. Tritium values (> 40 tritium units (TU)) suggest that island groundwater systems are primarily recharged from modern meteoric water. Stable isotopic delta-H-2 and delta-O-18 data plot along an evaporation line which indicates that recharge water contains a component of evaporated Great Salt Lake water. Temporal variations in spring discharges, tritium concentrations, and discharge temperatures of less than 20-degrees-C indicate short flow paths and shallow circulation. Excess Cl- and SO42- concentrations are attributed to the deposition of aerosols of wind-blown dust from nearby evaporate deposits and sea spray.

Effects of the development of a newly created spawning ground in the Des Prairies River (Quebec, Canada) on the reproductive success of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					6th International Symposium on Sturgeons	OCT 25-30, 2009	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA					In the fall of 1996, the surface area of an existing spawning ground located downstream of a power dam on the Des Prairies River was expanded. More than 8000 m 2 of appropriate substrate were then added to the largest lake sturgeon spawning ground in the lower St. Lawrence River system. The impact of this enhancement project was monitored 3 years before (1994-1996) and 7 years after (1997-2003) habitat modification. Four hypothesis were tested: (i) the newly created spawning ground was utilized by lake sturgeon for egg laying, (ii) the utilization of the newly spawning bed improved the reproductive success of lake sturgeon, (iii) the improvement of the reproductive success increased the lake sturgeon larvae production, and (iv) the increase of larvae production increased the recruitment of lake sturgeon. After the new spawning area was developed, the sampling station located in this new section was one of those most used for egg deposition, under both high (1997) and low (1998-1999) flows conditions. Absolute annual numbers of drifting larvae varied between 1.2 million (1996) and 12.8 million (2003). The mean survival rate of the estimated number of laid eggs compared with drifting larvae was 0.88 and 0.93% in 1995 and 1996, respectively, relative to 5.6% in 1997, 3.82% in 1998 and 2.41% in 1999. These results indicate that the new area had a positive impact on the reproductive success of lake sturgeon in the Des Prairies River. From 1994 to 2003, strong cohorts in the lower St. Lawrence system were related to high larval drift in this river. However, high larval production did not necessarily lead to a strong cohort, and year-class strength determination also appeared affected by environmental factors, with the strongest year classes all associated with high June flow rates (over 1150 m 3 s(-1)) in the Des Prairies River. The information gathered during this study enabled us to refine previous observations on the management of sturgeon spawning grounds and the planning of their design, surface area, substrate and location, as well as other physical parameters.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				APR	2011	27	2					394	404		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01718.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01718.x													WOS:000288864600037
J	Higgins, T; Colleran, E				Higgins, Tara; Colleran, Emer			Nutrient limitation and phosphate regeneration in artificial cutaway peatland lakes	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY												Increasingly large areas of Ireland's emerging cutaway peatlands are being flooded to create a linked network of lakes and wetlands designed for conservation and amenity purposes. The current study examined water quality in four artificial cutaway peatland lakes over three years (2001-2004), with particular focus on nutrient dynamics and the potential for phosphate to be regenerated from the organic phosphorus pool via biotic and abiotic processes. The cutaway lakes contrasted strongly in both their physico-chemical characteristics, trophic statuses and limiting nutrient states. Two of the alkaline mesotrophic study lakes were annually N-limited in summer, while the acidic eutrophic-hypertrophic study lake underwent a transition to more sustained N-limitation. Laboratory experiments indicated a considerable potential for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) to be regenerated from the dissolved organic phosphorus pool by phosphatase enzyme hydrolysis (mean 2.6 mu g l(-1)). UV-induced SRP regeneration was found to play a lesser role (mean 0.9 mu g l(-1)), particularly in the dystrophic study lake, while combined UV and enzymatic hydrolysis produced an intermediate response (mean 2.3 mu g l(-1)). With all three mechanisms, the quantity of SRP regenerated appeared to be independent of lake trophic status. The current data provide some evidence that the regeneration of SRP from the large organic phosphorus pool in cutaway peatland lakes can help maintain a constant supply of bioavailable phosphorus, potentially contributing to the prevalence of N-limiting conditions in these systems.																			0791-7945	2009-003X				DEC	2007	107B	3					147	156		10.3318/BIOE.2007.107.3.147	http://dx.doi.org/10.3318/BIOE.2007.107.3.147													WOS:000252242300004

These measurements included allochthonous and autochthonous components, as well as changes in storage, and were designed to construct a complete carbon budget. Bacterial respiration was compared directly to our budget in an effort to use ecosystem-level constraints to test the major assumptions used to estimate bacterial production and respiration. On the basis of the difference between all other inputs and outputs, bacterial respiration must lie between 0.4 and 6 mmol c m-2 d-1. With measured rates of thymidine incorporation and measured bacterial cell sizes, this organic-C budget constrains the thymidine conversion factor (cell nM-1 thymidine) to be between 1 and 6 .times. 109 cells nM-1 thymidine for growth yields between 10 and 80%. If the thymidine conversion factor were > 10 .times. 109 cells nmol-1, bacterial respiration alone would exceed the total input of C to the system, even at assumed growth yields of 80%. The same analysis indicates that the carbon conversion factor cannot exceed 3 .times. 10-7 .mu.g .mu.m-3 for any reasonable values of growth yield and thymidine conversion factor. On the basis of our best estimates for all parameters, bacterial production was equal to 16% of primary production and bacterial respiration was about 40% as large as the respiration of macrozooplanton. The respiration of nanoflagellate microzooplankton was < 10% as large as the respiration of macrozooplankton and could account for the remineralization of only 25% of bacterial production.

J	Guthrie, WS; Linford, ET; Eixenberger, D				Guthrie, W. Spencer; Linford, Ellen T.; Eixenberger, David			Development of an index for concrete bridge deck management in Utah	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												The purpose of this research was to develop a new index for concrete bridge deck management in Utah. Data were collected in the summer of 2005 from 15 concrete bridge decks in Salt Lake City. Decks ranged from 2 to 21 years in age and were all constructed with epoxy-coated rebar. Data collected from visual inspection, sounding, Schmidt hammer testing, half-cell potential testing, and chloride concentration testing were analyzed with statistics, and age, cover, and half-cell potential were ultimately selected for inclusion in a new Utah Bridge Deck Index (UBDI), which was structured around a deduct system using a 100-point scale. Coefficients were selected primarily on the basis of the judgment of the researchers and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) personnel involved in the research. Also, threshold values for maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement (MR&R) options were specified to be the same as those associated with standard sufficiency ratings. The UBDI and corresponding MR&R recommendation were then provided for each of the tested bridge decks. In addition, consideration of the possibility of treatment applications led to required adjustments in the UBDI calculation; the treatment options that were considered include an epoxy seal, a high-performance concrete overlay, and an asphalt membrane overlay. Four case scenarios were developed to demonstrate the response of the revised UBDI equation to these treatments. Finally, as aids for Utah DOT personnel implementing this research, charts were created to facilitate rapid determination of the required number of half-cell potential and cover measurements for different levels of reliability and tolerance.

J	Liboriussen, L; Jeppesen, E				Liboriussen, L; Jeppesen, E			Structure, biomass, production and depth distribution of periphyton on artificial substratum in shallow lakes with contrasting nutrient concentrations	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. To examine how the vertical distribution of periphytic biomass and primary production in the upper 0-1 m of the water column changes along an inter-lake eutrophication gradient, artificial substrata (plastic strips) were introduced into the littoral zones of 13 lakes covering a total phosphorus (TP) summer mean range from 11 to 536 mu g L-1. Periphyton was measured in July (after 8 weeks) and September (after 15 weeks) at three water depths (0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 m). 2. Periphyton chlorophyll a concentration and dry weight generally increased with time and the communities became more heterotrophic. Mean periphytic biomass was unimodally related to TP, reaching a peak between 60 and 200 mu g L-1. 3. The proportion of diatoms in the periphyton decreased from July to September. A taxonomic shift occurred from dominance (by biovolume) of diatoms and cyanobacteria at low TP to dominance of chlorophytes at intermediate TP and of diatoms (Epithemia sp.) in the two most TP-rich lakes. 4. The grazer community in most lakes was dominated by chironomid larvae and the total biomass of grazers increased with periphyton biomass. 5. Community respiration (R), maximum light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P-max), primary production and the biomass of macrograzers associated with periphyton were more closely related to periphyton biomass than to TP. Biomass-specific rates of R, P-max and production declined with increasing biomass. 6. Mean net periphyton production (24 h) was positive in most lakes in July and negative in all lakes in September. Net production was not related to the TP gradient in July, but decreased in September with increasing TP. 7. The results indicate that nutrient concentrations alone are poor predictors of the standing biomass and production of periphyton in shallow lakes. However, because periphyton biomass reaches a peak in the range of phosphorus concentration in which alternative states occur in shallow lakes, recolonisation by submerged macrophytes after nutrient reduction may potentially be suppressed by periphyton growth.

Controls on the contemporary distribution of lake thecamoebians (testate amoebae) within the Greater Toronto Area and their potential as water quality indicators	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Thecamoebians were examined from 71 surface sediment samples collected from 21 lakes and ponds in the Greater Toronto Area to (1) elucidate the controls on faunal distribution in modern lake environments; and (2) to consider the utility of thecamoebians in quantitative studies of water quality change. This area was chosen because it includes a high density of kettle and other lakes which are threatened by urban development and where water quality has deteriorated locally as a result of contaminant inputs, particularly nutrients. Fifty-eight samples yielded statistically significant thecamoebian populations. The most diverse faunas (highest Shannon Diversity Index values) were recorded in lakes beyond the limits of urban development, although the faunas of all lakes showed signs of sub-optimal conditions. The assemblages were divided into five clusters using Q-mode cluster analysis, supported by Detrended Correspondence Analysis. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to examine species-environment relationships and to explain the observed clusterings. Twenty-four measured environmental variables were considered, including water property attributes (e.g., pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen), substrate characteristics, sediment-based phosphorus (Olsen P) and 11 environmentally available metals. The thecamoebian assemblages showed a strong association with phosphorus, reflecting the eutrophic status of many of the lakes, and locally to elevated conductivity measurements, which appear to reflect road salt inputs associated with winter de-icing operations. Substrate characteristics, total organic carbon and metal contaminants (particularly Cu and Mg) also influenced the faunas of some samples. A series of partial CCAs show that of the measured variables, sedimentary phosphorus has the largest influence on assemblage distribution, explaining 6.98% (P < 0.002) of the total variance. A transfer function was developed for sedimentary phosphorus (Olsen P) using 58 samples from 15 of the studied lakes. The best performing model was based on weighted averaging with inverse deshrinking (WA Inv, r (jack) (2) = 0.33, RMSEP = 102.65 ppm). This model was applied to a small modern thecamoebian dataset from a eutrophic lake in northern Ontario to predict phosphorus and performed satisfactorily. This preliminary study confirms that thecamoebians have considerable potential as quantitative water quality indicators in urbanising regions, particularly in areas influenced by nutrient inputs and road salts.

A new genus and three new species of Anisogammaridae (Crustacea, Amphipoda) from the ancient lake Fuxian Hu in Yunnan, China	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH												Fuxian Hu is a deep freshwater take in the high plateau in Yunnan Province, China. After a study and description of Fuxiana yangi Sket, 2000 from deep waters, some coastal samples of amphipods were taxonomically evaluated. Four species were recognized, which in winter co-occur along most of the shallow littoral zone around the lake; they were identified as members of the family Anisogammaridae. One species was recognized as a slightly differentiated Eurypodogammarus helohius Hou et al., 2005, and the others as new species of Fuxigammarus gen. n. Results of a cladistic analysis performed on morphological characters from published descriptions, which included all lacustrine taxa and representatives of all other anisogammarid genera, established the monophyly of the new genus. Endemic character and monophyly of the group testify to an intralacustrine radiation within Fuxigammarus, Fuxian Hu is the fifth known lake in the world to contain a radiation of amphipods and is the only one inhabited by members of Anisogammaridae. Fuxigammarus gen. n. is characterized by a small and slender body, scant dorsal setosity-spinosity, and single, sausage-shaped accessory lobes on coxal gills, antennae without calceoli and rod shaped uropod Ill. These species differ substantially from each other by characters that do not occur in other anisogammarid genera. The type species F. antespinosus sp. nov. has spiniform dorsal setae shifted forward. Fuxigammarus barbatus sp. nov. has extremely setose antennal bases and mandibular palps and all elongated proximal flagellar article of antenna II. Fuxigammarus cornutus sp. nov. has a pair of dorsal spiniform setae only oil humped urosomite I and the usually spiniform setae replaced by flexible setae on the telson. These characters are a kind of counterpart to the specific body armature of the Bajkal amphipods.

Natural populations and clonal cultures are described. A continuum of morphological variation in the 5 populations was observed. The populations in lakes located in Minnesota, USA, were present either during the summer, for 2-6 mo., or perenially, and were stratified either in the epilimnion or the metalimnion. The maximum specific rate of change (increase in numbers) during the exponential phases of all the populations was 0.12-0.18, equivalent to a doubling time of from 3-4 days. The mean values of each of several morphological characters were significantly different between populations yet the ranges of variation overlapped and formed a continuum with no definite hiatus. Unialgal cultures started from each of the natural populations under similar environmental conditions had overlapping but discrete ranges of morphological variation. There may be greater variation for a culture under varying environmental conditions. There was no indication by cell size or shape that these populations in vivo or in vitro consisted of different taxa among or within populations although the range of variation encompasses the descriptions of several species. The populations may be comprised of a continuous series of strains that differed in distribution of cell size and shape. The populations are best described as A. flos-aquae Rales ex Bornet et Flahault. Some modification of the description of the species is required and future studies should include an analysis of the range of variation of cell size and shape.																			0003-9136						1981	92	2					222	251																WOS:A1981MK76700004
J	Grove, RA; Buhler, DR; Henny, CJ; Drew, AD				Grove, RA; Buhler, DR; Henny, CJ; Drew, AD			Declining ring-necked pheasants in the Klamath Basin, California: I. Insecticide exposure	ECOTOXICOLOGY												A study of organophosphorus (OP) insecticide exposure was conducted on a declining population of ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) associated with agricultural lands at Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge (TLNWR) during the summers of 1990-92. Findings at TLNWR were compared with a nearby pheasant population at Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge (LKNWR) not subjected to intensive farming or OP insecticide applications. Direct toxicity of anticholinesterase (antiChE) compounds (in this case methamidophos) killed 2 young pheasants (91 and 92% brain acetylcholinesterase [AChE] inhibition), but no deaths of adult radio-equipped hens were ascribed to direct insecticide intoxication. However, within 20 days postspray of OP insecticides, 68% (28 of 41) of the adult pheasants collected at TLNWR were exposed to antiChE insecticides, and exhibited brain AChE inhibition of 19-62%, with 15% (6 of 41) showing greater than or equal to 55% brain AChE inhibition. The lack of radio-equipped hens dying was unexpected because >50% brain AChE inhibition has been frequently used as a 'diagnostic tool' for evaluating cause of death from antiChE insecticides. No young were radio-equipped, so the extent of the effects of insecticide exposure on the survivorship of young was unknown. It is concluded that insecticide exposure was not the major factor impacting the pheasant population (see Grove et al., in press), although some young were acutely intoxicated. However, the loss of insects killed by insecticide use may have contributed to food shortages of young pheasants, indirectly influencing survival.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				OCT	1998	7	5					305	312		10.1023/A:1008836817910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008836817910													WOS:000080479700006

A long-term multi-proxy record of varved sediments suggests climate-induced mixing-regime shift in a large hard-water lake ∼5000 years ago	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The long-term terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem dynamics spanning between approximately 6200 and 4800 cal BP were investigated using pollen, diatoms, pigments, charcoal, and geochemistry from varved sediments collected in a large stratified perialpine lake, Lago Grande di Avigliana, in the Italian Alps. Marked changes were detected in diatom and pigment assemblages and in sediment composition at similar to 4900 cal BP. Organic matter rapidly increased and diatom assemblages shifted from oligotrophic to oligo-mesotrophic planktonic assemblages suggesting that nutrients increased at that time. Because land cover, erosion, and fire frequency did not change significantly, external nutrient sources were possibly not essential in controlling the lake-ecosystem dynamics. This is also supported by redundancy analysis, which showed that variables explaining significant amounts of variance in the diatom data were not the ones related to changes in the catchment. Instead, the broad coincidence between the phytoplankton dynamics and rising lake-levels, cooler temperatures, and stronger spring winds in the northern Mediterranean borderlands possibly points to the effects of climate change on the nutrient recycling in the lake by means of the control that climate can exert on mixing depth. We hypothesize that the increased P-release rates and higher organic-matter accumulation rates, proceeded by enhanced precipitation of iron sulphides, were possibly caused by deeper and stronger mixing leading to enhanced input of nutrients from the anoxic hypolimnion into the epilimnion. Although we cannot completely rule out the influence of minor land-cover changes due to human activities, it may be hypothesized that climate-induced cumulative effects related to mixing regime and P-recycling from sediments influenced the aquatic-ecosystem dynamics.

J	Olapade, OA; Depas, MM; Jensen, ET; McLellan, SL				Olapade, OA; Depas, MM; Jensen, ET; McLellan, SL			Microbial communities and fecal indicator bacteria associated with Cladophora mats on beach sites along Lake Michigan shores	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												A high biomasses of Cladophora, a filamentous green alga, is found mainly during the summer along the shores of Lake Michigan. In this study, the abundance and persistence of the fecal indicator bacterium Escherichia coli and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) on Cladophora mats collected at Lake Michigan beaches were evaluated using both culture-based and molecular analyses. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing were used to examine the bacterial community composition. Overall, E. coli was detected in all 63 samples obtained from 11 sites, and the average levels at most beaches ranged from 2,700 CFU/100 g (wet weight) of Cladophora to 7,500 CFU/100 g of Cladophora. However, three beaches were found to have site average E. coli densities of 12,800, 21,130, and 27,950 CFU/100 g of Cladophora. The E. coli levels in the lake water collected at the same time from these three sites were less than the recommended U.S. Environmental Protection Agency limit, 235 CFU/100 ml. E. coli also persisted on Cladophora mats in microcosms at room temperature for more than 7 days, and in some experiments it persisted for as long as 28 days. The SRB densities on Cladophora mats were relatively high, ranging from 4.4 X 10(6) cells/g (6.64 log CFU/g) to 5.73 X 106 cells/g (6.76 log CFU/g) and accounting for between 20% and 27% of the total bacterial counts. Partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene clones revealed a phylogenetically diverse community, in which the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides cluster and the low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria were the dominant organisms, accounting for 40% and 12.8%, respectively, of the total clone library. These results further reveal the potential public health and ecological significance of Cladophora mats that are commonly found along the shoreline of Lake Michigan, especially with regard to the potential to harbor microorganisms associated with fecal pollution and odor-causing bacteria.

J	Bizimis, M; Sen, G; Salters, VJM				Bizimis, M; Sen, G; Salters, VJM			Hf-Nd isotope decoupling in the oceanic lithosphere: constraints from spinel peridotites from Oahu, Hawaii	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												We present a detailed geochemical investigation on the Hf, Nd and Sr isotope compositions and trace and major element contents of clinopyroxene mineral separates from spinel lherzolite xenoliths from the island of Oahu, Hawaii. These peridotites are believed to represent the depleted oceanic lithosphere beneath Oahu, which is a residue of a MORB-related melting event some 80-100 Ma ago at a mid-ocean ridge. Clinopyroxenes from peridotites from the Salt Lake Crater (SLC) show a large range of Hf isotopic compositions, from epsilon(Hf)=12.2 (similar to the Honolulu volcanics series) to extremely radiogenic, epsilon(Hf)=65, at nearly constant Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios (epsilon(Nd)=7-8). None of these samples show any isotopic evidence for interaction with Koolau-type melts. A single xenolith from the Pali vent is the only sample with Hf and Nd isotopic compositions that falls within the MORB field. The Hf isotopes correlate positively with the degree of depletion in the clinopyroxene (e.g. increasing Mg#, Cr#, decreasing Ti and heavy REE contents), but also with increasing Zr and Hf depletions relative to the adjacent REE in a compatibility diagram. The Lu/Hf isotope systematics of the SLC clinopyroxenes define apparent ages of 500 Ma or older and these compositions cannot be explained by mixing between any type of Hawaiian melts and the depleted Pacific lithosphere. Metasomatism of an ancient (e.g. 1 Ga or older) depleted peridotite protolith can, in principle, explain these apparent ages and the Nd-Hf isotope decoupling, but requires that the most depleted samples were subject to the least amount of metasomatism. Alternatively, the combined isotope, trace and major element compositions of these clinopyroxenes are best described by metasomatism of the 80-100 Ma depleted oceanic lithosphere by melts products of extensive mantle-melt interaction between Honolulu Volcanics-type melts and the depleted lithosphere.

Additionally, we review the objectives and restrictions under consideration for sustainable extraction (safe, environmentally acceptable, and economically effective) of the enormous amount of CH4 from the lake. The harvested CH4 will be used to produce electricity which is desperately needed in both neighbouring countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. From a system-analysis point of view, the following processes need to be included as the minimum for adequately evaluating the vertical and temporal development of the lake CH4 during extraction: (1) in situ CH4 formation occurring in the permanently strati fi ed, anoxic deep-water, (2) CH4 oxidation in the oxic surface water, (3) natural lake-water upwelling caused by subaquatic springs, (4) arti fi cial lake-water up-and downwelling due to extraction-and reinjection-related fl ows, and (5) upward diffusion caused by double diffusive convection and weak turbulence. Water density is parameterised as a function of temperature, salinity, and the two gases carbon dioxide and CH4. For the sake of clarity of the presentation, we use a simpli fi ed 4-box analysis and are neglecting the diffusion process (5). This allows for the essence of the CH4 extraction challenge to be conveyed while avoiding excessive complexities. The system analysis for different CH4 extraction concepts clearly reveals that the depth of reinjection of the CH4 -depleted deep-water is critical for the sustainability of the extraction and an optimal CH4 harvesting plan. Here, the suitability of different reinjection scenarios is compared by evaluating each of them in terms of the objectives " safety" (water column stability), " lake ecological integrity" (nutrient upward fl uxes), and " economic viability" (amount of harvestable CH4). Comparison of model simulations, run over 50 years, revealed that (1) using lake surface (dilution) water for adjusting the density of the reinjection water and (2) reinjecting the nutrient-rich deep-water in the top 190 m are both unacceptable in terms of sustainability.					; Burgmann, Helmut/E-8804-2011; Schmid, Martin/C-3953-2009; Wuest, Alfred/L-2607-2014	Tofield Pasche, Natacha/0000-0002-9578-9301; Burgmann, Helmut/0000-0002-5651-5906; Schmid, Martin/0000-0001-8699-5691; 													1573-4595	2543-005X	978-94-007-4243-7; 978-94-007-4242-0				2012	5						165	180		10.1007/978-94-007-4243-7_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-4243-7_10	10.1007/978-94-007-4243-7												WOS:000459770800009

The underwater measuring unit consists of a multisensor unit, a micro-processor and an underwater pump (pumping rate up to 0.81/min) carried in a small, towed frame. The onboard unit (IBM compatible computer) is able to record sensor and location data transmitted from a GPS system and echosounder. Onboard, the water samples are split for introduction into a H2S flow-through sensor and for aliquots which are filtered through standard membrane filters and preserved either for trace metal determination or nutrient analysis. All data are stored in a data bank which can be used as a base for mapping the different parameters within the water body. This compact and portable system represents a breakthrough for hydrochemical investigations of lakes and rivers and was used to map the hydrochemical parameters and anthropogenic influences in Lake Muritz. In-situ measurements made during the summer stagnation showed that a 10 m-thick layer enriched in H2S built up in the bottom water. This anoxic hypolimnion was characterized by a steadily increasing H2S content approaching the sediment surface and with an associated increase in the contents of the nutrients NH4+ and PO43- and a decrease in the heavy metal contents.

Within that time, period lake mixing was intensified artificially during two successive summers. Complementary data from a nearby lake of similar size and basic water chemistry were used as a reference. Phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a did not respond to the greater mixing depth but an increase was observed in the proportional abundance of diatoms, and the proportional abundance of cryptophytes also increased immediately after the onset of mixing. Obligate anoxic green sulphur bacteria vanished at the onset of mixing but gradually recovered after re-establishment of hypolimnetic anoxic conditions. No major effect on crustacean zooplankton was found, but their diversity increased in the metalimnion. During the mixing, the density of rotifers declined but protozoan density increased in the hypolimnion. Littoral benthic invertebrate density increased during the mixing due to Ephemeroptera, Asellus aquaticus and Chironomidae, whereas the density of Chaoborus larvae declined during mixing and lower densities were still recorded one year after the treatment. No structural changes in fish community were found although gillnet catches increased after the onset of the study. The early growth of perch (Perca fluviatilis) increased compared to the years before the mixing and in comparison to the reference lake, suggesting improved food availability in the experimental lake. Although several food web responses to the greater mixing depth were found, their persistence and ecological significance were strongly dependent on the extent of the disturbance. To better understand the impacts of wind stress on small lakes, long term whole-lake experiments are needed.

(Acanthocephala: Polymorphidae) from the freshwater crab, Aegla abtao Schmitt, 1942 (Decapoda: Anomura) in Chile, with a key to congeneric species	PARASITE												Profilicollis rancoensis n. sp. is the tenth species of Profilicollis Meyer, 1931 which includes 9 other species mostly known from marine decapod crabs and shore birds. Cystacanths of P. rancoensis are described from the dominant freshwater crab Aegla abtao in Ranco Lake, Chile and are morphologically distinguished from cystacanths of the 9 other species based on a combination of 4 characters. These are body size, number of proboscis hook rows, number of hooks per row, and length of the largest anterior 2-4 hooks. Male and female cystacanths of P. rancoensis are 2.10-3.33 mm long having an ovoid proboscis with 14 rows of 6-7 hooks per row, with the largest anterior 2-4 hooks being 105-110 micrometers long; the anterior trunk has many small spines in 70-80 concentric rings, each with 50-60 spines around them; hook roots are simple, directed posteriorly, about as long as the blades anteriorly with unremarkable anterior manubria; the cephalic ganglion are in mid-receptacle just anterior to the level of the anterior trunk; the lemnisci are long and slender; the testes are in the anterior trunk, posterior trunk, or one in each; the primordia of 2 tubular cement glands are evident; strong bundles of fibers link the anterior and posterior trunk; and the posterior trunk has a corrugated surface cuticula. Molecular analysis (COI and 18S) sequences coincided with the morphology and support its taxonomy. The phylogenetic profile revealed that P. rancoensis n. sp. fell into the Profilicollis clade. Both sequences showed low genetic variation, and three different haplotypes were found. The new species was more closely related to P. botulus (Van Cleave, 1916) Witenberg, 1932 than to other Profilicollis species.

This territory presents huge amounts of water resources (Velino and Turano rivers; several springs; Lungo and Ripasottile lakes, relics of ancient Lacus Velinus). The aquifers occurring in the reliefs often have hydraulic continuity with the Rieti plain groundwater (detected at about 1-4 m below ground surface), which has general flow directions converging from the reliefs to the lake sector. Hydraulic exchanges between groundwater and surface waters are variable in space and time and play a relevant role for groundwater resource distribution. The Rieti Land Reclamation Authority was instituted in 1929 by Royal Decree N. 34171-3835, and integrates eight former authorities, dating the end of 1800s. It contributes to maintain the reclamation actions in the Rieti Plain, which started with the realization of the Salto and Turano artificial reservoirs, along two left tributaries of Velino River. The hydroelectric energy production purposes struggle with the reclamation and flood mitigation activities in the plain. The Land Reclamation Authority actuated the Integrated Reclamation General Project through the realization of pumping stations, connection and drainage canals, forestry-hydraulic works, rural roads, movable dams along Velino River and irrigation ditches. The irrigation activities, granted by the derivation of 5 m(3)/s from the Velino River, are carried out through 194,000 hectares within the territory of 42 municipalities of the Rieti Province. The Rieti Land Reclamation Authority contributes to the irrigation needs and to the environmental and hydrogeological protection and monitoring.

J	Van Gool, E; Ringelberg, J				Van Gool, E; Ringelberg, J			Relationship between fish kairomone concentration in a lake and phototactic swimming by Daphnia	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Light-induced swimming behaviour of Daphnia can lead to diel vertical migration. When this occurs, Daphnia may escape from predation by juvenile 0+ fish. For this to happen, swimming in response to the change in light intensity at dawn and dusk must be enhanced. This enhanced swimming reaction can be elicited by fish-associated kairomone in the laboratory. We studied the effect of these fish-associated kairomones in Lake Maarsseveen, The Netherlands. A bioassay was conducted in which light-induced swimming reactions of Daphnia were used to quantify the kairomone signal strength. In two successive years, 1998 and 1999, water from Lake Maarsseveen was tested weekly in early summer. Samples were taken from the epilimnion at 3 m depth and from the hypolimnion at 15 m depth. Simultaneously, we caught 0+ perch (Perca fluviatilis) with bongo nets to determine its abundance. The length and weight of individuals caught in 1998 were determined to establish a length-weight relationship. Using this relationship and the information on perch density from the trawls, the relative fish biomass was calculated for these two years. It was shown that water from the epilimnion layer increasingly enhanced light-induced swimming reactions until the second week of June, then the effect gradually disappeared. Water from the hypolimnion had no such effect. In 1998, these changes in signal strength correlated with the relative biomass of the 0+ perch, but in 1999, the maximum of the enhancement lagged 2 weeks behind the maximum of the biomass of the 0+ perch. This lag may be due to a different development of the thermocline. We conclude that kairomone concentration may well correlate with 0+ perch biomass and thereby might inform Daphnia not only about the presence, but also about the abundance, of juvenile perch.																			0142-7873					JUL	2002	24	7					713	721		10.1093/plankt/24.7.713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/24.7.713													WOS:000176909500008
J	EILERS, JM; LANDERS, DH; BRAKKE, DF				EILERS, JM; LANDERS, DH; BRAKKE, DF			CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LAKES IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A survey of the chemical status of 252 lakes, representing an estimated 2424 lakes, was conducted in the Southern Blue Ridge province and in Florida during Fall 1984. This survey was part of the Eastern Lake Survey designed to quantify the number of acidic lakes and lakes with low acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) with surface area greater than 4 ha. Of the 102 lakes sampled in the Southern Blue Ridge, none were acidic (ANC .ltoreq. 0) and only 1.4% of the population of 258 lakes were estimated to have low ANC (.ltoreq. 50 .mu.equiv/L. In contrast, an estimated 22% of the lakes in the Florida subregion were acidic, and 35.3% were estimated to have low ANC. Almost 90% of the lakes in the Southern Blue Ridge were reservoirs. These lakes generally had moderate ANC values (median = 250 .mu.equiv/L) and had low concentrations of aluminum, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and sulfate compared to those of Florida, the upper Midwest, and the Northeast. The lakes in the Southern Blue Ridge showed a high degree of chemical homogeneity relative to those of other regions in the East. In contrast, the chemistry of lakes in Florida exhibited a high degree of heterogeneity, indicating the presence of several distinct subpopulations. Florida had the highest proportion of acidic lakes in the East, some of which had moderately high concentrations of aluminum, DOC, and sulfate. Some of the Florida lakes are naturally acidic from organic acids. However, the many clear water, acidic lakes exhibit chemical characteristics that are not inconsistent with a hypothesis of acidification from deposition. The geographic separation of the Southern Blue Ridge from Florida and the strong contrasts in physical and chemical characteristics of the respective subregions require that they be treated as distinct regions.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB	1988	22	2					172	177		10.1021/es00167a006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00167a006								19995017					WOS:A1988L911800012

Assessing nutrient and sediment load reduction potential of vegetation by utilizing the nutrient tracking tool at the field and watershed scale in a Great Lakes priority watershed	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												PurposeNutrient and sediment pollution of surface waters remains a critical challenge for improving water quality. This study takes a user-friendly field-scale tool and assesses its ability to model at both the field and watershed scale within the Fox River Watershed (FRW), Wisconsin, USA, along with assessing how targeted vegetation implementation could attenuate nutrient and sediment exports.MethodsTo assess potential load reductions, the nutrient tracking tool (NTT) was used with a scoring system to identify areas where vegetation mitigation could be implemented within three selected FRW sub-watersheds. A corn soybean rotation, an implementation of a 10-m-vegetated buffer, a full forest conversion, and tiling were modeled and assessed. The corn-soybean results were aggregated and compared to watershed level gauge data in two sub-watersheds. Edge-of-field data was compared to modeled results using multiple parameterization schemes.ResultsThe agricultural areas that scored higher and were untiled showed greater potential nutrient and sediment export reduction (up to 80 to 95%) when vegetation mitigation was implemented in the model. Field-scale results aggregated to the watershed scale showed disparities between modeled and measured phosphorus exports but modeled sediment exports fell within observed gauge data ranges. Field-specific parameter adjustments resulted in more accurate modeled results compared to measured edge-of-field export data but needed further refinement.ConclusionTargeted mitigation using a vegetation-based scoring system with the NTT model was shown to be a helpful tool for predicting nutrient and sediment reductions. Using a field-scale model aggregated to the watershed scale presents tradeoffs regarding processes found beyond the edge of field.

Effects of acetazolamide on pulmonary artery pressure and prevention of high-altitude pulmonary edema after rapid active ascent to 4,559 m	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY												Acetazolamide prevents acute mountain sickness (AMS) by inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Since it also reduces acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), it may also prevent high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) by lowering pulmonary artery pressure. We tested this hypothesis in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Thirteen healthy, nonac-climatized lowlanders with a history of HAPE ascended (<22 h) from 1,130 to 4,559 m with one overnight stay at 3,611 m. Medications were started 48 h before ascent (acetazolamide: n = 7, 250 mg 3 times/day; placebo: n = 6, 3 times/day). HAPE was diagnosed by chest radiography and pulmonary artery pressure by measurement of right ventricular to atrial pressure gradient (RVPG) by transthoracic echocardiography. AMS was evaluated with the Lake Louise Score (LLS) and AMS-C score. The incidence of HAPE was 43% versus 67% (acetazolamide vs. placebo, P = 0.39). Ascent to altitude increased RVPG from 20 +/- 5 to 43 +/- 10 mmHg (P < 0.001) without a group difference (P = 0.68). Arterial Po-2 fell to 36 +/- 9 mmHg (P < 0.001) and was 8.5 mmHg higher with acetazolamide at high altitude (P = 0.025). At high altitude, the LLS and AMS-C score remained lower in those taking acetazolamide (both P < 0.05). Although acetazolamide reduced HAPE incidence by 35%, this effect was not statistically significant, and was considerably less than reductions of about 70%-100% with prophylactic dexamethasone, tadalafil, and nifedipine performed with the same ascent profile at the same location. We could not demonstrate a reduction in RVPG compared with placebo treatment despite reductions in AMS severity and better arterial oxygenation. Limited by small sample size, our data do not support recommending acetazolamide for the prevention of HAPE in mountaineers ascending rapidly to over 4,500 m. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study is the first to investigate whether acetazolamide, which reduces acute mountain sickness (AMS), inhibits short-term hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and also prevents high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) in a fast-climbing ascent to 4,559 m. We found no statistically significant reduction in HAPE incidence or differences in hypoxic pulmonary artery pressures compared with placebo despite reductions in AMS and greater ventilation-induced arterial oxygenation. Our data do not support recommending acetazolamide for HAPE prevention.

J	SETARO, FV; MELACK, JM				SETARO, FV; MELACK, JM			RESPONSES OF PHYTOPLANKTON TO EXPERIMENTAL NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT IN AN AMAZON FLOODPLAIN LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Natural algal populations in 4, 10 and 800 l enclosures were fertilized to ascertain to what extent ammonium, nitrate or phosphate enrichment changed phytoplankton abundance and physiology in an Amazon floodplain lake (Lake Calado), Brazil. When water was rising and was between 8 and 11 m (March-May 1982), algal abundance ranged from 13-24 .mu.g chlorophyll a (Chl a)/l and epilimnetic NH4+, NO3- and PO43- concentrations were usually < 0.3 .mu.M. Chlorophyll increased over the control by 60-265% in the P treatment, 5-40% in the N treatments and 75-270% in the N + P treatments after about 5 days. In 3 of the 4 experiments, increases in chlorophyll after addition of phosphate alone were significantly greater (P < 0.05) than after additions of nitrate or ammonium alone. Increases in net photosynthesis and in particulate C and N concentrations corroborated the chlorophyll data. Deficiency indices (ammonium-enhanced dark 14C fixation, N and P uptake rates and sestonic N:P ratios) implied that the phytoplankton were impoverished with respect to N and P; nutrient enrichment relieved this condition but deficiency often returned after a few days. When water depth was falling and was between 7 and 2 m (Sept.-Nov. 1982) algal abundance ranged from 4-15 .mu.g Chl a/l, turbidity increased, and epilimnetic inorganic N and P were usually < 0.3 .mu.M. During Sept. both N and P additions increased algal standing crop, whereas in early Oct. enrichment with N increased abundance substantially (P < 0.05) about that after P addition. The physiological evidence indicated that the lake was N-deficient during Sept.; in Oct. neither N nor P deficiency was discernible except for slight alkaline phosphatase activity.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1984	29	5					972	984		10.4319/lo.1984.29.5.0972	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1984.29.5.0972													WOS:A1984TM04300006

Apres Nous, le Deluge: A Human-Triggered Jokulhlaup From a Subglacial Lake	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Glacial floods (jokulhlaups) are a phenomenon of some temperate ice masses; they are a significant natural hazard, but their complex hydrology is incompletely understood. We document a jokulhlaup from a subglacial lake in Iceland that was inadvertently triggered by a borehole drilled through the overlying ice. We propose that this borehole allowed an englacial water body to drain into the lake, inducing a transient rise in pressure that overwhelmed the lake's subglacial seal 5 days later. Runaway melting of a subglacial conduit by 4 degrees C lake water then initiated a flood to the outlet glacier margin. This incident suggests that draining of englacial water bodies via hydrofracturing crevasses and flooding of moulins by precipitation events are potential natural triggers of jokulhlaups and explains a correlation between surface melting and jokulhlaups. This hydraulic trigger could have wider implications for relations between meteorological conditions, drainage, and dynamics of some glaciers. Plain Language Summary Some ice caps and mountain glaciers contain water bodies that drain episodically and catastrophically as subglacial floods, sometimes threatening human life and property. Our observations suggest that we unintentionally triggered such a flood from a subglacial lake in Iceland by boring through the overlying ice. Our conduit allowed water inside the glacier to drain into the lake, causing the pressure to rise and lifting the ice shelf enough to allow the lake to rapidly drain beneath the glacier toward its edge. This event revealed a mechanism by which natural drainage events can trigger such floods and why floods from this particular lake are more likely to occur in summer.					; Skidmore, Mark/I-4317-2018	Amend, Jan/0000-0003-4953-7776; Thorsteinsson, Thorsteinn/0000-0002-8680-1997; Johannesson, Tomas/0000-0001-7274-8593; Einarsson, Bergur/0000-0002-1984-9982													0094-8276	1944-8007				NOV 28	2020	47	22							e2020GL089876	10.1029/2020GL089876	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL089876													WOS:000595819700081

Depositional model of early Cretaceous lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Coqueiros formation - Northern Campos Basin, southeastern Brazil	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												Recent discoveries of giant hydrocarbon accumulations in coquinas and other lacustrine carbonate rocks of Rift and Post-rift (pre-salt) super-sequences of the Campos and Santos Basins have motivated a series of studies focused on understanding the genesis of these unique reservoirs. An integrated petrologic-sedimentologic-stratigraphic-seismic study of the Coqueiros Formation delineated the depositional model and evolution of reworked bioclastic rocks and other associated rocks deposited on the external high in the northern Campos Basin during the transition between late-rift and sag stages. Bioclastic rudstones and grainstones with moderate to high shell reworking represent 65% of the samples described. The following pieces of evidence point to a predominantly shallow lacustrine depositional environment, dominated by storm currents: (i) presence of high-angle ( > 14 degrees) longshore cross-bedded rudstones; (ii) limited occurrence of muddy sediments interbedded with thick packages of amalgamated bioclastic rudstones; (iii) great lateral continuity of rudstone deposits devoid of matrix on the structural high, consistent with processes of storm action on large expanses of shallow lakes; (iv) deposits of massive rudstones, with disorganized shells, similar to the modern coastal bioclastic deposits of California and Shark Bay. Three sets of facies association are proposed: (i) high-energy facies, composed of bioclastic rudstones and grainstones devoid of matrix deposited above the fair weather wave base (FWB); (ii) low energy facies, composed of hybrid rocks with muddy or peloidal matrix and other fine grained rocks deposited below the FWB or in protected shallow environments; (iii) an alkaline set, composed of mainly magnesian clay ooids deposited in a more alkaline composition of lake water. The evolution of the facies associations over time demonstrates an overall fall of the relative lake level. High proportion of low energy facies associated with a deeper lacustrine environment occurs at the Coqueiros Fm. base, while at the top predominate high energy facies associated with a shallow lacustrine environment, in addition to magnesian clay-rich facies associated to restricted and alkaline water bodies. Paleocurrents suggest the activity of two main wind direction (northwest and southeast) over the external high that result in clean bioclastic facies with good reservoir potential on both flanks. The knowledge of wind directions during the late Barremian and early Aptian in the northern Campos Basin is extremely important for targeting the best depositional facies for hydrocarbon accumulation in the Coqueiros Formation.																			0264-8172	1873-4073				JAN	2020	111						414	439		10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2019.07.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2019.07.013													WOS:000498747300027

Regular alternations of red to green mudstone and lacustrine limestone, termed the 'basic cycle', reflect lake-level variations at the metre-scale. In an earlier study, the basic cycle was shown to be controlled by the climatic precession cycle. Petrographic analysis made it possible to distinguish two main carbonate microfacies groups characteristic of very shallow transient and shallow permanent lake environments, respectively. In addition to the basic cyclicity, the microfacies analysis reveals lake-level variations on a larger scale. As a consequence, the astronomical forcing hypothesis of the cyclicity in the Cascante section is explored further. A climate modelling study of orbital extremes indicates that high lake levels could relate to enhanced net winter precipitation and runoff during precession minima, consistent with Mediterranean geological data. Using this phase relationship, an astronomical tuning of the cycles is established starting from astronomical ages of magnetic reversal boundaries. Subsequently, successive basic cycles are correlated to precession minima. The tuning reveals an identical number of basic cycles in the Cascante section as precession-related sapropel cycles in the deep marine succession at Monte dei Corvi (Italy), corroborating the precessional control of the basic cycles at Cascante. Lake-level highstands in the large-scale cycle identified by the microfacies analysis relate to maxima in both the ca 100 and 405 kyr eccentricity cycles, again consistent with Mediterranean geological data. Subtraction of the identified astronomically related (lake-level) variations from the palaeoenvironmental record at Cascante indicates a shift to deeper and more permanent lacustrine environments in the upper half of the section. The cause of this shift remains unclear, but it may be linked to tectonics, non-astronomical climate, long-period astronomical cycles or autogenic processes.					; Calvo, Jose/A-1277-2009	Abels, Hemmo/0000-0001-7648-3369; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				FEB	2009	56	2					399	419		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.00976.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.00976.x													WOS:000262296700002

More than 70 rotifer species were identified from collections in 1982 and 1984. None of the species collected could be considered acidobiontic or alkalibiontic. Keratella taurocephala was the most commonly collected rotifer, occurring in 94 of the study lakes. It was abundant throughout the range of pH investigated but was particularly dominant in acidic waters, averaging >85% of the rotifers collected from waters of pH <5.0. Rotifer community structure can be related to three groups of water quality parameters. Community parameters (richness and diversity) are most high correlated with parameters indicative of acidity status. Rotifer abundance correlated with trophic state indicators, i.e. chlorophyll a and total phosphorus, over the full range of pH investigated. However, in acidic lakes, rotifer abundance is related to true color and DOC, indicators of humic influences. The rotifer communities of the Adirondacks can be classified into four broad types: 1) A diverse, productive community of the more alkaline lakes, generally with .apprx. 13 species, and dominated by Conochilus unicornis, Kellicottia bostoniensis, Kellicottia longispina, and Polyarthra major; 2) Relatively diverse communities of productive, highly colored acid lakes, with .apprx. 8 species, and often with very large populations (>200 .cntdot.l-1) dominated by K. bostoniensis and K. taurocephala; 3) Depauperate (<4 species) communities of clear water acid lakes with generally low density populations dominated by K. taurocephala (>90% of rotifers in each sample); and 4) Extremely depauperate (2-3 species) acid lake communities associated with small lakes with high flushing rates dominated by C. unicornis.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 29	1989	175	1					33	48		10.1007/BF00008473	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008473													WOS:A1989U843000003

There exist diurnal cycles induced by the interaction between lake/land breeze and the lower level southeasterlies over each lake, particularly Lake Victoria. Generally, maximum convection/rain fall is in the night to early morning on the west side of the lake while on the other side of the lake it is in the afternoon to early evening. The mean annual over-lake rainfall is greater than mean annual catchment rainfall by 30% and 20% for Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika, respectively. Lake Victoria is divided into four quadrants based on the fact that convection is stronger in the northern quadrants and that the diurnal cycles in the cast and west quadrants are quite different. Convective activity is compared among the four quadrants and the catchment. Temporal and spatial distribution of cloud cover resembles that of convection. Annual mean cloudiness is 0,5, 0.45 and 0.38 for the above three lakes, respectively. For Lake Victoria both the monthly and annual mean cloudiness maps demonstrated a daytime cloudiness minimum and a nighttime cloudiness maximum over the lake. Evaporation is calculated for each lake by energy-budget and combined-Penman methods. Both a fixed cloudiness scenario and a varied cloudiness scenario arc used as cloud cover input. Calculated values range from 1537 to 1669 mm/year for Lake Victoria, 1559 to 1721 mm/year for Lake Tanganyika and 1698 to 1901 mm/year for Lake Malawi. In order to investigate the influence of cloudiness, evaporation calculation is also carried out in each quadrant and in each pixel of Lake Victoria. The results show that evaporation rate is highest in the middle of the lake and decreases in both the east and the west directions.																			1574-0919		1-4020-0772-8				2002	12						93	119																WOS:000179074600003

I: Mexico to Nevada1	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Peninsular Ranges orogeny occurred during the mid-Cretaceous at similar to 100 Ma and affected rocks from southern Mexico to Alaska. The event resulted from the closing of an Early Cretaceous marine arc trough, named the Bisbee-Arperos seaway in Mexico and Arizona, and the Cinko Lake arc trough in the Sierra Nevada. The trough was an ocean that formed after the Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous Nevadan orogeny and associated post-collisional magmatism. It was open for similar to 40 million years and closed by westward subduction. Here, we focus initially on the most complete cross section, located in southwestern Mexico, where a west-facing Albian carbonate platform, with subjacent siliciclastic rocks built on the western margin of North America, was pulled down into a trench at 100 Ma, buried in hemipelagic mud and Cenomanian flysch, then overthrust from the west by rocks of the 140-100 Ma Santiago Peak - Alisitos arc and its substrate, the Guerrero Superterrane, which collectively document westerly subduction. This tectonically thickened collision zone was exhumed and intruded by 99-84 Ma distinctive postcollisional tonalite-granodiorite plutonic complexes, all with Sr/Y > 20, Sm/Yb > 2.5, Nb/Y > 0.4, and La/Yb > 10. These geochemical features are typical of slab failure, not arc magmas. The post-collisional plutons, previously considered to represent arc flare-ups, were derived from melting of the descending slab following arc-continent collision. Remnants of the arc, basin, related eastvergent 100 Ma thrusts, flexural foredeep, and 99-84 Ma slab failure plutons are traced from the Peninsular Ranges, through the Mojave Desert to the Sierra Nevada where similar rocks, relations, and ages occur. Along the western, back-arc, side of the orogen after collision and slab break-off, but during exhumation, east-dipping reverse faults with >10 km of east-side up movement shed 100-85 Ma plutonic and other debris westward from the hinterland into troughs such as the Valle and Great Valley. We extend our synthesis northward, from west-central Nevada to Alaska, in Part II.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				AUG	2021	58	8					670	696		10.1139/cjes-2020-0154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjes-2020-0154													WOS:000683738600002

Holocene climate and environmental change in central New York (USA)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We present a Holocene record of climate and environmental change in central New York (USA) inferred using lithologic and stable isotope data from two sediment cores recovered in Cayuga Lake. The record was divided into three intervals: (1) early Holocene (similar to 11.6-8.8 ka), (2) Hypsithermal (similar to 8.8-4.4 ka), and (3) Neoglacial (similar to 4.4 ka to present). The early Holocene began abruptly, with rising lake level and relatively deep water. Between similar to 10.8 and 9.2 ka, cool and dry conditions prevailed at a time of maximum solar insolation. This anomaly has been referred to as the "post-Younger Dryas climate interval" and lasted similar to 1,600 years, the approximate length of one "Bond cycle." The Hypsithermal was the warmest, wettest and most biologically productive interval of the Holocene in central New York. The Hypsithermal was characterized by centennial to multi-centennial-scale variability. The 8.2 ka event is one such variation. The Neoglacial was an interval of generally cooler and dryer conditions, falling lake levels, and several prominent climate anomalies. At approximately 2.4 ka, delta(13)C of bulk organic matter increased abruptly by 5aEuro degrees as lake level declined, and the lake flora was dominated by Chara sp. during the coldest interval of the Neoglacial. Numerous sediment variables display increased variability similar to 2.0 ka, which continues today. Archaeological data from the literature suggest that Native American populations may have been large enough to impact land cover by about 2.4 ka and we hypothesize that the "Anthropocene" began at about that time in central New York. We also found paleolimnological evidence for the Medieval Warm Period (similar to 1.4-0.5 ka), which was warmer and wetter than today, and for the Little Ice Age (similar to 500-150 years ago), a period with temperatures colder than today.					; Patterson, William/J-6473-2012; Burnett, Adam/ABE-4249-2020	Patterson, William/0000-0003-3387-708X; 													0921-2728					FEB	2011	45	2					243	256		10.1007/s10933-011-9495-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-011-9495-z													WOS:000286677000009

In the summer of 1991, simultaneous outbreaks of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7 and of bloody diarrhea caused by Shigella sonnei were traced to a lakeside park near Portland, Oregon. Methods. We identified cases primarily from routine surveillance reports. In case-control studies, the activities of persons with park-associated E. coli O157:H7 or S. sonnei infections were compared independently with those of three sets of controls. We also evaluated environmental conditions at the park and subtyped the bacterial isolates. Results. We identified 21 persons with park-associated E. coli O157:H7 infections (all of them children; median age, six years) and 38 persons with S. sonnei infections (most of them children). These 59 people had visited the park over a 24-day period. Their illnesses were not associated with food or beverage consumption. All the case patients reported swimming, however, and in case-control studies swimming was strongly associated with both types of infection (P = 0.015 or less). The case patients were more likely than the controls to report having swallowed lake water, and they had spent more time in the lake. Numbers of enterococci indicative of substantial fecal contamination (geometric mean, > 50 per deciliter) were detected in the swimming area during some but not all of the outbreak period. Park-associated E. coli O157:H7 isolates were identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and were distinguishable from other isolates in the Portland area. Conclusions. Lake water that was fecally contaminated by bathers was the most likely vehicle for the transmission of both the E. coli O157:H7 and the S. sonnei infections. The unusually prolonged outbreak suggests both the survival of these enteric organisms in lake water and a low infectious dose.

A total of 71,931 coastal pools were mapped and measured, and amphibian occupants were identified along 48 km of shoreline at Isle Royale National Park, where coastal rock pool habitats were abundant. Generally, mean depth of pools was 0.11 m, with a mean surface area of 0.6 m(2), although maximum measurements were 1.5 m and 378 m2, respectively. Three strongly defined zones occurred, with bedrock near the lake having a low slope and more numerous, smaller, and shallower pools; bedrock near the forest edge had a steeper slope and fewer, larger, and deeper pools; and a median zone occurring between. A single offshore location, Passage Island, had nearly 63% of all pool abundance. Two amphibian species were typical of coastal pools, the chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata) and blue-spotted salamander (Ambystoma laterale), while spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) was uncommon and probably incidental to coastal habitats. These three species were significantly more abundant in mid-shore pools. Four other amphibian species were only rarely detected. Both coastal habitat density and chorus frog abundance were highest at localities directly adjacent to an international shipping lane. As a result of intriguing spatial distributions and potential for impacts from coastal pollution, chorus frog in particular reveals that coastal ecology can be unique from inland contexts and have important management implications at the land-water interface.

Trends in sedimentary charcoal shapes correspond with broad-scale land-use changes: insights gained from a 300-year lake sediment record from eastern Virginia, USA	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sedimentary charcoal is a useful fire proxy. Recent advances in the morphological and morphometric analyses of individual charcoal particles have enabled more nuanced paleofire interpretations. However, many uncertainties exist regarding the linkages of these particle characteristics with fuel type burned. Further, most of this proxy development research has been conducted in northern boreal biomes, which poses questions as to its universality. In this paper, we leverage a 300-year sediment record from a mill pond in southeastern Virginia, USA. Historical events and land-use changes are well constrained in Williamsburg, allowing us to compare our data with these known boundary conditions to (1) make inferences about the fuel sourcing of certain charcoal morphotypes, and (2) identify the potential controls of several charcoal morphometric characteristics. We found that the morphology and morphometry of particles in the Matoaka sediments changed in response to broad-scale shifts of historical land use and population. Prior to the American Revolutionary War (ca. 1780 CE), charcoal morphologies indicative of agricultural burning coincided with agricultural and local population expansion. Immediately preceding the American Civil War (1780-1865 CE), charcoal in Lake Matoaka recorded reforestation driven by depopulation and economic depression. After the fall of the Confederacy (ca. 1865 CE), changing charcoal morphologies reflected increased population and urban development. This increase became especially pronounced in the early 1900s, but lasted until the modern. Additionally, shifts of charcoal morphologies potentially reflect increased coal combustion. Comparison of these historical variations with morphotype shifts shows that Types M and S/B charcoal, types defined by their geometric shapes and exhibition of structure, are likely sourced from burning herbaceous fuels. However, we find that the variability of morphometric characteristics makes it unlikely that other morphologies are sourced from sole fuel types. Lastly, we propose three additional morphotypes, Types AI (angular and irregular shaped particles), E (irregular, complex shaped particles), and T (triangular particles), to an existing charcoal morphological key for application in the SE USA. Overall, this research underscores the need for more work calibrating paleofire methodologies in the SE USA.

J	Parent, M; Occhietti, S				Parent, M; Occhietti, S			Late Wisconsinan deglaciation and glacial lake development in the Appalachians of southeastern Quebec	GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE												Late Wisconsinan deglaciation in southeastern Quebec was preceded by a northward ice-flow reversal that was recorded in the northeastern part of the region. The reversal event was generated by flow convergence toward the St. Lawrence Ice Stream, a northeastward-flowing ice stream which formed in the St. Lawrence estuary prior to 13 000 years BP and lasted until at least 12 400 years BP. In the Bois-Francs uplands, the flow reversal event led to the formation of a semi-detached ice mass that underwent widespread stagnation and downwasting. In the southwestern region, northward retreat of the margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet was marked by the formation of a series of discontinuous recessional moraines and by the development of ice-dammed lakes in the main valleys. The level of these lakes fell as progressively lower outlets became ice-free. The main episodes are (1)the Sherbrooke Phase of Glacial Lake Memphremagog, (2) an unnamed transitional lake and (3) Glacial Lake Candona, a large lake which had expanded northeastward from the deglaciated regions of the Upper St. Lawrence (Lake Iroquois) and Ottawa valleys to the Lake Champlain (Glacial Lake Vermont) basin. As recorded by the Danville Varves, Lake Candona lasted about 100 years following deposition of the Ulverton-Tingwick Moraine. Subsequent ice retreat along the Appalachian piedmont led to final drainage of Lake Candona and allowed Champlain Sea waters to invade much of these glaciolacustrine terrains about 12 000 years BP. On the basis of the Danville Varves record, a regional rate of ice retreat of about 200 m.a(-1) is inferred. The age of the earliest moraine, the Frontier Moraine, is thus about 12 550 years BP, while the ages of the subsequent Dixville, Cherry River-East-Angus, Mont Ham and Ulverton-Tingwick moraines are estimated at 12 500, 12 325, 12 200 et 12 100 years BP, respectively.																			0705-7199						1999	53	1					117	135		10.7202/004859ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/004859ar													WOS:000081550800009
J	Yamamuro, M; Koike, I				Yamamuro, M; Koike, I			Concentrations of nitrogen in sandy sediments of a eutrophic estuarine lagoon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Concentrations of sediment organic nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (ammonium, nitrite and nitrate), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in sediments were measured at two sites in a eutrophic estuarine lagoon. One is a shallow aerobic site where macrobenthos are abundant and the other is a deep anaerobic site devoid of macrobenthos. Four species of macrobenthos (Bivalvia: Corbicula japonica, Annelida: Notomastus sp., Neanthes japonica and Oligochaeta sp.) were found in 8 sandy sediment cares collected at a shallow site in three succcessive summers. DON (170-1500 mu g atom N l(-1)) was the major constituent of dissolved nitrogen with 10 times greater concentration than ammonium (55-180 mu g atom N l(-1)) and 1000 times greater than nitrate (0.13-5.9 mu g atom N l(-1)) and nitrite (0.21-1.4 mu g atom N l(-1)). The ammonium content in anaerobic muddy sediments at the deep site (210-350 mu g atom N l(-1)) was higher than in aerobic sandy sediments, whereas DON was higher in aerobic sediments than anaerobic sediments (90-240 mu g atom N l(-1)). In aerobic sediments, depth profiles of DIN were nearly constant whereas DON was mostly highest at the surface. On the other hand, the increase of DON and ammonium was observed where macrobenthos was found. The occurrence of macrobenthos and high content of DON and ammonium content in the layers of sediment may suggest the influence of macrobenthos in the partitioning of nitrogen species through their motion and excretion.

River-valleys as an intra-city natural feature	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Intra-city natural structures have always had a key role in creating sustainable urban greenspaces. Adapting to natural features and relating the intra-city greenspaces to such natural structures as river-valleys, hillsides, lakes and forests, guarantee the endurance, sustainability and longevity of the natural quality of city. This paper looks at intra-city natural structures which have undergone wholesale changes and been ruined, and considers the lives of these invaluable natural structures which have been endangered due to gross human interference and pressure, regardless of physical and biological features. River-valleys in Tehran have always had a significant role in offering valuable bio-environmental services to the city From the time of Qadjar era, villages enjoying favorable climate were built outside the city, and the villa of the governors and affluent people were built near hillsides across river-valleys because of the abundance of running water, cool weather in the summer and natural plant life. Little by little green corridors of Shemiranat were built near river-valleys, which formed the axes of the development of the city at the time Pahlavi dynasty. From then, the development of the city towards hillsides, regardless of these natural structures, increased and the destruction of these urban natural spaces have posed serious problems nowadays. Familiarity with these natural structures, their preservation and organization, and making the optimum use of them seem to be a very critical issue. Taking an ecological approach in this paper, is an attempt to look at the intra-city river-valleys. To do so, the data collected from a natural river-valley is used as evidence to back up any claims made in this regard.																			1735-6865	2008-2304				SUM	2007	1	3					204	213																WOS:000256018200002
J	PRICE, JS				PRICE, JS			WATER EXCHANGES IN A SHORELINE TYPHA MARSH ON LAKE-ONTARIO	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A Typha-dominated marsh bordering Lake Ontario had a strong hydraulic connection with the lake during spring 1991, when the water level was more than 10-20 cm above the marsh surface. During this period, water-level changes were dominated by the general decline of Lake Ontario, by short-term fluctuations caused by seiche activity (1.7 h periodicity) and by setup (diurnal). These were transmitted into the marsh at 65-135 m h-1. The water surface profile was generally flat over the marsh during this period but water depth was uneven owing to peat surface adjustment. High buoyancy of the surface in the 30 m margin adjacent to the lake minimized water depth there. By 21 June, water depth at the margin was essentially zero, but elsewhere was 0.07-0.1 m; all water exchanges between the marsh and lake were thereafter constrained to relatively slow subsurface flow (approximately 10(-3)-10(-4) m h-1). Short-term fluctuations caused by lake-level variability were then restricted to the margin. The Lake Ontario water level then dropped faster than that on the marsh, as did the water table on the adjacent mineral terrain, resulting in an upwardly convex water surface profile on the marsh, where water flow was away from the marsh. Between 14 June and 6 August, 116 mm of rain and 264 mm of evapotranspiration resulted in 30 mm of lateral water loss from the marsh centre; only 1 mm was lost at the marsh margin, reflecting the frequent reversals of hydraulic gradient there.																			0022-1694					SEP	1994	161	1-4					181	195		10.1016/0022-1694(94)90128-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(94)90128-7													WOS:A1994PG57000011

The Economic Effects of Volcanic Alerts-A Case Study of High-Threat US Volcanoes	RISK ANALYSIS												A common concern about volcanic unrest is that the communication of information about increasing volcanic alert levels (VALs) to the public could cause serious social and economic impacts even if an eruption does not occur. To test this statement, this study examined housing prices and business patterns from 1974-2016 in volcanic regions with "very-high" threat designations from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)-Long Valley Caldera (LVC), CA (caldera); Mount St. Helens (MSH), Washington (stratovolcano); and Kilauea, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai (shield volcano). To compare economic trends in nonvolcanic regions that are economically dependent on tourism, Steamboat Springs, CO, served as a control as it is a ski-tourism community much like Mammoth Lakes in LVC. Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models predicted that housing prices were negatively affected by VALs at LVC from 1982-1983 and 1991-1997. While VALs associated with unrest and eruptions included in this study both had short-term indirect effects on housing prices and business indicators (e.g., number of establishments, employment, and salary), these notifications were not strong predictors of long-term economic trends. Our findings suggest that these indirect effects result from both eruptions with higher level VALs and from unrest involving lower-level VAL notifications that communicate a change in volcanic activity but do not indicate that an eruption is imminent or underway. This provides evidence concerning a systemic issue in disaster resilience. While disaster relief is provided by the U.S. federal government for direct impacts associated with disaster events that result in presidential major disaster declarations, there is limited or no assistance for indirect effects to businesses and homeowners that may follow volcanic unrest with no resulting direct physical losses. The fact that periods of volcanic unrest preceding eruption are often protracted in comparison to precursory periods for other hazardous events (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding) makes the issue of indirect effects particularly important in regions susceptible to volcanic activity.

J	Wilton, DHC				Wilton, Derek H. C.			Albert Peter Low in Labrador-A Tale of Iron and Irony	GEOSCIENCE CANADA												In 1893-1894, Albert Peter Low of the Geological Survey of Canada, along with D.I.V. Eaton and four indigenous assistants explored the Labrador Peninsula, then perceived as one of the last great unexplored wilderness areas of North America. The expedition left Lake St. John (now Lac St. Jean) on June 17, 1893, canoeing across the northeastern edge of the North American continent, arriving at Fort Chimo (now Kuujjuaq) on August 27, 1893. They departed Fort Chimo by steamer for Rigolet on the Labrador coast and the Hudson Bay Company post at North West River in the fall of 1893. On March 6, 1894 the party started up the Grand (now Churchill) River continuing through large central lakes into the Ashuanipi river system in western Labrador, then out via the Attikonak River to the Romaine River and finally the Saint Jean river system to arrive at Mingan on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River on August 23, 1894. Low described their fifteen-month journey as having covered over 8700 km including 1600 km on foot, over 4700 km in canoe, 800 km by dog team and 1600 km by steamer. The report from the expedition provides a compendium on the natural history of the region as well as the first geological maps. In terms of economic and scientific results, the greatest was documentation of the vast iron ore deposits of western Labrador; a world-class mining district that has been producing for sixty-three years since 1954. Low's account also provides details on the essence of such an epic journey, which stands as a classic in the annals of Canadian geological surveying.																			0315-0941						2018	45	1					43	58		10.12789/geocanj.2018.45.130	http://dx.doi.org/10.12789/geocanj.2018.45.130													WOS:000468383800004
J	Bazzanti, M; Mastrantuono, L; Pilotto, F				Bazzanti, Marcello; Mastrantuono, Luciana; Pilotto, Francesca			Depth-related response of macroinvertebrates to the reversal of eutrophication in a Mediterranean lake: Implications for ecological assessment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A better management of nutrient inflows into lakes has led to an improvement in their conditions (i.e. reversal of eutrophication) and the effects of this on macroinvertebrate communities that inhabit different lake-depth zones is largely unknown. This paper reports a comparison of macroinvertebrate communities living in the eulittoral, infralittoral and sublittoral/profundal zones of Lake Nemi (Central Italy) before and after its natural recovery from eutrophication following the deviation of domestic Wastewater. The infralittoral zone responded more rapidly than the other two depth-zones to the improved ecological conditions, as shown by larger differences in community composition between the two periods. In the eulittoral sand, the combined effects of hydromorphological pressures and reversal of eutrophication hindered the biotic response. In the eulittoral and infralittoral zones, typical taxa of mesotrophic waters appeared or increased their abundances after the eutrophication reversal. Benthic invertebrate response was slower in the sublittoral/profundal zone due to deoxygenation that continued to prevail in the deepest area of the lake during summer. However, both tolerant and more sensitive taxa were collected there for the first time. After the reversal of eutrophication, the percentage of molluscan + large crustaceans increased in the infralittoral zone, whereas the oligochaete/chironomid ratio decreased in both sublittoral/profundal and infralittoral zones. Functional feeding metrics (percentages of filter-feeders, collector-gatherers, miners and scrapers/grazers) differently tracked the reversal of eutrophication in the three depth-zones probably according to the effects of the-reduction of nutrients on food-web structure influencing macroinvertebrates. Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) and the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) seemed to respond to eutrophication reversal only in the sublittoral/profundal zone, where deoxygenation plays a major role as a structuring agent of the community. Our results suggest that the effects of re-. versal of eutrophication can be better assessed by examining the response of the communities belonging to each zone individually. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This relationship has not been explored at increasing or significant high altitude (HA). This study assessed the effects of exercise at progressively increasing HA on high-sensitivity (hs)-cTnT levels and their relationship to biventricular cardiac function and severity of acute mountain sickness (AMS). Transthoracic echocardiograms, hs-cTnT levels and AMS scores were measured at rest at 1,300 m then repeated post exercise and 12 h later after progressive trekking to 3,440, 4,270 m and at 5,150 m (after trekking to 5,643 m) on 19 healthy subjects (age 35.4 +/- A years, 52.6 % males). There was a detectable increase (> 5 ng/L) in post exercise hs-cTnT with exercise at HA which became significant at 5,150 m (5.84 % at 3,440 m, 5.2 % at 4,270 m and 56.3 % at 5,150 m; p = 0.0005). Compared with baseline, HA to 5,150 m led to a significant rise in post exercise Lake Louis AMS scores (p < 0.001) pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) (23.7 +/- A 3.8 vs 37.9 +/- A 11.7 mmHg: p < 0.001), cardiac output (5.2 +/- A 1.2 vs 7.5 +/- A 1.3 l/min; p < 0.001) and a fall in SpO(2) (96.1 +/- A vs 77.4 +/- A 12.0 %; p < 0.001). There was no change in stroke volume (p = 0.10) or estimated filling pressures (E/E') of the left (p = 0.50) and right ventricles (p = 0.4). On multivariate analysis increasing cardiac output (p = 0.02) and PASP (p = 0.04) and decreasing SpO(2) (p = 0.01) were the only independent predictors of increasing cTnT levels (overall R (2) = 0.23, p < 0.0001). Moderate intensity exercise at significant HA influences the post exercise increase in hs-cTnT without overt deleterious effects on cardiac function.																			1861-0684	1861-0692				APR	2014	103	4					291	299		10.1007/s00392-013-0654-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00392-013-0654-2								24363107					WOS:000333130600005

Influence of nearshore water dynamics and pollution sources on beach monitoring outcomes at two adjacent Lake Michigan beaches	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Beach closings are a growing concern in coastal regions because of serious public health and economic ramifications. Two beach sites separated by 150 m of shoreline on Lake Michigan were monitored in the summer of 2003 and 2004 for E. coli densities to evaluate the potential outcome of relocating an existing beach to a site immediately to the south. Under identical weather conditions, there was a large disparity between the two sites for 25 of the 39 days tested, where E. coli levels at the existing beach were at least twice as high as those at the proposed beach. Following rainfall, E. coli levels at the existing beach increased up to 100-fold to levels as high as 4,500 CFU/100 mL, whereas only a 10-fold increase in levels was observed at the proposed beach site. Water exchange in the beach areas was predominantly from wind driven currents rather than dilution, and longshore current speed at the proposed beach was calculated to be twice that of the existing beach. Stormwater and combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharged from two closely spaced outfalls approximately 0.5 km north of the existing beach was found to have E. coli levels above the EPA recommended limit of 235 CFU/100 mL for recreational waters. However, this input did not appear to be a major influence on beach monitoring results. In some cases, E. coli levels at the beach did not exceed 235 E. coli/100 mL during a CSO. Defining the sources and spatial range of pollution inputs would allow beach monitoring results to be interpreted in a more meaningful context, which may lead to the formation of effective management strategies.

Applications were made on 1-ha plots with rates based on plot type: references (0 mg acid equivalent (ae)L-.(-1)), protected plots (0.5 mg ae(.)L(-1)), semi-protected plots (1.0 mg ae(.)L(-1)), and unprotected plots (1.5 mg ae(.)L(-1)). Plot protection was a function of potential mixing in the water column. Herbicide residues were monitored to determine dissipation 1 through 72 h post treatment. Samples were analyzed with both a high performance liquid chromatography technique and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Results from these two analytical techniques were compared, and found equivalent (R-2 = 0.96). Triclopyr had a relatively short half-life for each treatment (3.5 hr at 0.5 mg ae(.)L(-1), 2.9 hr at 1.0 mg ae(.)L(-1), and 4.2 hr at 1.5 mg ae(.)L(-1)). At 8 weeks post treatment, there was a 30 to 45% reduction in Eurasian watermilfoil distribution. Greatest Eurasian watermilfoil control was achieved in plots using higher triclopyr rates. Frequency of native plants decreased by 24% in the untreated reference plot, 20% in the 0.5 mg ae(.)L(-1) plot and 6% in the 1.0 and 1.5 mg ae(.)L(-1) plots. Mean species per point, however, either increased or remained unchanged in seven of the nine treated plots. Decline of native plants may be partially attributed to the onset of fall senescence. Larger contiguous areas, higher triclopyr rates, and sequential applications may be required to enhance Eurasian watermilfoil control in small-plot, partial lake treatments.																			1040-2381					DEC	2004	20	4					322	332		10.1080/07438140409354161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140409354161													WOS:000226448700006

High resolution magnetostratigraphies, established on eight fossiliferous sections in the Lake Thun, Napf and Lake Zurich areas as well as in the Jura Mountains, provide the most complete temporal calibration of the Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene (30-15 Ma) mammal biozonation. The average duration of the 22 assemblage zones calibrated in this paper varies from 300 kyr in the Late Chattian to approximately 800 kyr in the Aquitanian to Langhian and in the Early Chattian. Furthermore the magnetic chronology suggests that the Paleogene/Neogene boundary should be placed within the mammal assemblage zone of Brochene Fluh 53. The presented magnetostratigraphies greatly improve the temporal calibration of the depositional sequences in the North Alpine foreland basin between 30-15 Ma. The Lower Marine Molasse (UMM) regression in central Switzerland is dated with 30 Ma, which coincides with an eustatic sea level fall. The Upper Marine Molasse (OMM) transgression is strongly heterochronous and is calibrated with 21 Ma in Haute Savoie and 20 Ma in the Napf area, suggesting that the perialpine sea way expanded from west to east. The transition from marine OMM to continental Upper Freshwater Molasse (OSM) is time transgressive as well. In the center of the Napf fan, OSM conglomerates rest directly on Lower Freshwater Molasse (USM) with no OMM in between. 10 kilometers farther east the OMM regression is calibrated with 18.7 Ma as compared to 17 Ma in the interfan areas.

J	Mitchell, RL; Sheldon, ND				Mitchell, Ria L.; Sheldon, Nathan D.			Sedimentary provenance and weathering processes in the 1.1 Ga Midcontinental Rift of the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan, USA	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												Fluvial, alluvial, lacustrine, and debris flow sedimentary rocks from the Keweenaw Peninsula (Michigan, USA) are geochemically characterized to examine weathering processes and provenance. These sedimentary rocks result from the erosion, weathering, and redistribution of effusive and plutonic igneous lithologies during periods of volcanic quiescence associated with the failed 1.1 Ga North American Midcontinental Rift. Three units comprising the sedimentary/igneous-mixed Portage Lake Volcanics, coarseness and source-varied Copper Harbor Conglomerate, and the quartz-rich post-rift fill unit of the Jacobsville Sandstone were studied over a geographically-wide and lithologically-varied range of localities across the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan. Provenance indicators such as Ti/Zr and Ti/Al ratios and La-Th-Sc ternary diagrams reveal that the Portage Lake Volcanic conglomerates are near-source, and that the Copper Harbor Conglomerate is primarily derived from felsic uplifted basement and recycled orogen lithologies to the east. The Jacobsville Sandstone is a combination of pulses of sources from the top to the bottom of the stratigraphic section: (1) felsic arkosic arenites sourced from the erosion and uplift of basement orogenic volcanic and plutonic rocks (top), (2) felsic arkosic-subarkosic arenites sourced from the erosion of uplifted basement, recycled orogeny and reworking of primary sedimentary and metased-imentary rocks (middle), and (3) quartz arenites eroded from the cratonic interior (highly mature). This work can consequently aid in structuring a stratigraphic nomenclature for the Jacobsville Sandstone. Both petrographic data and weathering indices such as the chemical index of alteration (CIA) and the paleosol hydrolysis metric (Al/Ca+Na+Mg+K) indicate low degrees of weathering during syn-rift deposition at 1.1 Ga, but increases with evolution of the rift in post-rift units toward the Late Mesoproterozoic/Early Neoproterozoic. Values for the CIA throughout the Mesoproterozoic from this and other localities have the same trend to that of proposed atmospheric CO2 concentrations derived from paleosol data, demonstrating that characterizing the weathering trends of floodplain deposits can be a useful addition to deciphering past paleoclimatic conditions in the Precambrian geologic record.

J	de Vos, JA; Raats, PAC; Feddes, RA				de Vos, JA; Raats, PAC; Feddes, RA			Chloride transport in a recently reclaimed Dutch polder	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Knowledge about the origin of solutes is required to define reasonable limits for surface water quality. The origin of the high chloride (0) concentrations in the drainage water of a recently reclaimed Dutch polder is analysed. Historical data on soil formation are used to understand the layering of the soil profile and its hydraulic properties. The salinisation process of the lake bottom in the period 1600-1932 explains the Cl profiles in the soil. After reclamation in 1942, the average application rate of Cl from fertiliser was 118 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Natural Cl deposition was 37 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and average Cl crop uptake was 10 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Upward diffusion from the subsoil (>120cm depth) of about 220kg ha(-1) yr(-1) is the major term in the Cl mass balance. Annual Cl drain discharge is estimated at 365 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Afield monitoring study in the winter leaching period 1991-1992 showed that the Cl drain discharge was only 180 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), probably, due to the relatively small precipitation excess in that period. The dynamics of water flow and solute transport in a two-dimensional flow domain are well described by the HYDRUS-2D model based on the Richards and Laplace equations for movement of water and the convection-dispersion equation for solute transport. The large lateral flow component towards the drain in the topsoil (0-120 cm depth) in the zone just above and below the phreatic surface explains the peaks in Cl and nitrate concentrations in the drainage water. The combination of historical data, field experiments and a simulation model was fruitful in explaining the origin and dynamics of Cl concentrations in the drainage water. The high Cl concentrations in the drainage and surface water are natural background concentrations originating mainly from the subsoil of the reclaimed polder. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We utilized time series information of this kind extracted from a series of multi-source remote sensing (RS) datasets including the MOD09GQ surface reflectance product, Landsat TM/ETM+ images, and meteorological records to analyze spatiotemporal variations of ice phenology of Qinghai Lake between 2000 and 2016 applying both RS and GIS technology. We also identified the climatic factors that have influenced lake ice phenology over time and draw a number of conclusions. First, data show that freeze-up start (FUS), freeze-up end (FUE), break-up start (BUS), and break-up end (BUE) on Qinghai Lake usually occurred in mid-December, early January, mid-to-late March, and early April, respectively. The average freezing duration (FD, between FUE and BUE), complete freezing duration (CFD, between FUE and BUS), ice coverage duration (ICD, between FUS and BUE), and ablation duration (AD, between BUS and BUE) were 88 days, 77 days, 108 days and 10 days, respectively. Second, while the results of this analysis reveal considerable differences in ice phenology on Qinghai Lake between 2000 and 2016, there has been relatively little variation in FUS times. Data show that FUE dates had also tended to fluctuate over time, initially advancing and then being delayed, while the opposite was the case for BUS dates as these advanced between 2012 and 2016. Overall, there was a shortening trend of Qinghai Lake's FD in two periods, 2000-2005 and 2010-2016, which was shorter than those seen on other lakes within the hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau. Third, Qinghai Lake can be characterized by similar spatial patterns in both freeze-up (FU) and break-up (BU) processes, as parts of the surface which freeze earlier also start to melt first, distinctly different from some other lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. A further feature of Qinghai Lake ice phenology is that FU duration (between 18 days and 31 days) is about 10 days longer than BU duration (between 7 days and 20 days). Fourth, data show that negative temperature accumulated during the winter half year (between October and the following April) also plays a dominant role in ice phenology variations of Qinghai Lake. Precipitation and wind speed both also exert direct influences on the formation and melting of lake ice cover and also cannot be neglected.

To aid palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, we carried out whole-rock geochemical analyses of 17 sedimentary layers of this section. The aim of this geochemical approach is to examine the element variations as a response to climate change during formation of the Tagay section deposits with a focus on the hydrological regime of the catchment and in-lake processes. Our results establish that temperature and climate conditions during the formation of sediments of section Tagay-1 were fairly stable, no abrupt climatic changes occurred. The palaeoclimate was temperate, however, it had a cyclic nature: wet and semiarid epochs of different intensity and duration alternated. The basal part of the sediment sequence is dominated by terrigeneous material, mainly by surface runoff, so the sedimentation was fed by erosion products of the weathering crust. During sedimentation of this lower part (layers 17-9), the palaeo-lake level and salinity stayed practically unchanged. The drawdown of the palaeo-lake and increasing salinity started in the higher middle part (layer 8), and reached the minimum water level and maximum salinity in layers 7-6. Sediments of the layers 8-6 accumulated in an arid climate. After deposition of layer 5, the water level began to rise, and during formation of layer 3 it fell again. The highest sedimentation rate was in layers 12-5, these are also the layers with the highest enrichment of biogenic elements (layers 12, 7-5) and where carbonate deposition took place. The observed changes in element behaviour are related to hydrological changes in the catchment (precipitation), lake level status, and evaporation, and are ultimately driven by climate.					; Kiel, Steffen/C-3150-2009; Shchetnikov, Alexander/GVU-4758-2022; Ivanova, Varvara/R-6400-2016	Ivanova, Varvara/0000-0002-7614-660X; Kiel, Steffen/0000-0001-6281-100X; Shchetnikov, Alexander/0000-0002-4591-6421; 													1867-1594	1867-1608				2022 DEC 14	2022										10.1007/s12549-022-00565-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12549-022-00565-9		DEC 2022											WOS:000898688500002
J	Savage, D				Savage, D.			A review of analogues of alkaline alteration with regard to long-term barrier performance	MINERALOGICAL MAGAZINE												Cement and concrete will be used as fracture grouts, shotcrete, tunnel and borehole seals, and as matrices for waste encapsulation inter alia in geological repositories for radioactive wastes. Alteration of the host rock and/or swelling clay in waste package buffers and tunnel backfills by hyperalkaline solutions from cement/concrete may be deleterious to system performance through changes in the physicochemical properties of these barrier materials. Analogue systems (and timescales) relevant to the understanding of the alkaline disturbed zone include: industrial analogues, such as alkaline flooding of hydrocarbon reservoirs (up to 30 y), cement-aggregate reactions (up to 100 y) and the Tournemire tunnel (up to 125 y); and natural analogues, including the hyperalkaline springs at Maqarin, Jordan (more than 100,000 y), saline, alkaline lakes (more than 1,000,000 y) and certain fracture fillings in granites (more than 1,000,000 y). These systems show that alkaline alteration can be observed for thousands of years over distance scales of hundreds of metres under extreme conditions of hydraulic gradients in fractured rocks (Maqarin), but may be limited to a few centimetres over tens to a hundred years in mudstone (Tournemire). Important reaction mechanisms for retardation of alkaline fluids include: fluid mixing (alkaline oil floods, Maqarin), ion exchange (alkaline oil floods, Tournemire) and kinetic mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions (all systems studied). Qualitative and quantitative kinetic data for mineral reactions are available from cement aggregate reactions and the Searles Lake analogue, respectively. Short-term alteration observed in cement-aggregates is characterized by calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) minerals and incipient zeolite formation, whereas evidence from the Tournemire tunnel shows the growth of K-feldspar after relatively short time intervals (tens to a hundred years). There is a tendency for alkaline alteration to result in porosity decreases, but locally, porosity may be enhanced (e. g. near-injection well interactions in alkaline oil floods, or at fracture margins at Maqarin, Jordan). Data from industrial and natural analogues may thus supply some key data for bridging time and space scales between laboratory and in situ experiments on one hand and the requirements for safety assessment on the other.																			0026-461X	1471-8022				AUG	2011	75	4					2401	2418		10.1180/minmag.2011.075.4.2401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1180/minmag.2011.075.4.2401													WOS:000295214200005
J	Rattan, KJ				Rattan, K. J.			An inter-basin comparison of nutrient limitation and the irradiance response of pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorescence in Lake Erie phytoplankton	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												This research examined the application of the maximum quantum efficiency (F (v)/F (m)) and relative electron transport rate versus irradiance curves (rETR) as a rapid, sensitive assessment of Lake Erie phytoplankton nutrient status. I evaluated the potential benefits of the variable fluorescence parameters by comparing these parameters with chemical and physiological nutrient status assays. I tested the hypothesis that F (v)/F (m) and rETR curves could diagnose nutrient status in natural lake phytoplankton and be capable of discriminating which inorganic nutrient is limited temporally and spatially. F (v)/F (m) was on average highest in the more eutrophic west basin (WB) and lowest in the more oligotrophic central basin (CB). According to the chemical and physiological indicators, P deficiency was most severe in the CB during summer stratification and N deficiency was strongest in the WB during isothermal conditions. Like F (v)/F (m), rETR at light saturation (rETR(max)) and the initial slope of the rETR versus irradiance curve (alpha) decreased as the severity of N and P deficiency increased. Amendment with N or P stimulated increased F (v)/F (m), rETR(max), and alpha in N- and P-limited samples, respectively, and abolished the photoinhibition apparent in rETR curves of nutrient-limited samples. These results supported the view that the N and P deficiency assays, and corresponding variations of variable fluorescence parameters, were valid indicators of widely variable N and P deficiency in the phytoplankton, and could be used to provide a promising tool in determining phytoplankton nutrient status. Contrary to my hopes, it did not appear that rETR-irradiance curves could discriminate between N and P deficiency. Identification of the most limiting nutrient still demanded additional information beyond the variable fluorescence measurements.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2014	48	1					107	125		10.1007/s10452-014-9470-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-014-9470-7													WOS:000331652800010

Restoration options for potential persistence of submersed aquatic vegetation: combining ecological, hydrodynamic and sediment transport modelling	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Restoration of shallow turbid lakes to promote growth of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) requires knowledge of the environmental factors affecting SAV growth and persistence, and a means to predict the success of SAV reestablishment under different management scenarios to improve these environmental conditions. We used a dynamic ecological modelling approach relating SAV responses to changes in physical and chemical conditions, with information on water level, flow and transparency being provided by hydrodynamic and sediment transport models. 2. The potential persistence of Vallisneria americana was similar under simulated environmental conditions in 1946 and in 1954, as was the potential persistence of Potamogeton pectinatus, indicating that the disappearance of V. americana from Peoria Lake (U.S.A.) previously attributed to an extended spring flood in 1954, may have been related to the combined effects of changes in water level, flow and water transparency as well as possibly other factors. 3. Recent environmental conditions (for 2000) proved not to be conducive for the colonization and persistence potential of V. americana, but would allow colonization by P. pectinatus. The construction of a hypothetical levee along the eastern descending line of the navigation channel in Upper Peoria Lake, which was expected to reduce fetch- and navigation-related turbidity, did not improve the situation for V. americana and overall deteriorated the situation for P. pectinatus. Thus, such a hydraulic alteration, generally considered as beneficial for SAV restoration, may not always be successful. 4. The results of the simulations indicated that the environmental conditions for potential persistence in Peoria Lake were generally less favourable for V. americana than for P. pectinatus. Measures suggested to restore SAV communities in such a lake should aim at reducing concentrations of total suspended solids at the point of inflow by a factor of three to four and limiting fetch- and navigation-related resuspension.

LAKE ROTOMA	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												A preliminary scuba survey of oligotrophic Lake Rotoma in 1972 revealed a vegetation mainly composed of native hydrophytes in which exotics were at an early stage of colonization. In 1973 the presence of species was recorded in 5708 quadrats (625 cm2) at 1 m intervals along a total of 50 line transects placed systematically around the lake. Water depth was measured, and quadrat cover and substrate type were subjectively estimated. Species frequency calculations showed that the dominant vegetation pattern was a characean meadow of Chara fibrosa f. acanthopitys (A.Br.) R.D.W., Nitella leptostachys var. leonhardii (R.D.W.) R.D.W., and N. pseudoflabellata var. mucosa (Nordst.) Bailey. The charophytes extended over a depth range of 1-17.5 m on a wide variety of substrates and gradients. Native vascular plants were absent from many transects, and had a depth range only from 0 to 4.5 m, with most occurring above 3.5 m. The low mixed community, found in shallow water less than 1.25 m in depth at the northeast end of the lake, provided this area with a high species diversity. Exotic hydrophytes had established in many areas around the lake. The distribution of Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss and Elodea canadensis Michx. appeared to coincide with boating access and fallen submerged trees over a depth range of 0-6.0 m, although much of the available habitat had not yet been exploited. Emergent species were most abundant within the southwest inlet and also in the lagoons surrounding the lake where sheltered conditions and shallow gradients prevail.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1981	15	4					447	457		10.1080/00288330.1981.9515937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1981.9515937													WOS:A1981NG53000009
J	Liu, SH; Feng, AP; Liu, Y				Liu, Shihao; Feng, Aiping; Liu, Yan			Buried channels under the northern Bohai Sea: Evidence for a great Bohai Paleolake during the late MIS3	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												Buried channels are widespread on continental shelves and potentially record Quaternary glacial-interglacial environmental changes. The Bohai Sea, an epicontinental basin, is extraordinarily sensitive to such environmental changes, but the evolution of buried channels there remains poorly understood. Here, combined seismic and sedimentological data were used to investigate the evolution of buried channels in western Liaodong Bay, northern Bohai Sea. We identified over six sets of channels, up to 15 m thick and up to 4 km wide, at different horizons within a terrestrial bed formed during the late Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 between 35 and 30 kyr BP. Most of these channels are interpreted as incised valley systems of fluvial origin, with complex combinations of fill facies. They were truncated on their tops by transgressive ravinements, which formed during baselevel rise. Our findings suggest that these incised valley systems formed and evolved over multiple cycles of incision/filling controlled by the alternation of subaerially exposed and drowned environments during the late MIS3, and the contemporaneous shoreline advanced and retreated repeatedly within our study area. Given that sea level during this period was -10-45 m lower than the buried channels in our study area, the evolution of the multiple channels appears to be dominated by lake level fluctuations rather than global eustasy. We hypothesize that during late MIS3, the Bohai Basin transformed into a great paleolake (>39000 km2) as a result of falling sea levels, separating it from the Pacific Ocean, which is also supported by the microfossils in a core collected from the more basinward location. Our stratigraphic evidence also suggests that lake level fluctuations were intensive and of different amplitudes (-5 to >15 m), which is consistent with climate proxy records. These fluctuations in the paleolake level were presumably a response to and therefore could provide implications for reconstructing regional climate dynamics.

While previous investigations of coastal sabkhas in Qatar have mainly focused on dolomitization processes, presented here is one of the first studies reconstructing facies changes and coastal formation in great detail. In the sabkha of Al-Kharayej (Gulf of Salwa), fifteen different facies types were distinguished based on twelve sediment cores, two trenches, as well as grain-size distribution, X-ray powder diffraction, thin section and microfossil analyses. Age estimates were based on seventy-eight C-14-AMS and optically stimulated luminescence data. The sabkha parasequence comprises pre-transgressive dune sands, a thin, transgressive layer of reworked dune material, a mid-energy open-coast to open-lagoon facies, a low-energy lagoon facies, saline lake facies (salina: swallow-tail gypsum and gypsum mush) and the supratidal sabkha characterized by diagenetic overprinting (buckled gypsum crusts and halite crust). Transgressive marine flooding created open-coast to open-lagoon sedimentation after ca 7000 cal yr bp, followed by initial spit formation at the northern sabkha end at the beginning of the relative sea-level highstand (6000 cal yr bp). This main outer spit prograded southward and a more narrow, low-energy spit, diverted landward, closing a small lagoon in the northern sabkha 4500 to 4000 cal yr bp. The falling relative sea-level and longshore drift intensified the southward extension and widening of the main spit, and the main lagoon became more shallow. At 2000 to 1500 cal yr bp, the outer spit had almost closed the main lagoon, leading to salina and, finally, sabkha conditions. It is shown how specific local conditions (coastline orientation; wind, wave, tidal energy, longshore drift; depositional relief; sediment sources) created a spit-controlled sabkha that is genetically distinct from the classical model of shore-perpendicular accumulation of coarser sediment during high tides or storms.

J	MILBRINK, G				MILBRINK, G			OLIGOCHAETES AND WATER-POLLUTION IN 2 DEEP NORWEGIAN LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Aquatic Oligochaeta	1991	TALLINN, ESTONIA					Analyses of the oligochaete fauna of two of the deepest lakes in Scandinavia - the Norwegian lakes Mjosa (450 m) and Tyrifjorden (295 m), revealed a totally different species composition in the deep profundal compared with the upper profundal - in contact with the nutrient-enriched epilimnion. In both lakes a pronounced thermal stratification develops in the summer, thus the epilimnion receiving gross organic pollution behaves differently from the profundal. The lakes are each effectively divided into two bodies of water with limited water exchange between them, i.e. one major oligotrophic body and one minor more nutrient-rich. Since the 1950s both lakes have been exposed to heavy pollution of various kinds. In Lake Mjosa in 1975 and 1976 unpleasant algal blooms of the blue-green alga Oscillatoria bornetii fa. tenuis occurred. Bottom samples obtained at the same time revealed that the deep central bottoms of the lake were totally dominated by oligotrophic oligochaete indicators, i.e. by Stylodrilus heringianus and Spirosperma ferox, while the fauna of the upper profundal in the vicinity of domestic and agricultural sewage outfalls, wood processing industries, etc. was dominated by Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Tubifex tubifex in great abundance, indicating enriched conditions. Several other species indicative of eutrophy, were absent, most of them belonging to the genus Potamothrix. A fairly similar situation exists in Lake Tyrifjorden, where, for instance, in the shallow bay of Steinsfjorden - heavily eutrophied by agricultural wastes - blooms of blue-green algae have caused problems from time to time. The same oligochaete communities as in Lake Mjosa distinguish the central oligotrophic bottoms from the regionally more enriched upper profundal. The likely reasons for an intact profundal oligochaete fauna are great volumes of oxygen-rich hypolimnic water of low temperature and a high bottom/lake surface area ratio.																			0018-8158					MAR 25	1994	278	1-3					213	222		10.1007/BF00142329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00142329													WOS:A1994NE00500025

THE ROLE OF NITROGEN-FIXATION IN NITROGEN REQUIREMENT OF PHYTOPLANKTON	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In situ nitrogen fixation and ammonium and nitrate uptake by phytoplankton in Lake Kizaki, in which the blue green algae, Anabaena spp. was the dominant species in summer, were measured using the nitrogen 15 tracer method in 1983. Nitrogen fixation rate was detectable from July to September and its maximum was reached in August. Nitrogen fixation rates were generally less than 10% of those of ammonium uptakes, though the fixation rates at the deepest part of the trophogenic zone was fairly similar to those of ammonium uptake in August. In this layer, the nitrogen fixation process was an important nitrogen source for phytoplankton. The effect of ammonium and nitrate on nitrogen fixation was investigated. In the presence of ammonium at 1-2 .mu.g atom N .cntdot. l-1, nitrogen fixation was completely suppressed, while nitrate did not affect nitrogen fixation where it was present even in relatively high concentration (above 10 .mu.g atom N .cntdot. l-1). Ammonium was preferentially used by phytoplankton, so that the in situ ammonium uptake rate where concentration was 1-2 .mu.g atom N .cntdot. l-1 was almost sufficient to meet the nitrogen requirement of phytoplankton. In such situation, nitrogen uptake by fixation should not be required. However, the nitrate uptake was often suppressed with ammonium at concentrations less than 0.5 .mu.g atom N .cntdot. l-1, and hence the nitrogen requirement of phytoplankton would be satisfied by nitrogen fixation, but not with nitrate even at high concentration.																			0003-9136					MAR	1988	112	1					43	54																WOS:A1988M984300003

Efficient Low-pH Iron Removal by a Microbial Iron Oxide Mound Ecosystem at Scalp Level Run	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a major environmental problem affecting tens of thousands of kilometers of waterways worldwide. Passive bioremediation of AMD relies on microbial communities to oxidize and remove iron from the system; however, iron oxidation rates in AMD environments are highly variable among sites. At Scalp Level Run (Cambria County, PA), first-order iron oxidation rates are 10 times greater than at other coal-associated iron mounds in the Appalachians. We examined the bacterial community at Scalp Level Run to determine whether a unique community is responsible for the rapid iron oxidation rate. Despite strong geochemical gradients, including a >10-fold change in the concentration of ferrous iron from 57.3 mg/liter at the emergence to 2.5 mg/liter at the base of the coal tailings pile, the bacterial community composition was nearly constant with distance from the spring outflow. Scalp Level Run contains many of the same taxa present in other AMD sites, but the community is dominated by two strains of Ferrovum myxofaciens, a species that is associated with high rates of Fe(II) oxidation in laboratory studies. IMPORTANCE Acid mine drainage pollutes more than 19,300 km of rivers and streams and 72,000 ha of lakes worldwide. Remediation is frequently ineffective and costly, upwards of $ 100 billion globally and nearly $ 5 billion in Pennsylvania alone. Microbial Fe(II) oxidation is more efficient than abiotic Fe(II) oxidation at low pH (P. C. Singer and W. Stumm, Science 167: 1121- 1123, 1970, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.167.3921.1121). Therefore, AMD bioremediation could harness microbial Fe(II) oxidation to fuel more-cost-effective treatments. Advances will require a deeper understanding of the ecology of Fe(II)-oxidizing microbial communities and the factors that control their distribution and rates of Fe(II) oxidation. We investigated bacterial communities that inhabit an AMD site with rapid Fe(II) oxidation and found that they were dominated by two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Ferrovum myxofaciens, a taxon associated with high laboratory rates of iron oxidation. This research represents a step forward in identifying taxa that can be used to enhance costeffective AMD bioremediation.

J	Smith, ND; Pérez-Arlucea, M				Smith, Norman D.; Perez-Arlucea, Marta			Natural levee deposition during the 2005 flood of the Saskatchewan River	GEOMORPHOLOGY												In summer 2005, a controlled flood of the Saskatchewan River (east-central Saskatchewan, Canada) resulted in general floodplain inundation and extensive natural levee deposition along a 60-km reach extending from 40 km below the E.B. Campbell dam to Cumberland Lake. Levee crests along channel banks were inundated for up to 7 weeks in some areas of the floodplain. New deposits on levee crests varied from 0 to 70 cm in thickness, displaying large variations both along reach and in opposing sites across channels. Mean grain sizes, mainly silt and very fine sand, likewise varied considerably among sample sites. Pre- and post-flood surveys of channel cross sections along the flooded reach permitted assessments of relationships between channel-area changes and patterns of levee sedimentation in this system in which virtually all new flood sediment was derived by channel scour. Results show that both net deposition and net erosion occurred within the channel cross sections, but that on average, net channel enlargement of 4.2% prevailed over the entire survey reach when weighted by cross-section size. Over the 60-km flooded reach, zones of thick levee deposition occur at or just downstream of two areas of major channel enlargement, and an intermediate zone of thin levee deposits is associated with an intermediate area of net channel aggradation. This bimodal distribution of flood-deposit thickness is inferred to have resulted from differences in sediment supply produced locally by the different extents of channel-perimeter erosion. Two other factors-(1) position of interfacial zones between clear floodbasin water and turbid channel water, and (2) difference in pre-flood levee heights-contributed to the poor correspondence in thickness and grain size between opposing levees at some sites. Additional features of the new levee deposits, including increases in transverse slopes, abrupt basinward fining, and paucity of deposition in distal areas due to clear floodbasin waters, are characteristic of strong front loading that results when suspended sediment production is restricted to channel erosion processes.

Although deposited in lacustrine environment, the lack of fossils in these rocks hampers determining whether the stromatolites formed in freshwater or saline conditions. To address this problem, and in an attempt to identify criteria to distinguish differences of freshwater and saline conditions, we studied the laminae microfabrics, stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios, rare earth element patterns and biomarkers of the stromatolites. These stromatolites can be divided into fenestral stromatolites and agglutinated stromatolites. The fabric of fenestral stromatolites is formed by microcrystalline carbonate enclosing spar-cemented, angular crystal traces. Essentially, this fabric is interpreted as pseudomorph after former formed evaporite crystals. Faecal pellets identical to that of the present-day brine shrimp Artemia, lack of other eukaryotic fossils, and stable isotopic signals point to a shallow, evaporation-dominated hypersaline lake setting. Covariation of carbon and oxygen isotopes indicates hydrologically closed conditions of the Miocene lake on northern Tibetan Plateau. However, if compared to other lacustrine carbonates of the Wudaoliang Group, the high delta C-13 values of the investigated Wudaoliang stromatolites reveal an additional photosynthetic effect during the deposition of the stromatolites. Furthermore, although no direct evidence is available from field observations and microfabrics, a positive europium anomaly of Wudaoliang stromatolites indicates that a palaeo-hydrothermal inflow system had existed in the outcrop area. These new results favour a hypersaline lake setting subject to hot spring inflow for the Wudaoliang stromatolites, in contrast to earlier interpretations suggesting a freshwater lake setting (e.g. Yi et al., Journal of Mineralogy and Petrology 28: 106-113, 2008; Zeng et al., Journal of Mineralogy and Petrology 31: 111-119, 2011). This approach may be appropriate for other lacustrine, unfossiliferous microbialites in settings where the environmental conditions are difficult to determine.

Assessing the environmental and dispersal controls on Fagus grandifolia distributions in the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim This paper assesses the relative importance of environmental filtering and dispersal limitations as controls on the western range limit of Fagus grandifolia, a common mesic late-successional tree species in the eastern United States. We also test for differences in species-environment relationships between range-edge populations of F. grandifolia in eastern Wisconsin and core populations in Michigan. Because environmental conditions between the states differ moderately, while in Michigan dispersal presumably no longer limits F. grandifolia distributions, F. grandifolia offers a classic case study for biogeographers, foresters, and palaeoecologists interested in understanding processes governing species range limits. Location Wisconsin and Michigan, USA. Taxon Fagus grandifolia. Methods This study combines historical datasets of F. grandifolia from the Public Land Survey, environmental covariates from soil maps and historical climate data, three spatial scenarios of dispersal limitation, and five species distribution models (SDMs). We test dispersal limitation and environmental filtering hypotheses by assessing SDM transferability between core and edge populations, measuring the importance of dispersal and environmental predictors, and using a residual autocovariate model to test for spatial processes not represented by these predictors. Results Fagus grandifolia presence was best predicted by total snowfall in Michigan and by dispersal, summer precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration (PET) in Wisconsin. Following the addition of dispersal as a predictor, most Wisconsin models improved and spatial autocorrelation effects largely disappeared. Transferability between core and edge populations was moderate to low. Main conclusions Both environmental and dispersal limitations appear to govern the western range limit of F. grandifolia. Species-environment relationships differ between range-edge and core populations, suggesting either stronger environmental filtering at the range edge or fine-scale, spatially varying interactions between environmental factors governing moisture availability in core populations. Although lakes, like Lake Michigan, both moderate regional climates and act as dispersal barriers, these effects can be disentangled through the joint analysis of SDMs and historic observational datasets.					; Williams, John/KBC-5275-2024	Williams, John/0000-0001-6046-9634; Goring, Simon/0000-0002-2700-4605; Seeley, Megan/0000-0003-1945-1162													0305-0270	1365-2699				FEB	2019	46	2					405	419		10.1111/jbi.13491	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13491													WOS:000458273300013

Unraveling the complex local-scale flows influencing ozone patterns in the southern Great Lakes of North America	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												This study examines the complexity of various processes influencing summertime ozone levels in the southern Great Lakes region of North America. Results from the Border Air Quality and Meteorology (BAQS-Met) field campaign in the summer of 2007 are examined with respect to land-lake differences and local meteorology using a large array of ground-based measurements, aircraft data, and simulation results from a high resolution (2.5 km) regional air-quality model, AURAMS. Analyses of average ozone mixing ratio from the entire BAQS-Met intensive campaign period support previous findings that ozone levels are higher over the southern Great Lakes than over the adjacent land. However, there is great heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of surface ozone over the lakes, particularly over Lake Erie during the day, with higher levels located over the southwestern end of the lake. Model results suggest that some of these increased ozone levels are due to local emission sources in large nearby urban centers. While an ozone reservoir layer is predicted by the AURAMS model over Lake Erie at night, the land-lake differences in ozone mixing ratios are most pronounced during the night in a shallow inversion layer of about 200 m above the surface. After sunrise, these differences have a limited effect on the total mass of ozone over the lakes and land during the day, though they do cause elevated ozone levels in the lake-breeze air in some locations. The model also predicts a mean vertical circulation during the day with an updraft over Detroit-Windsor and downdraft over Lake St. Clair, which transports ozone up to 1500 m above ground and results in high ozone over the lake. Oscillations in ground-level ozone mixing ratios were observed on several nights and at several ground monitoring sites, with amplitudes of up to 40 ppbv and time periods of 15-40 min. Several possible mechanisms for these oscillations are discussed, but a complete understanding of their causes is not possible given current data and knowledge.

J	Arenas, C; Alonso-Zarza, AM; Pardo, G				Arenas, C; Alonso-Zarza, AM; Pardo, G			Dedolomitization and other early diagenetic processes in Miocene lacustrine deposits, Ebro Basin (Spain)	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A variety of meteoric diagenetic features reveal the development of a syngenetic karst on lacustrine deposits of the Ebro Basin. Diagenetic processes that operated on lacustrine laminated and stromatolitic carbonates include the following. (1) A first syndepositional stage with processes such as dolomitization, desiccation and related breccia formation and sulphate precipitation, either as lenticular gypsum crystals or nodules. This stage took place under progressive evaporation due to lake level fall, when the previous carbonate deposits became exposed as a supra-littoral fringe surrounding saline mud flats of adjacent sulphate depositional environments. (2) A second early diagenetic stage in which processes such as sulphate dissolution and collapse brecciation, dedolomitization, calcite spar cementation and silicification occurred as a result of meteoric water input that caused a progressive rise in lake level. Light isotopic compositions (delta(13)C and delta(18)O) of diagenetic calcites, versus heavier compositions in primary laminated and stromatolitic limestones, confirm a meteoric influence. The syngenetic karst is best developed at the boundary between two allostratigraphic units and coincided with one of the extensive stages of sulphate deposition at the end of the Early Miocene. The karst facies occurred in an area that was a low-relief barrier that separated two sites of sulphate deposition during low lake levels, This indicates that the karat development was controlled by topographic changes within the basin and record a shift from arid to wetter climatic conditions, as suggested by the overlying freshwater carbonate deposits. The presence of diagenetic features such as those described in the central Ebro Basin affecting saline lacustrine carbonates is relevant because they can be used as indicators of subaerial exposure periods in terrestrial environments and they also reveal important palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic events of basinal extent.

The Usak and Cure basins accumulated a thick fluvio-lacustrine fill in which three distinct volcanic edifices (Elmadag, Itecektepe and Beydagi) and their deposits can overlap with each other and with the sediments produced by the background sedimentation. In addition, complete facies architectures of small-volume (monogenetic) volcanoes have been recognised in association with the three large complex (polygenetic) volcanoes providing a complex mixed siliciclastic and volcaniclastic basin infill in the respective basins where volcanism took place. All three volcanic centres display a complex succession of effusive and explosive volcanisms and their reworked deposits, with abundant evidences of magma-water interaction such as peperites for non-explosive magma-water interaction with the lacustrine water-saturated sediment and standing water body in a large alkaline lake. During the constructive phase, proximal successions of pyroclastic flows, pyroclastic falls, and rarely surge deposits are associated with distally-emplaced debris flow deposits, sometimes of mixed volcanogenic and terrestrial origins, and are interbedded with lacustrine sediments of the may Group. All three volcanic centres then experienced a phase of volcano growth and degradation between 17 and 15 Ma ago, most likely related to a combination of tectonic movements on NE-SW-trending basement faults, which triggered multiple flank collapses and volcanic debris avalanches (Elmadag), and voluminous ignimbrite eruptions that triggered caldera formation (ltecektepe and Beydagi volcanic centres). Lacustrine conditions persisted during the destruction and post-destruction stages of the volcano's evolution, as evidenced by indications of magma-water interactions within the central collapse structures, which also contain uplifted basement metamorphic rocks now exhumed in their eroded cores.

J	Coniglio, M; Myrow, P; White, T				Coniglio, M; Myrow, P; White, T			Stable carbon and oxygen isotope evidence of cretaceous sea-level fluctuations recorded in septarian concretions from Pueblo, Colorado, USA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Limestone concretions in the Blue Hill Member of the Carlile Formation (middle Middle Turonian) exposed in the Lake Pueblo State Park, Colorado, U.S.A., range in size from 20-cm-diameter, approximately spherical forms to flattened spheroids >2 m in width and >1 m in height. The earliest matrix and septarian calcite cement, with delta(13C) and delta(18)O values ranging mostly from -18 parts per thousand to -8 parts per thousand (PDB) and -3 parts per thousand to -8 parts per thousand (PDB), respectively, precipitated from diluted seawater during shallow burial where sulfate reduction largely controlled porewater bicarbonate composition. In contrast, the latest septarian cements exhibit very depleted delta(18)O values (similar to -16 parts per thousand) with delta(13)C values approaching values of 1 parts per thousand to 3 parts per thousand, reflecting a strong meteoric-water component to pore fluids. Overall, delta(13)C and delta(18)O values are inversely covariant. Concretion matrix calcite and septarian cements precipitated from mixtures of modified marine and meteoric fluids. Pore-water reversals resulted from sea-level fluctuations leading up to and associated with the formation of a sequence boundary, or possibly the development of parasequences near the top of the Blue Hill Member Relative sea-level falls caused pore-water freshening as the coastal mining zone migrated seaward. Similarly, modified marine-derived pore waters replaced fresher pore fluids accompanying subsequent marine flooding. Carbonate cements precipitated during this active hydrologic history recorded the isotopic characteristics of their parent fluids. Negative delta(18)O values of the meteoric end-member calcite compositions suggest deFivation from high-altitude precipitation in the Sevier highlands to the west. Septarian cements in concretions, despite their enclosure in relatively impermeable host sediment, can act as sensitive indicators of relative sea-level fluctuations.																			1073-130X					MAY	2000	70	3	A				700	714		10.1306/2DC40931-0E47-11D7-8643000102C1865D	http://dx.doi.org/10.1306/2DC40931-0E47-11D7-8643000102C1865D													WOS:000087328900023
J	Potvin, F; Bertrand, N				Potvin, F; Bertrand, N			Leaving forest strips in large clearcut landscapes of boreal forest: A management scenario suitable for wildlife?	FORESTRY CHRONICLE												Riparian forest strips (RS) along lakes and streams have been incorporated in regulations on clearcuts to protect water quality and fish habitat. As well, upland strips (US) are used to limit the size of clearcut patches. We conducted a three-year study to evaluate if RS and US between adjacent cutovers in large clearcut landscapes could be useful for certain terrestrial wildlife. Our study was conducted in southcentral Quebec on six landscapes (23-256 km(2)) originating from black spruce (Picea mariana) forests that were recently logged (less than or equal to 9 years). Residual uncut forest, mostly strips (width = 51-132 m), made up 31% of the productive forest area within these landscapes. RS and US were suitable habitat for red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and many species of birds including spruce grouse (Falcipennis canadensis). They provided marginal habitat for snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) and were not preferred by moose (Alces alces) over clearcut areas in winter. One bird species, bay-breasted warbler (Dendroica castanea), was absent in forest strips during the last year. We concluded that leaving RS and US is a management scenario that enables maintaining certain wildlife species within clearcut landscapes, but that larger residual forest patches are needed to accommodate area-sensitive and forest-interior species. A portion of these patches should be allowed to develop into mature and overmature stages for old-growth forest species. Green tree and dead tree retention should also be incorporated in logging practices to accommodate species that need snags for nesting or feeding. In areas where wildlife use has a high priority, large clearcuts should be intermixed with dispersed patch cutting in order to gain social acceptance.																			0015-7546	1499-9315				JAN-FEB	2004	80	1					44	53		10.5558/tfc80044-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc80044-1													WOS:000220659900047
J	Bizina, EV				Bizina, EV			Predators, resources and trophic cascades in the regulation of plankton communities in freshwater oligotrophic lakes	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												The relative strength of "top-down" versus "bottom-up" control of plankton community structure and biomass in two small oligotrophic lakes (with and without fish), located near the Polar circle (Russia), has been investigated for two years, 1996 and 1997. The comparative analyses of zooplankton biomass and species abundance showed strong negative effect of fish, stickeback (Pungitius pungitius L.), On the zooplankton community species, size structure and biomass of particular prey species but no effect on the biomass of the whole trophic level. An intensive predation in Verkhneye lake has lead to: 1) sixfold decline in biomass of large cladoceran Holopedium gibberum comparing to the lake lacking predator, 2) shift in the size mode in zooplankton community and the replacement of the typical large grazers by small species - Bosmina longirostris and rotifers. Their abundance and biomass even increased, demonstrating the stimulating effect of fish on the "inefficient" and unprofitable prey organisms. The analysis of contributions of different factors into the cladoceran's birth rate changes was applied to demonstrate the relative impact of predators and resources on zooplankton abundance. An occasional introduction of the stickleback to Vodoprovodnoye lake (the reference lake in 1996) in summer 1997 lead to drastic canges in this ecosystem: devastating decrease of zooplankton biomass and complete elimination of five previously dominant grazer species. The abundance of edible phytoplankton was slightly higher in the lake with fish in 1996 and considerably higher in the lake where fish has appeared in 1997 showing the prevailing "top-down" control of phytoplankton in oligotrophic ecosystem. The reasons of trophic cascade appearance in oligotrophic lakes are also discussed.

Late-Holocene to recent evolution of Lake Patria, South Italy: An example of a coastal lagoon within a Mediterranean delta system	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Lake Patria is a mesoaline coastal lagoon that develops along the coastal zone of the Volturno River plain (Campania, South Italy). The lagoon is a saline to brackish water body, ca. 2.0 long, and 1.5 km wide, with an average water depth of 1.5 m, reaching a maximum of ca. 3.0 m. The freshwater input into the lagoon is provided by a series of fresh to brackish water channels and small springs, landwards, while a permanent connection with the Tyrrhenian Sea is provided by a channel, 1.5 km long and a few meters wide. Drilling data from 12 boreholes acquired in the study area indicate that Lake Patria is a man-modified remnant of a larger lagoonal area that developed during the last millennia along the Campania coastal zone within an alluvial delta system at the mouth of the paleo-Volturno River. Sedimentological and stratigraphic analyses of drill cores suggest that the lower Volturno delta plain developed in the last 6000 years. Depositional conditions during this period were dominated by flood-plain and alluvial plain settings, with transition to coastal bars and associated back-barrier coastal lagoons. Lake Patria started evolving at an early stage of the Volturno delta plain formation as a consequence of foreshore deposits damming-up by littoral drift. The first marine layers display a radiocarbon age of ca. 4.8 ka BP and overlie a substrate represented by volcaniclastic deposits, originated by the Campi Flegrei, and associated paleosols. The lagoonal succession cored at Lake Patria may be interpreted as the result of a dynamic equilibrium between marine influence and riverine input into the lagoonal system through time, and has been tentatively correlated with the major climatic changes that occurred during Mid-Late Holocene. Insights into the recentmost evolution of the coastal lagoon of lake Patria are provided by the GIS-based analysis of the physiographic changes of the region conducted on a series of historical topographic maps dating back to the early XVII century. Particularly, the superposition of historical cartography reveals the secular trends in the change of coastal environments and the role of human modification of natural habitats over the last 400 years.

One gravity core of 115 cm length, covering the last similar to 4000 cal BP, was analyzed for geochemical and biological parameters. High organic content at similar to 4000 cal BP and the coinciding presence of pyrite framboids until similar to 2000 cal BP point to hampered decomposition of organic material due to anoxic conditions within the lake sediments. At the same time sedimentological and biological proxies suggest a rather high lake level, but still similar to 5 m below the recent one, with less saline lake water due to enhanced monsoonal activity. During this time a change in the source of organic matter to lowered input of terrestrial components is observed. A rather quick shift to a dry environment with less monsoonal influence and a lake level similar to 15 m lower than today at similar to 2000 cal BP lead to the oxygenation of sediment the degradation of organic matter and the absence of pyrite. Oscillations of the lake level thereafter were of minor amplitude and not able to establish anoxia at the lake bottom again. A wet spell between similar to 1500 cal BP and similar to 1150 cal BP is visible in proxies referring to catchment hydrology and the ostracod-based water depth transfer function gives only a slightly elevated lake level. The last similar to 300 years are characterized by low TOC and rising TN values reflecting enhanced nutrient supply and hence an advancing influence of human activity in the catchment. Decreasing TOC/TN values point to a complete shift to almost solely aquatic biomass production. These results show that hydrological variations in terms of lake level change based on monsoonal strength can be linked to redox conditions at the lake bottom of Nam Co. Comparison with other archives over larger parts of the Tibetan Plateau and beyond exhibits a rather homogeneous climatic pattern throughout the late Holocene. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Late Quaternary vegetation, climate as well as lake-level changes and human occupation from Nitaya area in Hoshangabad District, southwestern Madhya Pradesh (India), based on pollen evidence	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The pollen record of a 2.4 m thick sediment profile from a lake deposit at Nitaya Village, which has been named as Nitaya Lake, Hoshangabad District, southwestern Madhya Pradesh (India), displays a chronological record of vegetation, climate and lake-level changes as well as anthropogenic activities as a consequence of fluctuating trend of monsoon during the last 12,700 years. The study revealed that between 12,700 and 7150 yr BP, tree savanna vegetation existed with the dominance of grasses, Cheno/Am, Asteraceae as well as scattered Acacia, Ailanthus excelsa, Madhuca indica, and Bombax ceiba under a cool and dry climate with reduced monsoonal precipitation. A moderate-sized lake existed in the region prior to the Holocene. Human activity in the form of incipient cereal-based agriculture practice was also present. Between 7150 and 4657 yr BP, the tree savanna vegetation was transformed into an open mixed tropical deciduous forest as a result of expansion of prominent deciduous trees under warm and moderately humid climate, which could be attributed to an increase in monsoon precipitation. The lake size increased comparatively, and acceleration in agriculture practice took place. Later, between 4657 and 2807 yr BP with more or less similar floristic composition, the open mixed tropical deciduous forest continued in the region under a warm and less humid climate owing to weak monsoon precipitation. The lake became smaller in size while agriculture practice continued at the same pace. Subsequently, between 2807 and 1125 yr BP, mixed deciduous forest succeeded the open mixed tropical deciduous forest, which is indicated by the enhancement of M. indica, Acacia, Grewia, Symplocos, Shorea robusta, etc. and the debut of Tectona grandis around 1965 yr BP under a warm and more humid climate owing to an increase in monsoon precipitation. The lake-level remained unchanged but agricultural practice intensified. From 1125 yr BP to the present day, the mixed tropical deciduous forest became sparser and less diversified in composition, and consequently was transformed into open vegetation under a warm and comparatively less humid climate, equivalent to present. The lake also became smaller, although agriculture increased. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

CHROMATOGRAPHIC CHARACTERIZATION OF CAROTENOID PIGMENTS	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												The pigments of the summer zooplankton of the sandpit Lake Maarsseveen [Netherlands] and of the mountain lake Lac Pavin [France] were investigated by paper chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Potential possibilities of HPLC as a routine tool in carotenoid analysis are discussed. On a dry weight basis carotenoid content of the vividly-pigmented Lac Pavin zooplankton was about 4.5 times as large as that of the Lake Maarsseveen zooplankton. In contrast to Lac Pavin where carotenoid content of the zooplankton was made up of 80-90% keto-carotenoids, in Lake Maarsseveen carotenoid content of the zooplankton comprised only 40-60% keto-carotenoids. In Lac Pavin the zooplankton, mainly Acanthodiaptomus denticornis (Crustacea, Copepoda), contained hydroxy-echinenone and astaxanthin as major pigments; associated with .beta.-carotene, cryptoxanthin and 9 unidentified keto-carotenoids and/or keto-carotenoid esters. In addition trace amounts of zeaxanthin and/or esterified lutein were detected, probably of dietary origin. In Lake Maarsseveen the zooplankton, mainly Daphnia longispina (Crustacea, Cladocera), contained .beta.-carotene; echinenone and astaxanthin as major pigments; associated with an unidentified carotene-like pigment and 2 unidentified keto-carotenoids and/or keto-carotenoid esters. Considerable amounts of (partly esterified) fucoxanthin were detected, most likely derived from the algal diet contained in the animals'' digestive tracts. Qualitative and quantitative aspects of carotenoid pigmentation, together with the occurrence of typical algal xanthophylls derived from the digestive tracts of the zooplankton, suggest a more elaborate oxidative metabolism of dietary carotenoids in the Lac Pavin zooplankton.

Tributary impacts on nearshore surface water quality detected during a late summer circumnavigation along the 20 m isopleth of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water quality along the 20 m depth isopleth of Lake Ontario was assessed using continuous sampling at a depth of 1.5 m by drawing water through the hull of a ship into a ferry box containing sensors. Water temperature, specific conductivity, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and phytoplankton groupings (by pigment-specific fluorometry) were monitored continuously over the 4-day route and water was collected for determination of size-fractionated extracted chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration at hourly intervals. Total (>0.2 mu m) extracted Chl a ranged from 1.91 to 6.32 mu g/L with an average (+/- SD) of 3.19 +/- 0.87 mu g/L: picoplankton (0.2-2 mu m) represented the greatest contribution (43 +/- 11%) to the Chl a, followed by the nanoplankton (2-20 mu m; 31 +/- 9%). and the microplankton (>20 mu m; 26 +/- 8%). Among the phytoplankton, the Heterokontophyta and Pyrrophyta represented the majority (61.4%) of the in situ total Chl a measured along the entire 20 m isopleth, followed by the phycoerythrin-rich Cyanobacteria and Cryptophyta group (18.2%), the phycocyanin-rich Cyanobacteria group (17.8%), and the Chlorophyta and Euglenophyta group (2.6%). Peaks of phytoplankton in the surface water corresponded to nearshore water adjacent to known sources of high phytoplankton (e.g. tributaries) and were associated with detectable changes in water quality, as indicated by CDOM, temperature, and specific conductivity. This investigative survey demonstrates the utility of using a ferry box for continuous water quality measurements in the nearshore environment of the Great Lakes and opens further applications for wide-scale assessment of watershed influences on nearshore water quality.

The Importance of Natural Variability in Lake Areas on the Detection of Permafrost Degradation: A Case Study in the Yukon Flats, Alaska	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Long-term lake area change has previously been measured to detect the temporal rate and spatial extent of permafrost degradation. However, the natural intra- and interannual variability of lake areas has not been considered explicitly and quantitatively, which can substantially interfere with the detection of long-term lake area change associated with permafrost degradation. In order to better understand the natural background variability of lake areas, we used Landsat 7 images obtained on 11 dates from 1999 to 2002 to quantify the intra- and interannual lake area variability for a 4224 km(2) study area within the Yukon Flats, Alaska. Total lake areas ranged from 179 km(2) (22 August 1999) to 326 km(2) (6 June 2000). Even within a single year (year 2000), the total lake area decreased by 42 per cent from 6 June to 16 August, well exceeding the previously reported trends for long-term decrease (14% and 18%) for the Yukon Flats. Both intra- and interannual area variability in August and September were smaller than in June and July, suggesting that images from later in summer are more reliable for detecting long-term change in lake area. Variability of no-closure lakes was twice that of closed-basin lakes. Intra-annual area changes in closed-basin lakes can be explained by the intra-annual water balance, defined as cumulative precipitation minus evaporation between two consecutive dates within the same year. For a given period, the total lake area was correlated more strongly with the water balance since the preceding October than with the water balance in the preceding 12 months. Spatial heterogeneity in the intra-annual area change of individual lakes was observed, which might be caused by different topographical, geological and permafrost characteristics around and beneath the lakes.

CH4 concentrations in beaver pond and lake ice ranged between 0.3-150 mmol m(-3) and 3.1-56.2 mu mol m(-3), respectively. The corresponding CO concentrations showed no significant differences between the two lakes. They varied between 50 and 250 mu mol m(-3). These CO concentrations are some of the highest determined in any aquatic system. The differences in CH4 concentrations between lake and pond can be explained by the differences in production and microbial oxidation rates between the two systems. No explanation can be given for the similar CO concentrations. Supersaturation factors for CO were 660+/-130 and 630+/-330, and 65-35000 and 0.6-13 for CH4 in the ice of the beaver pond and Troy Lake, respectively. When digging into the beaver pond ice, a continuous flow of bubbles with 0.32+/-0.06 vol% CH4, 2.2+/-0.3 vol% CO2, and 482+/-98 ppb CO coming out of the slash ice for about 20-30 minutes was noticed. Wintertime flux estimates of CH4 and CO showed that they represent at minimum 6.4 % and 2.2 % of that of the summer. It has to be noted that these wintertime fluxes will mostly be released to the atmosphere during the time of snowmelt, thus a limited time period of weeks.

We used a combination of tower-and aircraft-based eddy covariance measurements to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of CO2, latent, and sensible heat fluxes along with MODIS NDVI, and were able to scale the aircraft-based CO2 fluxes to the 1802km(2) Barrow Peninsula region. During typical 2006 summer conditions, the midday hourly CO2 flux over the region was -2.04 x 10(5) kgCO(2)h(-1). The CO2 fluxes among the interstitial tundra, Ancient, and Old VDTLBs, as well as between the Medium and Young VDTLBs were not significantly different. Combined, the interstitial tundra and Old and Ancient VDTLBs represent similar to 67% of the Barrow Peninsula surface area, accounting for similar to 59% of the regional flux signal. Although the Medium and Young VDTLBs represent similar to 11% of the surface area, they account for a large portion, similar to 35%, of the total regional flux. The remaining similar to 22% of the surface area are lakes and contributed the remaining similar to 6% of the total regional flux. Previous studies treated vegetated areas of the region as a single surface type with measurements from a few study sites; doing so could underestimate the regional flux by similar to 22%. Here, we demonstrate that aircraft-based systems have the ability to cover large spatial scales while measuring the turbulent fluxes across a number of surfaces and combined with ground-and satellite-based measurements provide a valuable tool for both scaling and validation of regional-scale fluxes.					; Oechel, Walter/F-9361-2010	Zulueta, Rommel/0000-0002-2441-8845; Oechel, Walter/0000-0002-3504-026X													1354-1013	1365-2486				SEP	2011	17	9					2781	2802		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02433.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02433.x													WOS:000293399000002

The extreme indices are based on precipitation and temperature and are inspected for present (1981-2005) and future periods - near- (2031-2055) and far-future (2071-2095) - to assess the long-term climate change under the representative concentration pathway RCP8.5. Projected changes are analyzed for three different model ensembles. These ensembles are based on CORDEX-Central Asia (ENS_CAS, four ensemble members) and CORDEX-East Asia (ENS_EAS, six ensemble members), and a combination of both (ENS, ten ensemble members) for our study area centered over high mountain Asia, called Central East Asia (CEAS). For precipitation indices, an increase of consecutive dry days (CDD) in ENS_EAS and a slight to moderate decrease in northern parts in ENS_CAS during near-future is observed. Consecutive wet days (CWD), very heavy precipitation events (R20mm), maximum one-day precipitation (RX1day), and very wet days (R95p) are projected to increase in most areas. All indices show a further intensification towards the end of the century over large parts of the domain, e.g., + 7.8% / +5.6 days for CDD, + 96.6% / +0.26 days for R20mm, and + 19.7% for RX1day as median of ENS over CEAS. For temperature indices, the ensembles project a strong increase over the high mountain regions and southern parts for consecutive summer days (CSU, + 108.5% / +38.3 days), heat wave duration index (HWDI, + 1379.1% / +91.37 days), and the percentage of very hot days (TX90p, + 391.1% / +34.54 days). Accordingly, the number of consecutive frost days (CFD, -43.7% / -25.2 days) and the percentage of very cold days (TX10p, -83.4% / -8.13 days) are projected to decrease. The first-time usage of CORDEX-CORE and the larger ensemble size by considering simulations from overlapping domains increase the robustness of the findings from earlier studies. However, some discrepancies in the projected changes prevail among the different RCMs being part of the two CORDEX-domains and in specific landscapes like complex mountainous or lake areas. These uncertainties may be tackled by further model development with improved land-surface processes and potentially higher spatial resolution.					; Ziegler, Katrin/KSM-5873-2024; Rai, Praveen/MGB-0987-2025; Disse, Markus/G-2809-2016; Abel, Daniel/AHH-9264-2022; Schaffhauser, Timo/LSL-3455-2024; Disse, Markus/S-3759-2019	Pollinger, Felix/0000-0002-9519-2433; Ziegler, Katrin/0000-0002-9152-3135; Schaffhauser, Timo/0000-0002-2553-0089; Disse, Markus/0000-0003-4620-575X; Abel, Daniel/0000-0001-9663-3248; Bangelesa, Freddy/0000-0001-6843-7776													0177-798X	1434-4483				JUL	2024	155	7					6015	6039		10.1007/s00704-024-04976-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-024-04976-w		MAY 2024											WOS:001214906000003
J	Portielje, R; Van der Molen, DT				Portielje, R; Van der Molen, DT			Relationships between eutrophication variables: from nutrient loading to transparency	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Interactions in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Waterbodies	AUG 03-08, 1998	BLOSSIN, GERMANY	Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Tech Univ Cottbus				Monitoring data obtained from 231 freshwater lakes and ponds in the Netherlands, covering the period 1980-1996, were used to analyse the relationships between (a) transparency and chlorophyll-a, and the effect of system characteristics on this relationship, (b) chlorophyll-a and nutrient concentrations, and the effect of biological variables and (c) nutrient concentrations and nutrient loading. (a) Chlorophyll-a imposes a maximum on water transparency, but deviations from this maximum can be large. Reducing chlorophyll-a, therefore, does not guarantee a sufficient improvement of transparency. Soil type and the average depth of a lake were shown to influence the relationship between chlorophyll-a and transparency. (b) The maximum ratios of both chlorophyll-a: total-P and chlorophyll-a: total-N were higher in systems dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria than in systems dominated by other algae, indicating the efficiency of the former group with respect to nutrients. In systems with an areal coverage with submersed macrophytes above 5%, concentrations of chlorophyll-a and nutrients were lower than in systems with lower coverages. The ratios between chlorophyll-a and nutrients were lower at coverages larger than 10%. This indicates both bottom-up and top-down control of algae by macrophytes. Grazing pressure by zooplankton was also found to lower the chlorophyll-a: nutrient ratios. (c) System specific linear relationships were found between the average concentrations of total-P and total-N in the incoming water and the summer mean concentration in the lake. This allows the assessment of admissible loads for individual lakes, with narrower confidence limits compared to traditional relationships based on combined data from many lakes. From the analysis, it is concluded that the chain of relationships from nutrient loading to transparency is complex, and depends on biological variables as well as system characteristics.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	408						375	387		10.1023/A:1017090931476	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017090931476													WOS:000084892400042

Lake Miwasin (LM) is a pilot-scale pit lake consisting of treated fine tailings overlayed with oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) blended with fresh surface water. In October 2021, the surface water contained a mean concentration of 1.33 +/- 0.04 mu g/L dissolved selenium (Se), slightly above the Canadian Council of Ministers of Environment water quality guideline for long-term protection of aquatic life (1 mu g Se/L). This study assessed the bioaccumulation of Se by the cladoceran Daphnia pulex under laboratory conditions through both aqueous and dietary exposure routes for comparison to field-collected specimens. In 12-day semi-static tests, lab-cultured D.pulex were exposed to water, and algae grown in media spiked with selenate. Results showed that Se bioaccumulation by lab-cultured D. pulex increased in all exposure treatments from days 5 to 12, with maximum Se concentrations of 3.08-3.47 mu g/g dry weight (dw) observed within the exposure range tested. Interestingly, lower Se bioaccumulation concentrations (1.26-1.58 mu g/g dw) were observed in the highest dissolved Se and dietary Se treatments, suggesting potential internal regulatory mechanisms. In addition, native D. pulex (LM) collected from Lake Miwasin and cultured in-house were exposed in 8-day semi-static tests to Lake Miwasin surface water and algae cultured in Lake Miwasin surface water. Selenium bioaccumulation in native D. pulex (LM) ranged from 2.00 to 2.04 mu g/g dw at day 8 and was not significantly different (p > 0.05) compared to Se concentrations in D. pulex collected from Lake Miwasin (2.15 +/- 0.28 mu g/g) in summer 2022.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2024	196	7							628	10.1007/s10661-024-12761-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-12761-5								38888677					WOS:001250809100002
J	Merritt, RW; Benbow, ME; Hudson, PL				Merritt, RW; Benbow, ME; Hudson, PL			Wetland macroinvertebrates of Prentiss Bay, Lake Huron, Michigan: Diversity and functional group composition	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												The Great Lakes support many fish and waterbirds that depend directly or indirectly on coastal wetlands during some portion of their life cycle. It is known that macroinvertebrates make up an important part of wetland food webs and ecosystem function; however, our understanding of species distribution within and among wetlands has only recently received attention. We investigated the macroinvertebrates of a freshwater marsh (Prentiss Bay) in the Les Chenaux Island Area of Northern Lake Huron, Michigan. Macroinvertebrate taxa diversity and functional feeding group composition were compared between two habitats. A shallow depositional habitat with higher vegetation diversity and little wave action was compared to a deeper erosional habitat with fewer plant species and more wave action. A total of 83 taxa were collected over the summer of 1996, representing two phyla (Arthropoda and Mollusca) and five classes (Arachnida, Bivalvia, Malacostraca, Gastropoda and Insecta). A total of 79 genera were identified, with 92% being insects (39 families composed of at least 73 genera). Of the total, 42 insect genera were common to both habitats, while relatively fewer were collected exclusively from the erosional compared the depositional habitat. When habitats were pooled, predators comprised about 50% of the functional group taxa, while gathering collectors and shredders each were about 20%. Filtering collectors and scrapers each represented < 10%. When comparing habitats, there was a relatively higher percentage of predators and shredders in the depositional habitat, while all other functional groups were lower. These data suggest that vegetation diversity, depth and wave action affect taxa composition and functional group organization of the Prentiss Bay marsh.

Results show major chronological variability in both terrestrial and algal communities during the transition between the last interglacial (Eemian) and the last glacial (early Wurm) periods. The end of the Eemian was marked by an expansion of Pinus on the slopes of the lake and by a diatom community consisting of planktonic and eutrophic species indicating falling lake levels. Early Wurm began with severe climatic degradation, characterized on the catchment by the sharp decline of the forest to the benefit of steppic species, and by the shallowing of the lake as indicated by the development of a larger littoral diatom community and the dominance in the planktonic community by Aulacoseira subarctica. Subsequently warming-up occurred, as indicated by the development of a Pinus woodland and a return to higher lake-water levels as indicated by abundant densities of planktonic species. Another oscillation of the lake level towards shallower depths was recorded by the development of aquatic macrophytes associated with a maximum development of littoral diatoms. The last episode of the sequence presented here witnessed the expansion of thermophilous trees with the simultaneous development in the lake of a planktonic and eutrophic diatom assemblage characterizing higher water levels and nutrient enrichment. On the whole, diatom analysis showed a good correlation with pollen analysis and both indicated changes in the precipitation/evapotranspiration ratio as the main cause for lake-level changes. This study, which combined results obtained from different palaeoecological approaches, provides a synoptic view of fluctuations in the aquatic and terrestrial palaeoenvironments.

Linking non-culturable (qPCR) and culturable enterococci densities with hydrometeorological conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) measurement of enterococci has been proposed as a rapid technique for assessment of beach water quality, but the response of qPCR results to environmental conditions has not been fully explored. Culture-based E. coli and enterococci have been used in empirical predictive models to characterize their responses to environmental conditions and to increase monitoring frequency and efficiency. This approach has been attempted with qPCR results only in few studies. During the summer of 2006, water samples were collected from two southern Lake Michigan beaches and the nearby river outfall (Burns Ditch) and were analyzed for enterococci by culture-based and non-culture-based (i.e., qPCR) methods, as well as culture-based E. coli. Culturable enterococci densities (log CFU/100 ml) for the beaches were significantly correlated with enterococci qPCR cell equivalents (CE) (R=0.650, P<0.0001, N=32). Enterococci CE and CFU densities were highest in Burns Ditch relative to the beach sites; however, only CFUs were significantly higher (P<0.0001). Culturable enterococci densities at Burns Ditch and the beaches were significantly correlated (R=0.565, P<0.0001, N=32). Culturable E. coli and enterococci densities were significantly correlated (R=0.682, P<0.0001, N=32). Regression analyses suggested that enterococci CFU could be predicted by lake turbidity, Burns Ditch discharge, and wind direction (adjusted R-2=0.608); enterococci CE was best predicted by Burns Ditch discharge and log-transformed lake turbidity x wave height (adjusted R-2=0.40). In summary, our results show that analytically, the qPCR method compares well to the non-culture-based method for measuring enterococci densities in beach water and that both these approaches can be predicted by hydrometeorological conditions. Selected predictors and model results highlight the differences between the environmental responses of the two method endpoints and the potentially high variance in qPCR results.

A.; Rocha, Odete; Chellappa, Sathyabama			Impact of stress and disturbance factors on the phytoplankton communities in Northeastern Brazil reservoir	LIMNOLOGICA												The ecology of phytoplankton reservoir communities plays a pivotal role in their management and in the development of inland fisheries in the water scarce semi-arid regions of Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil. The hydrological conditions characterizing these reservoirs include infrequent rainfall and high evaporative loses. The phytoplankton assemblages in tropical climate are structured primarily on dry and wet cycles, not the annual temperature and light regime. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the ecological aspects of phytoplankton communities from three reservoirs during the period of July 2003-June 2004, which include atypical summer rainfall and reservoir overflow. The environmental data broadly divided into two categories, stress factors and disturbance factors. The stress factors deals with the impact of high particulate organic matter and low dissolved oxygen concentrations and disturbance factors, linked to water level fluctuation through flushing and reservoir drawdown, and these events are associated with the phytoplankton assemblages. Results indicated that the three distinct hydroperiods determined the structure of phytoplankton and chlorophyll levels and limited the presence and relative abundance of cyanobacterial species. Phytoplankton succession accompanied changes in clear and turbid water phase represented by the alternate dominance between diatoms and chlorophytes. Inundation and complete filling of reservoir stimulated "s" and "r" strategists species (<20 um) of unicellular and some colonial members of chlorophytes and cryptomonads in highly turbid water environment, and "c" strategist species in rest of the wet period following disturbance gradients. Statistical analysis elicited a significant relationship between particulate organic matter and relative abundance of smaller chlorophytes, which was deemed as stress factor. The flushing and reservoir drawdown indicate disturbance gradient and as a consequence high diversity. Furthermore, a substantial reduction in chlorophyll levels was registered in turbid water phase is related to the reduction of light penetration and re-suspension of sediments. Considering these results, it can be suggested that the well-managed reservoir drawdown can possibly maintain an environment free of eutrophication and cyanobacterial dominance.

In the summer of 2022, the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) in China experienced an extreme drought, significantly impacting the ecosystems and society. However, the specific effects of this extreme drought on surface and subsurface hydrological dynamics remain unclear. Here we employed satellite-observed terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and a modified hydrological model with consideration of reservoir operation, human water consumption, and water diversion engineering to quantify how subsurface and surface water in YRB responded to such an extreme drought in 2022. Validation against a series of observations shows that the modified model has good performance in reproducing daily streamflow, reservoir water storage, lake water storage, and snow water equivalent. It achieved more precise GRACE TWSA estimates in the YRB with significant human intervention, and therefore it can accurately quantify both surface and subsurface hydrological responses to the 2022 extreme drought. Compared to the same months (July-December) in 2015-2021, the drought in 2022 resulted in a decrease in precipitation and discharge of 373 km3 (36 %) and 324 km3 (50 %), respectively, while an increase in evapotranspiration of 156 km3 (29 %) in the YRB. In general, the surface water storage (SWS) is relatively low from July 2022, followed by subsurface water storage (SSWS) from August 2022, indicating an approximately one-month lag from the former to the latter. During the latter half year of 2022, the SWS and SSWS reduced by 48 km3 and 83 km3, respectively, suggesting the changes in the latter dominated the TWS variations. This study sheds light on the responses of surface and subsurface hydrology to extreme droughts, and the hydrological modeling framework with consideration of human activities proposed here holds applicability beyond the YRB.

J	Romo, S; Miracle, MR; Villena, MJ; Rueda, J; Ferriol, C; Vicente, E				Romo, S; Miracle, MR; Villena, MJ; Rueda, J; Ferriol, C; Vicente, E			Mesocosm experiments on nutrient and fish effects on shallow lake food webs in a Mediterranean climate	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Nutrient and fish manipulations in mesocosms were carried out on food-web interactions in a Mediterranean shallow lake in south-east Spain. Nutrients controlled biomass of phytoplankton and periphyton, while zooplankton, regulated by planktivorous fish, influenced the relative percentages of the dominant phytoplankton species. 2. Phytoplankton species diversity decreased with increasing nutrient concentration and planktivorous fish density. Cyanobacteria grew well in both turbid and clear-water states. 3. Planktivorous fish increased concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). Larger zooplankters (mostly Ceriodaphnia and copepods) were significantly reduced when fish were present, whereas rotifers increased, after fish removal of cyclopoid predators and other filter feeders (cladocerans, nauplii). The greatest biomass and diversity of zooplankton was found at intermediate nutrient levels, in mesocosms without fish and in the presence of macrophytes. 4. Water level decrease improved underwater light conditions and favoured macrophyte persistence. Submerged macrophytes (Chara spp.) outcompeted algae up to an experimental nutrient loading equivalent to added concentrations of 0.06 mg L-1 PO4-P and 0.6 mg L-1 NO3-N, above which an exponential increase in periphyton biomass and algal turbidity caused characean biomass to decline. 5. Declining water levels during summer favoured plant-associated rotifer species and chroococcal cyanobacteria. High densities of chroococcal cyanobacteria were related to intermediate nutrient enrichment and the presence of small zooplankton taxa, while filamentous cyanobacteria were relatively more abundant in fishless mesocosms, in which Crustacea were more abundant, and favoured by dim underwater light. 6. Benthic macroinvertebrates increased significantly at intermediate nutrient levels but there was no relationship with planktivorous fish density. 7. The thresholds of nutrient loading and in-lake P required to avoid a turbid state and maintain submerged macrophytes were lower than those reported from temperate shallow lakes. Mediterranean shallow lakes may remain turbid with little control of zooplankton on algal biomass, as observed in tropical and subtropical lakes. Nutrient loading control and macrophyte conservation appear to be especially important in these systems to maintain high water quality.

Annual sedimentation throughout the cores (glacial varves) is identified on photographs, ITRAX (high-resolution continuous microfluorescence-X) and CAT-Scan (computerized axial tomography) analyses and is supported by (1) the number of dark and light laminations between dates obtained by radionuclide measurements (Cs-137, Am-241), (2) the correlation of a slump triggered by the nearby AD 1881 Allemond earthquake (MSK intensity VII) and of a turbidite triggered by the AD 1822 Chautagne regional earthquake (MSK intensity VIII), (3) the number of laminations between two accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dates, and (4) archaeological data. In Lake Bramant, dark layers are coarser, contain less detrital elements, but more neoformed elements and organic matter content. These darker laminations result from calm background sedimentation, whereas the lighter layers are finer and rich in detrital elements and reflect the summer snowmelt. Traces of mining activity during the Roman civilization apogee (AD 115-330) and during the Early Bronze Age (3770-3870 cal BP) are recorded by lead and copper content in the sediments and probably result from regional and local mining activity in the NW Alps. Warmer climate during the Bronze Age in this part of the Alps is suggested by (1) two organic deposits (4160-3600 cal BP and 3300-2850 cal BP) likely reflecting a lower lake level and smaller glaciers and (2) evidence of a different vegetation cover around 2500 m a.s.l. The onset of elastic proglacial sedimentation between 3600-3300 cal BP and since 2850 cal BP is synchronous with periods of glacier advances documented in the Alps and high-lake levels in west-central Europe. This major change in proglacial sedimentation highlights the development of a larger St. Sorlin glacier in the catchment area of Lake Bramant. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Monitoring Microbial Populations and Antibiotic Resistance Gene Enrichment Associated with Arctic Waste Stabilization Ponds	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Wastewater management in the Canadian Arctic is challenging due to climate extremes, small population sizes, and lack of conventional infrastructure for wastewater treatment. Although many northern communities use waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) as their primary form of wastewater treatment, few studies have explored WSP microbial communities and assessed effluent impacts on receiving waters from a microbiological perspective. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene and meta-genome sequencing to characterize WSP and receiving water microbial communities for two time points bracketing the spring WSP thaw in Baker Lake (Nunavut) and compared these results to other Nunavut WSPs in Cambridge Bay and Kugluktuk. Most amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) recovered from these WSP samples belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria, with considerable variation between the three locations and only six ASVs shared among the WSPs at >0.2% relative abundance. Wastewater indicator ASVs for the Baker Lake WSP were identified, and few indicator ASVs were detected in samples originating from other upstream or downstream sites. The meta-genomic data revealed a strong enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes for WSP samples relative to downstream and reference samples, especially for genes associated with macrolide resistance. Together, our results provide a baseline characterization for WSP microbial communities, demonstrate how indicator ASVs can be used to monitor attenuation and dilution of effluent microorganisms, and reveal that WSPs can serve as hot spots for antibiotic resistance genes. IMPORTANCE Given that the microbial communities of Arctic waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are poorly studied to date, our characterization of multiple WSP systems and time points provides important baseline data that will assist with ongoing monitoring of effluent impacts on downstream aquatic ecosystems in the Arctic. This research also identifies indicator amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of WSPs that will be helpful for future monitoring for WSP effluent attenuation and demonstrates that WSP microbial communities are enriched in antibiotic resistance genes. Given operational and infrastructure changes anticipated for wastewater treatment systems in the Arctic, baseline data such as these are essential for further development of safe and effective wastewater treatment systems.

Microscopic observations have provided evidence for the presence of two main forms. The sporangia are implied in algal parasitism. The propagules, i.e. uniflagellated zoospores, may constitute an alternate resource for consumers. These results suggest a need to reconsider the concept of plankton food web functioning. In order to describe the potential role of fungi in food web functioning, we revisit the model of carbon flows in the photic zone of the North basin of Lake Biwa in summer, established using the inverse analysis method for estimating missing flow values. In the absence of quantification of the flows induced by fungal activity, simulations are realised of their potential role in the plankton food web. Different rates of parasitism of micro-phytoplankton are tested, with a return of this carbon to the consumer via the consumption of zoospores by mesozooplankton and, at a lower rate, microzooplankton. The presence of this indirect pathway channelling micro-phytoplankton production to the consumers via the fungi, leads to the following trends: (i) an enhancement of the trophic efficiency index, (ii) a decrease of the ratio detritivory/herbivory, (iii) a decrease of the percentage of carbon flowing in cyclic pathways, and (iv) an increase in the relative ascendency of the system. Relative ascendency, which indicates pathways more specialised and less redundant, is related to theories linking food web patterns and stability. A high ascendency in the plankton food web (low trophic level), if connected to a food web of high redundancy at higher trophic levels (e.g. nekton food web) would fit well to the stabilising pattern called structural asymmetry, considered a stability criterion. More precise models, taking into account the species diversity of fungi and the high specificity of their parasitism on the micro-phytoplankton, would further accentuate this observation.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019; Urabe, Jotaro/A-6256-2012; Niquil, Nathalie/N-2561-2013; Kagami, Maiko/L-4430-2018	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Christaki, Urania/0000-0002-2061-5278; Viscogliosi, Eric/0000-0002-5805-7179; Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X; Niquil, Nathalie/0000-0002-0772-754X; Kagami, Maiko/0000-0003-3086-390X													0018-8158					JAN	2011	659	1					65	79		10.1007/s10750-010-0308-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0308-6													WOS:000284651400007
J	MOSS, B; JOHNES, P; PHILLIPS, G				MOSS, B; JOHNES, P; PHILLIPS, G			AUGUST THIENEMANN AND LOCH-LOMOND - AN APPROACH TO THE DESIGN OF A SYSTEM FOR MONITORING THE STATE OF NORTH-TEMPERATE STANDING WATERS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Limnologists had an early preoccupation with lake classification. It gave a necessary structure to the many chemical and biological observations that were beginning to form the basis of one of the earliest truly environmental sciences. August Thienemann was the doyen of such classifiers and his concept with Einar Naumann of oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes remains central to the world-view that limnologists still have. Classification fell into disrepute, however, as it became clear that there would always be lakes that deviated from the prescriptions that the classifiers made for them. Continua became the de rigeur concept and lakes were seen as varying along many chemical, biological and geographic axes. Modern limnologists are comfortable with this concept. That all lakes are different guarantees an indefinite future for limnological research. For those who manage lakes and the landscapes in which they are set, however, it is not very useful. There may be as many as 300 000 standing water bodies in England and Wales alone and maybe as many again in Scotland. More than 80 000 are sizable (> 1 ha). Some classification scheme to cope with these numbers is needed and, as human impacts on them increase, a system of assessing and monitoring change must be built into such a scheme. Although ways of classifying and monitoring running waters are well developed in the UK, the same is not true of standing waters. Sufficient understanding of what determines the nature and functioning of lakes exists to create a system which has intellectual credibility as well as practical usefulness. This paper outlines the thinking behind a system which will be workable on a north European basis and presents some early results.

To elucidate its effect on zooplankton community structure and phytoplankton biomass (chl a), we conducted a 5.5 mo enclosure experiment with sticklebacks at different densities in high nutrient concentrations and a salinity of 2 psu. Increasing fish density (0 to 10.2 sticklebacks m(-2)) led to substantial changes in the zooplankton community structure, an increase in phytoplankton chl a, and a reduction in water clarity. At densities below 4 to 6 sticklebacks m(-2), large-bodied cladocerans dominated the zooplankton biomass, the zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio was high (> 1), and chl a was accordingly low (< 20 mug l(-1)). At higher stickleback densities, large cladocerans disappeared and the abundance of small cladocerans was low. Instead, cyclopoid copepods and rotifers dominated, the zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio was well below 0.5, and chl a exceeded 200 mug l(-1) in late summer. The fish density level for a shift from a clear to a turbid state is low compared to the densities observed in several eutrophic, brackish lagoons. We conclude that fish have a strong impact on water clarity in shallow, eutrophic, brackish lakes with low salinity, which may explain the usually low zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio and the turbid state of such aquatic environments. However, our results also indicate that once the density level declines to below 4 to 6 sticklebacks m(-2), a shift to a clear state is likely to occur.

J	BENNION, H				BENNION, H			A DIATOM-PHOSPHORUS TRANSFER-FUNCTION FOR SHALLOW, EUTROPHIC PONDS IN SOUTHEAST ENGLAND	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Shallow ponds in southeast England are often eutrophic with high phosphorus concentrations. The aim of this study was to develop a diatom-phosphorus 'transfer function' to enable past phosphorus levels in such waters to be inferred from the sediment record. A water chemistry survey of 123 randomly chosen, shallow, artificial ponds in southeast England was carried out. Principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that phosphorus was an important environmental variable. A subset of 31 sites was selected along a total phosphorus (TP) gradient (winter TP range 7-1123 mug l-1), in order to explore the relationship between the surface-sediment diatom assemblages and the contemporary water chemistry using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Annual mean TP was the most significant variable in explaining the variance in the diatom species data. Weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration techniques were used to generate a transfer function, enabling annual mean TP (range 25-646 mug l-1) to be inferred from the diatom species TP optima of 102 common taxa in the dataset (r2 = 0.79; RMSE = 0.161; RMSE(boot) = 0.279; n = 30). The model was applied to fossil diatom assemblages in a sediment core from Marsworth Reservoir, Hertfordshire, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), with currently high TP levels of 476 mug l-1 to reconstruct past epilimnetic annual mean TP concentrations. The study shows that artificial, shallow waters can be suitable for palaeolimnological research and that it is possible to reliably infer lake water TP using the WA technique, across a large range of phosphorus concentrations. This method has the potential to provide limnologists, conservationists and water quality managers with an estimate of pre-enrichment phosphorus concentrations and an indication of the onset and development of eutrophication at a site. This information is essential for lake management strategies and restoration programmes.					; Bennion, Helen/T-7848-2019	Bennion, Helen/0000-0003-0125-9308; 													0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						391	410		10.1007/BF00026729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026729													WOS:A1994NB19800036

Small-plot evaluations of aquatic pesticides for control of starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa) in Lake Koronis, Minnesota	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Nitellopsis obtusa (Desv.) J. Groves (starry stonewort) is a green macroalga native to Eurasia in the family Characeae. It has become an invasive species in much of the Midwestern United States. Starry stonewort is difficult to control due to its rapid and dense growth, and its ability to produce underground structures called bulbils. These bulbils act as a method of asexual reproduction that can serve to recolonize previously managed locations. There has been a lack of research on the efficacy of chemical treatments and combinations of chemical treatments on starry stonewort. Therefore, treatments of copper, diquat, and copper + diquat combinations were evaluated in small plots in Lake Koronis, MN, during the summers of 2020 and 2021. In 2020, applications of copper reduced aboveground biomass at 8 wk after treatment by . 90%. Copper treatments in 2020 had no effect on bulbil densities. Diquat was not effective at reducing starry stonewort biomass or bulbil density at 4 and 8 wk after treatment. Bulbil densities in diquat plots ranged from 33.3 & PLUSMN; 33.3 to 4,266.7 & PLUSMN; 3,963.3 bulbils m-2 depending upon sample time and site. The estimated diquat half-life in Lake Koronis was , 2 h among all treated plots, which was a factor in the lack of diquat efficacy. In 2021, copper treatments resulted in a 78 and 27% reduction in aboveground biomass at 4 and 8 wk after treatment, respectively. Copper treatments also reduced bulbil density by 4 wk after treatment. Plots treated with the copper + diquat had aboveground biomass reductions of 76 and 65% at 4 and 8 wk after treatment, respectively. Bulbil densities did not show a reduction in the combination plots. Regrowth was evident in all plots regardless of treatment by 8 wk. Additional strategies are needed to target bulbil production, induce bulbil mortality, or gain longer-term control of aboveground biomass.																			0146-6623					JUL	2022	60						79	84																WOS:001054107800005

The lake has a water spread area of about 3.75 km(2) and serves as a drinking water source for about seven lakh people in southern Kerala. Unfortunately, the lake is at the verge of severe degradation consequent to different kinds of human interferences. The Sasthamkotta lake receives water mainly from rainfall (2,350 mm/year) and surface run-off (3.33 million m3/ year). Apart from these, a significant quantity of water reaches the lake through underwater springs emerging from the Quaternary and Neogene aquifers as well. Rampant removal of construction grade sand using high power jet pumps from the Quaternary aquifers linking the lake with the adjoining river, over exploitation of lake water, unscientific engineering constructions, etc. are some of the externalities leading to degradation and ultimate drying up of the lake. The floodplain of the Kallada river, hosting the lake Sasthamkotta, was unaffected by sand extraction till early 1970's. The results of the present study revealed that indiscriminate sand mining has turned floodplain area of about 3.57 km(2) into fallow lands, during the past 3-4 decades. This together with the riverbed lowering due to instream sand mining has significantly reduced the groundwater replenishment of the lake system. The construction of embankment on the southern side of the lake has not only isolated the lake system from its natural settings, but has prevented the flood pulse contribution of monsoon waters to a considerable extent. The present paper examines in detail the pros and cons of the human induced environmental degradation of the Lake Sasthamkotta which is declared recently a Ramsar wetland of international importance. Based on the study, a set of recommendations are also drawn for improving the overall environmental quality of the Sasthamkotta lake in particular and the freshwater lakes in the coastal lands of densely populated tropics in general.																			1226-4806	1598-7477				JUN	2016	20	3					391	402		10.1007/s12303-015-0049-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12303-015-0049-7													WOS:000377223000010

Modern pollen and its ecological relationships with the tropical deciduous forests of central Uttar Pradesh, India	PALYNOLOGY												The paucity of modern pollen-rain data from the central part of Uttar Pradesh is a significant barrier to understanding the Late Quaternary vegetation history from the northern region of India. The interplay between extant vegetation and the modern pollen assemblage from both natural and human-induced vegetation types is examined from Lucknow, as an aid for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. A dataset of 25 surface pollen samples has been documented from the conservation forests of Kukrail, Lucknow (part of Central Ganga Plain). The palynodata reflect the mixed deciduous forest comprising Acacia, Butea, Salmalia, and Syzygium under a warm and humid climate in response to rainfall variations in the region. High monsoonal activity in and around the region is inferred from the presence of the Euphorbiaceae-Moraceae-Syzygium assemblage in the sediments. The marshy and aquatic taxa such as Cyperaceae, Nymphoides and Polygonaceae are strongly suggestive of the perennial waterlogged condition in the area. A striking signal of winter dryness is easily visible in the palynoassemblage, especially observed through Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae. The regular presence of pollen grains of conifers and other broad-leafed taxa including Alnus, Betula, Pinus and Quercus are suggestive of high wind activity from the higher altitudes. Anthropogenic activity is in continuous pace as reflected by the higher frequencies of cereal pollen (14-29%) and Brassicaceae (2-5%). The contrasting frequencies of extant floral taxa recovered in the form of pollen in varied surface samples are indicative of differential pollen production, dispersal and deposition patterns. Therefore, an attempt has been made to precisely observe the behavioural pattern of modern pollen deposition which could in turn help in assessing the expanse of pastoral practices and the depth of deterioration of pristine forests as well as in the reconstruction of past climate and vegetation shifts in Central Ganga Plain, India. A correlation of regional palynodata with other tropical regions of the Indian subcontinent as well as in a global context is required for better interpretation.																			0191-6122	1558-9188				JUL	2016	40	2					264	279		10.1080/01916122.2015.1045049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01916122.2015.1045049													WOS:000378090200010

Some fans were buried by till and glaciolacustrine materials. One fan surface, northwest of Leamington, was only modified by lake current that transgressed and regressed over it. An aggregate excavation (Bondi site) exists within the surface of this fan. We describe the sedimentology of the site that provides evidence for fan and overlying bar deposits. Lake levels fell to the levels of lakes Arkona (216 m) and Ypsilanti (122 m) following the deposition of the fans. Large terrestrial areas supported plants and animals. Their presence is recorded at the Bondi site by a single bone and several organic mats recovered from the fan and bar sediment contact at two separate exposures. Radiocarbon dates on the bone of 13 410 +/- 100 BP (TO-1803), organic material dates of 13 225 +/- 200 BP (BGS-1404) and 13 150 +/- 100 BP (WE-01-89), the altitude (209 m), and the sedimentological setting indicate deposition during the Lake Arkona (216 m) - Lake Whittlesey (226 m) transition period. The pollen and plant macrofossil assemblages recovered from the organic material indicate a forest-tundra environment, with a mean July temperature of 14-degrees-C. This interpretation fits well with the bone identified as cf. Euceratherium sp., a shrubox. The discovery of cf. Euceratherium sp. is surprising, as its previous range was south and west of this site. The organic material was subsequently buried by the formation of a bar as water levels rose within the Lake Erie basin and transgressed the site.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				DEC	1993	30	12					2436	2447		10.1139/e93-210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e93-210													WOS:A1993NF16100014

SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												Excess inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr) from the atmosphere will cause disturbances to forest ecosystems, including soil and stream water acidification, plant nutrient imbalances, alterations of species compositions (such as biodiversity losses), and nitrogen (N) leaching into stream water. Central Japan (or Chubu region) has experienced both domestic and transboundary air pollution since the 1950s. Emissions of nitrogen oxides in China peaked in 2011/2012, although the peak of ammonia emissions has not been confirmed. Changes in these emissions have been reflected gradually in atmospheric N deposition rates and the biogeochemical cycle in ecosystems in central Japan. We synthetically analyzed the current N saturation situation for forest ecosystems in central Japan based on our recent publications and the latest available dataset. The stream water in the Lake Ijira catchment (IJR) on the Pacific side in Gifu Prefecture became acidified and N-saturated in the mid-1990s but has begun to recover with a decrease in nitrate (NO3-) concentration since the mid-2000s. The progress and recovery of N saturation appeared to be related to the trends of atmospheric deposition, climatic anomalies (such as the cool and drought summers in 1993/1994), and forest management. The NO3 (-) concentrations in stream water within the forest catchment of Kajikawa (KJK) on the Sea of Japan side in Niigata Prefecture have continued to increase, although the catchment seems to be recovering from acidification owing to a decline in atmospheric sulfur (and probably N) deposition. Finally, the NO3- concentration in stream water in KJK became higher than that in IJR, a direct inversion of the situation in the early 2000s. The recent analysis of O-17 excess in NO3- estimated that the export of biologically unprocessed atmospheric NO3- via stream water was larger in KJK than in IJR. The N cycle in soil-plant systems likely does not function as expected under excess atmospheric N input (still over 10 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), especially in KJK. In addition to atmospheric N deposition, reduced N uptake rates as coniferous forests mature, and changing precipitation amounts/patterns appear to accelerate N leaching from forest catchments in central Japan.					; Sase, Hiroyuki/AAS-2461-2021; Matsuda, Kazuhide/C-2041-2013; Takahashi, Masamichi/B-6584-2009; Tsunogai, Urumu/C-8303-2011	Yamashita, Naoyuki/0000-0003-3398-6825; Matsuda, Kazuhide/0000-0003-3663-6126; Tsunogai, Urumu/0000-0002-1517-3284; Morohashi, Masayuki/0009-0007-7788-6443; Sase, Hiroyuki/0000-0001-9129-4339													0038-0768	1747-0765				JAN 2	2022	68	1					5	14		10.1080/00380768.2021.1991228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2021.1991228		OCT 2021											WOS:000707811300001
J	Dasgupta, P				Dasgupta, P			Facies pattern of the middle Permian Barren Measures Formation, Jharia basin, India: The sedimentary response to basin tectonics	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												In the Lower Gondwana succession of the Jharia basin of eastern India, the Barren Measures Formation is characterized by the cyclic disposition of fine-grained lacustrine deposits and relatively coarse-grained fluvial deposits. The cyclic variation in the rate of coarse clastic input is attributed to the sedimentary response to basin tectonics. The sandstone-shale alternations of the Barren Measures succession can be correlated with the tectonic cyclothems developed on the hangingwall dip-slope and adjoining trough in a continental half-graben setting. Enhancement of the gradient of the hangingwall dip-slope during reactivation of the basin margin faults led to progradation of the existing fluvial system towards the half-graben trough and deposition of the coarser clastics on the fine-grained lacustrine deposits of the trough. Peneplanation of the hangingwall slope and slow increase in the lake level caused lacustrine transgression and retrogration of the fluvial system on the hangingwall block. The fluvial sediments were onlapped by the fine-grained lacustrine deposits. Episodic rejuvenation of the basin margin faults thus caused development of tectonic cyclothem on the hangingwall block. The paleocurrent pattern indicates that a persistent northward paleoslope was maintained during Barren Measures sedimentation. The inferred depositional settings were much mote extensive than the present limit of the outcrop. The faults, presently defining the northern limit of the Barren Measures Formation, were possibly emplaced after Barren Measures sedimentation. The final movement along these fault planes caused preservation of the downthrown hangingwall block and the Barren Measures sediments on the footwall block were eroded during subsequent denudation. The Southern Boundary Fault came into existence after the deposition of the Barren Measures sediments.

A large part of its catchment area is a reputable and popular tourism area, where the quality of surface waters is in the center of public and scientific interest. The inflows of Lake Balaton are vulnerable, due to the strong human activity upstream. Despite their significance, the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities of these inflow streams are poorly known. In the summer of 2008, we investigated the distributional pattern of EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) assemblages, and their relationships with selected physico-chemical factors and landscape characteristics at different spatial scales. Samples were taken according to the AQEM sampling protocol at 20 stream sections with different environmental conditions. Multivariate analyses were used for evaluation. Altogether 8131 specimens (6225 Ephemeroptera, 133 Plecoptera, 1773 Trichoptera) belonging to 55 species (25 Ephemeroptera, 2 Plecoptera, 28 Trichoptera) were identified. Cloeon dipterum (L.) and Baetis spp. were the most common mayfly taxa, while caddisfly communities were dominated by limnephilids [Anabolia furcata Brauer, Potamophylax rotundipennis (Brauer)] and hydropsychids [Hydropsyche saxonica McLachlan, H. angustipennis (Curtis)]. The distribution of EPT assemblages was highly affected by pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature and total dissolved solids. At reach scale, relationships were detected between spatial patterns of EPT assemblages and structure of riparian vegetation, type of sediment, and some hydromorphological characteristics (e. g., depth and width of stream bed, cover of aquatic vegetation, etc.). At medium and large scale, the ratio of natural and human-impacted areas proved to be the most influential factor.

J	CLET, M; OCCHIETTI, S				CLET, M; OCCHIETTI, S			PALYNOLOGY AND PALEOENVIRONMENTS OF LOTBINIERE-SAND AND DESCHAILLONS-VARVES (UPPER PLEISTOCENE) OF THE ST-LAWRENCE VALLEY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Lotbiniere Sand and Deschaillons Varves are indicators of the drainage pattern of the St. Lawrence watershed, which presumably occurred during the Late Sangamonian (5c and 5c-5b transition?). The pollen content of the Lotbiniere Sand suggests there was a Picea mariana - Betula - Pious boreal forest in the valley. in the lowermost zone of the Deschaillons Varves, the pollen is very abundant: the boreal forest was progressively flooded by Lake Deschaillons. Above this zone, the vegetation seems to evolve toward a Picea and Betula open forest. The pollen of the upper contorted varves was presumably reworked from older material or transported from remote sources. The following paleoenvironmental sequence is reconstructed in the St. Lawrence Valley: (i) lowering of the relative drainage level, as indicated by the erosional disconformity in lower rythmites; this phase, of unknown duration, is ascribed to an eustatic lowering related to a global climatic cooling; (ii) an aggradation phase, as indicated by the Lotbiniere Sand, before and at the beginning of a glacial damming in the middle estuary; (iii) progressive flooding of the valley and its boreal forest as ice caps are present on adjacent Laurentian and Appalachian highlands; (iv) expansion of Lake Deschaillons, limited by the Glens Falls sill, New York. The relative elevation of the lake was at least 56 m. Great Lakes and upper St. Lawrence River drainage system was probably deflected to the Hudson River. According to the number of varves, the regional ice caps preceded the general invasion by Laurentide Ice Sheet of approximatively 3800 years.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	1994	31	9					1474	1485		10.1139/e94-130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e94-130													WOS:A1994PP59700009
J	JOHNSON, MG				JOHNSON, MG			TEMPORAL TRENDS IN METAL CONCENTRATIONS IN RIVERS, COASTAL-ZONE WATERS, AND SEDIMENTS OF NORTHERN AND EASTERN GEORGIAN BAY	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The pH of rivers during spring freshets in 1980-1989 ranged from 4.0 to 7.6 and concentrations of Cu, Ni, Zn, Al, and Cd (but not Pb) were inversely correlated with pH. Although Georgian Bay had high pH (> 7.6) and relatively low metals, some bays and inlets had impaired water quality because of large river inputs where exchange was low. The primary objective of the study was to estimate temporal increases in metals; two methods were used and results compared. First, increases in metals were estimated using observed pH-metal relationships together with estimates of decrease in pH in rivers due to atmospheric pollution. Concentrations of Ni, Zn, and Cd approximately doubled, while concentrations of Cu and Al increased 1.4 x and 1.3 x, respectively, from the onset of acidification. Secondly, independent estimates of temporal increases were based on metal profiles in dated sediment cores. These were 2 x for Cu, Ni, Zn, and Hg, and 4 x for Cd from approximately 1910-1920 and 13 x for Pb since about 1890. No increase was observed in Cr and Al concentrations in cores. The effects of increased metals and reduced pH on aquatic life in Georgian Bay are generally unknown. Inferences from toxicological studies are that high concentrations of several metals above water quality objectives (especially Cu, Al, and Cd) at reduced pH have adversely affected fish communities of Georgian Bay. Losses in fish stocks often have occurred in areas where high metals and low pH have been observed.																			0380-1330						1991	17	2					241	254		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71361-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71361-0													WOS:A1991FZ32800011

Piscivorous semi-aquatic freshwater megafauna inhabit both the terrestrial and aquatic mediums and thus may be good indicators of wetland habitat quality. However, the drivers of their space use at the terrestrial and aquatic landscape levels are not well understood. We studied the spatial behavior and habitat use of giant otters in Madre de Dios, Peru, inhabiting areas with variable levels of protection. We combined unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite images to develop different terrestrial and water-associated land cover variables. We tested the influence of these predictors on giant otter habitat use at multiple spatial scales, comparing used and available locations. Giant otters favored bank areas with dense forest canopy cover. In the aquatic medium, giant otters showed positive selection for open water and fallen logs and avoided floating vegetation. These findings may be explained by preference for optimal fish habitat to maximize foraging yield and bank areas that provide more cover from predators and higher quality denning locations. Variables developed from UAV images outperformed satellite-derived variables. Despite recent signs of deforestation in lake banks in unprotected areas, spatial model predictions indicated that unprotected oxbow lakes did not differ in their habitat suitability from protected freshwater habitats. Management implications of our findings include identification of factors driving habitat suitability to guide policy and decisions regarding protection or restoration of oxbow lake ecosystems to support giant otter populations. In addition, we demonstrate that UAVs have value in complementing satellite-derived images and providing a cost-effective methodology to assess habitat quality for semi-aquatic species at the land-water interface.					; Swaisgood, Ronald/AAL-3198-2020	Barocas, Adi/0000-0001-5435-9711; Chiaverini, Luca/0000-0001-9788-5754; Swaisgood, Ronald/0000-0001-5353-2148; Harrington, Lauren Alix/0000-0002-7212-2336; 														2578-4854				DEC	2022	4	12							e12786	10.1111/csp2.12786	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/csp2.12786		NOV 2022											WOS:000888237800001

Cascading sulfur cycling in simulated oil sands pit lake water cap mesocosms transitioning from oxic to euxinic conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Base Mine Lake (BML), the first full-scale demonstration of oil sands tailings pit lake reclamation technology, is experiencing expansive, episodic hypolimnetic euxinia resulting in greater sulfur biogeochemical cycling within the water cap. Here, Fluid Fine Tailings (FFT)-water mesocosm experiments simulating the in situ BML summer hypolimnetic oxic-euxinic transition determined sulfur biogeochemical processes and their controlling factors. While mesocosm water caps without FFT amendments experienced limited geochemical and microbial changes during the experimental period, FFT-amended mesocosm water caps evidenced three successive stages of S speciation in similar to 30 days: (S1) rising expansion of water cap euxinia from FFT to water surface; enabling (S2) rapid sulfate (SO42- ) reduction and sulfide production directly within the water column; fostering (S3) generation and subsequent consumption of sulfur oxidation intermediate compounds (SOI). Identified key SOI, elemental S and thiosulfate, support subsequent SOI oxidation, reduction, and/or disproportionation processes in the system. Dominant water cap microbes shifted from methanotrophs and denitrifying/iron-reducing bacteria to functionally versatile sulfur-reducing bacteria (SRB) comprising sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfovibrionales) and SOI-reducing/disproportionating bacteria (Campylobacterales and Desulfobulbales). The observed microbial shift is driven by decreasing [SO42-] and organic aromaticity, with putative hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria providing electron donors for SRB. Comparison between unsterile and sterile water treatments further underscores the biogeochemical readiness of the in situ water cap to enhance oxidant depletion, euxinia expansion and establishment of water cap SRB communities aided by FFT migration of anaerobes. Results here identify the collective influence of FFT and water cap microbial communities on water cap euxinia expansion associated with sequential S reactions that are controlled by concentrations of oxidants, labile organic substrates and S species. This emphasizes the necessity of understanding this complex S cycling in assessing BML water cap O-2 persistence.					; Yan, Yunyun/JJD-3184-2023	Yan, Yunyun/0009-0003-3316-3236; Liu, Felicia Yung Lok/0009-0002-1308-1498; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 10	2024	950								175272	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175272		AUG 2024						39111438					WOS:001292934200001

JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Studies on the variability of natural fire regimes are needed to understand plant responses in a changing environment. Since vegetation changes might follow or trigger changes in fire frequency, climate models suggest that changes in water balance will accompany current global warming, and the response of fire regimes to Holocene hydro-climate changes and vegetation switches may thus serve as a useful analogue for current change. 2 We present high-resolution charcoal records from laminated cores from three small kettle lakes located in mixed-boreal and coniferous-boreal forest. Comparison with some pollen diagrams from the lakes is used to evaluate the role of the local vegetation in the fire history. Fire frequency was reconstructed by measuring the separation of peaks after detrending the charcoal accumulation rate from any background. 3 Several distinct periods of fire regime were detected with fire intervals. Between c. 7000-3000 cal. year BP, fire intervals were double those in the last 2000 years. Fire frequency changed 1000 years earlier in the coniferous-boreal forest than in the mixed-boreal forest to the south. The absence of changes in combustibility species in the pollen data that could explain the fire frequency transition suggests that the vegetation does not control the long-term fire regime in the boreal forest. 4 Climate appears to be the main process triggering fire. The increased frequency may be the result of more frequent drought due to the increasing influence of cool dry westerly Pacific air-masses from mid to late Holocene, and thus of conditions conducive to ignition and fire spread. In east Canada, this change matches other long-term climate proxies and suggests that a switch in atmospheric circulation 2-3000 years ago triggered a less stable climate with more dry summers. Future warming is moreover likely to reduce fire frequency.					; Gauthier, Sylvie/J-3923-2019; Carcaillet, Christopher/G-1218-2011; Prairie, Yves/B-9108-2008	Prairie, Yves/0000-0003-1210-992X; Frechette, Bianca/0000-0002-4986-5772; Carcaillet, Christopher/0000-0002-6632-1507; Gauthier, Sylvie/0000-0001-6720-0195													0022-0477					DEC	2001	89	6					930	946		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2001.00614.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2001.00614.x													WOS:000172926100003
J	STAUFFER, RE; WITTCHEN, BD				STAUFFER, RE; WITTCHEN, BD			HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY OF MAINE SEEPAGE LAKES AND RELATED GROUNDWATERS	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Southeastern Maine contains numerous small seepage lakes (no perennial surface inflows or outflows), set in felsic, glacial deposits (eskers, pitted outwash, glacio-marine deltaic terraces) dating from the Wisconsin glacial retreat ca. 12 500 years B.P. The modem landscape is either forested or maintained as low blueberry heath by semi-annual mowing and burning. Although local precipitation is currently moderately acidic (volume-weighted pH almost-equal-to 4.5), spring waters issuing from the glacial deposits are only weakly acidic (6.1 < pH < 7.0), and bicarbonate-buffered (I 20 to 300 mmol m-3) on account of tertiary weathering by dissolved CO2. The order of mobility (denudation rate) for base cations (BC) is: Ca > Na > Mg > K, the same as for upland granitic terrane in the same region. Springwater composition is temporally stable but geographically variable. The most dilute springwaters drain blueberry barrens. Here, chemical weathering is limited by available acidity as evidenced by the relatively high final pHs (> 6.3) and low concentrations of strong oxy-anions (nitrate, sulfate) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC < 250 muM). Closely neighboring lakes often range widely in alkalinity, BC, and F, depending on their connection to the local groundwater system. Tracer analysis indicates seepage inflow is equal to 5-50 cm year-1 for typical regional seepage lakes, vs. higher rates (> 100 cm year-1) for groundwater discharge lakes. Approximately 88% of Si inputs to regional seepage lakes is retained in the sediments. Non-marine sulfate is lowest in groundwater discharge lakes containing the highest concentrations of BC and F, and featuring the shortest hydraulic residence times, suggesting that S retention in lake sediments is currently less efficient than in the adjoining terrestrial soils and vegetation.																			0022-1694					OCT	1992	138	3-4					559	581		10.1016/0022-1694(92)90137-K	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(92)90137-K													WOS:A1992JW46700014

Using near-term forecasts and uncertainty partitioning to inform prediction of oligotrophic lake cyanobacterial density	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Near-term ecological forecasts provide resource managers advance notice of changes in ecosystem services, such as fisheries stocks, timber yields, or water quality. Importantly, ecological forecasts can identify where there is uncertainty in the forecasting system, which is necessary to improve forecast skill and guide interpretation of forecast results. Uncertainty partitioning identifies the relative contributions to total forecast variance introduced by different sources, including specification of the model structure, errors in driver data, and estimation of current states (initial conditions). Uncertainty partitioning could be particularly useful in improving forecasts of highly variable cyanobacterial densities, which are difficult to predict and present a persistent challenge for lake managers. As cyanobacteria can produce toxic and unsightly surface scums, advance warning when cyanobacterial densities are increasing could help managers mitigate water quality issues. Here, we fit 13 Bayesian state-space models to evaluate different hypotheses about cyanobacterial densities in a low nutrient lake that experiences sporadic surface scums of the toxin-producing cyanobacterium, Gloeotrichia echinulata. We used data from several summers of weekly cyanobacteria samples to identify dominant sources of uncertainty for near-term (1- to 4-week) forecasts of G. echinulata densities. Water temperature was an important predictor of cyanobacterial densities during model fitting and at the 4-week forecast horizon. However, no physical covariates improved model performance over a simple model including the previous week's densities in 1-week-ahead forecasts. Even the best fit models exhibited large variance in forecasted cyanobacterial densities and did not capture rare peak occurrences, indicating that significant explanatory variables when fitting models to historical data are not always effective for forecasting. Uncertainty partitioning revealed that model process specification and initial conditions dominated forecast uncertainty. These findings indicate that long-term studies of different cyanobacterial life stages and movement in the water column as well as measurements of drivers relevant to different life stages could improve model process representation of cyanobacteria abundance. In addition, improved observation protocols could better define initial conditions and reduce spatial misalignment of environmental data and cyanobacteria observations. Our results emphasize the importance of ecological forecasting principles and uncertainty partitioning to refine and understand predictive capacity across ecosystems.

Water quality indicators and environmental factors vary spatially along the Lijiang River, which runs through urban areas, farmland, and karst areas. However, research on the response of water quality to water environmental factors is still lacking. Within this context, this study considered statistical methods and hydrological, meteorological, and water quality data of the middle and lower reaches of the Lijiang River from 2012 to 2018, expounded on the temporal and spatial change characteristics and evolution trends of water quality indicators; we analyzed the correlation between water quality indicators and environmental factors; we quantitatively assessed the sensitivity and contribution rate of water quality indicators to environmental factors. The results demonstrated that rainfall feedback on the river streamflow was lagging, and upstream precipitation often affected downstream streamflow. The water quality in the upper reaches of Guilin has improved year by year, and pollution levels have increased slightly when flowing through the urban area of Guilin. In spite of this, it still falls within the range of self-purification. River characteristics heavily influence the impact of environmental factors on water quality indicators; in contrast, the effects of different locations along the same river are more similar. Four water quality indicators are negatively correlated with water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO). The sensitivities of ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) to streamflow increase with the flow direction. The contribution rates of DO-to-total phosphorus (TP) and pH-to-TP are over -6%. Water temperature is the major contributing factor in the Lijiang River, while DO has a higher contribution in tributaries. The external sources affect the concentration of various water quality indicators and the sensitivity of water quality indicators to the external environment. There should be a series of measures implemented to reduce pollution, such as using oxygenation or chemical means to increase pH in Dahe and Yangshuo to control water pollutants. Tourism and particular karst topography make LRB's calculations unique, but the research method can be applied to other watersheds as well.					; Chen, Xiang/JUF-0248-2023	Zhu, Dantong/0000-0001-5022-8108; Fujun, Niu/0000-0003-0524-2618; Li, Wuhua/0000-0003-3246-6377														1660-4601				JUL	2022	19	13							8089	10.3390/ijerph19138089	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19138089								35805749					WOS:000824046000001

Hatching characteristics of eggs stored at 7 degrees C for 0-28 weeks in the lab and following maintenance overwinter in a lake are described. The hatching success of eggs stored for 4-28 weeks remained constant (71-81%) but slightly less than that observed in fresh eggs (90%). The hatching success of eggs kept overwinter under natural conditions did not differ from that of eggs stored an equivalent length of time in the lab at 7 degrees C (74.7 and 75.8%, respectively). With the exception of fresh eggs (17.7 days), the mean hatch time of eggs steadily decreased with increased storage time (18.9 days following 4 weeks storage to 11.4 days at 28 weeks storage) due to a slow embryonation of the eggs al 7 degrees C. Hatching characteristics of a subsample of eggs incubated at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C were compared and the embryonation rate was found to increase with incubation temperature. The majority of eggs stored at 10 degrees C embryonated but failed to hatch. When their incubation temperature was raised to 15 degrees C, a further 46% hatched within the following week. The survivorship functions of miracidia hatching from eggs stored for 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks differed but the mean expected life-span of the miracidia did not decline with increasing storage time as expected. The results of these experiments are discussed in relation to the potential importance of overwintered eggs in the development of the infective pool of metacercariae.

The monastery is quite rudimentary, its entrance is cut into the mountain and consists of small caves carved into cliff sides that can be difficult to reach. It has seven rooms containing some wall paintings and structures painted with some remains of pigments. Here we reported the investigations and analyses of the materials and techniques of the wall paintings in The Abu El Leaf Monastery using analytical techniques such as: Polarized light microscopy (PLM), X ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Earth materials such as iron oxides based on hematite and goethite were the main findings, black carbon was also identified. The analyses of samples from different locations of The Abu El Leaf Monastery with XRD analysis indicated the presence of calcite, anhydrite, gypsum in the ground layer, and calcite in the plaster one. The pigments were identified by close visual investigation which showed that the paint layer was a very thin one, and that some parts were in very bad conditions such as some missing parts and some fallen others. Arabic Gum as organic binding medium suggests that tempera technique was used in The Abu El Leaf Monastery in Fayoum Oases.					; Aal, Shaaban/H-2174-2012	ABDELAAL, SHAABAN/0000-0003-2446-4216; 													2067-533X	2067-8223				JUL-SEP	2018	9	3					429	438																WOS:000452900200005
J	Kolata, DR; Huff, WD; Bergstrom, SM				Kolata, DR; Huff, WD; Bergstrom, SM			Nature and regional significance of unconformities associated with the Middle Ordovician Hagan K-bentonite complex in the North American midcontinent	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Stratal patterns of the Middle Ordovician Hagan K-bentonite complex and associated rocks show that the Black River-Trenton un conformity in the North American midcontinent formed through the complex interplay of eustasy, sediment accumulation rates, siliciclastic influx, bathymetry, seawater chemistry, and perhaps local tectonic uplift. The unconformity is diachronous and is an amalgamated surface that resulted from local late Turinian lowstand exposure followed by regional early Chatfieldian transgressive drowning and sediment starvation. The duration of the unconformity is greatest in southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and northern Indiana, where the Deicke and Millbrig K-bentonite Beds converge at the unconformity. On the basis of published isotopic ages for the Deicke and Millbrig beds, it is possible that in these regions erosion and nondeposition spanned a period of as much as 3.2 m.y. Two broad coeval depositional settings are recognized within the North American midcontinent during early Chatfieldian time. (1) An inner shelf, subtidal facies of fossiliferous shale (Spechts Ferry Shale Member and Ion Shale Member of the Decorah Formation) and argillaceous lime mudstone and skeletal wackestone (Guttenberg and Kings Lake Limestone Members) extended from the Canadian shield and Transcontinental arch southeastward through Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri. (2) A seaward, relatively deep subtidal, sediment-starved, middle shelf extended eastward from the Mississippi Valley region to the Taconian foreland basins in the central and southern Appalachians and southward through the pericratonic Arkoma and Black Warrior basins. In the inner shelf region, the Black River-Trenton unconformity is a composite of at least two prominent hardground omission surfaces, one at the top of the Castlewood and Carimona Limestone Members and the other at the top of the Guttenberg and Kings Lake Limestone Members, both merging to a single surface in the middle shelf region. The inner and middle shelves redeveloped later in approximately the same regions during Devonian and Mississippian time.																			0016-7606					JUN	1998	110	6					723	739		10.1130/0016-7606(1998)110<0723:NARSOU>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1998)110<0723:NARSOU>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000074208200003

Sport anglers may be exposed to these residues via consumption of contaminated Great Lakes (GL) fish. The Health Departments of five GL states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana, formed a consortium to study body burden levels of chemical residues in fish consumers of Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie. In Fall 1993, a telephone survey was administered to sport angler households to obtain fish consumption habits and demographics. A blood sample was obtained from a portion of the study subjects. One hundred serum samples were analyzed for 8 dioxin, 10 furan, and 4 coplanar PCB congeners. Multiple linear regression was conducted to assess the predictability of the following covariates: GL sport fish species, age, BMI, gender, years sport fish consumed, and lake. Of the 100 subjects, there were 58 men; 35 consumed sport fish from Lake Michigan, 29 from Lake Huron, and 36 from Lake Erie. The overall average number of GL sport fish meals consumed in the previous 12 months was 43. Lake Erie male and female consumers, on average, ate more GL sport fish, a mean of 57 and 42 meals, respectively, than men and women from the other two lake subgroups. Median total dioxin toxic equivalents (TEq), total furan TEq, and total coplanar PCB TEq were higher among all men than all women (P = 0.0001). Lake trout, salmon, age, BMI, and gender were significant regression predictors of log(total coplanar PCBs). Lake trout, age, gender, and lake were significant regression predictors of log(total furans). Age was the only significant predictor of total dioxin levels. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

Facies analysis shows an abrupt change from high sinuosity gravelly-sandy river (III I millennium BC) to shallow braided channel bars (VII-XII century AD). The second stage features the occurrence of very abundant sediments originated from the erosion of the upstream Calcareous Tufa environments, coupled with abundant fine-to coarse-sized charcoal fragments, derived by selective fires sequentially affecting the wetlands, the riparian vegetation, and the surrounding slopes. Geomorphological and stratigraphical analysis of the Pecora river catchment indicates that the widespread wetlands in which Calcareous Tufa were developing were already active around 4 ka cal BC and their formation ended permanently around the XIII century AD. The age of the decline of the tufa systems in the Pecora catchment seems to disagree with most of those recorded in Europe. Contrastingly, their inactivity is coeval with the occupational period of the medieval archaeological site of Vetricella, located in the surroundings of the palaeochannel, and the onset of upstream wetland reclamation and hydraulic works. These changes led to the reclamation of karst depressions, the capture of karst springs, the bypass of barrages and the deep downcutting of the tufa terraces and the drainage of the corresponding wet environments. This study discusses the anthropogenic factors that during the Early Middle Age affected the Pecora catchment and promoted a permanent change in its physical and biological environment with a new assessment of the river course and the reclamation of large portions of floodplains previously permanently flooded. This study provides new data regarding the decline of fluvial tufa in the Mediterranean area and emphasises the Early Medieval anthropogenic forcing mechanism tethered to agricultural practices and land management, contrasting with the classic historical model which suggests an almost complete abandonment of the alluvial and coastal plains.

Control experiments show that the persistent effect is not an artifact A typical spindle ending response followed 3 stimuli to a VR filament and consisted of a brief, high-frequency discharge in time with the falling limb of the extrafusal contraction. This was followed after a latent period of 100 msec by the persistent excitation. The spindle discharge reappeared, reached a maximum within 300 msec and lasted, with gradually waning effectiveness, for 2.0 sec. The time course of the effect was determined by the following factors: the size of the VR filament stimulated, the strength of the stimuli, the number of stimuli given, the rate of stimulus repetition and the length of the caudal muscle. These factors did not appear to influence the frequency of discharge attained by the spindle at the peak of the effect. The duration of the persistent excitability was not proportional to the tension developed by the contracting extrafusal fibers. In 5 experiments a persistent excitation was not preceded by any recorded extrafusal contraction. A response under these conditions laked the early burst of activity. It is assumed that the persistent excitation owes many if not all its characteristics to some form of fusimotor action. A possible humoral augmentation of the mechanical action of an intrafusal fiber contraction is discussed.																			0022-3751	1469-7793					1964	170	1					39	+		10.1113/jphysiol.1964.sp007312	http://dx.doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1964.sp007312								14135598					WOS:A19646761B00035

The Linkage of the Precipitation in the Selenga River Basin to Midsummer Atmospheric Blocking	ATMOSPHERE												The linkage between atmospheric blocking (blocking frequency, BF) and total monthly July precipitation in the Selenga River Basin, the main tributary of Lake Baikal, for the period 1979-2016 was investigated. Based on empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) analysis, two dominant modes of precipitation over the Selenga River Basin were extracted. The first EOF mode (EOF 1) is related to precipitation fluctuations mainly in the Mongolian part of Selenga; the second EOF mode (EOF 2)-in the Russian part of Selenga. Based on two different modes obtained, the total amount of precipitation individually for the Russian and Mongolian part of Selenga was calculated. Correlation analysis has demonstrated that precipitation over the Mongolian part of the Selenga Basin is positively correlated to blocking over Eastern Siberia/Mongolia (80-120 degrees E, ESM-BF). Precipitation over the Russian part of the Selenga Basin is positively correlated to blocking over the Urals-Western Siberia (50-80 degrees E, UWS-BF) and European blocking (0-50 degrees E, E-BF). However, the linkage is not stable, and after the mid-1990s, the obtained positive correlation became insignificant. The analysis has shown that the dominance of E or ESM-blocking in July was the primary driver of the existence of two precipitation modes over the Selenga River Basin. During 1996-2016, the negative trend of time coefficients of EOF 1 and 2 for precipitation in Selenga had been observed, which was characterized by displacement of positive precipitation anomalies outside the basin. At the same time, there was a weakening of the linkage between precipitation in the Selenga Basin and blocking frequency. We have revealed two wave-like modes over Northern Eurasia and the subtropical part of Eurasia corresponding to E, ESM-blocks in 1979-1995 and 1996-2016. The change of the Northern and subtropical wave modes is one of the causes for the weakening of the linkage between atmospheric blocking and precipitation in the Selenga Basin and as a consequence decreased precipitation in the Russian and Mongolian part of Selenga during 1979-2016.

Yet, some decrease in the catches has been observed in recent years. We explored whether long-lasting size-selective harvesting of pikeperch together with changing climate factors might have triggered a truncation of the size-structure of the pikeperch population and resulted in the weakening of the population. Thus, we analysed long-term commercial fishery statistics (since 1931) and trawl sample data (since 1990) from the Peipsi and Vortsjarv lakes in terms of climate change and fishing pressure. Our study suggests that fisheries had direct negative effects on the size composition of the pikeperch population due to the nearly complete removal of the larger specimens. The truncation of the size-structure of the pikeperch population refers that cascading effect through the food web may occur as the abundance of inferior small fish has increased accordingly. Moreover, we found that climate changes influenced the pikeperch population in the same direction; large cohorts have become more frequent in the Peipsi and Vortsjarv lakes, and 0+ pikeperch are able to survive milder winters even without undergoing ontogenetic diet shifts. Consequently, overdensity of small fish have occurred, these effects might have serious implications for the economies of the poor rural communities that surround the lakes. The present fishing regulations seem to be inappropriate and this may lead to further population weakening and thus should be revised to provide effective protection for large. specimens. However, continued use of active (towed) gear (e.g., Danish seines) and the difficulties in enforcing fishery regulations under transboundary conditions complicate the implementation of policies that might result in more stable pikeperch populations in large Estonian lakes.

Measurements that integrate N processing within watersheds would be particularly useful for assessing the magnitude of this vital service. Because mast N removal processes cause isotopic fractionation, delta N-15 from basal food-chain organisms in aquatic ecosystems can provide information on both N sources and the degree of watershed N processing. As part of EPA's National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NABS), we measured delta N-15 of Chironomidae collected from over 2000 lakes, rivers and streams across the continental USA. Using information on N inputs to watersheds and summer total N concentrations ([TN]) in the water column, we assessed where elevated chironomid delta N-15 would indicate N removal rather than possible enriched sources of N. Chironomid delta N-15 values ranged from - 4 to + 20%o, and were higher in rivers and streams than in lakes, indicating that N in rivers and streams underwent more processing and cycling that preferentially removes N-14 than N in lakes. Chironomid delta N-15 increased with watershed sire, N inputs, and water chemical components, and decreased as precipitation increased. In rivers and streams with high watershed N inputs, we found lower [TN] in streams with higher chironomid delta N-15 values, suggesting high rates of gaseous N loss such as denitrification. At low watershed N inputs, the pattern reversed; streams with elevated chironomid delta N-15 had higher [TN] than streams with lower chironomid delta N-15, possibly indicating unknown sources elevated in delta N-15 such as legacy N, or waste from animals or humans. Chironomid delta N-15 values can be a valuable tool to assess integrated watershed-level N sources, input rates, and processing for water quality monitoring and assessment at large scales.					; Weber, Marc/GXA-0612-2022; Nahlik, Amanda/AAA-2752-2020; Compton, Jana/Q-7194-2019; Brooks, J.

Changes in Types and Area of Postharvest Flooded Fields Available to Waterbirds in Tulare Basin, California	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Conservation efforts to restore historic waterbird distribution and abundance in the Central Valley of California require information on current and historic areas of waterbird habitat. To provide this information, we mapped the area of agricultural fields in the vicinity of the historic Tulare Lake Bed in the Tulare Basin, California, that were treated postharvest with two different flooding regimes that varied in depth and duration of water applied (< 1 cm to 1.5 m water for longer than 1 wk [FLD]; < 1 to 15 cm water for 1 wk or less [IRG]) during August-March 1991-1994 and 2005-2006. We compared our results with published estimates for 1976-1980 and 1981-1987. Area and crops treated postharvest with FLD or IRG flooding differed among years and months. Overall for August through March, weekly area of FLD fields averaged 1,671 ha in 1976-1980 but declined to about half that in later years; the decline was most severe during January-March. Cotton was primarily treated with IRG flooding and comprised 47-95% of the total IRG field area. Other crops were primarily treated with FLD flooding; tomato replaced safflower in 2005-2006. These documented declines since the 1970s in area of FLD fields and changes in crops being flooded postharvest reduce the carrying capacity of the Tulare Basin for waterbirds, a situation that will need to be reversed for restoration of historic waterbird distribution in the Central Valley to be viable. If maintaining agricultural production is a priority and agricultural drainage waters can be disposed of safely, then increasing the extent of FLD grain fields would provide the most benefit for wintering waterbirds; otherwise, restoring and providing adequate water supplies to managed wetlands would most benefit waterbirds.																			1944-687X					DEC	2013	4	2					351	361		10.3996/022013-JFWM-012	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/022013-JFWM-012													WOS:000328898300013

Geological constraints on glacio-isostatic adjustment models of relative sea-level change during deglaciation of Prince Gustav Channel, Antarctic Peninsula	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The recent disintegration of Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves, and the associated accelerated discharge and retreat of continental glaciers, has highlighted the necessity of quantifying the current rate of Antarctic ice mass loss and the regional contributions to future sea-level rise. Observations of present day ice mass change need to be corrected for ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment, a process which must be constrained by geological data. However, there are relatively little geological data on the geometry, volume and melt history of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS) after Termination 1, and during the Holocene so the glacial isostatic correction remains poorly constrained. To address this we provide field constraints on the timing and rate of APIS deglaciation, and changes in relative sea-level (RSL) for the north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula based on geomorphological evidence of former marine limits, and radiocarbon-dated marine-freshwater transitions from a series of isolation basins at different altitudes on Beak Island. Relative sea-level fell from a maximum of c. 15 m above present at c. 8000 cal yr BP, at a rate of 3.91 mm yr(-1) declining to c. 2.11 mm yr(-1) between c. 6900-2900 cal yr BP, 1.63 mm yr(-1) between c. 2900-1800 cal yr BP, and finally to 0.29 mm yr(-1) during the last c. 1800 years. The new Beak Island RSL curve improves the spatial coverage of RSL data in the Antarctic. It is in broad agreement with some glacio-isostatic adjustment models applied to this location, and with work undertaken elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula. These geological and RSL constraints from Beak Island imply significant thinning of the north-eastern APIS by the early Holocene. Further, they provide key data for the glacial isostatic correction required by satellite-derived gravity measurements of contemporary ice mass loss, which can be used to better assess the future contribution of the APIS to rising sea-levels.

Chlachula's interpretation that chipped quartzite cobbles at the contact of Lake Calgary sediments and underlying till represent an "early Late Wisconsinan" lithics industry is the conclusion that Laurentide and Cordilleran ice did not coalesce in Late Wisconsinan time. Contrary to that conclusion are (1) NW-SE-oriented, streamlined landforms in the foothills area which could have been created only by coalescent ice flow, along with numerous radiocarbon dates which indicate that Laurentide ice did not advance to central and western Alberta before Late Wisconsinan time, (2) cosmogenic Cl-36 dates of 12-17 ka on the Foothills Erratics Train, indicating Late Wisconsinan coalescence, (3) an estimated thickness of 1000 m or more of Late Wisconsinan coalesced ice in western Calgary based on mapped Laurentide limits 100 km south of Calgary. Furthermore, recently discovered rare Shield clasts in the till at the Varsity Estates and Silver Springs sites suggest that the till was deposited by ice at least partly of Laurentide origin; as Laurentide ice retreated Lake Calgary would have immediately inundated the site, allowing no time or space for human cobble-chipping. Paleomagnetism indicates that the lake sediments at the Varsity Estates site rotated 25 degrees to the NW after deposition, presumably by rotational slumping. Slumping may have been syndepositional, or due to channel cutting during periods of lake drainage and refilling. Neither scenario either supports or contradicts the archeological interpretation. It is possible that the broken and chipped clasts interpreted to be artifacts were created by natural processes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Given their low-water temperatures, alkalinity, and nutrient levels, small climatic differences can strongly affect their water chemistry, and/or biodiversity. In central Mexico, there are only two high-altitude lakes, and both are within the crater of the Nevado de Toluca volcano. Here, we present a paleolimnological record from one of these lakes: La Luna. Previous paleoenvironmental work showed that it was sensitive to the Little Ice Age (LIA) cooling. Our results show that sediment accumulation began similar to 6900 to 6100 cal. yr BP under periglacial conditions and that lake conditions were established similar to 6000 cal. yr BP. One tephra layer was dated to similar to 5600 cal. yr BP, with no evidence of more recent volcanic activity. The early stages of this lake (6000-4700 cal. yr BP) contained Cladocera and diatom assemblages with different species composition than modern assemblages. This early stage community structure was related to more mesic conditions and cooler winters inferred by the high abundance of planktonic Aulacoseira nivaloides and of Chydorus cf. sphaericus. The establishment of modern limnological conditions after 4700 cal. yr BP is inferred from Cladocera and diatom assemblages similar to recent samples. A reduction in A. nivaloides and low magnetic-susceptibility values suggest lower lakes levels, a trend consistent with lower available moisture in central Mexico after 4000 cal. yr BP. The rest of the sequence shows the impact of two cold periods, the first one around 3000 cal. yr BP, identified by a new increase in Chydorus cf. sphaericus. The second was the larger impact associated with the LIA (AD 1350-1910), and an increase in Cavinula pseudoscutiformis and Pinnularia microstauron suggesting an increase in lake water pH. Also, organic matter and photosynthetic pigments increased during this period showing an increase in nutrient levels and productivity. Finally, the coldest interval during the LIA (AD 1570-1890) is identified by an important reduction in arboreal pollen concentration which points to a wider environmental impact of this cold event.					; Zawisza, Edyta/B-7005-2015; Hernandez, Martin/KIL-7716-2024	Waters, Matthew/0000-0003-1702-3973; Ortega-Guerrero, Beatriz/0000-0002-3823-1926; Caballero, Margarita/0000-0001-5691-0773; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2020	30	6					865	877	0959683620902226	10.1177/0959683620902226	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620902226		FEB 2020											WOS:000517271800001

The current study, conducted in the Ziway-Shala lakes basin, indicates that the F content exceeds the permissible limit for drinking prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO; 1.5 mg/l) in many important wells (up to 20 mg/l), with even more extreme F concentration in hot springs and alkaline lakes (up to 97 and 384 mg/l respectively). The groundwater and surface water from the highlands, typically characterized by low total dissolved solids (TDS) and Ca (Mg)-HCO3 hydrochemical facies, do not show high F content. The subsequent interaction of these waters with the various rocks of the rift valley induces a general increase of the TDS, and a variation of the chemical signature towards Na-HCO3 compositions, with a parallel enrichment of F. The interacting matrixes are mainly rhyolites consisting of volcanic glass and only rare F-bearing accessory minerals (such as alkali amphibole). Comparing the abundance and the composition of the glassy groundmass with other mineral phases, it appears that the former stores most of the total F budget. This glassy material is extremely reactive, and its weathering products (i.e. fluvio/volcano-lacustrine sediments) further concentrate the fluoride. The interaction of these "weathered/reworked" volcanic products with water and carbon dioxide at high pH causes the release of fluoride into the interacting water. This mainly occurs by a process of base-exchange softening with the neo-formed clay minerals (i.e. Ca-Mg uptake by the aquifer matrix, with release of Na into the groundwater). This is plausibly the main enrichment mechanism that explains the high F content of the local groundwater, as evidenced by positive correlation between F, pH, and Na, and inverse correlation between F and Ca (Mg). Saturation indices (SI) have been calculated (using PHREEQC-2) for the different water groups, highlighting that the studied waters are undersaturated in fluorite. In these conditions, fluoride cannot precipitate as CaF2, and so mobilizes freely without forming other complexes. These results have important implications for the development of new exploitation strategies and accurate planning of new drilling sites.					colombani, nicolò/J-2336-2015; colombani, nicolo/J-2336-2015; Godebo, Tewodros/AAA-4603-2020	colombani, nicolo/0000-0002-6593-8505; Beccaluva, Luigi/0000-0002-7457-3579; Bianchini, Gianluca/0000-0002-5030-8068													0943-0105					JUL	2009	58	1					109	118		10.1007/s00254-008-1498-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-008-1498-3													WOS:000267104600014

Two consecutive cold winters in 2005 and 2006 induced exceptional deep mixing, leading to a transient oxygenation of the whole water column. With the ventilation of deep waters and the oxidation of large quantities of reduced solutes, the lake's total redox-balance turned positive, and the overall hypolimnetic oxygen demand of the lake strongly decreased. The disappearance of 150 t dissolved phosphorous (P) during the first ventilation in March 2005 is attributed to the scavenging of water-column-borne P by newly formed metal oxyhydroxides and the temporary transfer to the sediments. The fixed nitrogen (N) inventory was reduced by similar to 30% (1000 t). The water-column turnover induced the nitratation of the previously NO3--free deep hypolimnion by oxidation of large amounts of legacy NH4+ and by mixing with NO3--rich subsurface water masses. Sediments with a strong denitrifying potential, but NO3--starved for decades, were brought in contact with NO3--replete waters, invigorating benthic denitrification and rapid fixed N loss from the lake in spite of the overall more oxygenated conditions. Similarly, a large microbial aerobic CH4 oxidation (MOx) potential in the hypolimnion was capitalized upon ventilation of the deep basin. Almost all CH4, which had been built up over more than 40 years (similar to 2800t), was removed from the water column within 30 days. However, boosted MOx could only partly explain the disappearance of the CH4. The dominant fraction (75%) of the CH4 evaded to the atmosphere, through storage flux upon exposure of anoxic CH4-rich water to the atmosphere. As of today, the North Basin seems far from homeostasis regarding its fixed N and CH4 budgets, and the deep basin's CH4 pool is recharging at a net production rate of similar to 66t y(-1). The size of impending CH4 outbursts will depend on the frequency and intensity of exceptional mixing events in the future.

Elaver Vallis in Aurorae Planum south of Ganges Chasma is an outflow channel system >180 km long, and here inferred to have formed by cataclysmic spillover flooding from a paleolake(s) contained in the Morella crater basin. Ganges Cavus is an enormous 5-km-deep depression of probable collapse origin located in the Morella basin. The fluid responsible for the infilling of the Morella basin likely emerged at least partially through Ganges Cavus or its incipient depression, and it may have been supplied also from small-scale springs in the basin. Similar paleohydrological processes are inferred also in Ophir Planum. It is reasonable to assume that water, sometimes sediment-laden and/or mixed with gases, was the responsible fluid for these phenomena although some of the observed features could be explained by non-aqueous processes such as volcanism. Water emergence may have occurred as consequences of ground ice melting or breaching of cryosphere to release water from the underlying hydrosphere. Dike intrusion is considered to be an important cause of formation for the cavi and smaller depressions in Aurorae and Ophir Plana, explaining also melting of ground ice or breaching of cryosphere. Alternatively, the depressions and crater basins may have been filled by regional groundwater table rising during the period(s) when cryosphere was absent or considerably thin. The large quantities of water necessary for explaining the paleohydrological processes in Aurorae and Ophir Plana could have been derived through crustal migration from the crust of higher plains in western Ophir Planum where water existed in confined aquifers or was produced by melting of ground ice due to magmatic heating or climatic shift, or from a paleolake in Candor Chasma further west.

Paleoecological and paleoenvironmental record of the Late Pleistocene record of Lake Khubsugul (Mongolia) based on ostracod remains	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This paper deals with the investigation of the upper 11.6 m portion of a long drill core (KDP-01) taken from the bottom sediments of Lake Khubsugul. Ostracod species and their assemblages recovered from the core were analyzed. The data are compared with the carbonate and sulfate values obtained from bulk sediment, as well as with the flux of the coarse terrigenous fraction (> 200 m) from the same core. Based on the previously calculated depth-age sedimentary model, the oldest age of the core studied here is about 230 ka. The four ostracod species recovered in the core are Cytherissa lacustris, Candona lepnevae, Limnocythere inopinata and Leucocythere sp. According to the distribution of those ostracods, we distinguish four main periods, each of about 50 ka long. Based on the ecological requirements of extant ostracods, two assemblages typifying a low water level and high salinity, on the first hand, and another representing freshwater and high lake level are recognized. The first "high salinity" ostracods correspond to "cold" periods as seen globally, while "freshwater" ostracods are associated with interglacials. Ostracod valves are absent during interglacial optima. This may be due to chemical dissolution of calcium carbonate related to organic matter decay at the initial stages of diagenesis, probably because during interglacials, in contrast to glacials, organic matter flux reaching the lake bottom were significantly higher. The periodicity in the development of ostracod species assemblages follows 17, 24 and 47 ka cycles related to orbital forcing. Its diversity is correlated with summer temperature fluctuations in northern altitudes for the past 230 ka. The maximum in species diversity follows the temperature maxima, by about 1.5 and 2 ka. Overall, the data obtained demonstrate a correlation between climatic changes and variations in specific and quantitative ratios of ostracod species during the last 230 ka.

Triple oxygen and clumped isotopes in modern soil carbonate along anaridity gradient in the Serengeti, Tanzania	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The isotopic composition of paleosol carbonates is usedextensively to reconstruct past vegetation, climate, and altimetry, but poor constraints on soil evaporation and temperature have limited the utility of oxygen isotopes in the studies. Recent advances in carbonate clumped isotope thermometry (T-Delta 47) allow for independent controls on temperature, but the influence of evaporation remains unresolved. However, the sensitivity of O-18-O-17-O-16 distributions to kinetic fractionation makes it possible to use triple oxygen isotopes (Delta'O-17) to track evaporation in water. Recent work shows the sensitivity of Delta'O-17 to evaporation in lakes and lacustrine carbonates, but little is known about variation of Delta'O-17 in soil carbonates and their potential to track evaporation. For this study, we sampled soils across an aridity gradient in the Serengeti, Tanzania to evaluate how soil carbonate Delta'O-17 tracks soil water evaporation. Modern soil carbonates were collected from 11 sites across a transect of the Serengeti Ecosystem where mean annual precipitation and aridity index range from 499 to 846 mm yr(-1) and 0.33 to 0.55, respectively. delta C-13 values range from -2.7 to 1.8 parts per thousand and reflect C-4 dominated grasslands, whereas delta O-18 values of soil carbonates vary by similar to 8 parts per thousand along a gradient in aridity. T-Delta 47 from these soil carbonates average 23.C (1 sigma +/- 4 degrees C), which does not vary significantly across sites or with depth, likely due to minimal annual variation in temperature at the equator. Using these temperatures for each carbonate, reconstructed d18O values of soil water are up to 6 parts per thousand higher than d18O values of local precipitation and springs, indicating considerable soil water evaporation. The Delta'O-17 values of these soil carbonates range from -162 to -106 per meg and decrease as both aridity and delta O-18 values increase. Our results support the hypothesis that soil water evaporation drives the variance in delta O-18 and Delta'O-17 of soil carbonate in arid climates, demonstrating the potential for soil carbonate Delta'O-17 to track paleoaridity and constrain interpretations of paleosol carbonate delta O-18 records.

J	Rosen, MR; Van Metre, PC				Rosen, Michael R.; Van Metre, Peter C.			Assessment of multiple sources of anthropogenic and natural chemical inputs to a morphologically complex basin, Lake Mead, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					Conference on ACEP Research Forum Scientific Assembly	OCT, 2009	Boston, MA					Lakes with complex morphologies and with different geologic and land-use characteristics in their sub-watersheds could have large differences in natural and anthropogenic chemical inputs to sub-basins in the lake. Lake Mead in southern Nevada and northern Arizona, USA, is one such lake. To assess variations in chemical histories from 1935 to 1998 for major sub-basins of Lake Mead, four sediment cores were taken from three different parts of the reservoir (two from Las Vegas Bay and one from the Overton Arm and Virgin Basin) and analyzed for major and trace elements, radionuclides, and organic compounds. As expected, anthropogenic contaminant inputs are greatest to Las Vegas Bay reflecting inputs from the Las Vegas urban area, although concentrations are low compared to sediment quality guidelines and to other USA lakes. One exception to this pattern was higher Hg in the Virgin Basin core. The Virgin Basin core is located in the main body of the lake (Colorado River channel) and is influenced by the hydrology of the Colorado River. which changed greatly with completion of Glen Canyon Dam upstream in 1963. Major and trace elements in the core show pronounced shifts in the early 1960s and, in many cases, gradually return to concentrations more typical of pre-1960s by the 1980s and 1990s. after the filling of lake Powell. The Overton Arm is the sub-basin least effected by anthropogenic contaminant inputs but has a complex (137)Cs profile with a series of large peaks and valleys over the middle of the core, possibly reflecting fallout from nuclear tests in the 1950s at the Nevada Test Site. The (137)Cs profile suggests a much greater sedimentation rate during testing which we hypothesize results from greatly increased dust fall on the lake and Virgin and Muddy River watersheds. The severe drought in the southwestern USA during the 1950s might also have played a role in variations in sedimentation rate in all of the cores. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Marquette strain lake trout Survived at a significantly higher rate than Seneca strain lake trout prior to age 3 but at similar rates after age 3. The 1984 year-class of lake trout survived at a significantly higher rate than the 1985 year-class of lake trout prior to age 3 but at similar rates after age 3. Emigration of lake trout from the Sheboygan Reef to the nearshore Milwaukee area was similar for the Marquette and Seneca strains but was higher for the 1984 year-class than the 1985 year-class. The mean relative abundance of the 1984 and 1985 year-classes of Marquette and Seneca strains of lake trout varied erratically with age but did not decline with age on the Sheboygan Reef and Milwaukee nearshore area. On the Sheboygan Reef, growth in length, expressed as asymptotic length (L.), differed significantly between the Marquette and Seneca strains of lake trout but did not differ significantly between the 1984 and 1985 year-classes. On the Sheboygan Reef, wounding rates by sea lampreys did not differ significantly between the Marquette and Seneca strains of lake trout among size-classes (633-734, 735-836, and greater than or equal to837 min) during 1994-2000. Our findings suggest that the performance of Marquette strain lake trout was superior to that of Seneca strain lake trout On the Sheboygan Reef in central Lake Michigan.

Beaver Lake, a large epishelf lake in eastern Antarctica was sampled on two occasions during the austral summer of 2000. Two sites, one 1 km offshore and another 6 km offshore were sampled at intervals to depths of 40 and 110 m, respectively. 2. The lake is an end member of ultra-oligotrophic lake systems with a very low carbon pool. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations ranged between 95 and 652 mug L-1. Nutrient levels were generally low with soluble reactive phosphorus ranging from undetectable to 8.4 mug L-1, ammonium ranged between 1.8 and 5.0 mug L-1, nitrate from undetectable to 161 mug L-1 and nitrite 1.1-5.3 mug L-1. 3. Chlorophyll a concentrations (0.39-4.38 mug L-1) showed an unusual distribution with the highest levels close to the lake bottom at the offshore site (110 m) where the phototrophic nanoflagellates (PNAN) displayed strong autofluorescence. 4. Bacterial concentrations were low, with a maximum of 7.60 x 10(7) L-1, as were the concentrations of heterotrophic nanoflagellates that exploit them. 5. Primary production ranged between 19.7 and 25.49 mug C L-1 day(-1) and bacterial production from 0.32 to 1.15 mug C L-1 day(-1). 6. In common with other continental Antarctic lakes, the system was dominated by a microbial plankton. However, a dwarf variety of the calanoid copepod, Boeckella poppei, occurred below 25 m at concentrations of 3-5 L-1. 7. The data suggest that primary production and bacterial production were not limited by nutrient availability, but by other factors, e.g. in the case of bacterial production by organic carbon concentrations and primary production by low temperatures.

J	James, RT; Havens, KE				James, RT; Havens, KE			Outcomes of extreme water levels on water quality of offshore and nearshore regions in a large shallow subtropical lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The effects of extreme water levels on water quality were examined for shallow nearshore vs. deeper offshore regions of Lake Okeechobee, a large subtropical lake in Florida USA. Water quality attributes were compared using mid-summer (June-August) observations for the highest and lowest five years of water levels since 1988. Differences in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), chloride (Cl), color, nutrients, total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (TN: TP), Secchi Disk depth, transparency ratio (defined as the ratio of Secchi Disk depth to total depth), and total suspended solids (TSS) were examined to test hypotheses of interactions within and between the two regions under high and low water levels. The offshore region had consistently higher nutrient and TSS concentrations and lower Secchi Disk depth and transparency ratio. At high water levels within the offshore region, Cl, color, TSS, TP and TN were lower and Secchi Disk depth and color were higher. In contrast, at high water levels within the nearshore region, Chl-a, TP, TN, dissolved inorganic N and TSS concentrations were higher, and Cl, color, and transparency ratio were lower. Submerged aquatic vegetation, epiphyton, and benthic algae grow and compete for nutrients with phytoplankton in the nearshore region, but are absent from the deeper offshore region. The contrasting responses of the two lake regions indicate that water-level management actions taken to reduce eutrophication symptoms (e. g., algal blooms) in one region may not work in the other. In the case of Lake Okeechobee, the nearshore region supports most of the lake's ecological and societal values, so low water levels have a net benefit to ecosystem functions. In other lakes this may not be the case, highlighting the importance of understanding spatial variation of phytoplankton responses to water level in large shallow lakes.																			0003-9136					JUN	2005	163	2					225	239		10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0163-0225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0163-0225													WOS:000230923700006
J	Bonoff, MB; Mattax, BL; Olson, TM				Bonoff, MB; Mattax, BL; Olson, TM			Diel study of Lemolo lake, Douglas county, Oregon	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												As a component of a program of environmental studies associated with relicensing of the North Umpqua Hydroelectric Project, limnological data were routinely collected in Lemolo Lake, a 419 acre reservoir in Douglas County, Oregon, from 1992-1994. In addition to the periodic data, an intensive, short term study was conducted to provide information on diel changes in the reservoir during a period of heightened primary production. This paper describes the results of the diel study. Data collected over a 24-hour period consisted of in situ profiles, continuous monitoring, and sample collection in both the reservoir and the North Umpqua River approximately 800 meters downstream of the dam. Data collected in the reservoir were indicative of eutrophic conditions, and nitrogen limitation. Chlorophyll a concentrations for samples collected August 11 and 12, 1993 were 28.4 and 33.4 mu g/L, respectively; as compared to 1 mu g/L in July. Phytoplankton biomass was dominated by the blue-green algae Anabaena. Secchi depth was markedly reduced during the study period, and epilimnetic pH remained near 9.0. This study highlighted the existence of a surface layer in Lemolo Lake which can become highly productive during the summer months. Withdrawal of hypolimnetic water for power generation and instream flow creates lentic conditions on top of a more lotic hypolimnion. Overall retention of the reservoir is short (15 days), but slow growing cyanobacteria and large bodied cladocerans are indicative of longer retention of Lemolo Lake surface waters. The ability to remain buoyant in the water column, and to thrive in a nitrogen poor system, are particularly important advantages for Anabaena in Lemolo Lake.																			0029-344X						1996	70				2		48	58																WOS:A1996VY39600006

Rare earth and alkali elements in stalagmites, as markers of Mediterranean environmental changes during Termination I	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Speleothems represent a key source of information on climate variations in continental environments as they enable high temporal resolution reconstructions. The stalagmite salam3 presented in this study comes from the Salamandre Cave (SE France, Gard region). Its growth period, determined by Th-230/U-234 chronology and MODAGE extrapolation, falls between 10.91 +/- 1.00 kyr BP and 13.43 +/- 0.25 kyr BP, which corresponds to the transition between the last glacial period and the Holocene. This period is essential for the understanding of past and future climate variations. In this study, trace elements were measured along the growth axis of this stalagmite and results were compared with the elementary composition of bedrock and soil above the cave. Three periods were identified with high Li, Rb, Cs, Th and rare earth element (REE) concentrations, between 13.43 +/- 0.25 and 13.11 +/- 0.27, between 12.70 +/- 0.34 and 12.30 +/- 0.15 kyr, and between 11.31 +/- 0.86 and 11.15 +/- 0.87 kyr. Our results suggest that the alkali metals (alkalis) studied are either associated in the detrital phase with the clay and particle fraction (correlation with Th), or with the organic matter and colloids as complexed ligands (correlation with Mn). To attribute the origin of REE measured within the stalagmite, we compared their pattern with those of soil and bedrock, and two sources were deduced: i) periods with an enrichment in light REE and no cerium anomaly corresponding to mobilization from soil during weathering episodes such as the Bolling-Allerod period; ii) from bedrock during a longer residence time of water in the epikarst such as during the Younger Dryas and the Holocene. Thus, as illustrated in this study, combined analysis of REE and alkalis can provide key information on soil weathering linked to climate/environmental change.

Changes in chlorophyll a concentrations as a function of incubation time allowed two fractions to be separated. Fast sinking rates varied between values of 1.9 m/day when pennate and centric diatoms and coccal cyanobacteria were dominant tin cell concentration) and values of 0.5 m/day when cryptophytes and chrysophytes dominated the <120 mu m size fraction. Slow sinking rates decreased from 0.04 m/day at the beginning of July to 0.02 m/day in late July. Photosynthesis-Irradiance parameters (P-max(B) light saturated photosynthesis and #alpha#(B), light limited photosynthesis) were lower in the fast sinking fraction (P-max(B) = 1.3 - 2.4 mu gC/mu gChl/h and #alpha#(B) = 0.01 - 0.04 mu gC/mu gChl/h/(mu E/m(2)/s) than in the slow or non-sinking one (P-max(B) = 3.9 - 6.4 mu gC/mu gChl/h and #alpha#(B) = 0.03 - 0.08 mu gC/mu gChl/h/(mu E/m(2)/s). P-max(B) and #alpha#B of the planktonic Gloeotrichia echinulata, a colonial broom-forming cyanobacterium, were similar to those found in the fast sinking fraction. Mean floating rates of G. echinulata were around 43 m/d from 15 to 27 July and increased by a factor of two afterwards. G. echinulata colonies migrating upwards from sediments and captured in inverted traps showed a mean floating rate of 104 m/d.

Fluctuations in magnetic susceptibility ( MS), grain size, organic-matter (OM) content, C/N ratios, delta(13)C, and biogenic silica (BSi) record marked environmental changes within the lake and its watershed during the last similar to 33 cal ka. Age control is provided by 31 C-14 ages on plant macrofossils in four cores between 5.2 and 8.6 m long. Major stratigraphic units are traceable throughout the lake subbottom in acoustical profiles, and provisional ages are derived for six prominent tephra beds, which are correlated among the cores. During the interstadial interval between similar to 33 and 30 cal ka, OM and BSi contents are relatively high with values similar to those of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, suggesting a similar level of aquatic productivity. During the glacial interval that followed ( similar to 30 - 15 cal ka), OM and BSi decrease in parallel with declining summer insolation. OM and BSi values remain relatively uniform compared with the higher variability before and after this interval, and they show no major shifts that might correlate with climate fluctuations evidenced by the local moraine record, nor with other global climate changes. The glacial interval includes a clay-rich unit with a depauperate diatom assemblage that records the meltwater spillover of an ice-dammed lake. The meltwater pulse, and therefore the maximum extent of ice attained by a major outlet glacier of the Ahklun Mountain ice cap, lasted from similar to 24 to 22 cal ka. The Pleistocene - Holocene transition ( similar to 15 - 11 cal ka) exhibits the most prominent shifts in OM and BSi, but rapid and dramatic fluctuations in OM and BSi continue throughout the Holocene, indicating pronounced paleoenvrionmental changes.

The turbulence transfer coefficients were verified with short-term eddy correlation runs over Lake Tamnaren. The drag coefficient and the Stanton number attained a stability dependence close to the Businger-Dyer form. During weak or moderate wind conditions, the latent heat flux determined from eddy correlation was close to that calculated with the bulk aerodynamic method using typical values of the Dalton number. However, the independent verification of the Dalton number under conditions of moderate or strong wind suffered from the poor performance of the fast-response hygrometer due to movement of the float. Measurements of the surface roughness suggested a value of the Charnock constant near 0.02. On average, the stratification of the surface layer over both lakes was unstable, but stable conditions occurred almost daily due to advection of warm air from adjacent land areas. High evaporation rates occurred even during stable stratification. The variation of the latent heat flux on an hourly or daily basis was strongly correlated with wind speed. This was also demonstrated by the higher rates of evaporation on the larger Lake Tamnaren compared to the sheltered Lake Raksjo during strong wind conditions. Towards the end of the summer of 1995, the lake surface temperature attained somewhat higher values on Lake Raksjo, attributable to its larger depth. This also resulted in higher daily average sensible and latent heat fluxes compared to Lake Tamnaren in August-September. Thus, in the long-term, the observed daily deviations between the lakes nearly compensated each other. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Teletskoe lake bottom sediments were studied by scanning X-ray microprobe using synchrotron radiation from VEPP-3 (INP SB RAS, Novosibirsk) with an annual time resolution on the time interval of 1500 years. Data on the distribution of isotopes Cs-137, Pb-210, C-14 were used to create an age model: core depth - age. Using this model were constructed time series of sediment cores composition changes. To obtain the time series used a scanning X-ray analysis on synchrotron radiation with 100 micron spatial resolution. At each point of the core at the same time determines the content of more than 20 trace elements: K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ba, Pb, Th, U. Terrigenous elements (Ti, V, Cr, Rb, Y, Th) reflect changes in precipitation in the catchment. Organogenic elements (Br, Zn, U) are more associated with regional temperature changes. The ratio of Rb/Sr shows the size of the particles and associated with spring flooding dynamics. The resulting time series were processed by mathematical methods, including the Hilbert-Huang transformation. Was found a set of cyclical changes in litho-geochemical indicators in the Lake Teletskoe sediments with periods of 3.5+/-0.3; 8.8+/-0.9; 18.9+/-2.0; 37.8+/-1.6; 86+/-10; 164+/-15; 346+/-30; 596+/-71 and 993 years.

Here we use Ash3D, an Eulerian VATDM, to simulate the tephra deposition from the similar to 7.7 ka climactic eruption of Mount Mazama. We investigate how best to apply a VATDM using the ESPs characteristic of a large magnitude eruption (M >= 7). We simplify the approach to focus on the distal deposit as if it were formed by a single phase of Plinian activity. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to use modern wind profiles to simulate the tephra dispersal from a prehistoric eruption; however, this introduces an inherent uncertainty to the subsequent simulations where we explore different ESPs. We show, using the well-documented distal Mazama tephra, that lateral umbrella cloud spreading, rather than advection-diffusion alone, must be included in the VATDM to reproduce the width of the isopachs. In addition, the Ash3D particle size distribution must be modified to simulate the transport and deposition of distal fine-grained (<125 mu m) Mazama ash. With these modifications, the Ash3D simulations reproduce the thickness and grain size of the Mazama tephra deposit. Based on our simulations, however, we conclude that the exact relationship between mass eruption rate and the scale of umbrella cloud spreading remains unresolved. Furthermore, for ground-based grain size distributions to be input directly into Ash3D, further research is required into the atmospheric and particle processes that control the settling behaviour of fine volcanic ash.

Glaciers, isostasy, and eustasy in the Fraser Lowland: A new interpretation of late Pleistocene glaciation across the International Boundary	UNTANGLING THE QUATERNARY PERIOD: A Legacy of Stephen C. Porter	Geological Society of America Special Papers											High-resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) data and new stratigraphic, lake sediment, and radiocarbon constraints help to resolve a long-standing dispute regarding the timing and nature of the Everson interstade and the Sumas stade, the last major events of the Cordilleran ice sheet in the Fraser Lowland. The new data indicate that: (1) an early, maximum Sumas advance occurred roughly 14,500 cal yr B.P. (calibrated C-14 years before 1950), extending into the Salish Sea near Bellingham, Washington; (2) ice retreated north of the International Boundary long enough for forests to establish in deglaciated lowland sites; (3) a rapid, short-lived rise in local relative sea level (RSL) of similar to 20-30 m, possibly related to meltwater pulse 1A or the collapse of a glacio-isostatic forebulge, inundated the U.S. portion of the lowlands up to similar to 130 m above modern sea level; and (4) directly following this transgression at ca. 14,000 cal yr B.P., ice readvanced across the border to nearly the same limit as reached during the early Sumas period. Distinct crosscutting marine strandlines (erosional and depositional remains of emerged marine shorelines), subaerial moraines. and till plains imaged in lidar data indicate that following the maximum extent of the second Sumas advance, local RSL progressively lowered as the glacier fluctuated and gradually thinned. By ca. 13,000 cal yr B.P., ice had retreated north of the border, and local RSL had fallen to within similar to 4 m of modern. A layer of possible loess in sediments in Squalicum Lake suggests a possible third and final Sumas readvance between 13,000 and 11,150 cal yr B.P., at which time a moraine was constructed similar to 8 km south of the border near the town of Sumas, Washington. Together, our results suggest that the concept of a distinct Everson interstade and Sumas stade should be abandoned in favor of a more nuanced "Sumas episode" that encompasses the sequence of events recorded in the Fraser Lowland.

J	Raat, AJP				Raat, AJP			Stocking of sea trout, Salmo trutta, in Lake Veere, south-west Netherlands	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Lake Veere (1750-2050 ha), a brackish water lake in south-west Netherlands, is a former branch of the Oosterschelde. The lake was closed off by the construction of two dams in 1961. Since the early 1970s Lake Veere has been regularly stocked for recreational and commercial fisheries with rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), brown trout, Salmo trutta L., and glass eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.). Between May and September 1996 an experimental stocking of 18 054 trout of sea trout parentage (15-16 cm; 776 kg) was carried out to study their potential for recreational fisheries. The growth and mortality of the stocked trout were estimated from recaptures in eel fyke nets. The production and consumption of the stocked trout were estimated with a bioenergetics model. After 3.5 years (May 1996-November 1999) the stocked trout measured between 50 and 70 cm. The estimated annual total mortality was 84%. During the winter of 1996-1997, the biomass of the stocked trout reached a maximum of about 1800 kg. By November 1999 the biomass was estimated to be 100 kg. The maximum daily consumption by the trout population was 60 g ha(-1) in October 1996 and in June 1997. The total consumption of the stocked trout population over the 3.5-year period was estimated as 54 244 kg. The analysis suggested that the stocked trout used about 0.2% of the average annual primary production of the lake system. Although the growth and initial production of the population are attractive from the perspective of a recreational fishery, the high mortality and infestation with the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer), are serious drawbacks for a future stocking programme with trout in Lake Veere.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				APR	2003	10	2					61	71		10.1046/j.1365-2400.2003.00327.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2400.2003.00327.x													WOS:000181484600001
J	Saros, JE; Fritz, SC; Smith, AJ				Saros, JE; Fritz, SC; Smith, AJ			Shifts in mid- to late-Holocene anion composition in Elk Lake (Grant County, Minnesota): comparison of diatom and ostracode inferences	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The fossil diatom record from Elk Lake (Grant County, Minnesota) was used to reconstruct salinity and brine type between 2640 and 4645 C-14 yr BP. This lake was selected for a brine-type reconstruction because a previous study using fossil-ostracode assemblages indicated a shift in anion composition during the mid-Holocene (Smith et al., 1997). Salinity was reconstructed using a transfer function developed for the Northern Great Plains (NGP) of North America, the reconstruction revealed that salinity was higher (1.5-6.2 g l(-1)) between similar to 4000 and 4645 C-14 yr BP and dropped to 0.35-1.2 g l(-1) after 4000 C-14 yr BP. The anion composition of the system was investigated by passively plotting fossil diatom assemblages onto a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) biplot of the NGP modern samples to determine where core assemblages fell with respect to brine type. The biplot suggests that Elk Lake was mainly a bicarbonate system, but temporarily shifted to sulfate domination at 4080 C-14 yr BP. Both the salinity and brine-type reconstructions essentially agree with results from Smith et al. (1997), but the diatom record provides less-definitive information on anion proportions as compared to anion concentrations. Because shifts in the relative abundances of anion-associated diatom taxa generally tracked the ostracode-inferred changes in brine type, we conclude that fossil diatom assemblages can reveal information on shifts in brine type over time and provide insight into brine evolution and groundwater behavior in a lake system.

In 1992 Hg in surficial sediments (up to 183 mg kg(-1) total Hg and 15.9 mu g kg(-1) methyl Hg) exhibited a classic point source distribution with maximum concentrations adjacent to the mine. However, the ratio of methyl:total Hg in sediments increased with distance from the mine, suggesting either differential transport of methyl Hg or a non-linear relationship between sediment inorganic Hg concentrations and methylation. Water exhibited an even more gradual decline in total Hg concentrations with distance from the mine, in both unfiltered bottom water (max, ca. 70 ng L-1) and filtered surface water (max. ca. 7 ng L-1). In comparison with other studies, Clear Lake exhibits high total Hg in sediment and water, yet relatively low methyl Hg concentrations. Our findings indicate a non-linearity between total and methyl Hg concentrations in sediments. The ratio of methyl:inorganic Hg is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher in the water column than in the sediments, making the methyl fraction much more available for downgradient transport away from the mine. Particulate Hg comprises ca. 33-94% of the total Hg and ca. 25-78% of the methyl Hg in the water column. Geothermal springs do not appear to represent a significant source of Hg to Clear Lake. The present pattern of Hg distribution in Clear Lake shows that water column transport plays some role in the lake-wide contamination of methyl Hg, but high methylation at relatively low inorganic Hg concentrations cannot be ruled out. No quantitative estimate of the area of sediments requiring remediation is possible from these descriptive data alone.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				MAY	1998	104	1-2					77	102		10.1023/A:1004980026183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004980026183													WOS:000073482600006

Fate of Planktothrix-derived toxins in aquatic food webs: A case study in Lake Mindelsee (Germany)	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Blooms of the red, filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens occur frequently in pre-alpine lakes in Europe, often with concomitant toxic microcystin (MC) production. Trophic transfer of MCs has been observed in bivalves, fish, and zooplankton species, while uptake of MCs into Diptera species could facilitate distribution of MCs into terrestrial food webs and habitats. In this study, we characterized a Planktothrix bloom in summer 2019 in Lake Mindelsee and tracked possible trophic transfer and/or bioaccumulation of MCs via analysis of phytoplankton, zooplankton (Daphnia) and emergent aquatic insects (Chaoborus, Chironomidae and Trichoptera). Using 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we found that five sequence variants of Planktothrix spp. were responsible for bloom formation in September and October of 2019, and these MC-producing variants, provisionally identified as P. isothrix and/or P. serta, occurred exclusively in Lake Mindelsee (Germany), while other variants were also detected in nearby Lake Constance. The remaining cyanobacterial community was dominated by Cyanobiaceae species with high species overlap with Lake Constance, suggesting a well-established exchange of cyanobacteria species between the adjacent lakes. With targeted LC-HRMS/MS we identified two MCcongeners, MC-LR and [Asp3]MC-RR with maximum concentrations of 45 ng [Asp3]MC-RR/L in lake water in September. Both MC congeners displayed different predominance patterns, suggesting that two different MCproducing species occurred in a time-dependent manner, whereby [Asp3]MC-RR was clearly associated with the Planktothrix spp. bloom. We demonstrate an exclusive transfer of MC-LR, but not [Asp3]MC-RR, from phytoplankton into zooplankton reaching a 10-fold bioconcentration, yet complete absence of these MC congeners or their conjugates in aquatic insects. The latter demonstrated a limited trophic transfer of MCs from zooplankton to zooplanktivorous insect larvae (e.g., Chaoborus), or direct transfer into other aquatic insects (e.g. Chironomidae and Trichoptera), whether due to avoidance or limited uptake and/or rapid excretion of MCs by higher trophic emergent aquatic insects.

Dolomitic rocks were collected from the upper member of the Eocene Niubao Formation in the Lunpola Basin, consisting of dolomitic mudstone, argillaceous dolomite, dolomite-bearing mudstone, and mud-bearing dolomite. These dolomites are dominated by aphanotopic and microcrystalline dolomites, with minor amounts of euhedral or subhedral powder- and fine-crystalline dolomites. Carbon and oxygen stable isotopes, combined with ubiquitous gypsum in study area, indicate a semisaline continental lake under strong evaporative conditions. The revealed relatively high temperature of the dolomitization (33.8 degrees C-119.1 degrees C), combined with hydrothermal minerals such as cerous phosphate and barite, reflect the participation of dolomite from hot fluids. Moreover, the inferred dolomitization temperatures decrease gradually toward the center of the lake basin, suggesting the resurgence of hydrothermal fluids along a fault zone on the lake margin. This proves that frequent thermal events occurred at the boundary fault of the Lunpola Basin margin during early Himalayan orogenesis. In addition, Jurassic carbonates interacting with hydrothermal fluids, as well as strong evaporation conditions, likely provided favorable conditions for the formation of primary lime sediments. A rich source of Mg2thorn brought by volcanic ash, hydrothermal fluids, and the Jurassic carbonates then created conditions for dolomitization during the depositional period. Strong evaporation under a relatively hot climate enhanced penecontemporaneous dolomitization, thus forming dolomite. Tibetan Plateau was under arid to semiarid climate conditions, and there was a widespread distribution of dolostones in western, central, and northern China during the Eocene period. The hydrothermal dolomites of the upper Niubao Formation testify for active hot springs, whereas lacustrine dolomite imply arid or semiarid climates during the Eocene, in the early stages of Himalayan orogenesis.					; Jiang, Shu/AAL-9260-2020	Xing, Fengcun/0000-0002-7823-2915; chen, xiaoquan/0000-0002-9818-4033; /0000-0002-6272-7649													2324-8858	2324-8866				AUG	2021	9	3					SF11	SF22		10.1190/INT-2020-0195.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/INT-2020-0195.1													WOS:000699850500007

Eddy covariance flux measurements confirm extreme CH4 emissions from a Swiss hydropower reservoir and resolve their short-term variability	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Greenhouse gas budgets quantified via land-surface eddy covariance (EC) flux sites differ significantly from those obtained via inverse modeling. A possible reason for the discrepancy between methods may be our gap in quantitative knowledge of methane (CH4) fluxes. In this study we carried out EC flux measurements during two intensive campaigns in summer 2008 to quantify methane flux from a hydropower reservoir and link its temporal variability to environmental driving forces: water temperature and pressure changes (atmospheric and due to changes in lake level). Methane fluxes were extremely high and highly variable, but consistently showed gas efflux from the lake when the wind was approaching the EC sensors across the open water, as confirmed by floating chamber flux measurements. The average flux was 3.8 +/- 0.4 mu g C m(-2) s(-1) (mean +/- SE) with a median of 1.4 mu g C m(-2) s(-1), which is quite high even compared to tropical reservoirs. Floating chamber fluxes from four selected days confirmed such high fluxes with 7.4 +/- 1.3 mu g C m(-2) s(-1). Fluxes increased exponentially with increasing temperatures, but were decreasing exponentially with increasing atmospheric and/or lake level pressure. A multiple regression using lake surface temperatures (0.1 m depth), temperature at depth (10 m deep in front of the dam), atmospheric pressure, and lake level was able to explain 35.4% of the overall variance. This best fit included each variable averaged over a 9-h moving window, plus the respective short-term residuals thereof. We estimate that an annual average of 3% of the particulate organic matter (POM) input via the river is sufficient to sustain these large CH4 fluxes. To compensate the global warming potential associated with the CH4 effluxes from this hydropower reservoir a 1.3 to 3.7 times larger terrestrial area with net carbon dioxide uptake is needed if a European-scale compilation of grass-lands, croplands and forests is taken as reference. This indicates the potential relevance of temperate reservoirs and lakes in local and regional greenhouse gas budgets.

An especially important group of freshwater invertebrates is the water fleas of the genus Daphnia. These animals are often the dominant herbivores in lakes and ponds. They play a key role in determining water clarity (by grazing on algae) and they are an important part of the diet of fish. Natural chemical signals (kairomones) produced by predators affect the development, life history strategy, and behavior of zooplankton. Laboratory studies of anthropogenic chemicals that have biological activity (xenobiotics), such as the insecticide carbaryl, have demonstrated effects of concentrations in the 1 to 5 ppb range on Daphnia develop ment, growth rate, and swimming behavior in our laboratory experiments. Low concentrations of carbaryl inhibit growth and reproduction and delay maturation, whereas survivorship was not effected. These sublethal exposures to carbaryl reduced Daphnia population growth rate (productivity) by about 15% (at 5 ppb), enough to have significant ecological effects on the rest of the lake community. The insecticide carbaryl showed synergistic interactions with natural chemicals associated with predators (kairomones) that modify Daphnia development and life history characteristics. In addition, there were complex synergisms between carbaryl, the predator odors, and oxygen concentration (low oxygen concentration can be either a natural environmental stress or an anthropogenic stress). Daphnia produce males facultatively, usually in late fall, at other times, reproduction is asexual. There is some evidence from long-term field studies that the maximum frequency of males has declined since the 1940s, when estrogen-mimicking xenobiotics first appeared in lakes. A decrease in sexual recombination will result in maladapted Daphnia relative to their constantly changing environment.																			0091-6765					MAY	1995	103			4			7	11		10.2307/3432405	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3432405								7556027					WOS:A1995RC57700002

The early bird gets the shrimp: confronting assumptions of isotopic equilibrium and homogeneity in a wild bird population	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Because stable isotope distributions in organic material vary systematically across energy gradients that exist in ecosystems, community and population structures, and in individual physiological systems, isotope values in animal tissues have helped address a broad range of questions in animal ecology. It follows that every tissue sample provides an isotopic profile that can be used to study dietary or movement histories of individual animals. Interpretations of these profiles depend on the assumption that metabolic pools are isotopically well mixed and in equilibrium with dietary resources prior to tissue synthesis, and they extend to the population level by assuming isotope profiles are identically distributed for animals using the same proximal dietary resource. As these assumptions are never fully met, studying structure in the variance of tissue isotope values from wild populations is informative. 2. We studied variation in delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2 and delta O-18 data for feathers from a population of eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) that migrate to Great Salt Lake each fall to moult feathers. During this time, they cannot fly and feed almost exclusively on superabundant brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana). The ecological simplicity of this situation minimized the usual spatial and trophic complexities often present in natural studies of feather isotope values. 3. Ranges and variances of isotope values for the feathers were larger than those from previously published studies that report feather isotopic variance, but they were bimodally distributed in all isotope dimensions. Isotope values for proximal dietary resources and local surface water show that some of the feathers we assumed to have been grown locally must have been grown before birds reached isotopic equilibrium with local diet or immediately prior to arrival at Great Salt Lake. 4. Our study provides novel insights about resource use strategies in eared grebes during migration. More generally, it demonstrates the utility of studying variance structures and questioning assumptions implicit in the interpretation of stable isotope data from wild animals.

J	Belmaker, R; Stein, M; Yechieli, Y; Lazar, B				Belmaker, Reuven; Stein, Mordechai; Yechieli, Yoseph; Lazar, Boaz			Controls on the radiocarbon reservoir ages in the modern Dead Sea drainage system and in the last glacial Lake Lisan	RADIOCARBON					19th International Radiocarbon Conference	APR 03-07, 2006	Keble Coll, Oxford, ENGLAND		Keble Coll			Carbon isotopic and chemical compositions of freshwaters feeding the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee (i.e. perennial streams and floods along their stream profiles) were used to constrain the factors that dictate the reservoir ages (RA) of these lakes and the last glacial Lake Lisan. Runoff waters are characterized by high Ca2+, Mg2+, alkalinity, and radiocarbon contents (67-108 pMC), suggesting a major role for C-14 atmospheric exchange reactions (carbonate rock dissolution alone will result in lower pMC values). These exchange processes were corroborated by dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and delta C-13 trends throughout the flood profile. During the evolution from rain to incipient runoff, the C-14(DIC) of the water increases and is accompanied by a DIC increase and delta C-13(DIC) decrease, suggesting an addition of soil CO2, which is characterized by light delta C-13 and high C-14 content. When incipient runoffs evolve to floods, the opposite trends are observed. It appears that the Sea of Galilee, the Dead Sea, and its last glacial precursor, Lake Lisan, maintained uniform but specific RAs of 0.8 +/- 0.1, 2.3 +/- 0.1, and 1.6 +/- 0.3 kyr, respectively. However, applying the C-14 contents of modern Dead Sea water sources to the water mass balance of Lake Lisan reveals that the RA of Lake Lisan is higher than that predicted by the mass balance. This discrepancy may reflect enhanced dissolution of carbonatic dust, changes in the amount of C-14 exchanged in Judean Desert floods, or variations in the contribution of brine and saline springs. Furthermore, the small fluctuations in the Lisan RA (1.6 +/- 0.3 kyr) may reflect small, short-term changes in the relative contributions of these sources.

Potassium isotope system (delta K-41), characterized by significant mass-dependent fractionation, has emerged as an effective tracer for investigating geological processes and material sources. This study presents a comprehensive geochemical investigation of brine salts, intercrystalline brines, and river waters collected from the Qaidam Basin on the northern Tibetan Plateau, China. The ion compositions, hydrochemical characteristics, and potassium isotopic compositions of the samples were analyzed. Analytical results reveal substantial spatial heterogeneity in potassium concentrations ([K+]) across different sample types, ranging from less than 0.01 x 10(3) mg L-1 to similar to 21.12 x 10(3) mg L-1. A distinct [K+] hierarchy emerges: river samples < freshwater lakes < semi saline lakes < brine lakes < intercrystalline brines. Concurrent delta K-41 values exhibit significant variability (-0.77 parts per thousand to + 1.31 parts per thousand), demonstrating systematic correlations with both [K+] concentrations and basin-scale structural features, as evidenced by comparative analysis with published delta Li-7 and delta B-11 datasets. Multivariate isotopic analysis (delta K-41-delta Li-7-delta B-11) coupled with hydrochemical fingerprinting reveals a polygenetic potassium origin for Qaidam's brine systems, involving: multiple mixture of rivers, deep groundwater via fractures (oil field brines, hot springs, etc.), and low-temperature weathering processes of K-rich rock. Notably, delta K-41 signatures show systematic differentiation between two major brine types. The delta K-41 values of chloride type salt lakes is relatively small (-0.57 parts per thousand to 0.22 parts per thousand), whereas those in sulfate type salt lakes is much larger (-0.77 parts per thousand to 1.31 parts per thousand). The results suggest that delta K-41 is a powerful tracer not only for indicating changes in sources but also for reflecting the evolutionary processes of brine.					he, maoyong/ADO-7723-2022; luo, Jiaxin/GQH-1164-2022; Wang, Dawei/GYA-0034-2022; LI, ZHENGYAN/KCY-9486-2024														0169-1368	1872-7360				JUN	2025	181								106632	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2025.106632	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2025.106632		APR 2025											WOS:001480611600001

Hawa; Ahmed, Faruque; Ishiga, Hiroaki; Asaeda, Takashi; Fujino, Takeshi			Present environment of Dam Lake Sambe, southwestern Japan: a geochemical study of bottom sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Geochemical analyses of lakebed and core sediments from Lake Sambe on the outskirts of Oda City in Shimane prefecture in southwestern Japan were carried out in order to assess the water quality and the concentration and distribution patterns of sixteen elements. The lake water showed a stratified condition with respect to dissolved O-2, and As, Fe, and Mn concentrations in the bottom layers which increased in the summer. The chemical composition of the sediments, as measured by X-ray fluorescence, included major and trace elements (P, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Zr, Pb, and Th), and total sulfur (TS). Elevated values of As, Zn, V, Fe, P, and TS were present in several layers of the upper cores (from 0 to 5 cm) and other surface sediments. Increases in the abundances of these metals in lake sediments are probably related to the reducing condition of the sediments, fine-grained organic rich sediments, and post-depositional diagenetic remobilization. Moreover, correlations between the concentrations of trace metals and iron in the sediments suggest their adsorption onto Fe (oxy)hydroxides, whereas correlations with sulfur indicate that they were precipitated as Fe-sulfides. The average abundances of As, Pb, Zn, and Cu exceeded the lowest effect level and Interim Sediment Quality Guideline values that the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment determined to have moderate impact on aquatic organisms. In addition, concentrations of As and Zn exceeded the Coastal Ocean Sediment Database threshold value, indicating potentially toxic levels. Therefore, the presence of trace metals in the lake sediments may result in adverse effects on biota health.

J	Pettibone, GW; Irvine, KN				Pettibone, GW; Irvine, KN			Levels and sources of indicator bacteria associated with the Buffalo River ''Area of Concern,'' Buffalo, New York	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Elevated levels of indicator bacteria within an Area of Concern (AOC) are recognized by the International Joint Commission as a water quality impairment. Combined sewer overflows are assumed to be the major source of bacteria to the Buffalo River AOC and current remediation strategies largely disregard other potential sources, including waters entering the river from the upper watershed. To assess the influence of upstream sources on pollution indicator bacteria levels in the Buffalo River, fecal coliform (FC) and fecal streptococci (FS) densities were determined at 12 sites in the Buffalo River watershed during 1992-1993. FC and FS densities were highly correlated throughout the year (r = > 0.83) and the mean levels of both indicator groups increased at sites closer to the Buffalo River. The highest levels of indicator bacteria in the water column coincided with rainfall events but FC levels violated New York State water quality standards at the three sites closest to the Buffalo River in 79% of all samples. Total suspended solids were strongly correlated with FC (r = 0.86) in the upper watershed during the summer months when flow velocities were greatest, and solids may play an important role in transporting bacteria into the Buffalo River. The fluctuations and relative magnitude of indicator bacteria levels were similar in the Buffalo River and at the upstream sites in the absence of combined sewer overflow events. The data depict a strong influence of upstream waters on the Buffalo River AOC. Upstream tributaries may make important contributions to the pollutant loading in AOCs and should not be overlooked in remediation planning.

Introducing other submersed plants to substitute Potamogeton crispus can improve the structure of the aquatic plant community and to reduce the growth of Potamogeton crispus to some degree, but the effect is poor and short-lived. Considering the fact that Potamogeton crispus is sensitive to changes in light intensity, the two methods of shading the water surface and introduction of other submerged plants were used synergistically. In a large simulated experimental pool, light intensity was reduced by placing black polyethylene floating spheres on the water surface and planting three species of submerged plants, namely, Vallisneria natans , Hydrilla verticillata and Potamogeton wrightii . Changes in the physico-chemical properties of the experimental pool water and the physiological and biochemical characteristics (morphology, chlorophyll, biomass, antioxidant enzymes and malondialdehyde) of the submerged plants during the period of 0 -40 d were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) After the light intensity was reduced by 85%, Potamogeton crispus seedlings showed a significant decrease in biomass and chlorophyll content and died in large numbers within 20 -30 days. (2) Catalase is the main tool for Potamogeton crispus to cope with low light stress. The activities of various antioxidant enzymes and the malondialdehyde content of Potamogeton crispus showed a decreasing trend under shade conditions, but the catalase activity increased dramatically. (3) Vallisneria natans is more tolerant of low light conditions than the other two submersed plant species. Therefore, we tried to reduce the biomass of Potamogeton crispus by combing introduction of other submersed plants and shading treatment. (4) The water quality objectives remained stable over the period of the trial, indicating that short-term shading does not have a negative impact on the quality of the water quality.

This study concentrates on the lower West River area in Southern China, offering high-resolution reconstructions of vegetation changes over the last 9000 years. Our findings reveal that during the Holocene Climatic Optimum (9-5 ka BP), the area was predominantly covered by dense evergreen broad-leaved forests. Around 5.1 ka BP, the emergence of marsh forests, as evidenced by abundant pollen of Glyptostrobus and in situ buried woods and roots, indicated a transition towards a wetland ecosystem. Notably, a thriving wetland environment and high production of peat deposits dating from 4.3 ka to 2.5 ka BP reflect the continuous drop of lake levels and the formation of swamps driven by a climatic pattern marked by decreased precipitation, potentially linked to a reduction in summer monsoon intensity during the latter part of the Holocene. This period of wetland expansion also coincides with the earliest evidence of rice cultivation in Southern China, suggesting a relationship between agricultural development and regional landscape changes. Additionally, millennial-scale paleo-megafloods are not only identified by lithological features but also by pollen taxa and principal component analysis. Despite the temporary disruptions of the marsh forest, it demonstrated resilience, quickly recovering within decades. By approximately 2.5 ka BP, a significant increase in rice-type Poaceae pollen and Pteridophyte spores, alongside the sharp decline of Glyptostrobus and a decrease in arboreal taxa, were observed. This shift in pollen spectra, coupled with a PC1 curve of principal component analysis, points to intensified human activity as a primary driver behind the collapse of the local wetland ecosystem. These findings align with regional evidence from the Pearl River Delta and coastal Southern China, highlighting extensive human intervention in natural forests and the onset of large-scale agriculture post-2.5 ka BP.

J	Talbot, CJ				Talbot, CJ			Ice ages and nuclear waste isolation	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY												The greatest natural threats to the integrity of the geological barriers to nuclear wastes isolated in cavities mined at depths between 400 and 800 m are likely during rapid retreats of future ice sheets. The next major glacial retreat is expected at ca 70 ka, well within the lifetime of high grade nuclear waste, but it is not yet clear how long man's greenhouse effect may delay it. This contribution discusses the potential problems posed to European waste isolation sites during erosion by ice and over-pressurizing of meltwater and gasses in a lithosphere flexed by major ice sheets. These depend on the target rocks and the location of the site with respect to the ice-streams and margins of future ice sheets of particular size. No sites are planned under the centres of future ice sheets in Europe where end-glacial earthquakes can be expected to reactivate major faults, nor where ice can be expected to deepen and lengthen fjords along the Atlantic coast. Sites in the Alps may be vulnerable to radical changes in the patterns of glacial troughs. The stability and geohydrology of sites in coastal areas beyond future ice margins are threatened by river gorges when sea level falls ca 125 m or, in enclosed basins like the Mediterranean, ever lower. The greatest problems are likely in lowland regions exposed by the rapid retreat of thick ice fronts where large lakes on or under thick warm-based ice are dammed by more distal cold-based ice. Groundwater in subhorizontal fractures dilated by glacial unloading may reach over-pressures capable of hydraulically lifting megablocks of bedrock with fracture permeability and-or the ice damming them so that less permeable substrates are susceptible to incisions eroded to depths of ca 360 at locations controlled mainly by ice topography, kinematics and history.

Using Japanese eels as natural samplers (n = 881), we revealed the spatial heterogeneity of energy flow among three successive estuarine segments (upper, middle, and lower estuaries) of the Hamana Lake-Miyakoda River system on the Pacific side of central Honshu, Japan. In the upper estuary which serves as the nursery ground for eels, the predominant small eels (body weight <30 g) fed mainly on polychaetes (58.8% IRI [index of relative importance]), mainly Hediste atoka. This polychaete species depends on the detritus food chain driven by terrestrial inputs, and the detritus food chain appears to be predominant in the upper estuary. However, large eels (body weight >150 g) fed directly on terrestrial subsidies in the form of fallen insects (49.0% IRI) and earthworms (20.2% IRI), indicating that the detritus food chain does not directly affect the diet of large eels. Terrestrial subsidies in the form of living organisms do not contribute to the diet of eels in the adjacent middle estuary, which is the main growth habitat for eels within an estuary. However, small eels depend on terrestrial subsidies by feeding on oysters (71.6% IRI), which assimilate terrestrial particulate organic matter. The pre-dominant medium eels were highly dependent on the high diversity and biomass of prey groups, as indicated by the high % IRI values of several groups, such as infaunal bivalves (31.7% IRI), oysters (19.0% IRI), amphipods (22.6% IRI), and polychaetes (16.4% IRI). Eelgrass beds usually serve as shelters and foraging areas for medium and large eels in the lower estuary. Despite the high species diversity around seagrass meadows, the eels concentrated on infaunal bivalves (85.4% IRI) with high biomass, predominantly Anadara sp. In addition to being tools for monitoring fauna, eels as natural samplers provide insights into the energy flow in ecosystems.

J	BELL, RT; TRANVIK, L				BELL, RT; TRANVIK, L			IMPACT OF ACIDIFICATION AND LIMING ON THE MICROBIAL ECOLOGY OF LAKES	AMBIO												There is a lack of consensus about the effects of acidification on the microbial component of aquatic food webs. From a review of the literature it is apparent that negative effects of acidification are most often observed in disturbed systems, e.g. laboratory systems, sediment-water slurries, but less frequently in relatively undisturbed, e.g. intact sediment cores, large in situ enclosures, whole lake manipulations and follow-up. We measured several microbial rates in experimentally acidified and limed enclosures in a mesohumic lake and found no consistent differences between the treatments in any parameter that would affect the balance of production and degradation. A field survey of 10 similar acidified mesohumic lakes, 5 of which were limed, also indicated no effects of acidity on microbial metabolism. Water chemistry and pelagic community structure were studied in a clearwater, acidified lake before and after liming. Bacterial biomass was greater than algal biomass in the limed lake. After liming, the dominant phytoplankter (almost-equal-to 60% of late summer phytoplankton biomass), the cyanobacterium, Merismopedia tenuissima, disappeared and planktonic bacterial biomass doubled. Although bacterial production was similar under acid and limed conditions, the potential of the bacterial response to fluctuations in nutrients and food-web structure was greater after liming. Many effects on microbes were mediated indirectly via the presence or absence of Merismopedia. Bacteria were co-limited by DOC and inorganic N/P during acid conditions. Bacterial production at that time was only enhanced by simultaneous additions of C, N, P, which in turn stimulated the entire microbial food web (flagellates, ciliates).

These components, however, are not properly measured by current EPA accepted methods, such as the R&P TEOM monitor, due to loss of semivolatile material (SVM) from particles in the heated environment of the filter during sampling. The accurate determination of semivolatile material is important due to the possible effects of these species on human health, visibility, and global climate change. The concentration and composition of fine particulate material were determined using a combination of continuous and integrated samplers at the Brigham Young University-EPA Environmental Monitoring for Public Access and Community Tracking (BYU-EPA EMPACT) monitoring site in Salt Lake City, Utah over a six-day sampling period (30 January to 4 February) during the winter of 2001. Continuous samples were collected using a RAMS (total PM2.5 mass), a TEOM monitor (nonvolatile PM2.5 mass), an Aethalometer (elemental carbon), a TSI CPC (particle count), and a Nephelometer (light scattering by particles, bsp). Fine particle composition and mass were determined on a three-hour basis using the PC-BOSS diffusion denuder sampler. Total PM2.5 mass-determined with the RAMS agreed with constructed mass determined from the chemical composition measured in collocated PC-BOSS-integrated samples. Results from this study indicate that semivolatile material (ammonium nitrate and semivolatile organic compounds) is a significant component of fine particle mass. Semivolatile organic compounds were the major contributor to light scattering during the six-day sampling period. Semivolatile nitrate, but not organic material, was suggested to be hygroscopic by the nephelometric data. The majority of the SVM observed appeared to be secondary material formed from photochemical reactions of the organic and NOx emissions from mobile sources and wood smoke combustion.

During the summer of 2001, physical, chemical, and biological measurements in the canyon were taken to better understand the hydrodynamic setting of and the feeding relationships among, the pelagic and benthic communities. Results show that currents were strongly tidal, and transport, where measured, was primarily up and into the canyon below shelf depth as previous studies in the canyon have shown. Temperature time series suggests that the largest diurnal oscillations occurred at, or were trapped near, the bottom of the canyon. Within the upper canyon, subtidal temperature was correlated with upper-level shelf-edge currents, linking subtidal upwelling events in the canyon with near-surface subtidal along-shore flow. Invertebrates, such as shrimp. euphausiids, and squid, as well as mesopelagic fishes, dominated the Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl catches along the canyon walls. Large trawl catches were comprised mainly of lake and rockfishes (shallow trawls) and macrourids, scorpaenids, stomiids. and zoarcids (bottom trawls). Gut-content analysis of rockfishes and lanternfishes revealed substantial use of midwater prey such as euphausiids and mesopelagic fishes. The delta(13)C values of fishes and invertebrates reflected local primary production, as indicated by particulate organic matter (POM) delta(13)C values from samples collected at various depths along the axis of the canyon, as well as across the canyon at several sites. The delta(15)N values of fishes and invertebrates indicated lanternfishes, along with euphausiids, amphipods, shrimp and squid, may be important dietary components of higher-tropic-level fishes in both the benthic and benthopelagic food webs. The delta(13)C and delta(15)N values of Sebastes species showed significant enrichment in the adults of species that are largely piscivorous relative to the values of adults of more omnivorous species.

J	Innes, DJ				Innes, DJ			Sexual reproduction of Daphnia pulex in a temporary habitat	OECOLOGIA												Species of Daphnia (Crustacea: Cladocera) typically reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis, in which a period of all-female parthenogenetic reproduction is followed by sexual reproduction. Sex in Daphnia is determined by the environment, with factors such as temperature, photoperiod and crowding stimulating the production of males and sexual females. Previous studies on Daphnia pulex from temporary pond habitats demonstrated the coexistence of male-producing and non-male-producing (NMP) females, as determined under crowding in the laboratory. A strong genetic component to this sex allocation variation suggested that sex expression in D. pulex is better described as a result of genotype-environment interaction. The present study examined the switch from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction in two temporary-pond populations of D. pulex. Both populations showed a very early investment in sexual reproduction, independent of population density, by producing males very soon after the populations were reestablished from resting eggs in the early spring. Approximately 40% of the initial broods were male. Additional evidence for gender specialization was obtained by observing the sex of two or three successive broods for 85 individual females. Fifty-eight females produced successive broods of females, 13 females produced successive broods of males and 14 females produced successive broods which included both male and female broods. Females that produced successive female broods under natural conditions included a higher frequency of NMP females compared to a random sample of females, confirming the existence of NMP females. Sexual females were observed in both populations after the first appearence of males, suggesting that the presence of males may stimulate the production of sexual females. For D. pulex populations in a temporary environment, there appears to be an increased emphasis on sexual reproduction and a decreased influence of the environment on sex determination, compared to Daphnia populations in more permanent habitats.

J	Wright, HE				Wright, HE			Contrasts in the Quaternary of mid-North America and mid-Eurasia: notes on Quaternary landscapes of western Siberia	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The West Siberian Plain was formed by marine deposits that extended from the Mediterranean basin to the arctic. Tectonic action later produced a striking series of long straight NE-SW grabens in the Southern part of the plain. Pleistocene advance of the Kara ice sheet onto the continent resulted in blockage of the Ob and Yenisey rivers to form huge proglacial lakes that drained through these grabens South via the Turgay Pass and the Aral, Caspian, Black and Mediterranean seas to the North Atlantic Ocean, but during the Last Glacial Maximum (late Weichselian, isotope stage 2), the Kara ice sheet did not advance onto the continent in northwestern Siberia. The Altai Mountains, which bound the West Siberian Plain on the South, contained large deep intermontane ice-dammed lakes, which drained catastrophically when the ice dams broke, forming giant ripples on the basin floors. Pollen studies of glacial lakes indicate that the Lateglacial steppe vegetation and dry climatic conditions continued into the early Holocene as Summer insolation maintained high levels. Permafrost development on a drained lake floor in the western Altai Mountains resulted in the formation of groups of small pingos. In North America the growth and wastage of the huge Laurentide ice sheet had an indirect role in the climatic history of western Siberia during the Glacial and Lateglacial periods, after which the climate was more affected directly by insolation changes, whereas in North America in the early Holocene the insolation factor was Coupled with the climatic effects of the slow wastage of the ice sheet, and the time of maximum dryness was postponed until the mid-Holocene.

Authorization for incidental,take of KBBs was granted with US Fish and Wildlife Service Terms and Conditions intended to restore and enhance disturbed KBB habitat. In compliance with these conditions, KBB-occupied right-of-way was reseeded with a combination of native grasses, lupine, and other KBB nectar species in fall 1998. Lakehead is required to monitor the right-of-way for three years to determine the success of this restoration effort. Monitoring includes assessment of frequency and density of lupine and nectar plants, as well as KBB surveys, which consist of a modified presence/absence survey during the first year and formal counts in the subsequent two years. First-year monitoring was conducted in July 1999 during the peak of the KBB second flight. KBBs were observed at 86% of the sample sites, which was consistent with second-flight results of pre-construction surveys. Planted nectar species were present on 60-98% of the reseeded property tracts depending on the species, reflecting good diversity. Frequency within sample plots varied greatly by species, ranging from zero to 100%. First-year density data reflect the small size of the seedlings, but seedling coverage was generally good, with some variation between sites due to soil conditions and amount of disturbance unrelated to the project. Preliminary results suggest that restoration efforts will, at a minimum, replace disturbed habitat, and will likely enhance KBB habitat in the long term.																					0-080-44117-3				2002							345	354																WOS:000180304900039

With climate change, the boundaries between fluvial-dominated and eolian-dominated areas may shift. Although there have been few reports in the North American literature of river systems blocked by dune sand, our work in the Nebraska Sand Hills provides evidence of multiple episodes of such blockage events. During prolonged arid intervals in latest Pleistocene and middle Holocene time, eolian dune sand blocked two large valley systems in western Nebraska. These blockages raised the water table of the High Plains aquifer as much as 25 m over an area of 7000 km(2) and created over one thousand lakes. Wetlands far removed from the discharge points of the buried paleovalley system are strongly alkaline (exceeding 250 000 mg/L total dissolved solids [TDS]). Relatively fresh (280 mg/L TDS), flow-through lakes are present at the distal end of the system where the gradient of the water table is steep and the cross section of the buried valley is large. Anomalously thick marsh and lake sediments accumulated in deep paleovalleys upstream of dune dams near the southern margin of the Sand Hills. Our cores and radiocarbon dates from Blue and Crescent Lakes reveal their histories to be quite distinct from adjacent Swan Lake; these differences are best explained by multiple blockage events. Our work explains why lakes are most abundant in the driest part of the Sand Hills. It also provides another line of evidence for major dune activity in the Sand Hills region during Holocene time and shows that factors other than regional climate, specifically location, height, and hydraulic conductivity of dune dams, can control the rise and fall of the ground-water table and the chemistry of lakes.																			0016-7606					APR	1995	107	4					396	406		10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107<0396:DDPOTN>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107<0396:DDPOTN>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995QR84500002

Efficacy of a large-scale constructed wetland to remove phosphorus and suspended solids from Lake Apopka, Florida	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed wetlands treat various types of waters. We examined the efficacy of a large-scale constructed wetland (the marsh flow-way), which was designed to treat lake water by maximizing the removal rate of total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended solids (TSS) from Lake Apopka. The flow-way was constructed on former agricultural land and has four independently operated wetland cells (treatment area is similar to 276 ha). During the operating period (November 2003-March 2007), hydraulic loading rate (HLR) was high, with annual median values between 32 and 49 m yr(-1). On average, 87% of the treated water returned to the lake, and the remainder flowed downstream. The wetland released soluble P (mostly soluble reactive P [SRP]), which was probably caused by P release from soils and/or senescing vegetation. This release was high initially and high during summers, but declined overall with time. Despite SRP release, the system removed TP over annual periods, with maximum net TP removal in 2007 (1.8 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Most of the incoming and retained P was particulate. Median percent mass removal was 58% for particulate P (PP) and about 30% for TP. Total suspended solids were always removed (median removal rate = 1.4 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) and the percent mass removal was high (93%). Median first-order rate constants (P-k-C* model) were 43 m yr(-1) for TP and 228 m yr(-1) for TSS. Removal rates of TP and PP appeared to increase linearly up to the highest loading (5-6 g m(-2) yr(-1)), whereas removal rate of TSS may have approached an asymptote at loading >3 kg m(-2) yr(-1). We found that C* declined from 0.070 in the previous pilot project to 0.045 mg L-1 in the current flow-way system. Continued reduction in C* as TP declines in inflow lake water would assist P removal. Otherwise, selective wetland operation during periods of high lakewater TP concentrations may be required in the future to maintain net P removal.

J	HENDERSON, BA; NEPSZY, SJ				HENDERSON, BA; NEPSZY, SJ			FACTORS AFFECTING RECRUITMENT AND MORTALITY-RATES OF RAINBOW SMELT (OSMERUS-MORDAX) IN LAKE ERIE, 1963-85	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recruitment of young-of-the-year (YOY) rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) per parent was not dependent upon water temperature (rate of warming and average temperature) during spawning, Glugea infestation, or parental stock-size. Only in the eastern basin of Lake Erie was recruitment to age 1 + years-old positively correlatred with the YOY index in the preceding summer. Recruitment of age 1 + year-old smelt was not related to parental stock-size. Recruitment (age 1 + years-old) per spawner was inversely related to the abundance of age 1 year-old smelt present during the year of hatch in both the eastern and central basins of Lake Erie. This could be taken as evidence to support the hypothesis that the alternating dominance of year-classes (1963-74) was caused by cannibalism of YOY by age 1 year-old smelt. After 1974, alternating year-class-dominance was not evident; we considered three possible explantations for the absence of strong year-classes. First, the size at age declined in both basins during the study so that more classes could have fed opitmally on young-of-year (YOY), resulting in a poorer survival of YOY smelt. Second, the harvest of smelt increased greatly after 1974, particularly for yearling smelt, so that year-class strength measured by the abundance of yearlings was reduced by fishing. Third, predation on smelt by stocked salmonids probably increased after 1974 as the stocking rates increased. Adult total mortality rates (ages 2 and 3 years-old) were positively related to stock density providing some evidence for density dependent mortality of smelt. There was no evidence that the variations in adult mortality were associated with the incidence of Glugea.																			0380-1330						1989	15	2					357	366		10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71488-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71488-X													WOS:A1989AL80300016

As such, the investigation of their sedimentary dynamics is the only way to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental evolution in these peculiar regions. Here, the basin-scale sedimentary dynamics of the Agadir-Tissint Feija (i.e. feija is the local name for lowlands) are discussed together with new palaeoenvironmental information on the late Quaternary in the north-western Sahara margin. The succession consists of up to ca 40 m thick fluvio-lacustrine deposits subdivided into three depositional sequences (S1-S3) that were deposited between ca 75 ka and ca 10 ka. S1 and S2 reflect the evolution of a palaeolake intercalated by carbonate-rich palustrine to alluvial plain environments, while S3 shows the transition to an entirely clastic alluvial plain environment. The three sequences are genetically associated with three pulses of tufa buildups at the outlet of the depocentre. Each pulse of tufa buildup is attributed to wet conditions, while each interruption is associated with drier conditions. The wet-dry alternation at the origin of S1 fits with summer insolation fluctuation suggesting that precession parameters may have paced long-term climate variability in the area. Superimposed on wet-dry cycles, submillennial-scale (750-900 year) shorter-term lake fluctuations are identified in S1 and S2; their origins may be related to North Atlantic Oscillation mechanisms. Furthermore, the sudden increase in clastic sediment supply in S3 evidences a change in sediment production in the catchment area attributed to lower temperatures established during the last glacial period. Finally, this newly identified continental archive is unique at the northern Sahara margin; it enables reconstructions of the local and regional hydrological conditions during the last glacial cycle. Even if a more systematic investigation of palaeoclimate forcing is still necessary, the Agadir-Tissint Feija will potentially bring important information to understand past and anticipate future regional climate change.

Fifteen strains of STEC were monitored, individually, in untreated well water samples incubated at 10 and 22 degrees C for 56 days. The strains were selected from three serogroups (O26, Ol11 and O157) and represented five distinct ERIC (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic concensus)-genotypes. The microcosms were prepared in triplicate and inoculated at an initial cell density of about 7.0 log CFU/ml well water. At 10 degrees C, the cell density of five STEC strains fell below the detection limit of 0.8 log CFU/ml by day 56. Of the ten persisting strains, four showed superior survival with cell densities decreasing to an average of about 5 log CFU/ml while the remaining six strains showed moderate levels of survival, decreasing to an average cell density of about 3 log CFU/ml. At 22 degrees C, strain H32 (genotype I) and H15 (genotype B) persisted at 1.1 log CFU/ml and 2.2 log CFU/ml in 56 days, respectively. The other 13 STEC strains dropped below the detection limit between weeks 3 to 8. The 15 strains demonstrated highly variable levels of survival with no correlation between ERIC-genotypes or serogroups and the strains' ability to persist in the well water samples. Although strain H32 (O157:H7) persisted significantly longer than strain H22 (O157:H7) in natural well water at both 10 and 22 degrees C, both strains survived equally well in sterile well water, indicating that individual STEC strains vary in their ability to compete with background microbial populations.					; Rosa, Bruce/MFK-3172-2025	Topp, Edward/0000-0002-8273-9372; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				NOV	2006	177	1-4					367	382		10.1007/s11270-006-9179-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-006-9179-x													WOS:000242628300022

Evolution of paleo sea-surface conditions over the last 600 years in the Mackenzie Trough, Beaufort Sea (Canada)	MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY												In order to document long-term climate trends and predict future climate change for the Arctic, we need to look at the geological record to establish the link between historical and pre-industrial sea-surface parameters. Dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) are used as proxy indicators of sea-surface parameters (temperature, salinity, sea-ice cover, primary productivity) jointly with transfer functions and a modern dinocyst reference database, to reconstruct the evolution of sea-surface conditions at decadal and multi-decadal timescales. Here we present the fossil dinocyst assemblages established from three sediment cores collected along an inshore-offshore transect in the Mackenzie Trough during the 2004 CASES (Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study) cruise. The chronology of each core was determined using Pb-210 activity and AMS-C-14 measurements in core 912A. Sediment cores 912A, 909B and 906B cover the last 600,200 and 100 years respectively. Palynomorph influxes increase from the bottom to the top of each core, illustrating an increasing productivity over the last similar to 600 years until similar to 1850 AD, when we observe a decrease of productivity until today. We determined a succession of two assemblages over the last similar to 600 years. Assemblage 1, at the base of each core, is mostly composed of dinocysts from heterotrophic taxa. The modern assemblage (Assemblage II at the top of each core) is mostly composed of dinocysts from autotrophic taxa. Quantitative reconstructions of sea-surface parameters reveal a sharp increase in summer (August) temperature (similar to 2 to 5 degrees C) throughout the study area from similar to 1400 AD until similar to 1800-1850 AD, after which the increase (between similar to 0.5 and 1.0 degrees C) is much slower until modern times.

J	Chiodini, G; Marini, L; Russo, M				Chiodini, G; Marini, L; Russo, M			Geochemical evidence for the existence of high-temperature hydrothermal brines at Vesuvio volcano, Italy	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												A high-temperature hydrothermal system is present underneath the crater area of Vesuvio volcano. It is suggested that NaCl brines reside in the high-temperature reservoir and influence the chemical composition of the gases discharged by the fumaroles of the crater bottom (vents FC1, FC2, and FC5). These have typical hydrothermal compositions, with H2O and CO2 as major components, followed by H-2, H2S, N-2, CH4, and CO (in order of decreasing contents) and undetectable SO2, HCl, and HF. Fumarolic H2O is either meteoric water enriched in O-18 through high-temperature water-rock oxygen isotope exchange or a mixture of meteoric and are-type magmatic water. Fumarolic CO(2)is mainly generated by decarbonation reactions of marine carbonates, but the addition of small amounts of magmatic CO2 is also possible. All investigated gas species (H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, H-2, H2S, N-2, and NH3) equilibrate, probably in a saturated vapor phase, at temperatures of 360 to 370 degreesC for vent FC1 and 430 to 445 degreesC for vents FC2 and FC5. These temperatures are confirmed by the H-2-Ar geoindicator. The minimum salt content of the liquid phase coexisting with the vapor phase is similar to 14.9 wt.% NaCl, whereas its maximum salinity corresponds to halite saturation (49.2-52.5 wt.% NaCl). These poorly constrained salinities of NaCl brines reflect in large uncertainties in total fluid pressures, which are estimated to be 260 to 480 bar for vents FC2 and FC5 and 130 to 220 bar for vent FC1. Pressurization in some parts of the hydrothermal system, and its subsequent discharge through hydrofracturing, could explain the relatively frequent seismic crises recorded in the Vesuvio area after the last eruption. An important heat source responsible for hydrothermal circulation is represented by the hot rocks of the eruptive conduits, which have been active from 1631 to 1944. Geochemical evidence suggests that no input of fresh magma at shallow depths took place after the end of the last eruptive period. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Nevertheless, its potential ecological risks and feasibility should be examined and identified prior to its application in large natural lakes given the multiple functions of these water bodies in human health and welfare. In situ mesocosm experiments on modified soil flocculation were performed in Lake Taihu during summer 2010 and 2011. Chitosan-moclifiecl kaolinite (CMK) soil was used to flocculate algal blooms and improve water transparency to facilitate the re-establishment of the submersed macrophyte Vailisneria natans in this shallow eutrophic lake. Moreover, the ecological effects of CMK soil were assessed. Results showed that repeated additions of CMK (0.3 g/L for each time) improved water quality in terms of Chl-a, TN, and TP concentrations; TN/TP ratio; turbidity; reclox conditions; and nitrification and denitrification activities. These effects lasted for.48 clays. After the fourth close of CMK, the biomass of all phytoplankton categories, except for that of Cryptophyta, decreased by >90% (ca. 1-2 x 106 cell/L or 0.38-0.55 mg/L of wet weight). Zooplankton biomass markedly decreased after the first CMK addition, and copepods became dominant. These effects, however, did not last for the long term. Most importantly, submersed V. natans was restored successfully when water clarity and quality were improved through repeated CMK flocculation. Nevertheless, the indices of carbohydrate depletion and free amino acid accumulation indicated that the plant experienced physiological stresses. The reestablishment of V. natans reinforced the positive effects of repeated CMK dosing on water quality, and promoted a clear water state. V. natans is recommended for vegetative restoration in shallow eutrophic lakes given its facile transplantation, high stress tolerance, and physiological traits, which can be applied as indices of post-flocculation effects. In summary, the combination of repeated CMK dosing and revegetation of V. notans can feasibly improve water quality and initiate the restoration of a clear water state in shallow eutrophic lakes.

In this paper, we conduct model simulations of vegetation responses to the 8.2 ka BP event over East Asia, and compare them with pollen-based vegetation records. Our results reveal that all major Plant Functional Types responded to the climate changes, but the magnitude, timing, and impact of their responses varied. In addition, it was found that after the 8.2 ka BP climate event the vegetation did not always recover to the state simulated before the perturbation, suggesting that different vegetation compositions may occur under similar climate conditions. Changes in temperature exerted a major influence on the vegetation dynamics in the most high latitude regions, and changes in both temperature and precipitation were responsible for the vegetation changes at mid-to-high-latitudes. Compared with pollen-based vegetation reconstructions, our model simulations generally capture the main features of vegetation responses to the 8.2 ka BP event. Notably, only a relatively small proportion of taxa were climatically sensitive during the 8.2 ka BP cooling in pollen records. Only one high-resolution pollen record indicated that the vegetation did not recover to the pre-perturbed state, showing a different vegetation composition after the 8.2 ka BP event similar to our simulations. Such different vegetation compositions could be a long-lasting effect of abrupt climate changes on vegetation through eco-physiological and ecosystem demographic processes, e.g., plant competition. Moreover, our model simulations suggest a more pronounced vegetation responses to the severe cooling in the north and weaker responses to less cooling in the south. Since significant vegetation responses during this event were only seen in few records, more high-resolution pollen records and simulations in terms of vegetation responses to different abrupt climate changes are needed in future.

The study was conducted on the basis of the analysis of available hydrological data and contemporary and archival topographic basemaps. The research was supplemented by a field study from the years 2011-2016, during which numerous surveys and hydrometric measurements were made. Their goal was to determine the natural range of water fluctuations in the lakes under consideration and to identify potential flows in the Notec Zachodnia River. Observations and calculations allowed the determination of damming ordinates that are within the range of natural water fluctuations of the lakes. On the basis of this information and the previously prepared model of terrain, including the test area, the authors designated zones within the lakes at the required water level and calculated the useful and flood capacity of those water reservoirs. Subsequently, the possibilities of reducing the flood wave on the Notec Zachodnia River were determined. Calculations were made for 2011, i.e. a year for which the highest winter spate for over 30 years has been documented. It has been shown that, by using only the flood capacities of surveyed lakes, it would be possible to reduce the flood wave on the Notec Zachodnia River by 30% for the profile closing its catchment below Kamienieckie Lake. The results indicated the validity of damming the lakes located in the catchment of the Notec Zachodnia River. Water retention in these lakes would restore the water resources in the area and allow reduction of the flood wave during heavy rains. This action would positively affect the ecosystems associated with the river system and would assist the flood protection system in central and west Poland.					; Nowak, Bogumil/L-6393-2018	Stanek, Paulina/0000-0002-4494-9694; Nowak, Bogumil/0000-0002-6963-770X													2299-3835	2353-5652				JUN	2018	6	2					45	58		10.26491/mhwm/90604	http://dx.doi.org/10.26491/mhwm/90604													WOS:000438454300005
J	Liao, KH; Lai, XM; Zhou, ZW; Liu, Y; Zhu, Q				Liao, Kaihua; Lai, Xiaoming; Zhou, Zhiwen; Liu, Ya; Zhu, Qing			Uncertainty analysis and ensemble bias-correction method for predicting nitrate leaching in tea garden soils	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Pedotransfer functions were often applied to predict the soil water contents at field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP), which are the key parameters used in the soil nitrogen (N) biogeochemical models for simulating the nitrate (NO3--N) leaching. However, the PTF prediction uncertainty was often ignored. In addition, the uncertainty of the N model structure (soil N cycling is described with a set of equations) can also be substantial. Based on the 12 classic pedotransfer functions (PTFs) (namely Baumer, Brakensiek/Rawls, British Soil Survey Topsoil, British Soil Survey Subsoil, EPIC, Hutson, Manrique, Rawls, Campbell, Mayr/Jarvis, Rawls/Brakensiek, and Vereecken) and 2 biogeochemical models (DayCent and DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC)), this study evaluated the PTF prediction and model structural uncertainty in soil NO3--N leaching modelling on a tea garden hillslope in Taihu Lake Basin, China. The ensemble mean was then applied to combine the 12 outputs of each model and the 24 outputs of both models. Finally, the linear bias-correction combined with the ensemble mean, i.e., the ensemble bias-correction (EBC), was also applied for the prediction of the leachate NO3--N concentrations. Data on basic soil properties were used to derive the FC and PWP by using the 12 PTFs. Results showed that both the PTF prediction and model structural uncertainty were equally important in soil NW-N leaching modelling at four slope positions. The coefficients of variation of the NO3--N concentration forecasts obtained by different PTFs, representing the PTF prediction uncertainty, were positively related to the climate factors, especially when PTFs were used in DayCent. Ensemble mean was found to produce a very large bias in the prediction of the leachate NO3--N concentrations, which is due to the prediction bias of PTFs. The EBC can substantially improve the prediction of the soil NO3--N leaching, especially when the 24 outputs of both models were combined.

J	Kondo, R				Kondo, Ryuji			Pseudodesulfovibrio nedwellii sp. nov., a mesophilic sulphate-reducing bacterium isolated from a xenic culture of an anaerobic heterolobosean protist	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												A novel sulphate- reducing bacterium, strain SYKT, was isolated from a xenic culture of an anaerobic protist obtained from a sulphidogenic sediment of the saline Lake Hiruga in Fukui, Japan. The results of phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that SYKT clustered with the members of the genus Pseudodesulfovibrio. The closest relative of strain SYKT was Pseudodesulfovibrio sediminis SF6T, with 16S rRNA gene sequence identity of 97.43 %. Digital DNA-DNA hybridisation and average nucleotide identity values between SYKT and species of the genus Pseudodesulfovibrio fell below the respective thresholds for species delineation, indicating that SYKT represents a novel species of the genus Pseudodesulfovibrio. Cells measured 1.7-3.7x0.2-0.5 mu m in size and were Gram- stain- negative, obligately anaerobic, motile by means of a single polar flagellum and had a curved rod or sigmoid shape. Cell growth was observed under saline conditions from pH 6.0 to 9.5 (optimum pH 8.0-9.0) and at a temperature of 10-30 degrees C (optimum 25 degrees C). SYKT used lactate, pyruvate, fumarate, formate and H-2 as electron donors. It used sulphate, sulphite, thiosulphate and sulphur as terminal electron acceptors. Pyruvate and fumarate were fermented. Major cellular fatty acids were anteiso- C-15:0, C-16:0,anteiso-C-17:1 omega 9c, summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c) and summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c). The DNA G+C content of SYKT was 49.4 mol%. On the basis of the the genetic and phenotypic features, SYKT was determined to represent a novel species of the genus Pseudodesulfovibrio for which the name Pseudodesulfovibrio nedwellii sp. nov. is proposed with type strain SYKT (=DSM 114958(T)=JCM 35746(T)).

J	Shah, SA; Ai, ST; Yuan, HX				Shah, Shoukat Ali; Ai, Songtao; Yuan, Hanxiao			Predicting water level fluctuations in glacier-fed lakes by ensembling individual models into a quad-meta model	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID MECHANICS												Predicting water levels in glacier-fed lakes is vital for water resource management, flood forecasting, and ecological balance. This study examines the predictive capacity of multiple climate factors affecting Blue Moon Lake Valley, fed by the Baishui River glacier on Yulong Snow Mountain. The study introduces a novel quad-meta (QM) ensemble model that integrates outputs from four machine learning models - extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and decision tree (DT) - through meta-learning to improve the prediction accuracy for water levels under complex environmental conditions. High-frequency water depth data, recorded every five minutes using an RBR logger, alongside climate variables such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, evaporation, solar radiation, and rainfall, were analyzed. Temperature was identified as the most significant factor influencing water levels, with an importance score of 15.69, followed by atmospheric pressure (14.08) and solar radiation (12.89), which impacted surface conditions and evaporation. Relative humidity (10.24) and wind speed (8.71) influenced lake stability and mixing. The QM model outperformed individual models, and achieved RMSE values of 0.003 m (climate data) and 0.001 m (water depth data), with R2 values of 0.994 and 0.999, respectively. In comparison, XGB and GBM exhibited higher RMSE and lower R2 scores. RF struggled with an RMSE of 0.008 and R2 of 0.962, while DT performed better (RMSE: 0.006 m for climate data) but remained inferior to the proposed model. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the QM ensemble approach in handling complex environmental data, particularly where individual models fall short. This study highlights the potential of ensemble learning for enhanced prediction accuracy in glacier-fed lake systems, recommending future research directions that incorporate the QM model with deep learning and long-term forecasting to expand predictive capabilities on a global scale.

Lake Nyos exploded in 1986, releasing CO2 that killed 1750 people and over 3000 cattle. Here we report results of the first measurements of major elements, trace elements and U-series disequilibria in ten basanites/trachy-basalts and two olivine tholeiites from Lake Nyos. It is the first time tholeiites are described in Lake Nyos. But for the tholeiites which are in U-238-Th-230 equilibrium, all the other samples possess U-238-Th-230 disequilibrium with 15 to 28% enrichment of Th-230 over U-238. The (Ra-226/Th-230) activity ratios of these samples indicate small (2 to 4%) but significant Ra-226 excesses. U-Th systematics and evidence from oxygen isotopes of the basalts and Lake Nyos granitic quartz separates show that the U-series disequilibria in these samples are source-based and not due to crustal contamination or post-eruptive alteration. Enrichment of Th-230 is strong prima facie evidence that Lake Nyos is younger than 350 ka. The Th-230-Ra-226 age of Nyos samples calculated with the (Ra-226/Th-230) ratio for zero-age Mt. Cameroon samples is 3.7 +/- 0.5 ka, although this is a lower limit as the actual age is estimated to be older than 5 ka, based on the measured mean Th-230/U-238 activity ratio. The general stability of the Lake Nyos pyroclastic dam is a cause for concern, but judging from its Th-230-Ra-226 formation age, we do not think that in the absence of a big rock fall or landslide into the lake, a big earthquake or volcanic eruption close to the lake, collapse of the dam from erosion alone is as imminent and alarming as has been suggested.

Sediment budget of a Maumee River headwater tributary: how streambank erosion, streambed-sediment storage, and streambed-sediment source inform our understanding of legacy phosphorus	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Objective We described source and phosphorus (P) retention potential of soft, fine-grained, streambed sediment and associated phosphorus (sed-P) during summer low-flow conditions. Combining in-channel, sed-P storage with relative age provided context on relevance to western Lake Erie Basin management goals. Methods In 2019, rapid geomorphic assessment (30 reaches) compared streambed-sediment storage (S) to streambank erosion (E), providing annual sediment budgets (S:E). Streambed sediment (13 reaches) was fingerprinted and analyzed for sed-P. The P saturation ratio (PSR; four reaches) quantified potential sorption/desorption of dissolved P (DP) between the water column and streambed sediment. Analyses were supplemented with data from 2017 and 2021. The ratio of two fallout radionuclides, beryllium-7 (54-day half-life) and excess lead-210 (22.3 years), apportioned "new" sediment based on time since rainfall contact. Results Streambed sediment was mostly streambank (54-96%) for contributing areas > 2.7 km(2); for upstream reaches, a larger percentage was apportioned as upland (cropland, pasture, forest, and road), with < 30% streambank. Streambank erosion correlated with contributing area; however, soil type (ecoregion), stream characteristics, and land use combined to drive streambed-sediment storage. Individual-reach S:E (accumulation of 0.01-35 years of streambank erosion) differentiated erosional and depositional in-channel environments. Most reaches indicated that 17-57% of sediment had recent contact with rainfall. Streambed-sediment PSR indicated a low potential for further sorption of DP from the water column; one reach was a P source when sampled. Conclusion Sed-P was higher in streambed sediment than in source samples, which varied by land use and ecoregion. This indicates homogenization resulting from in-stream sorption of DP during sediment transport that occurs over multiple events.

Biogeochemical evidence for hydrologic changes during the Holocene in a lake sediment record from southeast Greenland	HOLOCENE												Holocene paleoclimate records from Greenland help us understand the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet and regional oceanic and atmospheric circulation systems to natural climate variability in order to place recent changes in a longer-term perspective. Here biogeochemical analysis of a lake sediment core from southeast Greenland is used to define changes in moisture balance and runoff during the Holocene in a catchment near the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. A 1.6 m sediment core that spans the last 8.8 ka was recovered from Flower Valley Lake on Ammassalik Island. Magnetic susceptibility, diatoms, bulk biogeochemical properties (TOC, C/N, C-13(org)), and lipid biomarkers (n-alkanes; C-16-C-31) reveal changes in clastic sedimentation and the relative input of terrestrial- and aquatic-derived organic matter. Hydrogen isotope values (D) of mid- (n-C-25) and long-chain (n-C-29, n-C-31) n-alkanes allow reconstruction of D of precipitation and summertime evaporation of lake water. Following a period of early lake ontogeny and landscape stabilization after deglaciation from 8.4 to 7.0 ka, the mid Holocene, 8.4-4.1 ka, is characterized by greater evaporative enrichment of the lake water as indicated by D records. After 4.1 ka, there is a decrease in evaporative enrichment of the lake water. There is also an abrupt transition to more variable sedimentation marked by sharp increases in magnetic susceptibility, C/N, C-13(org), and the concentration of long-chain n-alkanes, showing periodic delivery of terrestrial organic matter and clastic sediment to the lake. Higher insolation during the mid Holocene resulted in a warmer and drier climate with longer ice-free periods in the summer and enhanced evaporation of lake water. The reduction in insolation and colder temperatures during the late Holocene caused a reduction in evaporation of lake water over the last 4.1 ka and was accompanied by periodic increases in surface runoff, which correspond with intervals of cold Greenland Ice Sheet surface temperatures.					; Bradley, Raymond/P-9358-2015	Perren, Bianca/0000-0001-6089-6468; Balascio, Nicholas/0000-0001-7106-3541; D'Andrea, William/0000-0003-0182-8857													0959-6836	1477-0911				OCT	2013	23	10					1428	1439		10.1177/0959683613493938	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683613493938													WOS:000325710400006

Constraints on Lake Agassiz discharge through the late-glacial Champlain Sea (St. Lawrence Lowlands, Canada) using salinity proxies and an estuarine circulation model	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												During the last deglaciation, abrupt freshwater discharge events from proglacial lakes in North America, such as glacial Lake Agassiz, are believed to have drained into the North Atlantic Ocean. causing large shifts in climate by weakening the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water and decreasing ocean heat transport to high northern latitudes. These discharges were caused by changes in lake drainage outlets, but the duration, magnitude and routing of discharge events, factors which govern the climatic response to freshwater forcing, are poorly known. Abrupt discharges, called floods, are typically assumed to last months to a year, whereas more gradual discharges, called routing events, occur over centuries. Here we use estuarine modeling to evaluate freshwater discharge from Lake Agassiz and other North American proglacial lakes into the North Atlantic Ocean through the St. Lawrence estuary around 11.5 ka BP, the onset of the Preboreal oscillation (PBO). Faunal and isotopic proxy data from the Champlain Sea, a semi-isolated, marine-brackish water body that occupied the St. Lawrence and Champlain Valleys from 13 to 9 ka, indicate salinity fell about 7-8 (range of 4-11) around 11.5 ka. Model results suggest that minimum (1600 km(3)) and maximum (9500 km(3)) estimates of plausible flood volumes determined from Lake Agassiz paleoshorelines would produce the proxy-reconstructed salinity decrease if the floods lasted <1 day to 5 months and 1 month to 2 years, respectively. In addition, Champlain Sea salinity responds very quickly to the initiation (within days) and cessation (within weeks) of flooding events. These results support the hypothesis that a glacial lake flood, rather than a sustained routing event, discharged through the St. Lawrence Estuary during the PRO. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We performed a study on the modern vegetation composition within the Wolfe Creek Meteorite Crater to complement our future paleoecological investigation of the crater. A bull's-eye pattern exists where C-4 grasses dominate an outer ring and salt tolerant species, including shrubs, herbs, chenopods, and halophytic algae, dominate the inner pan of the crater. The ecotone between the inner and outer zones is narrow and occupied by tall (>7 m) Acacia ampliceps, with some C-4 grasses in the understory. Along with the highest water table and most saline soils the center of the crater has C-3 plants present with the highest delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. The range of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values from the analysis of surface soil organic matter (OM) was much smaller compared with the range of values from plant materials implying that either: (1) the current plant OM has not yet been integrated into the soils, or (2) processes within the soil have acted to homogenize isotopic variability within the crater. The application of a two end member mixing model to calculate %C-4 and %C-3 biomass from the delta C-13 of surface soil OM was complicated by: (1) the crater containing both a dry habitat with C-4 grasses and a central pan with C-4 halophytic plants and, (2) the large variation in the delta C-13 of the plants and soil OM.

HOLOCENE PRECIPITATION RECORDS FROM INNER MONGOLIA DERIVED FROM HYDROGEN ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS OF SEDIMENT FATTY ACIDS	RADIOCARBON												The Inner Mongolian Plateau lies along the northern limit reached by the East Asian summer monsoon. This geographic setting makes it especially sensitive to environmental change and an excellent site for understanding Quaternary East Asian monsoon variability. In this study we present new results of hydrogen isotopic compositions of fatty acids extracted from sediments, which were used to construct Holocene paleoprecipitation (or moisture) changes in Northern China. The hydrogen isotopic composition (D/H ratio) of n-acids in the sedimentary sequence of the Duoerji peat. Inner Mongolia, was determined with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Changes in the precipitation from middle Inner Mongolia are recorded by the D/H ratio of n-C-20, n-C-22, n-C-24, n-C-26, n-C-28 acids (delta D). From 10-9 ka, the relatively high delta D values indicate reduced precipitation in the Early Holocene. Subsequently, increased precipitation is reflected by reduced delta D values from 9-5.5 ka. After 5.5 ka, gradually increasing delta D values record an overall decrease in precipitation. The precipitation trends established for the Duoerji sequence are consistent with other major paleoclimate proxies in the East Asian monsoon region, especially with a distinct Holocene optimum of increased monsoonal activity from 9-5.5 ka. The delta D resulting paleo-precipitation record clearly shows that the Holocene climate in Northern China is basically controlled by the insolation changes.

J	Soderberg, DN; Das, AJ; Stephenson, NL; Meyer, MD; Brigham, CA; Flickinger, J				Soderberg, David N.; Das, Adrian J.; Stephenson, Nathan L.; Meyer, Marc D.; Brigham, Christy A.; Flickinger, Joshua			Assessing giant sequoia mortality and regeneration following high-severity wildfire	ECOSPHERE												Fire is a critical driver of giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum [Lindl.] Buchholz) regeneration. However, fire suppression combined with the effects of increased temperature and severe drought has resulted in fires of an intensity and size outside of the historical norm. As a result, recent mega-fires have killed a significant portion of the world's sequoia population (13%-19%), and uncertainty surrounds whether severely affected groves will be able to recover naturally, potentially leading to a loss of grove area. To assess the likelihood of natural recovery, we collected spatially explicit data assessing mortality, crown condition, and regeneration within four giant sequoia groves that were severely impacted by the SQF- (2020) and KNP-Complex (2021) wildfires within Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. In total, we surveyed 5.9 ha for seedlings and assessed the crown condition of 1104 giant sequoias. To inform management, we used a statistical methodology that robustly quantifies the uncertainty in inherently "noisy" seedling data and takes advantage of readily available remote sensing metrics that would make our findings applicable to other recently burned groves. A loss of giant sequoia grove area would be a consequence of giant sequoia tree mortality followed by a failure of natural regeneration. We found that areas that experienced very high-severity fire (above similar to 800 RdNBR) are at substantial risk for the loss of grove area, with tree mortality rapidly increasing and giant sequoia seedling density simultaneously decreasing with fire severity. Such high-severity areas comprised 17.8, 142.0, 14.6, 1.6 ha and similar to 90%, similar to 14%, similar to 53%, and similar to 27% of Board Camp, Redwood Mountain, Suwanee, and New Oriole Lake groves, respectively. In all sampling areas, we found that seedling densities fell far below the average density measured after prescribed fires, where seedling numbers were almost certainly adequate to maintain giant sequoia populations and postfire conditions were more in keeping with historical norms. Importantly, spatial pattern is also important in assessing the risk of grove loss, and in two groves, Suwanee and New Oriole Lake, the high-severity patches were not always contiguous, potentially making some areas more resilient to regeneration failure due to the proximity of surviving trees.

J	Seal, RR; Shanks, WC				Seal, RR; Shanks, WC			Oxygen and hydrogen isotope systematics of Lake Baikal, Siberia: Implications for paleoclimate studies	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We interpret oxygen and hydrogen isotope data for water samples from Lake Baikal, Siberia, its tributaries and other local rivers, and local precipitation in terms of the known water budget for the modem lake in order to gain insight into past limnological and climatic processes that influenced the lake. Lake Baikal is remarkably uniform in its isotopic composition (delta(18)O = -15.8 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand; delta D = -123 +/- 2 parts per thousand) and lies slightly to the right of the global meteoric water line, which suggests significant evaporation. Water is supplied to the lake by over 300 rivers and streams. The oxygen isotope values (delta(18)O) of the rivers in the Baikal catchment range from -13.4 to -21.2 parts per thousand. The hydrogen isotope values (delta D) for the same area range from -103 to -156 parts per thousand. Both these ranges generally conform to the global meteoric water line. The weighted average isotopic composition of input to the lake (rivers plus precipitation) is -15.2 parts per thousand for delta(18)O and -116 parts per thousand for delta D, values higher than those of the modem lake. Therefore, the isotopic composition of the modern lake cannot be related to the modern input through simple evaporation. Instead, modeling of the isotopic mass balance of the lake suggests that inputs (precipitation and influx from rivers) and outputs (evaporation and outflow) are not at a steady-state equilibrium under current climate conditions. We found previous input to the lake had lower delta(18)O and delta D values than modern input, which reflects cooler climates in the past compared with modern conditions. Under constant climate conditions, steady-state conditions are not expected to be reached by the lake for at least 700 yr because of its large size and the long residence time of water in the lake.																			0024-3590					SEP	1998	43	6					1251	1261		10.4319/lo.1998.43.6.1251	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.6.1251													WOS:000076791700019

Continous air pollution measurements of SO2, O3, NO(x), particulate sulfates, light scattering, and meteorological measurements including temperature, dew point, and wind speed and direction were made. Twelve-hour integrated samples of size fractioned particles were also obtained using dichotomous samplers and Harvard impactors equipped with an ammonia denuder for subsequent hydrogen ion determination. Particulate samples were analyzed for trace elements by X-ray fluorescence and Neutron Activation, and for organic and elemental carbon by a thermal/optical technique. The measured aerosol was periodically very acidic with observed 12-h averaged H+ concentrations in the range < 10-560 nmoles m-3. The aerosol H+ appeared to represent the net strong acidity after H2SO4 reaction with NH3(g). Average daytime concentrations were higher than night-time for aerosol H+, sulfate, fine mass and ozone. Prolonged episodes of atmospheric acidity, sulfate, and ozone were associated with air masses arriving at the measurement site from the west and from the southwest over Lake Erie. Sulfate concentrations measured at the lakeshore camp were more than twice those measured at inland sites during extreme pollution episodes. The concentration gradient observed with onshore flow was potentially due to enhanced deposition near the lakeshore caused by discontinuities in the meteorological fields in this region.

Phytoplankton species richness declined significantly with increasing acidity. Acidic lakes (pH < 5.0) averaged fewer than 20 species while more circumneutral waters (pH > 6.5) averaged more than 33 species. Phytoplankton abundance was not significantly correlated with any of the measured physical-chemical parameters, but standing crop parameters, i.e., chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biovolume, did correlate significantly with several parameters. Midsummer standing crop correlated best with total phosphorus concentration but acidity status affected the standing crop-phosphorus relationship. Circumneutral waters of low phosphorus content, i.e. < 10 .mu.g.cntdot.l-1 TP, averaged 3.62 .mu.g.cntdot.l-1 chlorophyll a whereas acidic lakes of the same phosphorus content averaged only 1.96 .mu.g.cntdot.l-1 chlorophyll a. The midsummer chlorophyll content of lakes of high phosphorus content, i.e. > 10 .mu.g.cntdot.l-1 TP, was not significantly affected by acidity status. Adirondack phytoplankton community composition changes with increasing acidity. The numbers of species in midsummer collections within all major taxonomic groups of algae are reduced with increasing acidity. The midsummer phytoplankton communities of acidic Adirondack lakes can generally be characterized into four broad types; 1) the depauperate clear water acid lake assemblage dominated by dinoflagellates, 2) the more diverse oligotrophic acid lake community dominated by cryptomonads, green algae, and chrysophytes, 3) the productive acid lake assemblage dominated by green algae, and 4) the chrysophyte dominated community. The major phytoplankton community types of acid lakes are associated with different levels of nutrients, aluminum concentrations, and humic influences.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 29	1989	175	1					13	32		10.1007/BF00008472	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008472													WOS:A1989U843000002
J	Bérubé, A				Berube, Annie			Toward an economic analysis of the environmental burden of disease among Canadian children	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART B-CRITICAL REVIEWS												There have been calls for increased investments in research in Canada to determine the extent of exposure and the associated health effects of environmental risks to child health. When allocating scare public health resources, decision makers often rely on cost-benefit analysis to determine whether specific expenditures will yield significant economic benefits by reducing adverse health outcomes. This article describes the elements required for an economic analysis of the environmental burden of disease among Canadian children. Such analysis would require reviewing the strength of the association between environmental exposures and specific adverse pregnancy outcomes and childhood diseases. Second, it would determine the prevalence of childhood diseases and conditions in order to estimate the total economic and social costs associated with the overall burden of childhood diseases in Canada. The next step is to determine how much of the overall burden of disease among Canadian children can be attributed to environmental exposures. Recent environmental burden of disease analyses in other jurisdictions have led to advancement in methodologies that could support this work in Canada. Finally, the economic and social costs attributable to the environmental burden of childhood diseases in Canada could be estimated. Estimates of the economic costs of environmentally related diseases can then be used to determine the appropriate level of investments in scientific research. This article argues for initial investments in establishing a biomonitoring program of children's and pregnant women's exposure to environmental chemicals, as well as a Canadian longitudinal cohort study on the environmental influences on child health and development.																			1093-7404	1521-6950				JAN-MAR	2007	10	1-2					131	142		10.1080/10937400601034605	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10937400601034605								18074307					WOS:000243429300006
J	Skilbeck, CG; Rolph, TC; Hill, N; Woods, J; Wilkens, RH				Skilbeck, CG; Rolph, TC; Hill, N; Woods, J; Wilkens, RH			Holocene millennial/centennial-scale multiproxy cyclicity in temperate eastern Australian estuary sediments	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												We have undertaken a comparative study of down-core variation in multiproxy palaeoclimate data (magnetic susceptibility, calcium carbonate content and total organic carbon) from two coastal water bodies (Myall and Tuggerah Lakes) in temperate eastern Australia to identify local, regional and global-forcing factors within Holocene estuarine sediments. The two lakes lie within the same temperate climate zone adjacent to the Tasman Sea, but are not part of the same catchment and drain different geological provinces. One is essentially a freshwater coastal lake whereas the other is a brackish back-barrier lagoon. Despite these differences, data from two sites in each of the two lakes have allowed us to investigate and compare cyclicity in otherwise uniform, single facies sediments within the frequency range of 200-2000 years, limited by the sedimentation rate within the lakes and our sample requirements. We have auto- and cross-correlated strong periodicities at similar to 360 years, similar to 500-530 years, similar to 270-290 years, 420-450 years and similar to 210 years, and subordinate periods of similar to 650 years, 1200-1400 years and similar to 1800 years. Our thesis is that climate is the only regionally available mechanism available to control common millennial and centennial scale cyclicity in these sediments, given the geographical and other differences. However, regional climate may not be the dominant effect at any single time and either location. Within the range of frequency spectral peaks we have identified, several fall within known long-term periodical fluctuations of sun spot activity; however, feedback loops associated with short-term orbital variation, such as Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, and the relationship between these and palaeo-ENSO variation, are also possible contributors.

J	Yu, ZC; Ito, E; Engstrom, DR				Yu, ZC; Ito, E; Engstrom, DR			Water isotopic and hydrochemical evolution of a lake chain in the northern Great Plains and its paleoclimatic implications	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Oxygen isotopes and geochemistry from lake sediments are commonly used as proxies of past hydrologic and climatic conditions, but the importance of present-day hydrologic processes in controlling these proxies are sometimes not well established and understood. Here we use present-day hydrochemical data from 13 lakes in a hydrologically connected lake chain in the northern Great Plains (NGP) to investigate isotopic and solute evolution along a hydrologic gradient. The delta(18)O and delta(2)H of water from the chain of lakes, when plotted in delta(2)H-delta(18)O space, form a line with a slope of 5.9, indicating that these waters fall on an evaporation trend. However, 10 of the 13 lakes are isotopically similar (delta(18)O = -6 +/- 1parts per thousand VSMOW) and show no correlation with salinity (which ranges from 1 to 65parts per thousand). The lack of correlation implies that the isotopic composition of various source waters rather than in-lake evaporation is the main control of the delta(18)O of the lakes. Groundwater, an important input in the water budget of this chain of lakes, has a lower delta(18)O value (-16.7parts per thousand in 1998) than that of mean annual precipitation (-11parts per thousand) owing to selective recharge from snow melt. For the lakes in this chain with salinity < 15&PTSTHOUSND;, the water Mg/Ca ratios are strongly correlated with salinity, whereas Sr/Ca is not. The poor correlation 18 between Sr/Ca and salinity results from uptake of Sr by endogenic aragonite. These new results indicate that δO-18 records may not be interpreted simply in term of climate in the NGP, and that local hydrology needs to be adequately investigated before a meaningful interpretation of sedimentary records can be reached.

Understanding changes in TWS is essential for assessing the characteristics of drought and flood events in a region. However, the discontinuity between Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) severely affects and limits their applicability in long-term hydrological studies. In this study, a new variable filter reconstruction model (NVFRM) is proposed to reconstruct the TWS anomaly (TWSA) by combining the Gamma test (GT) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The research findings reveal that the TWSA reconstructed by the NVFRM is consistent with the GRACE-FO during the testing period (June 2018-December 2020). It shows that the Pearson correlation coefficient (PR), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.91, 0.81, and 4.90 cm, respectively, which demonstrates the reliability of the NVFRM. More importantly, four drought events are identified by the drought severity index (DSI) derived from the reconstructed TWSA, including August 2003-April 20 April 200420 April 200411-September 20 June 2011,20 June 201118-September 2018, and September 2019-December 2019, respectively. Flood events are monitored based on the flood potential index (FPI), which is calculated by using the reconstructed TWSA and precipitation. Flood events in the Poyang Lake Basin are characterized by a high FPI index of 0.58, 0.52 and 0.32 in summer (June-August), indicating a greater probability of flooding. The NVFRM model proposed in this study provides an effective measure for filling the missing TWSA in regional hydrological research, which is of great significance for monitoring extreme hydrological events and facilitating disaster prevention and mitigation.					shen, yifan/ABB-9964-2021; Chen, Zhiwei/HJH-4481-2023	Yang, Shuai/0000-0001-5017-4832													0143-1161	1366-5901				NOV 17	2023	44	22					7211	7235		10.1080/01431161.2023.2277162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2023.2277162													WOS:001111306100001
J	JONES, RI				JONES, RI			PHOSPHORUS TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE EPILIMNION OF HUMIC LAKES - BIOLOGICAL UPTAKE OF PHOSPHATE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The hypothesis that dissolved humic material (DHM) stimulates bacterial involvement in phosphorus transformations and may thus lead to decreased accessibiity of phosphorus to algae was investigated by studying three small forest lakes in southern Finland representing a wide range of concentrations of DHM. 2. Other chemical differences between the three lakes were slight, although the most humic lake exhibited higher concentrations of total phosphorus and of molybdate-reactive phosphorus. Bacterial biomass did not differ significantly between the lakes, but algal biomass as significantly lower at higher DHM concentrations. Consequently the ratio of algal biomass to bacterial biomass was significantly lower in the most humic lake. 3. Uptake of phosphorus from added 33PO4 was partitioned between algal and bacterial size fractions by differential filtration. No significant variation between lakes was found in the proportion of particulate 33P recovered from the algal fraction. 4. Turnover times for phosphoate were significantly longer in the most humic lake and also showed lower variability. In general turnover times were long in comparison with values reported from many other lakes. Only briefly in mid summer did turnover times in two of the lakes shorten to value which would indicate that demand for phosphate was outstripping supply. 5. Short-term storage of samples from the most humic lake stimulated biological incorporation of 33P, but additions of nitrogen and iron had little effect on phosphate uptake. 6. In these small forest lakes it is probable that no single nutrient consistently limits plankton development. Since no evidence was found that DHM shifts the balance of plankton phosphate uptake away from algae towards bacteria, the influence of DHM on phosphorus transformations, may rather be through chemical regulation of free phosphate availability.

Quantitative palaeolimnology has traditionally sought to quantify species-environment relationships to use alterations in biological assemblages to reflect past environmental change. Transfer functions have used regression techniques, such as weighted averaging, to define taxon optima and tolerance for a single chemical or biological variable. 2. Cladoceran assemblages and their sub-fossil remains in shallow lakes are shaped by a combination of interacting factors. Partial constrained ordination of sub-fossil cladoceran assemblages from 39 shallow lakes (29 in Norfolk, U.K. and 10 in Denmark) indicated that both zooplanktivorous fish (ZF) density and submerged macrophyte abundance significantly influenced community composition. These dual structuring forces precluded the use of a transfer function as one of the key assumptions of this approach was not met, namely that environmental variables apart from the variable being modelled have negligible influence on species distribution or that there is a linear relationship between the two. Separate transfer functions for ZF and macrophyte abundance were developed but had poor performance diagnostics with low bootstrapped r2, high root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and large bias. 3. To obviate the problem of multiple structuring forces a multivariate regression tree (MRT) was employed, which allows for more than one explanatory variable within a model. The MRT analysis defined six groups with discrete ranges of ZF and macrophyte densities. The technique identified critical values or 'break points' in ZF and macrophyte abundances which result in significant alterations in the sub-fossil cladoceran assemblage. In addition, the MRT groups had different summer mean values for chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth, total phosphorus and nitrate-nitrogen. 4. The predictive abilities of the model were assessed by comparing the observed versus predicted MRT group membership. In general group membership was reliably predicted, suggesting sub-fossil cladoceran assemblages reliably reflect ZF and macrophyte density in shallow lakes. For a relatively small number of sites there were differences between the observed and predicted MRT group membership. These failures of prediction may result, at least in part, from the disparity of the time period represented by the environmental data and the surface sediment cladoceran assemblage.

The aim of this study was to determine what influenced the succession of SMBs in a tidal river system, namely the Pearl River Delta, China (PRD). Surveys were carried out from 2015 to 2020 and a range of environmental (16) and ecological parameters were measured that could support an examination of the distribution and variation in SMBs. The coverage area, species richness, and biomass were measured at the community level, while nine morphological traits of the dominant species, Vallisneria denseserrulata, were measured at the population level. The results showed that, in 2015, the SMB community was distributed in sporadic patches and the community was dominated by multiple species. In 2018, V. denseserrulata grew continuously from February to August in all sections but its growth through the overwintering period (December) followed two patterns: recession (Pattern 1) or continuous growth (Pattern 2). Principal component analysis highlighted that the clonal growth ability, sexual propagation allocation, and perennial growth were related to different patterns of V. denseserrulata growth in the overwintering period. Pattern 1 was characterized by a low clonal growth ability and no sexual propagation, while Pattern 2 was characterized by a strong clonal growth ability and sexual propagation over winter. In 2019, the community was dominated by a single species of V. denseserrulata and macrophytes had disappeared from most river sections. The results from redundancy analysis implied that the decline in the SMBs from 2015 to 2020 was probably related to increases in the (1) TP concentrations in the sediment, (2) occupation of SMB habitats, and (3) annual river runoff in pre-flooding periods.

Long-lived deformation history recorded along the Precambrian Thelon and Judge Sissons faults, northeastern Thelon Basin, Nunavut	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The east-northeast-striking Thelon and Judge Sissons faults of south-central Nunavut are well preserved and record long-lived dextral transcurrent movement with complex reactivation and fluid flow histories. The faults cut across Archean gneisses, Paleoproterozoic plutons, and a Mesoproterozoic sedimentary basin in the Rae domain of the western Churchill Province. They formed and were reactivated during multiple deformation events beginning with an initial faulting event at 1830-1760 Ma, followed by an epithermal faulting event at 1760-1750 Ma and late reactivation events at 1600-1300 Ma. The initial faulting event produced the core-damage zone architecture of the faults. Damage zones are characterized by multiple fracture sets, quartz veins and hydrothermal crackle breccias, surrounding core zones defined by multiple mosaic to chaotic breccias and cataclasites with dextral slip indicators. The epithermal faulting event is expressed by the presence of crosscutting comb, crustiform-cockade and lattice-bladed quartz 6 hematite 6 carbonate veins, and is likely associated with a magmatic event of similar age. The late reactivation events resulted in the formation of irregular, non-cohesive crackle to mosaic breccias and gouges, which became the primary pathways for uranium-bearing hydrothermal fluids and the formation of unconformity-type uranium deposits. The Thelon and Judge Sissons faults are similar to other major continental faults in the Rae domain (e.g., McDonald fault, Wager Bay shear zone), which formed during the Paleoproterozoic Taltson-Thelon and Trans-Hudson orogenies and to modern analogues, such as the Karakorum, Altyn Tagh, and Hunan-Jiangxi faults, which formed during the Himalayan-Tibetan orogeny and experienced prolonged hydrothermal and even hot spring activity.

Newly fallen oak leaves were disposed in nylon mesh litter-bags (20 .times. 10 .times. 1 mm) and submerged on three sites in a lake located in the municipality of Itapecerica, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Leaves and water samples were taken monthly from January to June of 1988, for fungal isolation by the following methods: leaf discs washing method with plaiting in potato dextrose agar and pentose malt agar; direct observation of leaves incubated in sterilized distilled water and baiting with corn straw, snake skin, hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) and Sorghum sp. seeds, hair and cellophane. Counting of the total colony number was carried out after 7 days of incubation of the plates at room temperature (25-30.degree.C). The majority of the zoosporic fungi present in the water samples and the leaf disks were the same. Thirty-six taxa were isolated, 8 zoosporic fungi, 8 aquatic Hyphomycetes, 17 terrestrial Hyphomycetes and 3 Zygomycetes. The leaf-inhabiting pioneer micota isolated in Quercus robur L. leaves in tropical climate conditions seems to be very similar to tht reported for the temperature zones. Typical soil fungi were isolated from the submerged leaves even after months of submergence. Aquatic Hyphomycetes colonized the substrate after 2 months, whereas the zoosporic fungi were observed after 3 months of leaf decomposition. Almost all zoosporic fungi isolated from leaf disks were also observed in the water samples.

J	Scarsi, M; Crispini, L; Malatesta, C; Spagnolo, C; Capponi, G				Scarsi, Marco; Crispini, Laura; Malatesta, Cristina; Spagnolo, Chiara; Capponi, Giovanni			Geological Map of a Treasure Chest of Geodiversity: The Lavagnina Lakes Area (Alessandria, Italy)	GEOSCIENCES												The aim of this work is to present a new georeferenced geological map of an area in the Ligurian Western Alps (Lavagnina Lakes area) that includes both a unique geodiversity and great biodiversity, a peculiar geological heritage, and cultural features. The study area is located in the northern part of the Capanne di Marcarolo Regional Natural Park, occurring in the southern Piedmont Region (Alessandria, NW Italy) and close to the suburbs of Genoa. This area has been studied by multi-disciplinary scientific researchers who, so far, have focused their attention on the occurrence of alkaline springs and investigation of different endemic floral species. Moreover, in the past, the Lavagnina Lakes area has been exploited due to the presence of gold mineralization, and several mining records are still visible. We performed detailed geological mapping at a 1:10,000 scale, and collected data that were later integrated into a digital GIS map. The database associated with the map contains information that may be interesting from different points of view: (i) scientific research; (ii) outreach and dissemination activities; and (iii) geotourism (i.e., trail networks and panoramic viewpoints). The area represents a section of the Jurassic Piedmont Ligurian oceanic lithosphere, showing several geologic processes on different scales, such as the serpentinization process and intense and widespread carbonation of ultramafic rocks; the area is, moreover, characterized by fault systems showing paleoseismic structures. Beyond scientific research activities (i.e., geology, geoarchaeology, and mining archaeology), the area can also be promoted for geotourism, outreach and dissemination activities, field trips for schools, and gold panning activities. Hence, our new digital map and our 3D model could be a useful tool to illustrate the main characteristics of the area, leading a non-expert public to explore different geological features in a relatively small area. In this way, our map could help to improve geotourism, be used as a tool for educational activities, and, finally, could also help the Capanne di Marcarolo Regional Natural Park to be recognized as a geopark.					; Crispini, Laura/N-1580-2019; Crispini, Laura/C-1177-2013	CAPPONI, Giovanni/0000-0002-9237-3212; SCARSI, MARCO/0000-0002-6585-1004; Crispini, Laura/0000-0001-5770-8569; Malatesta, Cristina/0000-0002-4765-7873														2076-3263				MAY	2019	9	5							229	10.3390/geosciences9050229	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences9050229													WOS:000470966100038

William; Lovis, William A.; Wang, Hong			Paleoenvironmental and geomorphic significance of bluff-top dunes along the Au Sable River in Northeastern Lower Michigan, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												We report on the age and evolution of five well-developed parabolic dunes that are perched on high (similar to 40 m) bluffs along the southern lip of the Au Sable River valley in northeastern Lower Michigan, U.S.A. These dunes are located on west/northwest-facing exposures and mantle the Jackpines Delta, which formed when the glacial Au Sable River system deposited sands and gravels into glacial Lake Warren in the Huron basin sometime between similar to 15.1 and 14.7 ka. Lake level subsequently fell >35 m as the ice margin retreated northward during the Twocreekan Interstadial. This regression resulted in abandonment of the jackpines Delta and incision of the associated surface by the ancestral Au Sable River. Lake level subsequently rose similar to 50 m during the Algonquin transgression, which likely promoted valley widening through channel migration. Eight samples were collected for OSL age determination of the dunes and yielded ages that suggest dune formation occurred mostly between similar to 13.5 ka and 13 ka. This result, coupled with the landscape position of the dunes (i.e., south side of river; west/northwest-facing bluffs) suggests that the dunes largely formed: 1) during the Algonquin transgression when bluffs were eroded by stream-channel migration, and 2) by west-northwesterly winds that transported eo-lian sands from exposed bluff faces to the adjacent valley edge. This study contributes to the understanding of perched-dune formation in the Great Lakes region and further supports models indicating that westerly winds prevailed within 150 km of the ice margin during the late Pleistocene. It also demonstrates that interior dunes in this region formed in similar environmental settings to interior dunes in northern Europe and suggests that local factors, rather than specific climate intervals, should also be considered as they relate to dune evolution.

Distribution and occupancy of wolverines on tundra, northwestern Alaska	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Understanding wildlife distribution and habitat use is needed for effectively balancing resource development, wildlife conservation, and Alaska Native subsistence on the North Slope of Alaska, USA. This region includes the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), a 96,000-km(2) remote area of largely undeveloped lands that is important for wildlife, including caribou (Rangifer tarandus), wolves (Canis lupus), and wolverines (Gulo gulo). We focused our study on spring distribution and occupancy of wolverines in the NPR-A because a baseline distribution estimate is required to understand current distribution and track changes over time. We conducted aerial surveys of wolverine tracks in snow during March and April of 2014 and 2015, surveying over 84,400 km(2) using 100-km(2) hexagonal sampling units. We used hierarchical Bayesian occupancy modeling to determine wolverine distribution and estimate probability of occupancy within each hexagon, relative to measured covariates with potential to affect either detection or occupancy. Probability of wolverine occupancy increased as well-drained soils increased, suggesting that wolverines prefer drier areas or habitat features associated with well-drained soils. In addition, as standard deviation of elevation increased, wolverine occupancy also increased, indicating that wolverines may prefer areas with more rugged and variable terrain. Mean elevation was not retained as a covariate in the best-fitting model, supporting the importance of terrain ruggedness rather than elevation on wolverine distribution within the NPR-A. Spatially, areas of highest wolverine occupancy occurred within the southern and northeastern portions of the study area, with lowest occupancy in the northern portion of the study area west of Teshekpuk Lake. Based on the spatial pattern of wolverine probability of occupancy, we proposed 4 potential wolverine management zones with varying priorities for monitoring and managing wolverine populations. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society. We used wolverine detection data from aerial surveys of wolverine tracks in snow across our study area on the North Slope of Alaska to model wolverine occupancy in the region with respect to measured habitat covariates. We found that wolverine occupancy showed a strong spatial pattern, with higher occupancy in areas with drier soils and more rugged elevation, and proposed 4 potential wolverine management zones based on occupancy values across the region.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				JUL	2018	82	5					991	1002		10.1002/jwmg.21439	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.21439													WOS:000435816100013
J	Matsumoto, H; Azuma, N; Chiba, S				Matsumoto, Hiroyuki; Azuma, Noriko; Chiba, Susumu			Effects of heatwave events on the seagrass-dwelling crustacean Pandalus latirostris in a subarctic lagoon	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Heatwaves often cause mass mortality of organisms in seagrass areas, and they eventually alter some ecological functions of seagrass ecosystems. In subarctic regions, however, the effects of heatwaves on seagrass areas are still unclear. In a subarctic lagoon of northern Japan, we examined the effects of heatwaves on the Hokkai shrimp, Pandalus latirostris, a commercially exploited species distributed in seagrass areas of northern Japan and eastern Russia. A long-term survey of the surface water temperature in the lagoon clarified a gradual increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwave events since 1999. Surveys of the water temperature at a seagrass area in the lagoon during summer have also demonstrated that the maximum water temperature had been exceeding 25 degrees C, unusually high for this location, regardless of water depth. These results indicate that the effects of heatwaves in seagrass areas in a subarctic region had become as severe as those in tropical and temperate re-gions. We also experimentally evaluated the effects of this unusually high water temperature (25 degrees C) on the survival of P. latirostris by changing the length of exposure time. Some individuals suffered damage to their intestinal mucosal structure after exposure for 12 h or longer, and all individuals died after exposure for 120 h. Our results suggest that heatwaves possibly cause mass mortality in P. latirostris in the following sequence: heat stress, damage to the intestinal epithelial mucosal structure, degradation of nutrient absorption and immuno-logical function of the intestine, energy deficiency and disease infection, and finally mortality. This study, conducted in subarctic closed waters, concludes that it is essential to become familiar with not only trends in heatwaves but also the intermittent occurrence of unusually high water temperature in seagrass areas in order to better understand the process of mortality of organisms that inhabit these ecosystems.

J	VERDUIN, J				VERDUIN, J			PHYTOPLANKTON AND TURBIDITY IN WESTERN LAKE ERIE	ECOLOGY												Phytoplankton crops and turbidity data from an extensive area in western Lake Erie, and over several years, are presented. The largest crop between 1938-53 was the spring crop of 49 amt. to 16 mm3/l. It was assoc. with transparencies permitting 1% of surface light to penetrate to 4.8 m, ca. 1/2 the water column. Only during one year were large areas encountered exhib. turbidities so high (1% of surf. light at 3.5 m) that they could exert a major controlling influence on phytoplankton growth. A comparison of max. phytoplankton crops reported in literature for various habitats indicated that the upper limits, occurring in shallow waters (1.5 m), are of the order of 100 mm3/l. Maps of horizontal distr. of turbidities in western Lake Erie suggest a northward movement of turbid waters in the island region, con- sistent with reported rotation of waters areound Pelee Island, the largest in western Lake Erie. The dilution of turbid, nutrient-rich waters in this rotational current may be responsible for the max. phytoplankton crops. The effectiveness of light-quenching by suspended particles in natural water was determined by computing k in an equation (k = 4.6/d''c) derived from the Lambert-Beer''s Law, using exptl. detn. of the depth (d'') assoc. with 1% of surf. light, and the concn.

Intra-lake trends and inter-lake comparisons of Mysis diluviana life history variables and their relationships to food limitation	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The opossum shrimp, Mysis diluviana, is an important member of the offshore food webs of the Laurentian Great Lakes, but its response to ecosystem changes that have occurred over the past several decades is not well understood. We combined the data of four long-term sampling programs, adding several years of data (post and prior) to previously published analyses to offer a longer-term, cross-basin analysis of M. diluviana populations in the Great Lakes from 1997 to 2019. Densities were high in lakes Superior and Ontario (summer values 100-300/m(2)), high and variable but declining (from 200-300/m(2) in 1997-2004 to less than 100/m(2) in 2017-2019) in Lake Michigan, low (similar to 20-50/m(2) since 2005) in Lake Huron, and very low in shallower eastern Lake Erie (<1/m(2)). Biomass showed similar trends. Life history parameters (mortality, fecundity, and growth) were consistently highest in eastern Lake Erie, followed by lakes Ontario, Michigan, Huron, and Superior. Generation time was 1 year in Lake Erie and 2 years in the other lakes. Cross-basin relationships between annual M. diluviana areal densities and food indices (chlorophyll-a concentration and zooplankton biomass) were non-linear, increasing with food levels up to about 250 mysids/m(2) and about 650 mg dry wt/m(2). Annual growth rates were also positively correlated to both food indices in the four deep lakes, but fecundity and mortality rates were not. Our results suggest food availability is a primary factor predicting M. diluviana density and biomass. Density-dependent mortality and fish predation could explain some of the inter-lake differences, but these relationships could benefit from further investigations.					; Warner, David/C-8858-2009	Scofield, Anne/0000-0001-6273-8084; 													0380-1330					OCT	2023	49	5					1179	1189		10.1016/j.jglr.2023.08.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2023.08.001		SEP 2023											WOS:001092901300001

Diet shift response in round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, based on size, sex, depth, and habitat in the western basin of Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												This study examines the diet of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in the western basin of Lake Erie. As an invasive benthic feeder, the round goby has the potential to affect smallmouth bass and other native species. Round goby (n = 100) were collected during summer 2011 and stomach contents were examined to determine diet patterns and possible ontogenetic diet shifts. Individual round goby were grouped by sex, size (small < 65 mm, large >= 65 mm), depth of habitat (shallow < 2 m, deep > 5 m), and habitat type (natural shallows, anthropogenically modified shallows, and deep waters). Gut fullness ranged from 10 to 100% with 23 stomachs presenting 100% fullness. Round goby consumed 27 different food items including abiotic (sand grains, gravel), floral (algae, fine leaved vascular plants), and fauna items. The Index of Relative Importance (IRI) and comparative z-tests were used to assess correlations and differences. Two-way z-tests revealed a significant difference in mouth gape related to size (z = -5.56377, P = 2.64e-08), and habitat depth (z = 3.34262, P = 0.00083). A significant linear correlation was also found between mouth gape standardized by head length (HL) for both males (P = 2.63e-9) and females (P = 1.3e-4). Two-way z-tests also revealed a significant difference in gonadosomatic index (GSI) related to sex (z = 6.07727, P = 6.11248e-10), but not size. A significant difference in gut fullness was also found related to sex (z = -3.34743, P = 0.00082), habitat depth (z = 3.16336, P = 0.00156), and habitat type (z = -2.7398, P = 0.00615). IRI values demonstrated a diet selective of veliger mussels (IRI = 2462.01), juvenile mussels (IRI = 1073.03), cladocerans (IRI = 4804.31), and chironomids (IRI = 1012.12). While previous studies have focused on round goby diet shifts from macroinvertebrates to bivalves, most studies did not evaluate changes in diet among multiple categories. Furthering knowledge of multiple aspects of goby diet may aid in developing management techniques to deter future round goby invasion.					; Simon, Thomas/B-4075-2012	Simon, Thomas/0000-0003-4393-4703; 													0175-8659	1439-0426				OCT	2014	30	5					955	961		10.1111/jai.12441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.12441													WOS:000342991000016

Lake Qinghai is a high-altitude lake ( 3,200 m) in western China that currently exhibits the following composition (in mmol L-1: [Na+] 200, [Cl-] 173, [Mg2+] 36, [Ca2+] 0.23, [K+] 5.3, total CO2 21, titration alkalinity 29; osmolality 375 mOsm kg(-1); pH 9.3), but concentrations are increasing because of water diversion and climate change. We studied the physiology of river water to lake water transfer. When river fish are transferred to lake water, there is a transitory metabolic acidosis followed by a slight respiratory alkalosis, and hemoconcentration occurs. All plasma electrolytes rise over the initial 48 h, and final levels in lake water acclimated fish are very close to lake water concentrations for [Na+], [Cl-], [K+], and osmolality, whereas [Ca2+] continues to be regulated well above ambient levels. However, [Mg2+] rises to a much greater extent (fourfold in 48 h); final plasma levels in lake fish may reach 12 mmol L-1 but are still much lower than in lake water (36 mmol L-1). At the same time, urine flow rate decreases drastically to < 5% of river water values; only the renal excretion of Mg2+ is maintained. Both gill and kidney Na+, K+-ATPase rapidly decline, with final levels in lake water fish only 30% and 70%, respectively, of those in river water fish. Metabolic rate also quickly decreases on exposure to lake water, with O-2 consumption and ammonia-N excretion rates eventually falling to only 60% and 30%, respectively, of those in river fish, while plasma ammonia rises fivefold. The fish appear to be benefiting from a metabolic holiday at present because of decreases in iono- and osmoregulatory costs while in lake water; elevated plasma [Mg2+] and ammonia may be additional factors depressing metabolic rate. If the lake continues to dehydrate, these benefits may change to pathology.

Cyanobacterial toxins befall a group of various compounds according to chemical structure and health effects on people and animals. The most significant in this large group of compounds are microcystins. Their presence in water used for human consumption causes serious health problems, liver beeing the target organ. Microcystins are spread all over the world. Waterblooms of cyanobacterias and their cyanotoxins are also common in the majority of surface waters in Serbia. The aim of this study was to propose HPLC method for determination of mikrocystin-LR, to validate the method and to use it for determination of microcystin-LR in the surface water of the river Ponjavica. The Ponjavica is very eutrophic water and has ideal conditions for the cyanobacterial growth. Methods. Sample of water form the Ponjavica river were collected during the summer 2008. Coupled columns (HLB, Sep-Pak), were used for sample preparation and HPLC/PDA method was used for quantification of microcystin-LR. Results. Parameters of validation show that the proposed method is simple, fast, sensitive (0.1 mg/L) and selective with the yield of 89%-92%. The measuring uncertainty of +/- 5% was obtained. The obtained results for surface water show that microcystin concentration reached the maximum level during August and September (1.5 mu g/L). The value is higher than maximum allowable concentration of microcystin in drinking water (1 mu g/L) proposed by WHO. Conclusion. This study contributes to the issue of pollution of the National Park Ponjavica. Besides, literature data and WHO clearly point out harmfulness of cyanobasterias and their toxins and implicate the necessity of legislation concerning determination and monitoring of these toxins in our country. Method used for quentification of mycrocystin-LR was shown to be sensitive, selective, rapid and simple and could be recommended for routine determination of this toxin.					; Karadzic, Vesna/HZI-0321-2023	Bulat, Zorica/0000-0001-9830-8772; Karadzic, Vesna/0000-0001-8647-9136; Matovic, Vesna/0000-0003-1106-6403													0042-8450					SEP	2012	69	9					753	758		10.2298/VSP1209753N	http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/VSP1209753N								23050398					WOS:000309025200003

The seismic profiles analyzed show that an up to 160 m thick glacimarine-dominated unit, of probably Younger Dryas age, has been deposited above the acoustic basement. A <55 m thick unit, comprising stacked mass transport deposits (MTDs) has been deposited atop the glacimarine unit. The identified mass movement events comprise 19 MTDs (MTD1-19), which have transported sediment volumes of up to 0.4 km(3) and initiated turbidity currents resulting in the deposition of up to 13 m thick turbidite layers. The established chronostratigraphical framework reveals high mass movement activity in Hardangerfjorden at 11100-8200 cal. yrs BP (Early Holocene) and at 4100 cal. yrs BP to present (Late Holocene). 14 MTDs have been dated to the Early Holocene, which is a time period characterized by high sedimentation rates (1.1 mm/yr), giving a mass movement recurrence rate of 1/ 200 years. Several of these failure events are suggested to have been triggered by regional mechanisms such as earthquakes linked to glacioisostatic uplift. Some of the MTDs of that time could potentially be caused by rock avalanches. Furthermore, it seems that the identified 8200 cal. yrs BP MTD5 coincides with the age of the Storegga tsunami, suggesting that processes related to this event may have caused sediment failure in the inner Hardangerfjorden. During the mid-Holocene (8200-4100 cal. yrs BP), a time period which was characterized by low sedimentation rates of 0.1-0.2 mm/yr and a wanner and wetter climate, mass movement events were absent in the study area. The renewed slide activity in the Late Holocene, comprising four MTD5, is probably related to climatic processes, earthquakes and rock avalanches, resulting in a mass movement recurrence rate of 1/ 1000 years for this time period. This study, thus, underlines the importance of high-latitude fjords, also in a global context, as systems where local, regional and external geological forces interact to impose highly dynamic post glacial depositional environments.

Transtensional analyses of fault patterns and strain provinces of the Eastern California shear zone-Walker Lane on the eastern margin of the Sierra Nevada microplate, California and Nevada	INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW												Obliquity of the strain velocity field to the deformation zone boundary requires strain to be triaxial. At the plate boundary scale, fault geometries predicted by transtensional theory better explain observed fault patterns in the northern Eastern California shear zone-Walker Lane area than do 2D plane strain predictions. Structural provinces in the Eastern California shear zone-Walker Lane are defined by variations in the orientation of the eastern margin of the Sierra Nevada microplate, and include the Honey Lake-Pyramid Lake, Lake Tahoe, Mono Lake-Long Valley, Owens Valley, and Coso subprovinces. The local geometry of the transtensional zone boundary and the microplate transport direction determines orientations of the instantaneous strain axes for each province. Fault orientations predicted with respect to these axes are consistent with those observed in each structural province. The variation of zone geometry among predominantly coaxially dominated strain provinces over a consistent period of deformation does not result in dramatic changes in shape or orientation among finite strain ellipsoids. Although Quaternary faulting strongly reflects transtensional kinematics, the magnitude of estimated finite strain for each province suggests that present-day transtensional deformation has not accommodated large amounts of extension, vertical thinning, or strike-slip offset. K-values for all structural provinces plot in the k > 1 constrictional field on the logarithmic Flinn (Ramsay) diagram, indicating non-plane, transtensional strain. Collectively, these theoretical applications and structural-tectonic observations have implications for evaluating kinematics and faulting during brittle non-plane strain deformation, and for the overall evolution of the transtensional Sierra Nevada-North America plate boundary.																			0020-6814	1938-2839					2009	51	9-11					843	872		10.1080/00206810903034449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00206810903034449													WOS:000270001100003

Growing trout in net frame systems manufactured in dam lakes is very common and economically very promising application. For growing trout, certain conditions such as certain water temperature range and minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) level must be satisfied. The water temperature required should be at 17-20 degrees C to grow trout. Also, the amount of dissolved oxygen (pc) should never fall below 6-7 mg/L. As the temperature rises during the months of June-September, water temperature rises above the acceptable limits to grow trout. Producers usually use different types of internal combustion engine-pump (ICE-P) systems to provide the circulation of the colder water in the deeper parts of the lake to lake surface to grow trout in these months. But, this method is not economically feasible. In this study, as an alternative to ICE-P system, an axial flow deep well pump has been proposed for energy saving purposes. To validate the feasibility of the system, total of 40 net frame systems each has dimensions of 5x5x8 meters have been installed to grow trout in net frames in Lake Karacaoren 2 in Burdur, Turkey. To grow trout in the hot seasons, it is necessary to circulate the colder water in the deeper parts of the lake to lake surface economically. For this aim, total of 10 an axial flow deep well pumps (AFDWPs) having a capacity of 300 m(3)/h, head of 4 m and running at 2850 rpm which is driven by 5.5 kW deep well motor (DWM) have been specially designed and manufactured. To compare the classical water circulation method with ICE-P and newly proposed AFDWP, after every two pumps (ICE/AFDWP) are installed, mean water temperatures were measured along the water column in net frame with the depth of 8 meters and also energy consumptions have been compared during the months of June to September. AFDWP and ICE-P were used only in these months where the water has to be circulated. According to the results energy consumption by using AFDWP was about 90 MWh/year, on the other hand, energy consumed by ICE-P was about 1949 MWh/year during the months of June-September. As a result, significant energy saving of 95.3 % (1906.8 MWh/year) can be obtained by using proposed AFDWP instead of the classical ICE-P during these months for total of 40 net frames.					gölcü, mustafa/AAI-7565-2021														1300-3615						2012	32	1					33	40																WOS:000303629600004

Holocene relative sea-level change and deglaciation on Alexander Island, Antarctic Peninsula, from elevated lake deltas	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Field data constraining the rate and spatial pattern of deglaciation and relative sea-level (RSL) change on the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) are relatively sparse, but are needed to improve regional ice sheet and RSL change models, and contribute to better model predictions of future sea-level rise. We investigated the geomorphology, sedimentology and quartz-fraction single aliquot regeneration optically-stimulated luminescence (SAR-OSL) geochronology of elevated deltas around two epishelf lakes, Ablation Lake (AL) and Moutonnee Lake (ML), Alexander Island, Antarctic Peninsula. AL and ML are dammed by George VI Ice Shelf, and maintain a direct hydraulic connection to the sea; hence, their water levels are controlled by changes in RSL. Our aim was to provide new terrestrial constraints on RSL and deglaciation for the southern AP by comparing the formation processes, age and altitude of the AL and ML deltas with: (1) existing RSL curves for the AP; (2) isostatically-coupled AP ice sheet models, and (3) existing AP deglaciation history and SAR-OSL ages from elevated deltas around the nearby inland Hodgson Lake (HL). Although there was insufficient quartz in the ML samples for SAR-OSL dating, the 4.6 +/- 0.4 ka SAR-OSL age of the elevated delta at AL represents the last time active deltas were forming higher than present day lake level, and implies: (1) a fall in RSL of up to 14.4 m since the mid-Holocene in this part of Alexander Island, which is consistent with existing field-based RSL chronologies for the AP; (2) relatively smaller ice masses than suggested by some (but not all) isostatically-coupled ice sheet models since the mid-Holocene, and (3) significant mid-Holocene thinning of the AP ice sheets, which is consistent with regional sediment core data and cosmogenic exposure ages, and the 4.4 +/- 0.7 ka SAR-OSL age of the lowermost HL delta.

The studies were performed on phytoplankton from the moderately acidified Lake Njupfatet in central Sweden before and after liming. Phytoplankton samples from in situ enclosure experiments with low-dose enrichments of nitrate and phosphate and removal of large (> 100 mum) zooplankton and from the lake water were collected. The phytoplankton were concentrated by through-flow centrifugation and post-cultured in the laboratory with or without the addition of phosphate. A relative increase in the ATP:chlorophyll a ratio after the phosphate treatment as compared to samples without phosphate enrichment was found to be a highly reproducible indicator of phosphate deficiency in the natural phytoplankton population. In contrast, the absolute ATP:chlorophyll a ratio varied substantially between different sampling occasions. No phosphate deficiency was detected in phytoplankton from the acidic lake or from fertilized in situ enclosures. However, phytoplankton from in situ enclosures without added nutrients showed evidence of phosphate limitation after 21 days incubation. Also, the phytoplankton community developed a significant phosphate deficiency the summer after lake liming. The results from the ATP analyses are compared with chemical data of the lake water, phytoplankton community structure and phosphatase activities in the lake before and after liming. The average total biomass of phytoplankton and the average Tot-P measured during May to September decreased with appr. 30% after liming while Tot-N was essentially unaffected and the phosphatase activities increased by 1000-2000%.																			0018-8158					OCT 23	1992	246	2					99	110		10.1007/BF00014697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014697													WOS:A1992KB68600002

Responses of the Clonal Florida Endemic Shrub Polygonella myriophylla to Fire and Mechanical Disturbance	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												There is an unsettled debate on the benefits of mechanical disturbance for native species in fire-prone habitats. We compared the demographic effects of fire and mechanical treatments (Gyro-tracing) on Polyganella myriaphylla, a prostrate clonal shrub listed as endangered and narrowly endemic to pyrogenic scrub ecosystems in south-central Florida. This species is commonly found in gaps within a matrix dominated by resprouting shrubs, but also occurs under other shrubs and along the shoulders of adjacent road-side habitats. We designed and executed a replicated (that plots per treatment, 1 ha per plot; total 147 initial plants) experiment including plots burned, mechanically chopped, with both treatments and without treatments at the Lake Wales Ridge Wildlife and Environmental Area - Carter Creek in Highlands County, central Florida (2005-2008; treated in summer of 2005). Cumulative mortality of standing P. myriophylla after 3 y was higher in burned plots (> 80%) than in chopped-only and untreated plots (similar to 50 % and similar to 40 % respectively). Post disturbance growth in canopy area among the surviving plants was consistently higher in mechanically disturbed plots compared to untreated plots and intermediate burned conditions. We found three putative seedlings, accounting for less than 8% of the initial genets, before treatment application, but many seedlings after treatments. Seedling recruitment (similar to 90) post-treatment was higher in disturbed plots, highest when both treatments occurred together, and almost null in untreated plots. Recruitment was highest in the first-year post disturbance (70%), decreasing in subsequent years. Disturbances may improve the persistence of P. myriophylla by increasing recruitment and individual growth, however; fire and mechanical disturbance should be used with caution for this species given many plants died during treatment.

In order to obtain surface albedo data with higher accuracy and better applicability in deserts, we used MODIS and OLI as data sources, and calculated the daily surface albedo data, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, of Guaizi Lake at the northern edge of the Badain Jaran Desert in 2016, using the Spatial and Temporal Non-Local Filter-based Fusion Model (STNLFFM) and topographical correction model (C model). We then compared the results of STNLFFM and C + STNLFFM for fusion accuracy, and for spatial and temporal distribution differences in surface albedo over different underlying surfaces. The results indicated that, compared with STNLFFM surface albedo and MODIS surface albedo, the relative error of C + STNLFFM surface albedo decreased by 2.34% and 3.57%, respectively. C + STNLFFM can improve poor applicability of MODIS in winter, and better responds to the changes in the measured value over a short time range. After the correction of the C model, the spatial difference in surface albedo over different underlying surfaces was enhanced, and the spatial differences in surface albedo between shifting dunes and semi-shifting dunes, fixed dunes and saline-alkali land, and the Gobi and saline-alkali land were significant. C + STNLFFM maintained the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of STNLFFM surface albedo, but the increase in regional aerosol concentration and thickness caused by frequent dust storms weakened the spatial difference in surface albedo over different underlying surfaces in March, which led to the overcorrection of the C model.						rutian, Bi/0000-0002-1395-7579														1424-8220				SEP	2022	22	17							6494	10.3390/s22176494	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22176494								36080952					WOS:000851859400001

The number of colonies doubled over the study period reaching 14 in 2014 from seven in 1988. There was also a continuous increase in the number of nests: from 952 in 1988 to 9256 in 2014, presenting an annual change of +26.5% +/- 0.05 (SD). Most of the colonies were situated in freshwater lakes, three in deltas and one on the seacoast. Nine colonies were mixed with other colonially nesting species (mostly from the Ardeidae family). Of the 14 colonies 11 were found in trees. Two colonies were situated on the ground, four in bushes, two on reed rhizome islets and one on cliff ledges. Five out of the 14 active colonies in 2014, comprising 87% of the total recorded nests, were in wetlands of low altitude (0-45 m a.s.l.). The rest were situated in mountainous wetlands at altitudes ranging from 235 to 853 m a.s.l. One colony, at Lake Kerkini, contained the majority of nests in Greece (6650, being 72% in 2014). The second largest colony, at Lake Volvi, had 900 nests, followed by the Greek part of Prespa with 625 nests (in three colonies) in 2014. The percentage of nests in newly established colonies increased after 2003, reaching its highest value (14%) in 2009. The reason for the growth in both colonies and nests over the years is attributed to the increasing availability of fish, the protection status of wetlands and the absence of disturbance. Particularly after 2002 the species increased in numbers and established colonies in new areas, which is probably related to the expanding breeding populations of the species in north-eastern European countries and a corresponding increase in wintering numbers in Greece. This needs further attention by monitoring and research.

J	Hesthagen, T; Heggenes, J; Larsen, BM; Berger, HM; Forseth, T				Hesthagen, T; Heggenes, J; Larsen, BM; Berger, HM; Forseth, T			Effects of water chemistry and habitat on the density of young brown trout Salmo trutta in acidic streams	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												We examined the relationship between young brown trout ( Salmo trutta) density in lake tributaries, and water chemistry and habitat variables. The study was carried out during the autumn in three acidic, softwater river systems in western and southwestern Norway; Gaular and Vikedal (1987-1993) and Bjerkreim (1988-1993). The streams had mean calcium concentrations of 0.35 mg L-1 (Gaular), 0.52 mg L-1 (Vikedal) and 0.84 mg L-1 (Bjerkreim). The concentration of inorganic Al was generally low, with mean values of 8.40 (Gaular), 22.22 (Vikedal) and 43.36 mu g L-1 (Bjerkreim). In multiple regressions that involved different water chemistry variables, brown trout density correlated best with calcium concentration and with a combination of calcium and pH; the Ca2+:H+ ratio. In Vikedal and Gaular, calcium explained 51 and 57%, respectively, of the variability in brown trout densities. Althoug alkalinity exhibited the best correlation with brown trout density in Bjerkreim ( r(2)=0.33), it was similar to that of the model that included all major ions plus pH. The Ca2+:H+ ratio had a larger effect for variability in brown trout density in Gaular (r(2)=0.66) than calcium alone. In Vikedal and Bjerkreim, the Ca2+:H+ ratio also correlated with brown trout density, but considerably less than in Gaular. The predictive power of habitat variables was much lower than that of water chemistry; the single most important factors were altitude in Gaular (r(2)=0.22), mean water temperature in Vikedal (r(2)=0.11) and depth SD (index of heterogeneity) in Bjerkreim (r(2)=0.07). Models that included both habitat and water chemistry variables showed that the density of young brown trout was predicted primarily by calcium concentrations in Gaular (r(2)=0.75) and Vikedal (r(2)=0.54), as opposed to pH in Bjerkreim (r(2)=0.25). Habitat had low effect in all three river systems (r(2)=0.01-0.04). The final model explained 86, 68 and 32%, respectively, of the variability in brown trout density in the three catchments. Thus, water chemistry variables seem to be factors that limit the density of young brown trout in acidic softwater streams.

Phonological and/or semantic characteristics of terminal words were manipulated in 4 conditions in which: (1) the terminal word was the highest doze probability ending for the sentence and was thus phonologically and semantically appropriate to the sentence context (e.g., Ray fell down and skinned his kneels)).; (2) the terminal word had the initial phonemic sound of the highest doze probability sentence-ending word but was semantically anomalous to the context of the sentence (e.g., They sat together without saying a single worm. [word]); (3) the initial phoneme of the terminal word was phonologically unexpected but the word was semantically correct (e.g., The dough was pur in the hot pan. [oven]); or (4) the initial phoneme of the terminal word was phonologically unexpected and the word was semantically inappropriate to the sentence context (e.g., Bill jumped into the lake and made a big farm. [splash]). A left fronto-temporally distributed negative peak was observed in the 250-300 msec range to varying degrees in all conditions but was largest in the condition in which terminal words were both phonologically unexpected and semantically inappropriate. A second, parietally distributed, symmetrical negativity (the N400) was found which peaked around 365 msec and was largest in the two conditions involving semantically anomalous terminal words. Results are discussed in terms of modality factors in ERP manifestations of receptive language functions and the implications of ERP modality differences for theories of word recognition.

J	Manville, V; Newton, EH; White, JDL				Manville, V; Newton, EH; White, JDL			Fluvial responses to volcanism: resedimentation of the 1800a Taupo ignimbrite eruption in the Rangitaiki River catchment, North Island, New Zealand	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The potential for the generation of dangerous and damaging lahars and floods in response to the eruption of voluminous pyroclastic debris has become increasingly appreciated in recent years. The style and tempo of this response varies both between eruptions and between individual catchments impacted by a single eruption, so that an understanding of the factors controlling this variation is necessary for precise hazard assessment. The 1800a Taupo eruption from the Taupo Volcanic Centre in the central North Island of New Zealand devastated an area of 20,000 km(2) during eruption of a climactic ignimbrite, impacting the headwaters of all major rivers draining radially from this region. The Rangitaiki River, the subject of this paper, differs from other catchments in that the Taupo ignimbrite buried an essentially flat land surface inherited from a suite of welded ignimbrite sheets erupted between 320-340 and 230 ka. The middle reaches of the catchment are characterised by narrow, steep gorges alternating with low-gradient basins developed in tectonic half-grabens. Initially, remobilisation of pyroclastic material in the headwaters was dominated by hyperconcentrated sheet flows resulting in shallow reworking. In higher gradient areas, reintegration of drainage networks was achieved by incision of deep channels and gullies, assisted by breakouts from ephemeral lakelets developed in ignimbrite-dammed depressions. Braided, and later meandering, streams superseded this pattern as rill and gully systems stabilised and sediment yields fell leading to a decline in drainage density. Gorge reaches acted as efficient conduits for remobilised material while the basins acted as local depocentres for the temporary storage of volcaniclastic sediments, mediating the transfer of pyroclastic debris to the Bay of Plenty coast >100 km to the north. Reworking and resedimentation of pyroclastic debris began immediately after the eruption, peaking early and then rapidly declining so that most geomorphic adjustments occurred within one or two decades of the initial disturbance.

Sinninghe			Late Pleistocene temperature history of Southeast Africa: A TEX86 temperature record from Lake Malawi	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We present a TEX86-derived surface water temperature record for Lake Malawi that provides the first continuous continental record of temperature variability in the continental tropics spanning the past similar to 74 kyr with millennial-scale resolution. Average temperature during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5A was 26.5 degrees C, with a range from 25.7 to 27.3 degrees C, comparable to Holocene temperatures. MIS 4 was a relatively cold period with temperatures generally decreasing from 25.5 degrees C at 68 ka to a minimum of 20 degrees Cat similar to 60 ka, 1.5-2 degrees C colder than the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Termination of MIS 4 is characterized by a rapid increase of 3-4 degrees C in only similar to 0.5 kyr. Temperatures were relatively stable throughout MIS 3 at the resolution of this study, with an average of 23.8 degrees C and a range from 25.1 to 22.9 degrees C. The lack of millennial-scale temperature variability during MIS 3 suggests that Lake Malawi's documented response to the bipolar seesaw (Brown et al., 2007) is not reflected in its thermal history. Our temperature estimates for the LGM and Holocene are consistent with a previously published TEX86 record from Lake Malawi with a temperature of similar to 22.6 degrees C for the LGM, similar to 25-26 degrees C in the mid Holocene and similar to 25-28 for the late Holocene. In general the present extended TEX86 record indicates that temperature variability in tropical East Africa during late MIS 5 and MIS 4 was as great as that associated with the deglaciation and Holocene. A decrease in Southern Hemisphere insolation between 70 and 60 ka may have played an important role in forcing temperatures during MIS 4, but after 60 ka other factors, such as the extent of the polar ice sheets, or atmospheric CO2 may have forced temperature in tropical Africa to a greater extent than local summer insolation.

Increased risk of cyanobacterial blooms in northern high-latitude lakes through climate warming and phosphorus enrichment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Harmful cyanobacterial blooms are an increasing problem at many locations throughout the world but are rarely reported in aquatic habitats at high latitudes. Shallow lakes are a major feature of northern permafrost landscapes and are likely to experience large-scale changes in their limnological properties in the future as a consequence of climate warming. 2. In the present study, we addressed the question of what preconditions would be necessary to stimulate the growth and dominance of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in northern fresh waters. We analysed the summer phytoplankton of 18 lakes on eroding permafrost (thaw lakes) and on glacier-scoured rock (rock basin lakes) in subarctic Quebec, Canada, to determine their phytoplankton community structure and the biomass contribution of cyanobacteria. This survey was complemented with an incubation experiment to evaluate the direct warming and indirect phosphorus (P) enrichment effects of climate change on cyanobacterial bloom development. 3. All lakes contained diverse phytoplankton communities, often dominated by chrysophytes, dinoflagellates and chlorophytes. Cyanobacteria were present in all waterbodies, but their contribution to the total community biovolume was highly variable (mean of 8.7%, range 0.1%-47%). Cyanobacterial community biovolumes correlated positively with surface water temperatures, and negatively with dissolved organic carbon, soluble reactive phosphorus, iron and manganese concentrations in the surface waters. 4. Phosphorus enrichment of water from a thaw lake resulted in a fourfold increase of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and an increase in the cyanobacterial pigments echinenone and zeaxanthin. The phytoplankton counts showed that there was a sharp decrease in diversity (expressed as decline of the Shannon-Wiener index from 1.69 to 0.16), accompanied by a shift to cyanobacterial dominance, notably by the heterocystous, potentially toxic species Dolichospermum cf. planctonicum. Increased temperature led to an initial doubling of cyanobacterial biovolume, followed by the development of a chrysophyte bloom. Combined warming and P enrichment led to reduced phytoplankton biodiversity, with a community composed of cyanobacteria and chrysophytes. There was also a pronounced response by the picophytoplankton community; picocyanobacteria were strongly stimulated by P enrichment, while picoeukaryotes increased in response to warming. 5. The current inoculum levels of cyanobacteria in subarctic lakes and their responsiveness to temperature and phosphorus indicate the potential for an abrupt increase in their abundance, accompanied by a decrease in phytoplankton diversity. Ongoing climate change will increase the risk of noxious cyanobacterial blooms in northern lakes and ponds, with potentially negative consequences for higher trophic levels.

Use of a multi-column thin-layer pneumatic sampler and modified analytic procedures has enabled resolutions of chemical and biological strata at 2.5 or 5.0 cm depth intervals. Examination of meromictic Lake Fidler, Tasmania, indicates the presence of a thin, intense stratum of bacteriochlorophyll d in the upper monimolinion, associated with a discrete stratum of Chlorobium cf. limicola at the microaerobic interface between the oxygenated and sulphide-rich ones. 2. Algae included small populations of Chlorophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Cryptophyceae. Bacteria included microaerophils and obligate anaerobes, pigmented and colourless, in well-defined strata in the upper monimolimnion. A population of the microcrustacean Calamoecia tasmanica tasmanica was present in the mixolimnion. Chaoborus larvae were concentrated within the Chlorobium layer. 3. The chemical profile of Lake Fidler was stable, with a chemocline constant in position relative to the lake bottom. The surface water levels rose and fell through a distance of 1 m in conjunction with heavy rainfall in the rainforest, and with river level variation, but had no measurable effect on the absolute position of the chemocline. Marked heterogeneity of dissolved substances at depths in the vicinity of bacteria suggested endogenous influence on pH and gelbstoff (''gilvin'' in Australia). 4. Downwelling light attenuation was influenced primarily by gelbstoff (''gilvin'') in the mixolimnion, with only red light (peak at 700 nm) measurable below 2 m. Light was absorbed mainly by Chlorobium in the monimolimnion, and was unmeasurable deeper than 3 m. 5. The absorption spectrum of the bacteriochlorophyll d in vivo, with a maximum absorbance at 721 nm, corresponds with the available downwelling light penetrating the mixolimnion to the Chlorobium layer.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1985	15	6					735	747		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1985.tb00245.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1985.tb00245.x													WOS:A1985AVE8400009

The area was glaciated many times during the Pleistocene and the basin lies immediately north of the prominent Cartier Moraine built during the last glaciation by the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet some 11,000 years ago. Study of the deeper geophysics of the basin using magnetic and gravity techniques, and confirmation of its origin, is hampered by lack of data regarding water depths, the form of the bedrock surface and the thickness and character of glacial and postglacial sediment. To this end, more than 300 km of high-resolution single channel seismic chirp and 200 kHz bathymetric data were collected from the basin in the summer of 2002. Water depths reach a maximum of 118 m and acoustic basement is defined by a glacially scoured bedrock surface. The overlying Pleistocene sediment fill exceeds 35 m in thickness and consists of a lowermost late-glacial succession of rhythmically laminated silty clays deposited when the basin was flooded by a deep and regionally extensive ice dammed water body (Glacial Lake Algonquin). Truncation of the upper surface of this succession across large parts of the lake floor records the drainage of Lake Algonquin and the isolation of Wanapitei Lake as a separate water body. Overlying Holocene sediment is up to 10 m thick but is markedly discontinuous and commonly occurs as mounded 'drifts' reflecting strong bottom currents and low inputs of modern sediment. The presence of apparently undisturbed Precambrian bedrock below large portions of the lake basin places significant constraints on the dimensions of any meteorite impact structure.

The range in diffuse attenuation coefficients observed in the clearest ocean waters versus small oligotrophic lakes can be as much as 3 orders of magnitude. In this study, we investigated the variability of UV penetration (and its sources) in a typical Norwegian fjord system (Samnanger fjord, 60degreesN, 5degreesE) after the main spring diatom bloom had passed, so that the primary production in the fjord was low, with chl a concentrations of 1 to 2 mg m(-3) at 10 m depth (April 1999). At 320 nm, diffuse attenuation coefficients varied between 1.2 and 5.0 m(-1) from the outer to the inner part of the fjord. At 305 nm, the variation was between 2.3 and 5.4 m(-1). Less variability was found at longer wavelengths (340 and 380 nm). River run off, containing high concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), provided a low salinity layer of highly UV-absorbing water at the surface. There was a strong correlation between diffuse attenuation coefficients in the UV and CDOM, but only a weak correlation with chl a. Uncertainty in measuring diffuse attenuation coefficients are seldom addressed. Thus, we undertook an intercomparison of diffuse attenuation coefficients calculated from data produced using 3 different UV radiometers: a spectroradiometer, a narrowband filter radiometer and 2 moderate-bandwidth filter radiometers. The deviations in attenuation ranged from 20 to 40%, being most pronounced at the shortest wavelengths (305 and 320 nm) at 3 different stations. This intercomparison illustrates that there has not been significant improvement in the uncertainties of measuring diffuse attenuation coefficients since a similar intercomparison was performed in 1994.

In a nature reserve, the foraging sites of waterbirds are relatively fixed, but frequently close to residential areas and can also be visited by domestic fowls. It is easy to result in the trans-species-flock dispersal of gut microbes between the wild birds and domestic fowls. The effects of the variable foraging site distances on the gut microbe structures of the waterbirds and the sympatric domestic fowls are currently unclear, and further research is required to evaluate the impacts of geographic location on cross-infection. Methods Illumina high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis software were utilized to compare and analyze the composition of gut microbes from the fecal samples of Hooded Cranes (HC; Grus monacha) and two groups of Domestic Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) that foraged at 1 km (ducks in near areas, D-N), and 4 km (ducks in far areas, D-F) away from the habitats of the Hooded Cranes at Shengjin Lake, China. Results The results showed that there were significant differences in the alpha-diversity of the gut bacteria in the HC, D-N, and D-F samples under the interspecific distance factor. The dominant bacterial phyla, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria, showed correlations with distance for each host. The D-N group had more diverse intestinal flora than the D-F, as they were physically closer to the HC and had more indirect contact and cross-transmission of their gut microbes. More potentially pathogenic bacterial sequences, and Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were found in the D-N than in HC and D-F. Conclusions Hooded Cranes and the Domestic Duck populations at variable distances from the cranes showed significant differences in their intestinal bacteria and potentially pathogenic bacteria. The closer the foraging sites were, the easier the intestinal flora spread across species. The results provide a basis for determining the safe distance between wild birds and domestic fowls in a nature reserve.

Assessing hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations in Canadian Shield lakes: Deriving management benchmarks using two methods	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The ability to predict hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations in lakes and to track changes in concentrations over time in response to known environmental stressors is critical for effective lake management. The background concentrations of deepwater oxygen, in particular, provide important management benchmarks for assessing the impact of current and future shoreline residential development on water quality. Background can be defined as the conditions that exist in the absence of, or prior to, human influence. We compare 2 models commonly used to predict end-of-summer, volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen (VWHO) concentrations in Canadian Shield lakes. The paleoecological and empirical models are evaluated in their ability to predict present-day VWHO concentrations, and then compared in their predictions of background VWHO concentrations and in predictions of changes in VWHO from background to present-day conditions. The predictive power of the 59-lake paleoecological model (jackknifed r(2) = 0.51, RMSEP = 2.18 mg/L) is comparable to other models that have used chironomids to predict the degree of hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes but is lower than that produced by the empirical modelling approach (r(2) = 0.87, SE = 1.04 mg/L). However, this discrepancy may be offset by the enhanced realism of the paleoecological model, including its ability to predict declines in VWHO over time. The combined use of the paleoecological and empirical modelling approaches may allow lake managers to examine changes in deepwater oxygen concentrations in response to a single "targeted" stressor (e. g., residential shoreline development) and to multiple environmental stressors (e. g., climate change, hydrological management).

Forecasting the expansion of the invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei in Brazilian and North American rivers based on its occurrence in the Paraguay River and Pantanal wetland of Brazil	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857), also called golden mussel, is native to Asia but becoming dispersed around the world. The golden mussel resembles the invasive dreissenid bivalves in many respects, and although much less studied it evidently has broader environmental tolerances. The golden mussel was introduced into the La Plata River estuary (South America) and quickly expanded upstream to the north, into the tropical Paraguay River reaching a large floodplain area in Brazil known as the Pantanal wetland. The golden mussel tolerates environmental conditions in the Pantanal that would be inhospitable for most bivalves, but mussel mortality has been observed during the most extreme oxygen depletion events. Based on knowledge about the limiting factors for the golden mussel in the Pantanal wetland, its potential distribution was predicted for the remainder of the Paraguay River basin where the species is not present, as well as in other river systems throughout Brazil. Forecasts of potential distribution in Brazilian river systems were based on physicochemical limitations for shell calcification, and specifically on lower thresholds of dissolved calcium concentrations and the calcium carbonate (calcite) index of saturation, which may be a better indicator of calcification potential in low-calcium waters than calcium concentration alone. In addition to examining spatial patterns in calcium and calcification potential, these and other limnological and climate variables were used in ecological niche modeling using GARP and Maxent algorithms. Forecasts of potential distributions in three major North American river systems (Mississippi, Colorado, and Rio Grande) were based mainly on water temperature because calcium availability and calcification evidently would not be limiting to golden mussel establishment in those waters. Due to the greater tolerance of the golden mussel to conditions known to limit other bivalves, as well as its greater ability for shell calcification in low-calcium water, the golden mussel could potentially become broadly distributed throughout Brazil. According to its thermal tolerance L. fortunei could become established in the Mississippi, Colorado and Rio Grande drainage systems, although the northern Mississippi River system including the Missouri River may be too cool in the winter to support the golden mussel.

Long-term analysis of road salt loading and transport in a rural drinking water reservoir watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Chloride exports from the widespread application of road salt serve as a primary contribution to water body salinity in cold climate regions. Road salt pollution is a concern in drinking water supplies due to the relationship between chloride concentration and water corrosivity. In the Northeastern U.S., researchers and water quality managers are interested in better understanding how management practices can mitigate the negative effects of road salt pollution. This study uses regression-based chloride load estimates from LOADEST to produce mass balances and analyze transport flow-paths to the Wachusett Reservoir from a predominantly rural watershed. A chloride mass balance for 2000 through 2019 revealed that reservoir and watershed export only recently reached a level similar to estimated inputs from road salt (11,200 ton/yr). Results from hydrograph and load separation techniques show that average loading (4300 +/- 1300 ton/yr) and discharge from baseflow (3.2 +/- 0.9 m(3)/s) contributed approximately 74% and 65% of the total loading (5800 +/- 1800 ton/yr) and discharge (4.93 +/- 1.50 m(3)/s), respectively from water years 2001 through 2019. Approximately 40% of the total annual tributary load (30% baseflow; 10% runoff) occurred in the spring (March-May) and is attributed to elevated baseflow conditions from snowmelt. As indicated by a baseflow chloride index, baseflow concentrations are 14% greater than the total concentrations measured in the tributaries. Therefore, the baseflow-dominated tributary chloride loading is due to a combination of greater discharge and chloride concentration in baseflow as compared to direct surface runoff. However, a long-term trend analysis suggests a slightly increased fraction of chloride loading via overland flow in several reservoir tributaries, potentially indicative of late 20th century land development. This study offers a unique monitoring approach for management authorities to better assess road salt pollution in water systems. The decadal response of the reservoir system reflects the slow-moving nature of the baseflow-dominated chloride loading and suggests that measurable water quality improvements will only be realized with a sustained long-term decrease in the amount of road salt applied.

A multi-scale comparison of trait linkages to environmental and spatial variables in fish communities across a large freshwater lake	OECOLOGIA												Species present in communities are affected by the prevailing environmental conditions, and the traits that these species display may be sensitive indicators of community responses to environmental change. However, interpretation of community responses may be confounded by environmental variation at different spatial scales. Using a hierarchical approach, we assessed the spatial and temporal variation of traits in coastal fish communities in Lake Huron over a 5-year time period (2001-2005) in response to biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The association of environmental and spatial variables with trophic, life-history, and thermal traits at two spatial scales (regional basin-scale, local site-scale) was quantified using multivariate statistics and variation partitioning. We defined these two scales (regional, local) on which to measure variation and then applied this measurement framework identically in all 5 study years. With this framework, we found that there was no change in the spatial scales of fish community traits over the course of the study, although there were small inter-annual shifts in the importance of regional basin- and local site-scale variables in determining community trait composition (e.g., life-history, trophic, and thermal). The overriding effects of regional-scale variables may be related to inter-annual variation in average summer temperature. Additionally, drivers of fish community traits were highly variable among study years, with some years dominated by environmental variation and others dominated by spatially structured variation. The influence of spatial factors on trait composition was dynamic, which suggests that spatial patterns in fish communities over large landscapes are transient. Air temperature and vegetation were significant variables in most years, underscoring the importance of future climate change and shoreline development as drivers of fish community structure. Overall, a trait-based hierarchical framework may be a useful conservation tool, as it highlights the multi-scaled interactive effect of variables over a large landscape.

J	Stevens, CH; Stone, P				Stevens, CH; Stone, P			Correlation of Permian and Triassic deformations in the western Great Basin and eastern Sierra Nevada: Evidence from the northern Inyo Mountains near Tinemaha Reservoir, east-central California	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Geologic relationships exposed near Tinemaha Reservoir southeast of Big Pine, east-central California, provide key chronological and structural constraints for linking Permian and Triassic deformational events recognized in the White and Inyo Mountains in the western Great Basin with those in the eastern Sierra Nevada, particularly the Mount Morrison and Saddlebag Lake pendants. Permian to earliest Triassic deformation in the Tinemaha Reservoir area produced a large north- to northwest-trending, east-vergent, originally recumbent syncline (Mule Spring syncline) cut by an overriding thrust (Strange Hill thrust). We correlate this deformation with a middle Permian to earliest Triassic contractional deformation recognized in the southern Inyo Mountains, and with a major episode of folding and thrust faulting in the eastern Sierra Nevada. After a period of tectonic quiescence and marine sedimentation in the Early Triassic, rocks in the Tinemaha Reservoir area were refolded twice, producing distinctive sets of steeply plunging folds. Similar structures in the Mount Morrison pendant that formed prior to intrusion of a 225 +/- 16 Ma dike along the Laurel-Convict fault are correlated with those in. the Tinemaha Reservoir area. The timing of these folding events may be similar to that of displacement on the Golconda and/or Lundy Canyon thrusts in the Saddlebag Lake pendant. Close structural and stratigraphic ties suggest that rocks in the northeastern part of the Mount Morrison pendant and Tinemaha Reservoir area, now separated by similar to65 km of dextral displacement along the cryptic Tinemaha fault, originally lay adjacent to one another. This offset postdates Triassic folding and is inferred to predate emplacement of the latest Triassic Wheeler Crest Granodiorite, which crops out across the projected fault trace.																			0016-7606					OCT	2002	114	10					1210	1221		10.1130/0016-7606(2002)114<1210:COPATD>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(2002)114<1210:COPATD>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000178490000002

Average values over the 2 yr period for these parameters in the photic zone (0 to 15 m) were PP, 1539 mg C m(-2) d(-1); CR, 1653 mg C m(-2) d(-1); BBP, 887 Mg C m(-2) d(-1); BN, 4.6 x 10(6) cells ml(-1); and BOD5, 6366 mg C m(-2). We used these data together with literature-based assumptions about the ratio of net to gross primary production, bacterial and zooplankton respiration to estimate bacterial growth efficiencies (BGE) ranging from 44 to 64 %. Bacterial specific growth rates averaged 0.33 d(-1), ranging from 0.13 to 0.93 d(-1). CR was significantly correlated with both PP and BBP. A significant correlation was found between BBP and BOD5, suggesting that the indigenous bacterial populations were strongly dependent on substrates measured by BOD5. The potentially labile fractions of TOC, as quantified by BOD5, were rapidly cycled by heterotrophic bacteria, within similar to4 d on average. With the exception of 6 to 8 wk in early summer, the photic zone of this warm mesotrophic-eutrophic lake, with low inputs of allochthonous organic carbon, was net autotrophic. BBP and BGE values were high in comparison to those reported from even more eutrophic aquatic systems. Our results indicate that bacteria are by far the major biological agents of organic carbon cycling in Lake Kinneret, and contradict the general perception that the microbial loop plays a less important role in carbon cycling in eutrophic than in oligotrophic aquatic systems.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				JAN 16	2004	34	1					43	55		10.3354/ame034043	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame034043													WOS:000188829700005

Some of these problems have been solved by biological control using the beetle Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). (2) Intrinsic rates of growth by S. molesta were measured every week over periods of from 16 weeks to 2 years at seven sites located near the equator to 33.degree. S. The rates varied between zero, at the most southerly site in winter, up to 0.17 leaves per leaf per day (0.16 g g-1 d-1). (3) Self-crowding when the water surface was just completely covered, 50% shading, and one adult C. salviniae per five ramets of S. molesta, reduced intrinsic growth rates by 0.04, 0.03 and 0.005 g g-1 d-1 respectively. (4) Among the sites, intrinsic rates of growth and net assimilation rates were generally significantly correlated with air temperature and NPK content of the plant. In contrast, leaf weight ratio, top/root ratio and ramet weight were generally negatively correlated with the same variables. (5) Intrinsic growth rates, when adjusted for temperature effects using a relationship found in earlier controlled-environment studies, had a relationship with the nitrogen content of the plant very similar to that found in controlled-environment studies of the effects of nitrogen. (6) A model, based on the above relationship with N-content and controlled environment studies of the effects of temperature, explained between 40% and 80% of the variance in intrinsic growth rates observed at the different sites. There was little effect on the amount of variance explained if the model was driven by water temperatures calculated from observed air temperatures or by water temperatures calculated from latitude and date, and by mean temperature of hourly temperatures interpolated from daily maxima and minima. Adding sunshine and P-content of the plant did not increase the fit of predicted to observed rates of growth. (7) At one site, the intrinsic growth rate was shown to be limited by the seasonal progression of temperature to a smooth annual cycle onto which were superimposed shorter frequency peaks and troughs resulting from the sequence: rainfall, runoff, elevated concentration of N in lakewater, elevated concentration of N in tissues of S. molesta, increased rate of growth by the plant. (8) A model was built to predict rates of growth for any latitude, altitude, time of year and nitrogen content of the plant. Predicted mean annual growth rates are presented for latitudes between zero and 50.degree.

The distribution of isoprenoid GDGTs has GDGT-0/crenachaol > 2 and therefore the widely used TEX86 is precluded from being used for the calculation of lake water temperature in this lake. The total concentration of branched GDGTs (br-GDGTs) in the soils, SPM, and lake bottom sediments ranged from 91.3-223.7 ng/g, 17.8-41.4 ng/L, and 864.2-2008.6 ng/g, respectively. The molecular composition of br-GDGTs, MBT values (methylation of br-GDGTs), and CBT values (the cyclization ratio of br-GDGTs) in the catchment soils differ from those in lake materials. This difference indicates that br-GDGTs in the lake are largely produced in situ. Based on the global lake-specific MBT/CBT-MAT (mean air temperature) calibration, the air temperature was reconstructed for lacustrine material in Huguangyan Maar. The estimates fall in the range 23.2-23.8 degrees C, similar to the average value of local MAT for the preceding 45 years. The paleotemperature history of Huguangyan Maar was reconstructed using br-GDGTs extracted from a sediment core spanning the period 0.3-3.7 ka, and ranged from 24.6 to 263 degrees C. The temperature pattern of Huguangyan Maar based on the global lake-specific MBT/CBT-MAT resembles those recorded in East China using numerous indicators. The pattern consists of five cool and four warm periods, including two distinct phases within the Medieval Warm Period (900-1300 AD), the coldest temperature in the Little Ice Age (1550-1850 AD) and reveals even finer temperature variations than other indicators. This new method based on br-GDGTs, produced in situ in the subtropical lacustrine environment, provides a new sensitive and precise paleotemperature proxy for lacustrine sediments for which other GDGT-based proxies are not applicable.

CONDOR												Reservoirs often have highly fluctuating water levels. The perimeters of these impoundments, which alternate between being exposed or inundated by water (drawdown zone), are used by nesting birds, but at the risk of nest submergence when water levels rise. For species that nest above the ground in shrubs, foraging and predation may also be affected by flooded habitat. Our objective was to clarify the net impact that habitat flooding has on nest survivorship at Arrow Lakes Reservoir, British Columbia, Canada. This reservoir typically shows a pattern of water management where water is stored during the spring snowmelt (increasing water levels) and released later in the year. Yellow Warblers (Setophaga petechia; n = 272 nests) and Willow Flycatchers (Empidonax traillii; n = 81 nests) nested in similar parts of the drawdown zone, but differences in their nesting behaviors, particularly timing of nesting, caused the flycatchers to experience more nest submergence. Flycatchers also nested on a floating island of bog habitat, offering them some protection from nest submergence. We found little evidence that drawdown zone shrubs functioned as ecological traps. In flooded conditions, 28% of warbler nests failed due to submergence. Warbler nest daily survival rate (DSR) declined with advancing ordinal date, and we concluded that their DSR was not influenced by habitat flooding. For flycatchers, 50% of nest failures were caused by submergence under flooded conditions, but DSR did not differ between flooded (0.960 +/- 0.009) and unflooded conditions (0.958 +/- 0.012). We speculate that these counterintuitive results may be explained by a reduction in predation levels during flooded conditions, which may compensate for nest submergence. Finally, we found that nest DSR was enhanced in the floating island habitat (0.986 +/- 0.005), indicating that floating habitat islands can be highly productive and may hold potential as a management tool for enhancing productivity of reservoir drawdown zones.

THE DESCRIPTION AND HOST-PARASITE RELATIONSHIPS OF A NEW QUADRIGYRID SPECIES (ACANTHOCEPHALA) FROM THE PERSIAN TOOTH-CARP, APHANIUS FARSICUS (ACTINOPTREYGII: CYPRINODONTIDAE) IN IRAN	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Acanthogyrus (Acanthosentis) barmeshoori n. sp. (Quadrigyridae) is described from the Persian tooth-carp, Aphanius farsicus Teimori, Esmaeili, and Reichenbacher, 2011 (Cyprinodontidae) in the Maharlu Lake basin, southern Iran. Aphanius farsicus is an endemic freshwater fish found in streams and springs that drain into Maharlu Lake, Shiraz, Iran. The new species is the smallest of all the 44 known species of the subgenus Acanthosentis Verma and Datta, 1929, measuring between 0.26 and 1.68 mm in length. It is further distinguished by having a short cylindrical proboscis with very long anterior hooks widely separated from very small hooks in 2 very close circles posteriorly (hook length ratio about 4: 1). It is separated from 4 other species of Acanthosentis with similar proboscis armature but with less-extreme diversification of hook length. The new species is also distinguished in having anterior para-receptacle structures (PRS) and a similar posterior structure like those reported in only 1 other species of Acanthosentis from Japan. Proboscis receptacle is single walled with a large triangular cephalic ganglion. Testes are large, pre-equatorial, and Saefftigen's pouch is prominent. Fourteen to 25 circles of spines cover the anterior 50-70% of the trunk, but a few spines may be present at posterior end of trunk. This is the first species of Acanthosentis where SEM images, showing external morphological details, are provided. From a total of 357 fish specimens examined between July 2006 and June 2007, 173 specimens (48.5%) were infected with individuals of the new species. The prevalence of infection decreased with increasing fish size. The parasite was observed all year, with the highest abundance and intensity in May while the prevalence was highest in February. The prevalence of acanthocephalans decreased with increasing fish size. While most worms were recovered in fish within the length range of 18-29.9 mm, 1 of the longest parasites (1.68 mm long) was found in fish within the range of 30-33.9 mm long.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				APR	2013	99	2					257	263		10.1645/GE-3247.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/GE-3247.1								22994245					WOS:000322520700013

Reduction in biomass of freshwater arctic vegetation by foraging and nesting hyperabundant herbivores shows recovery	ECOSPHERE												Arctic-nesting geese are specialist herbivores of grasses and sedges (collectively, graminoids). Under moderate grazing pressure, these migratory herbivores can create and maintain arctic grazing lawns with high nutritional content and low aboveground biomass. Nutrient and energy subsidies from southern agricultural landscapes during winter have improved survival among populations of Ross's (Anser rossii) and lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens), leading to marked population growth. Resulting goose hyperabundance has raised conservation concern for resilience of arctic ecosystems to withstand cumulative and intense pressures of herbivory and nest construction. We used both design-based (experimental herbivore exclosures) and model-based methods to investigate changes to plant community structure in direct response to foraging and nesting by these species within the Queen Maud Gulf (Ahiak) Migratory Bird Sanctuary, Nunavut, Canada. Annual nest construction and foraging by up to similar to 1.3 million geese at a large colony at Karrak Lake markedly reduced aboveground biomass of forage (graminoids) and non-forage (foliose and fruticose lichens) vegetation, with spatial variation in reduction associated with intensity of use by geese. Within vast brood-rearing regions, foraging reduced above- and belowground plant biomass of lowland plant communities by 61% and 29%, respectively, between 1994 (when herbivore exclosures were established) and 2017. In addition to landscape diversity associated with abiotic properties created by geomorphic processes, long-term herbivory by geese further increased spatial heterogeneity in vegetation at the landscape scale. Although foraging geese nearly completely depleted aboveground plant biomass in some parts of their brood-rearing areas, belowground biomass was largely conserved, and thus, plant communities had strong potential for aboveground regeneration. We propose that the effects of high-density nesting and foraging by Ross's and lesser snow geese in the central Canadian Arctic, while extensive, are ephemeral and prone to reversion following cessation of grazing and nesting pressure, such as that afforded by shifts in herbivore distribution or local population decline.

Farmer-managed small-scale irrigation systems for sustainable crop production in Uganda, East Africa	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT												The programme was undertaken for a period of two years (March, 1994 to February, 1996) to study the feasibility of installing, designing and laying out the farmers managed small-scale irrigation system for sustainable crop production in Uganda (East Africa) based on participatory approach. The work started having its nucleus activities in Masaka, one of the advanced districts in agriculture. The area used to receive bimodal rainfall giving birth of two crop seasons to a range of annual precipitation of about 1400 mm in a year. Because of sharp decline of annual rainfall (about 500-700 mm/year) from the year 1988 and onwards that leads the planners to emphasize the scientific approach of introducing irrigation water management for crop cultivation in order to get sustainable production. The programme consisted of bench mark survey of 27 randomly selected individual farmers having large, medium and small (>150, 50-150 and <50 hectare, respectively) holding size followed by a diagnostic survey to provide technical instruction and guidelines to the individual in accordance with water resources availability and land situations and model demonstration. A reconnaissance tour programme was also undertaken to rehabilitate the days long practices and earlier efforts along with to bring the resource personnel together in the field of irrigation. The work over the 2-year period recommended that the farmers having abundant water resources could be grouped into three categories; (1) having continuous flow of water connected with perennial sources within the farm area; (2) having lake/river as water source with considerable area under riverbed or river basin; (3) having existing water harvesting structures fully recharged with ground water or flowing surface water and plenty of pounded water with natural springs which could be brought under irrigated agriculture. It was also suggested two other categories of farm lands where either (1) there was possibility of constructing water harvesting structures for recycling the stored rain water for crop cultivation and to take conservational land treatments to preserve more moisture for growing crops under management of rainfed agriculture or (2) to improve the existing dug or tube wells to increase its capacity for livestock and domestic purposes and also to provide life saving irrigation to the standing crops on emergency basis. Small-scale irrigation systems based on farmers' participation for sustainable crop production was successfully designed and laid out befitting the individual farm requirements.																			1459-0255					AUG-DEC	2003	1	3-4					312	315																WOS:000208574900061
J	BIRKS, HJB				BIRKS, HJB			LATE WISCONSIN VEGETATIONAL AND CLIMATIC HISTORY AT KYLEN LAKE, NORTHEASTERN MINNESOTA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Kylen Lake, located within the Toimi drumlin field, is critically positioned in relation to Late Wisconsin glacial advances, for it lies between the areas covered by the Superior and St. Louis glacial lobes between 12,00-16,000 yr B.P. The pollen and plant-macrofossil record suggests the presence of open species-rich tundra barrens from 13,600-15,850 yr B.P. Small changes in percentages of Artemisia pollen between 14,300-13,600 yr B.P. appear to be artifacts of pollen-percentage data. Shrub-tundra with dwarf birch, willow and Rhododendron lapponicum developed between 13,600-12,000 yr B.P. Black and white spruce and tamarack then expanded to form a vegetation not dissimilar to that of the modern forest-tundra ectone of northern Canada. At 10,700 B.P. spruce and jack pine increased to form a mosaic dominated by jack pine and white spruce on dry sites and black spruce, tamarack, and deciduous trees such as elm and ash on moist fertile sites. At 9250 yr. B.P. red pine and paper birch became dominant to form a vegetation that may have resembled the dry northern forests of Wisconsin today. The diagram terminates at 8410 .+-. 85 yr B.P. Climatic interpretation of this vegetational succession suggests a progressive increase in temperature since 14,300 yr B.P. This unidirectional trend in climate contrasts with the glacial history of the area. Hypotheses are presented to explain this lack of correspondence between pollen stratigraphy and glacial history. The preferred hypothesis is that the ice-margin fluctuations were controlled primarily by changes in winter snow accumulation in the source area of the glacier, whereas the vegetation and hence the pollen stratigraphy were controlled by climatic changes in front of the ice margin.

J	Baffico, GD				Baffico, Gustavo D.			Epilithic Algae Distribution Along a Chemical Gradient in a Naturally Acidic River, Rio Agrio (Patagonia, Argentina)	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The epilithic algae distribution along a pH gradient and the relationship between the chemical gradient and biomass development were studied in Rio Agrio, a naturally acidic river located in Patagonia (Argentina). The epilithic community was monitored during the summer of three consecutive years in sites located above and below the entrance of tributaries. The epilithic community showed differences between sites based on the chemical composition of the water and the precipitates that appear on the streambed of the river. The lowest biomass, diversity, and number of species were found at the most extreme part of the river in terms of pH (ca. 2) and element concentrations. Euglena mutabilis was the dominant species in this section of the river. As pH increased (ca. 3), the community changed to be dominated by filamentous green algae (Ulothrix spp., Mougeotia sp., Klebsormidium sp.) showing luxuriant growths in terms of biomass. With the inflow of a neutral tributary, the pH of Rio Agrio increased above 3, and the precipitates of orange-red iron hydroxides appeared. The algal community was not affected by these precipitates or the low P concentrations, along the next 30 km of river downstream from this site. The apparent physical stress that the precipitates impose on algae is in fact a dynamic reservoir of P because diel cycle of Fe could be promoting precipitation and redissolution processes that binds and releases P from these precipitates. Where the pH increased above 6, precipitates of aluminum hydroxides appeared. At this site, the epilithic biomass and density decreased, some algae species changed, but the diversity and the number of species in general remained consistent with the upstream values. The physical stress of the Al precipitates on the algae is added to the chemical stress that represents the sequestering of P in these precipitates that are not redissolved, resulting P a limiting nutrient for algae growth.

In this frame, our study investigates (1) modern pollen-vegetation relationships and (2) changes in vegetation, human activity and climate in the Holocene record of Vanevan peat (south-eastern shore of Lake Sevan, Armenia), using a multiproxy approach including sediment geochemistry (XRF), pollen, Non-Pollen Palynomorphs (NPPs), and branched Glycerol Dialkyl Glycerol Tetraethers (brGDGTs). Climate reconstructions are provided by (1) water-level changes, (2) brGDGTs, and (3) pollen transfer functions (multi-method approach: Modern Analogue Technique, Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares regression, Random Forest, and Boosted Regression Trees). Modern pollen assemblages are selected along an altitudinal transect in Armenia. They show a dominance of Chenopodiaceae in semi-desert/steppe regions while meadows steppes, subalpine, and alpine meadows are dominated by Poaceae. Past vegetation is characterized by steppes dominated by Poaceae surrounded during the Mid-Holocene (8200-4200 a cal BP) by scarce open woodlands. Humans have influenced the local vegetation, mainly through their agricultural practices present since 5200 a cal BP with several intensification steps. Our reconstruction indicates a climate shift from a cold and arid Early Holocene toward a warmer and more humid Mid-Late Holocene. An aridification trend marks the last 5000 years causing a drop in water level, which allowed humans to live and cultivate on Lake Sevan shores. Arid events are recorded at 6.2 ka, 5.2 ka, 4.2 ka and 2.8 ka a cal BP, which are commonly related to multi-centennial-scale variations of Westerlies activity (North Atlantic Oscillation). Through our temperature reconstruction, we can assign (1) the 5.2 and 2.8 ka events as being cold and probably related to a strong Siberian High, and (2) the 4.2 ka event as being warm associated with high Arabian subtropical pressures in the South Caucasus and the Near East. Our study suggests a significant impact of these arid events on the Lake Sevan shore populations and they are consistent with cultural phases in the South Caucasus, thus showing the impact of climatic variations on cultural, land use and occupation mode development in this crossroad region between Europe, Africa and Asia.

J	Michele, J; Michele, V				Michele, J; Michele, V			The free jet as a means to improve water quality: Destratification and oxygen enrichment	LIMNOLOGICA												Rivers, lakes, and coastal waters are chaotic systems - physical, chemical, and biological parameters influence their development. Each parameter itself is influenced by the system. Human interaction has led to fast eutrophication. Oxygen input and artificial mixing have been considered as tools to overcome the biggest problems of fish kills, algal blooms, and bad odour. The favoured technology for destratification and oxygen input so far is the bubble curtain. This technology has been applied successfully in several cases. But often, this technology could not be implemented because of high investment and operating costs. Alternatively, the free jet is discussed as an efficient and low investment and operating cost technology. The free jet may transport oxygen-rich water from the surface down into the hypolimnion, thereby destratifying a water system. A free jet entrains on its way down even more oxygen rich and warm epilimnic water. This water will finally - if some mixing with the cold hypolimnic water occurs - be transferred to the metalimnion. The density differences will make this water travel long distances. The energy input may be very low and the objective must not be to totally overturn a system. A jet started in early spring may help a lake to have a deep enough epilimnion, relatively large in volume in respect to the hypolimnion, and the normal wind will recirculate the water transferring enough oxygen to the deeper part, thus expanding the fish habitat and enabling benthic fauna. Literature also shows that the occurrence of massive algal blooms may be reduced. The oxygen efficiency can be multifold compared to standard technologies.																			0075-9511					DEC	2002	32	4					329	337		10.1016/S0075-9511(02)80024-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(02)80024-X													WOS:000181085000006
J	RIENECKER, WC				RIENECKER, WC			HARVEST DISTRIBUTION AND SURVIVAL OF MALLARDS BANDED IN CALIFORNIA, 1948-82	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												Over 108,000 mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, were banded in the Sacramento (Gray Lodge Wildlife Area) and San Joaquin valleys (Los Banos Wildlife Area), and northeastern California (Klamath Basin, Honey Lake, Mountain Meadows) during 1948-82. Analysis of recoveries shows that adult males survived at a higher annual rate (61%) than adult females did (56%), although recovery rates of males (9%) exceeded those of females (6%). Immature mallards survived at lower rates (male 47%-female 46%) and had higher recovery rates (male 14%-female 12%) than did adults. These survival rates were nearly identical to those reported for the continent as a whole. Direct recoveries of each age/sex class of mallards banded preseason at Gray Lodge and Los Banos were obtained most frequently in the region of banding (69-84% of recoveries). This was true also for all immatures banded preseason at Klamath Basin and Honey Lake (68-78% of direct recoveries), and adult females at Honey Lake (73% of recoveries). However, most adult males, and many adult females (Klamath Basin only), migrated prior to opening of the hunting season and were recovered in areas to the south (58-64% of recoveries in Central Valley-Bay Delta); these birds were either local or other postbreeders, or molt migrants returning to the Central Valley. Several lines of evidence suggest that, during the past 35 years, a progressively larger proportion of the California mallard harvest thas come from Klamath Basin and Central Valley mallard populations. First indirect recoveries in California of Klamath Basin preseason-banded mallards increased proportionately from the 1950''s to the 1980''s; and, most of this increase was in the Klamath Basin (1950''s-21.3% vs. 1980''s-41.7% of recoveries). Concurrently, indirect recoveries of Klamath Basin banded birds declined proportionately from Canada, the Sacramento Valley, and the San Joaquin Valley. Second, the proportion of indirect recoveries of Gray Lodge preseason-banded mallards increased in all California areas, but declined in all non-California recovery areas including Canada (7.8% in the 1950''s, 1.5% in the 1970''s). Also, recoveries in California of mallards banded postseason at Gray Lodge increased proportionately in the 1980''s (88.4%) compared to the 1950''s (62.2%); concurrently, a proportionate downward trend in out-of-state recoveries occurred, especially from Alberta (1950''s-13.4% to 1980''s-1.9%). This increased proportion of resident mallards, concurrent with an apparent increase in the California breeding population, coincided with a marked increase of wintering mallards in the Columbia Basin of Washington and Oregon, and a reduced breeding population in prairie Canada. Thus, mallards could be managed separately in California during periods when significant numbers of northern mallards are not present. Additional research is recommended.																			0008-1078	2331-0405				WIN	1990	76	1					14	30																WOS:A1990DE57400002
J	Floyd, PA; Helvaci, C; Mittwede, SK				Floyd, PA; Helvaci, C; Mittwede, SK			Geochemical discrimination of volcanic rocks associated with borate deposits: an exploration tool?	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												The Miocene borate deposits of western Turkey are associated with extensive medium- to high-K calc-alkali igniometric volcanism and a differentiated comagmatic alkaline trachybasalt-trachydacite lava suite. Ignimbritic air-fall and reworked pumiceous elastic materials are intimately associated with lake sediments that host the borate deposits. Local ignimbritic volcanism is considered the primary source of the B for the Kirka borate deposit in this area. Comparison of the geochemical composition of Turkish ignimbrites associated with borates ('fertile' ignimbrites) with those that do not ('barren' ignimbrites), exhibit a number of features that might prove useful in the exploration for borates in similar volcanic domains. In particular, 'fertile' ignimbrites are (a) generally a high-K calc-alkali suite, well-evolved and fractionated (K/Rb is low, < 200) with a high-silica rhyolitic bulk composition, (b) exhibit a combined high content of B, As, F, Li and Pb, with high B/La (> 1) and B/K (> 0.001) ratios, and (c) a mildly fractionated REE pattern (La-N/Yb-N similar to 2) and large positive Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* similar to 0.1). Other apparent discriminants involving both compatible and incompatible elements (relative to major silicate phases) are largely a function of different degrees of partial melting and fractionation. It is suggested that the initial source of the B (and other associated elements) was from LIL-rich fluids released by the progressive dehydration of altered oceanic crust and pelagic sediments in a subduction zone. The absence or presence of sediments in a segmented subduction zone may influence the variable lateral distribution of borates in active margins on a global scale. Once the crust has become enriched in B via previous or contemporary subduction-related calc-alkali magmatism, the effect of tectonic environment, climate and hydrothermal activity influence the local development of the deposits.

J	Warren, JK				Warren, JK			Evaporites, brines and base metals: Fluids, flow and 'the evaporite that was'	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Waters in modern evaporite systems are marine, non-marine, or hybrid but mineralogies in most ancient systems are not so simple that marine and non-marine brines can be easily interpreted from the chemistry of their precipitates. Complications arise related to subsurface brine mixing and back-reactions both at the surface and in the subsurface. The precipitation order of ancient bittern salts from seawater may have been dependent on flux rates of river inflow relative to flux rates through mid-ocean ridges. In ancient continental systems the chemistry of the inflow waters was a fundamental control on the subsequent mineral paragenesis. Our lack of hydrogeochemical understanding of ancient evaporite systems has led to the 'potash problem'. Potash evaporites, traditionally interpreted as marine salts, fall into two categories: (i) potash deposits characterised by MgSO4 salts, such as polyhalite, kieserite and kainite; and (ii) potash deposits characterised by assemblages containing halite, sylvite and carnallite and entirely free or very poor in the magnesium-sulfate salts. This latter group makes up more than 60% of ancient potash deposits. The former group may well be marine-derived but the latter group must have precipitated from Na-Ca-Mg-K-Cl brines with compositions quite different from that of concentrated modern seawater. After primary precipitation, ongoing pore-water flow propels near-surface and burial diagenesis, both processes that can dissolve and reprecipitate evaporites and drive the chemical evolution of subsurface brines. The hydrologic framework of a large evaporite basin consists of several regimes: (i) the active phreatic-depositional; (ii) the compactional; (iii) the thermobaric; and (iv) the active phreatic-exhumation/uplift. Boundaries are indistinct and transitional. Nonetheless the regimes show hydrological end-members characterised by distinct relative positions, hydrogeochemistries, flow dynamics and evaporite textures. Basin-scale dissolution and remobilisation of evaporite units can occur within all these hydrological settings with the relatively impervious evaporite unit acting both as a focus for fluid flow and as a source of dissolved ions in the subsurface brines. On a geologic time scale both meteoric and brine-reflux driven circulations are rapid and at least partially convective through the subsiding sediment pile. Evaporite units can also act as pressure seals and instigate convectional flow in the compactional and thermobaric regimes. With the cessation of basin subsidence, compactional and thermobaric flow rates slow down and finally cease. This is followed at some later stage by a phase of emergence of basin fill, perhaps due to a sea-level fall or basin uplift. The resulting depositionally inactive, or hydrologically mature, sedimentary basin is increasingly subject to gravity-driven meteoric circulation and the basin evaporites are increasingly Bushed by meteoric waters. Into this hydrological framework fit the various diagenetic textures of former evaporite beds. Textures include: caprocks, basal anhydrites, some rhythmically banded lead-zinc ores, as well as the more usual indicators of 'the evaporite that was'-evaporite dissolution breccias, rauhwacken, silicified evaporite nodules, calcitised evaporites and calcitised dolomites. Beyond the normal sedimentary realm of evaporite studies lies the metamorphic realm. In this context meta-evaporite deposits are discussed, along with indicator processes of: scapolitisation, albitisation, anorthositisation and tourmalinisation. The various indicator textures are then used to discuss the evolution of the earth's surface waters from the Archaean till the Phanerozoic. Halite the mineral or its pseudomorphs characterise areas of widespread chemical sedimentation from the Archaean to the present. Calcium sulfate is more enigmatic. Widespread beds composed of calcium sulfate minerals or their pseudomorphs were scarce to absent up to approximately 1.8 Ga. Since then the halite/gypsum precipitates from a concentrating seawater brine reflect the same predictable succession of precipitated salts as is found in modem seawater (with possible complications in the bittern salts). This implies marine water has maintained similar proportions of major ions throughout the Phanerozoic and the Proterozoic back to 1.9-1.8 Ga. Prior to this the Archaean ocean may have been a Na-HCO3 ocean and not the Na-Cl ocean of today.																			0812-0099					APR	1997	44	2					149	183		10.1080/08120099708728302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120099708728302													WOS:A1997WT84400001

Matching Watershed and Otolith Chemistry to Establish Natal Origin of an Endangered Desert Lake Sucker	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Stream habitat restoration and supplemental stocking of hatchery-reared fish have increasingly become key components of recovery plans for imperiled freshwater fish; however, determining when to discontinue stocking efforts, prioritizing restoration areas, and evaluating restoration success present a conservation challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that otolith microchemistry is an effective tool for establishing natal origin of the June Sucker Chasmistes liorus, an imperiled potamodromous fish. This approach allows us to determine whether a fish is of wild or hatchery origin in order to assess whether habitat restoration enhances recruitment and to further identify areas of critical habitat. Our specific objectives were to (1) quantify and characterize chemical variation among three main spawning tributaries; (2) understand the relationship between otolith microchemistry and tributary chemistry; and (3) develop and validate a classification model to identify stream origin using otolith microchemistry data. We quantified molar ratios of Sr: Ca, Ba: Ca, and Mg: Ca for water and otolith chemistry from three main tributaries to Utah Lake, Utah, during the summer of 2013. Water chemistry (log(e) transformed Sr: Ca, Ba: Ca, and Mg: Ca ratios) differed significantly across all three spawning tributaries. We determined that Ba: Ca and Sr: Ca ratios were the most important variables driving our classification models, and we observed a strong linear relationship between water and otolith values for Sr: Ca and Ba: Ca but not for Mg: Ca. Classification models derived from otolith element : Ca signatures accurately sorted individuals to their experimental tributary of origin (classification tree: 89% accuracy; random forest model: 91% accuracy) and determined wild versus hatchery origin with 100% accuracy. Overall, this study aids in evaluating the effectiveness of restoration, tracking progress toward recovery, and prioritizing future restoration plans for fishes of conservation concern. Our results have further application, such as identifying subpopulations that provide the greatest reproductive contribution to a metapopulation or finding the reproductive area and origin of invasive fishes.					; Budy, Phaedra/B-2415-2012; Crowl, Todd/C-9576-2011	Crowl, Todd/0000-0002-4712-8701; 													0002-8487	1548-8659					2017	146	4					732	743		10.1080/00028487.2017.1301994	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2017.1301994													WOS:000403848200013

Understating the wading depths of cranes is a pressing concern for the better management of wetlands and robust conservation of the overwintering cranes populations. Yet, practically it is very difficult to precisely measure the wading depths due to several limitations like, inaccessibility and sampling difficulties. In the current study a sample of 1288 wading photographs of cranes, based on the constancy of proportion of tibiotarsus to tarsometatarsus was taken in Caohai wetland situated in the Northwest Guizhou Province of southwest China. Caohai Wetland is the biggest overwintering wetland around the world, and a very promising area to infer the exact ranges of wading depths of these cranes. The ratio of tibiotarsus to tarsometatarsus of the cranes standing on the lands and the ratio of tibiotarsus to the rest of tarsometatarsus of the cranes standing in water were measured; to infer the projection depths of the part of tarsometatarsus submerged in water, which was used to calculate the accurate depth range of the cranes by comparing with the referenced values. According to the results, 89.92% of individuals preferred the water depths from (0-20] cm, 76.11% preferred (0-10] cm% while water depths for 49.04% individuals was (0-5] cm. Thus we conclude that the Black-necked Cranes prefer a depth range of (0-10] cm. This water depth may be relative to the swamps around the lake, which are very important foraging and roosting sites for cranes, For better habitat management, we strongly recommend paying special attention to swamps with specific water depth ranges, particularly when the water level changes.					khattak, Romaan/JAO-0697-2023; Hu, Yao/KEH-3649-2024; Su, jun/AFD-5510-2022	Khattak, Romaan Hayat/0000-0002-8047-1835; SU, Haijun/0000-0002-2123-0660													0923-4861	1572-9834				APR	2022	30	2					331	339		10.1007/s11273-022-09863-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-022-09863-7		FEB 2022											WOS:000753774800001

Physical Assets Ownership of Fisherfolk in Fishing Communities of Kainji Lake Nigeria: Implications for Climate Change	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION												A probe was carried out to ascertain fisherfolk ownership of physical assets for fisheries activities in fishing communities' vis-a-vis implication of climate change around Kainji Lake. Interview schedule was employed to generate primary data from 165 respondents in eleven fishing communities on western side of the lake and analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Information on personal characteristics revealed that most of the respondents were advanced in age, small scale artisan fisherfolk with many years of experience, self employed and married with children but had poor education. Physical assets owned fall into three categories of fishing asset (33.3%), fish processing asset (41.7%) and accessories (25%). Conspicuous assets owned were fishing net, wooden canoe, hook & line, fish drying net, improved banda and modified drum smoking kiln. Physical assets that use wood and fuelwood which impinged on climate change were fishing canoe, improved banda and modified drum smoking kiln. Correlates of improved banda and modified drum kiln were marital status and number of wives. It implies that marital family's ownership of fish smoking processing assets contributed to climate change problems through deforestation thereby causing desertification, soil erosion, destruction of ecosystem and weather variations with serious consequences on water bodies, fisheries, and livelihood in fishery around the lake. Worrisome is zero ownership of solar tent dryer which uses renewable energy of the sun and friendly to climate change adaptation. In view of prevailing evidence, adaptation to climate change is subject to modification of solar net drier to meet fish smoking needs. In alternative is exploration of biomass energy sources that is sustainable like rice husk for fish smoking as a mitigation strategy.																			1119-944X	2408-6851				DEC	2012	16	2					92	103		10.4314/jae.v16i2.8	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/jae.v16i2.8													WOS:000420200700007

Role of Snow in Runoff Processes in a Subalpine Hillslope: Field Study in the Ward Creek Watershed, Lake Tahoe, California, during 2000 and 2001 Water Years	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Field study is an essential component of hydrologic science because all hydrological studies must be conducted by such observation-based knowledge of real watersheds. Hillslope runoff processes have been intensively investigated, but the flow process at the boundary between the snowpack and ground surface has not been well documented. A field site at the northwest sector of the Ward Creek watershed, Lake Tahoe Basin, was built for observations of overland flow, subsurface stormflow, and channel flow, simultaneously with atmospheric measurements to examine the hydrology at a snow-covered hillslope. Also, the groundwater table under the snowpack was monitored by shallow wells at the hillslope. All field-measured atmospheric data were synthesized with an energy-balance snow model, and the snowmelt rate and energy balance were computed. The results of the analyses indicate that most of the snowmelt water infiltrated into the topsoil layers and that saturated subsurface flow was the largest contributor to the stream channel flow throughout the observation period. However, overland flow or longitudinal flow within the snowpack may still happen even over an unfrozen and unsaturated topsoil on a relatively mild hillslope (16%). The quantification of observations of overland/within snowpack flow showed that the snowpack enhanced the overland runoff, which caused higher peaks in flow discharge and sediment production. Analysis of the major rain-on-snow event of May 7, 2000, revealed that snowmelt water, caused by the energy flux from raindrops, might not be the major contributor to the runoff peak discharge since very little snowmelt was observed during the rain-on-snow event. Consequently, spring storm hydrographs in the Sierra Nevada seem to be affected by the high-soil water in the topsoil because of the daily water supply by snowmelt and by overland/within snowpack flow caused by the capillary suction forces in the snowpack.

J	GOULD, HR; BUDINGER, TF				GOULD, HR; BUDINGER, TF			CONTROL OF SEDIMENTATION AND BOTTOM CONFIGURATION BY CONVECTION CURRENTS, LAKE-WASHINGTON, WASHINGTON	JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH												Lake Washington near Seattle occupies a deep narrow trough sculptured by the Vashon ice sheet, the last continental glacier to invade the Seattle area. Extending along the center of the trough is a broad ridge that stands 5 to 30 feet above narrow valleys on either side. Thus, the trough in cross-section is W-shaped rather than U-shaped, as are most glacial valleys. The sediments in the trough consist of blue clay, locally more than 100 feet thick, overlain by limnic peat or gyttja 5 to 55 feet thick. The blue clay consists of rock flour of meltwater origin and the limnic peat consists of planktonic organisms that began to accumulate following the melt-water stage. Within the limnic peat are a layer of volcanic ash and an overlying layer of varved peat, each about 2 inches thick. Radiocarbon analyses place the age of the ash at 6700 years and that of the blue-clay peat contact at 13,650 years. The estimated age of the varved layers is 5000 years. Core profiles across the lake show that the trough was U-shaped at the close of blue-clay deposition and that the W-shaped profile had approximately its present configuration at the time of the ash fall. Investigations of the lake-temperature structure, together with certain distinctive features of the lake topography and sediments, point to convection currents as being the agents responsible for the observed inequalities in limnic-peat sedimentation which, in turn, account for the unusual W-shaped configuration of the trough floor.

Satellite-derived shallow water depths estimation using remote sensing and artificial intelligence models, a case study: Darbandikhan Lake Upper, Kurdistan Region, Iraq	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												Bathymetric mapping provides valuable information for the estimation of the depth and volume of enclosed inland water bodies that are useful in the planning and management of water resources. The use of conventional methods for the detection of shallow water depth, specifically in flooded areas, has been challenging. However, advances in remote sensing technology combined with artificial intelligence (AI) offer a reliable method. This study presents a reliable method to estimate water depth, using the Darbandikhan Lake Upper (DLU) as a test site. The novelty of this work lies in using a combination of Quantile Regression Forests (QRF), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approaches together with the reflectance of Sentinel-2 and the ICESat-2 LiDAR data to estimate the depth of the water in the DLU during the 2019 spring flood. Our results gave the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual depth obtained from the ICESat-2 and the estimated depth from the applied artificial intelligence models of 0.984, 0.983, 0.868, and 0.809; and 0.545, 0.569, 1.618, and 2.143 for the QRF, RF, SVM, and ANN models, respectively. This study, which applied the QRF model for the first time to determine the satellite-derived water depths, produced the most accurate result, with the maximum and mean estimated depth of DLU being 19.93 and 6.29 m, respectively. This study shows that the most sensitive bands to estimate the bathymetry are Band 9 (940 nm), Band 3 (560 nm), and Band 5 (705 nm) of the Sentinel-2, while the less sensitive bands are Band 2 (490 nm) and Band 11 (1610 nm). We argue that this technique can be applied to estimate the depth of shallow water bodies using passive satellite imageries in other regions of the world regardless of the full coverage availability of ICESat-2.

J	SCHOFIELD, CL; GALLOWAY, JN; HENDRY, GR				SCHOFIELD, CL; GALLOWAY, JN; HENDRY, GR			SURFACE-WATER CHEMISTRY IN THE ILWAS BASINS	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Alkalinity and pH differences observed between the three ILWAS lakes (Panther, Sagamore, and Woods lakes) [Adirondack Mountains, New York, USA] are primarily a result of inherent watershed differences in base cation supply rates, relative to comparable strong acid input levels. The relatively high proportion of base rich ground water input to Panther Lake results in high pH and alkalinity (annual mean pH 6.2, alkalinity 147 .mu.eq L-1). In contrast, shallow interflow with excess strong acid and high Al levels dominates the Woods Lake basin (annual mean pH 4.7, alkalinity -10 .mu.eq L-1). Temporal acidification, observed in all three basins during snowmelt, occurs as a result of base cation dilution (particularly in Panther Lake) and increased strong acid anion levels. These marked changes in surface water chemistry are related to an upward shift in flow paths from ground water dominated base flow to shallow interflow during increased snowmelt discharge. Elevated nitrate and Al levels observed during these episodes suggest that HNO3 from the snowpack and soil nitrification triggers acidification and Al mobilization. On an annual basis, Al export rates were less than 2% of total base cation output from the Panther basin and 23% of base cation output from Woods basin. Woods Lake itself serves as a secondary sink for Al exported from the soils of the watershed, particularly during the summer months when increasing pH levels induce Al precipitation. Annually, an estimated 43% of the Al entering the lake is retained. Strong acid neutralization in the ILWAS basins appears to be a two-stage process, with initial Al mobilization in upper soil horizons followed by primary mineral dissolution and alkalinity production in deeper soil horizons. Separation of these processes in either time or space results in incomplete neutralization, acidification, and export of inorganic Al to surface waters.					; Galloway, James/C-2769-2013	Galloway, James/0000-0001-7676-8698; 													0049-6979	1573-2932					1985	26	4					403	423																WOS:A1985AVW2700006

Fish samples were obtained from Qarun Lake, Egypt, during the summer of 2019. They were dry-salted with a salt content of 20% (w/w) and stored at a range of 28-32 degrees C for 60 days. Plain sauce was treated with 0.1% of garlic (Allium sativum), black seed (Nigella sativa), rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus) and jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) extracts, and stored at different conditions. The results showed that the plain sauce had a pH of 6.17, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) of 72.23 mg/100 ml, free amino nitrogen (FAN) of 12.86 mg/100 ml, acid value (AV) of 0.63 mg KOH/ml oil, and free fatty acids (FFAs) of 0.66 mg/100 ml. Fish sauce with garlic was the best compared to others based on sensory evaluation. With regard to the effect of storage conditions on the efficacy of plant extracts, it was found that at 33 +/- 2 degrees C jojoba, black seed and rosemary extracts con-trolled most quality indices, whereas at 5 +/- 2 degrees C all extracts were more effective in controlling the quality indices of the anchovy sauce. In conclusion, this study suggests that plant extracts especially under cold storage could improve the storage quality and extended shelf life of anchovy sauce. In general, both stor-age conditions and periods affected the protein and lipid hydrolysis of the fish sauce samples. Fish sauce is safe for human consumption based on the international permissible values. In addition, the resultant dried cake can be exploited in the field of food industry as a value-added product.					; Ibrahim, Mohamed/LBH-5568-2024	Ibrahim, Mohamed Abdellhady/0000-0001-6319-0110; 													1687-4285	2090-3278				DEC	2022	48	4					401	408		10.1016/j.ejar.2022.05.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejar.2022.05.001		DEC 2022											WOS:000899207000014

Assessment of glacier lakes development potential in the Central Caucasus	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												Glacier mass loss and consequent terminus retreat lead to formation and growth of glacier lakes. In Caucasus outbursts of glacial lakes formed in recent decades have led to human casualties and significant damage. In this study the location and volume of the potential glacier lakes in Central Caucasus was estimated based on ground and airborne GPR data, as well as using results of global ice thickness modelling. Selected glaciers are located in the Adyl-Su and Gerkhozhan-Su valleys as well on the southern and north-eastern slopes of Elbrus. The methodology was tested by retrospective modeling of Bolshoy Azau and Djikiugankez glaciers bed topography using 1957 topographic map. Seven existing lakes were predicted by the hydraulic potential in the areas where glaciers disappeared by 2017. Six overdeepenings on Djikiugankez glacier bed as of 1957 are currently absent, which might be related to the model uncertainties and the original DEMs errors, as well as to possible filling of lakes by sediments. Retrospective modeling of the Bashkara glacier bed topography based on SRTM DEM (2000) showed significant growth potential of the existing lake Lapa. Retrospective modeling of the Kaayarty glacier bed topography has not provided a clear answer whether the subglacial lake outburst flood was a trigger for catastrophic debris flow formation during the summer of 2000. In case of total disappearance of Bolshoy Azau, Djikiugankez and Bashkara glaciers at least 11 new lakes with total area of about 1.7 km(2) and an average depth of 8 m will form. While the deepest lake will be formed at the ablation zone of Bolshoy Azau glacier (at elevation 3100-3400 m a.s.l.) the largest in area (1 km(2)) glacial lake will appear at the Djikiugankez snout with maximum depth of 40 m and mean depth of 7.2 m. The simulation also showed that subglacial lakes of different number and size may also exist under studied glaciers. Our estimates may contain uncertainties due to low resolution of airborne GPR data and the lack of GPR data for Kayaarty glacier, DEM and ice thickness model errors. Detailed ground-based radar survey will enable the assessment of the size and volume of the potential subglacial lakes.

Benthic organisms, being an important food source for organisms from higher trophic levels, constitute an important part of the Arctic trophic network. Moreover, the long lifespan and limited mobility of some benthic species make them suitable for the study of the spatial and temporal variability of contaminants. In this study, organochlorine pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB)) were measured in benthic organisms collected in three fjords of western Spitsbergen. Two of these were recommended by the Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning (MARBEF) Network of Excellence as European flagship sites, namely Hornsund as the Biodiversity Inventory and Kongsfjorden as the Long-Term Biodiversity Observatory. Adventfjorden, with notable human activity, was also studied. Ʃ7 PCB and HCB concentrations in sediments were up to 2.4 and 0.18 ng/g d.w. respectively. Concentrations of Ʃ7 PCBs and HCB measured in collected benthic organisms were up to 9.1 and 13 ng/g w.w., respectively. In several samples (41 of 169) the concentrations of n-ary sumation 7 PCBs were below the detection limit values, yet nevertheless the results of the research show effective accumulation of target organochlorine contaminants by many Arctic benthic organisms. Important interspecies differences were observed. Free-living, mobile taxa, such as shrimp Eualus gaimardii, have accumulated a large quantity of contaminants, most probably due to their predatory lifestyle. n-ary sumation 7 PCB and HCB concentrations were both significantly higher in Hornsund than in Kongsfjorden. Biomagnification occurred in 0 to 100 % of the predator-prey pairs, depending on the congener analyzed. Although the sampled organisms were proved to have accumulated organochlorine contaminants, the measured levels can be considered low, and not posing a substantial threat to the biota.

C	Timperley, MH		Lyons, WB; HowardWilliams, C; Hawes, I		Timperley, MH			A simple temperature-based model for the chemistry of melt-water ponds in the Darwin Glacier area, 80°S	ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES IN ANTARCTIC ICE-FREE LANDSCAPES					International Workshop on Polar Desert Ecosystems	JUL 01-04, 1996	CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND					The total dissolved salts concentrations (TDS) in the stream flowing into Lake Wilson, and in 15 melt water ponds and associated streams of the Darwin Glacier area, ranged from 15 g m(-3) to 5500 g m(-3). Principal components analysis of the standardised major ion and NO3 concentrations identified three components accounting for 89% of the data variance. Component 1 accounting for 61% of the variance, contained positive loadings on Na, Mg, Cl, and NO3, and negative loadings on Ca, K, HCO3 and SO4. This result is consistent with the salts in the pond catchments originating from atmospheric deposition of sea salts, plus NO3 and SO4 and weathering processes in the catchment soils. It is suggested that the loading for SO4, which does not follow from the probable atmospheric origin of this ion, reflects the fact that as the ions move through the catchment soils towards the ponds, the less mobile SO4 salts are retarded together with the CO3 salts from weathering, whereas the other ions of atmospheric origin, Cl and NO3, form mobile salts which move more readily. The relative concentrations of these mobile ions in the pond waters increase with the TDS concentration and a model is proposed to explain both this observation and the wide range of TDS concentrations in ponds within a small area. It is proposed that during particularly warm summers the frozen ground water table lowers sufficiently to allow some ponds to drain into the ponds in the next lower catchments. The draining waters are enriched, relative to the catchment inputs, in the more mobile Cl and NO3 salts, and these ions would accumulate in the non-draining ponds increasing both the TDS concentrations and the ratios of Cl and NO3 relative to CO3 and SO4.																					90-5410-925-4				1997							197	206																WOS:000072809000018
J	Schmitt, AK; Romer, RL; Stimac, JA				Schmitt, AK; Romer, RL; Stimac, JA			Geochemistry of volcanic rocks from the Geysers geothermal area, California Coast Ranges	LITHOS												The Geysers geothermal reservoir in the California Coast Ranges is the world's largest economically used geothermal system. Surface exposure of volcanic rocks and extensive drill penetration of a > 300 km(3) subsurface plutonic body (Geysers Plutonic Complex or GPC) that underlies the reservoir allow unique insights into the evolution of a volcanic-plutonic magma system. We present compositional data for major elements, trace elements, and Nd, Sr and Pb isotopes of late Pliocene to early Pleistocene lavas that are spatially related to the geothermal reservoir and cores from coeval subsurface plutonic rocks. Isotopic ratios of dacitic to rhyolitic lavas from Cobb Mountain, Pine Mountain and Tyler Valley, and core samples from the shallow microgranite phase of the GPC range between 0.70343-0.70596 (Sr-87/Sr-86), 0.512813-0.512626 (Nd-143 /(144) Nd), and 19.084-19.189 (Pb-206/Pb-204). These compositions fall between values for two major isotopic end-members: (1) coeval basalt of Caldwell Pines that has compositional affinities to magmas extracted from a subcontinental mantle-wedge, and (2) regional crustal rocks equivalent to those of the Franciscan and Great Valley sequence. Model calculations suggest that lower crustal intrusion of basalt triggered crustal assimilation in mass proportions of similar to 5 : 1 to produce magmas of intermediate composition. Because rhyolites are isotopically indistinguishable to dacites, we interpret them as partial melts derived from precursor intrusions of granodioritic compositions. Our data suggest that two major mantle and crustal reservoirs continually interacted over the > 1 Ma duration of volcanism and pluton emplacement at the Geysers. Individual magma pulses, however, evolved independently, arguing against the presence of a single long-lived magma body. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	EISENREICH, SJ				EISENREICH, SJ			ATMOSPHERIC INPUT OF TRACE-METALS TO LAKE-MICHIGAN	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Atmospheric bulk deposition was collected on a monthly basis in the Lake Michigan basin from Sept. 1975 through Dec. 1976 to determine the atmospheric loading of trace elements to Lake Michigan. The sampling network consisted of bulk collectors located at 21 locations in the northern and southern basin. Atmospheric loading rates to Lake Michigan were estimated as (in units of 105 kg/yr): Al-50; Fe-28; Mn-6.4; Zn-11; Cu-1.2; Pb-6.4; Cd-0.11; Co- < 0.25; Ca-798; Mg-155; Na-110; K-64. Atmospheric deposition of all elements measured was greater in the southern basin than in the northern basin as a result of intense urban/industrial activity in the former. The percentage of total atmospheric deposition falling in the southern basin was: Fe-74%, Al-71%; Mn-75%; Zn-67%; Cu-62%; Pb-78%; Cd-74%; Co- .apprx. 56% Ca-79%; Mg-62%; Na-65%; K-61%. Atmospheric loading rates reported are in general agreement with estimates made by others from emission inventories and aerosol concentrations. Atmospheric loadings were estimated to represent 10% or more of the total loadings to Lake Michigan from tributary and erosion sources for the trace elements Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb. Atmospheric deposition may account for recent accumulations of Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb and Co in southern Lake Michigan surficial sediments. The atmospheric Pb flux to southern Lake Michigan was estimated as .apprx. 1.7 .mu.g/cm2 per yr for 1975-1976 which compares favorably with the 1972 anthropogenic Pb flux of 1.3 .mu.g/cm2 per yr (total .apprx. .mu.g/cm2 per yr-1) as determined from 210Pb dating. The geographical distribution of trace element loading implicates the southern periphery of Lake Michigan as the principal emission source area.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1980	13	3					287	301		10.1007/BF02145474	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02145474													WOS:A1980KD77900003
J	Esselman, PC; Stevenson, RJ				Esselman, Peter C.; Stevenson, R. Jan			Model-based assessment and mapping of total phosphorus enrichment in rivers with sparse reference data	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water nutrient management efforts are frequently coordinated across thousands of water bodies, leading to a need for spatially extensive information to facilitate decision making. Here we explore potential applications of a machine learning model of river low-flow total phosphorus (TP) concentrations to support landscape nutrient management. The model was trained, validated, and then applied for all rivers of Michigan, USA to identify potential drivers of nu-trient variation, predict alteration in nutrient concentrations from minimally disturbed conditions, and explore reach-specific sensitivity to riparian agricultural change. A boosted regression tree model of low-flow TP concentrations trained on natural and anthropogenic landscape predictors accounted for 53 % of variation in cross-validation data, had good accuracy, little bias, and plausible relationships between predictors and response. Percent riparian agricul-tural cover accounted for the greatest root mean square error reduction in the modeled response (33.2 %), followed by riparian soil permeability (12.9 %), watershed slope (9.6 %), and percent urban cover (9.6 %). An apparent non-linear relationship between TP concentrations and percent riparian agricultural cover suggested steep positive in-creases in stream TP concentrations between 10 and 30 % upstream riparian agricultural cover. Predicted minimally disturbed TP concentrations were spatially variable and ranged from 7.0 to 48.5 mu g/L, with the highest concentrations in watersheds draining low-permeability lake plain soils. Comparison of minimally disturbed predictions to those from the early 2000s suggested that much of northern Michigan existed close to the reference condition, while southern Michigan streams were often substantially enriched. Our predicted values of minimally disturbed condition generally agreed with previous studies but offer greater geographic specificity. Expanded application of machine learning modeling with landscape predictor data have great potential to inform stream nutrient strategy development in set-tings with sparse reference data.

J	WEBB, JA; MOORE, PD				WEBB, JA; MOORE, PD			THE LATE DEVENSIAN VEGETATIONAL HISTORY OF THE WHITLAW MOSSES, SOUTHEAST SCOTLAND	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Late Devensian, Late-glacial deposits are described from the Whitlaw Mosses, near Melrose, Roxburghshire (now Borders). Pollen diagrams and macrofossil lists are given for the bottom sediments of Beanrig Moss and Blackpool Moss, two small fens lying in hollows in the undulating boulder clay of Tweeddale. The succession of taxa through the sediments indicates interstadial conditions followed by stadial conditions. Critical determinations of certain microfossil and macrofossil indicator taxa, permits the identification of certain plant communities. Communities identified from within the stadial are: bare-ground communities of open, wind-exposed areas with Artemisia cf. norvegica and Papaver spp. (sect. Scapiflora) as the main indicator types and bare-ground communities in sheltered areas of long snow-lie with such species as Salix herbacea, Polytrichum norvegicum and P. alpinum. The main communities identified in the interstadial are as follows: scrub with abundant Juniperus and sparse tree birches (e.g., Betula pubescens); base-rich, well-drained short turf with abundant Helianthemum; damp, tall-herb meadows in which Rumex acetosa is important; dwarf-shrub heath with Dryas octopetala and Betula nana and open-ground communities with Artemisia spp. and Hippophae. Communities identified from both the stadial and interstadial are: short-turf calcareous flushes or springs with Selaginella and various mosses and fens and marshy lake margins with Homalothecium nitens. Several taxa have not hitherto been found in the Late Devensian of the British Isles, among which are Artemisia cf. campestris, A. sect. Dracunculus, A. cf. maritima s.l., Gypsophila repens/fastigiata, Hedysarum cf. hedysaroides, Minuartia rubella, Rhacomitrium cf. canescens and Vaccinium vitis-idaea. The identification of the pollen grains and macrofossils is discussed and comments are made on the biogeographical and ecological implications of the records, especially of those species which are now no longer part of the British flora.																			0028-646X	1469-8137					1982	91	2					341	398		10.1111/j.1469-8137.1982.tb03317.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1982.tb03317.x													WOS:A1982NT52800016

The pond has an area of one hectare and a five-hectare contained catchment basin bordered by road embankments. Catchment area is 5 hectares of which falls on 1 ha of water body. When the pond's water level is at an altitude of 264 m a.s.l., the water body is 2.5 m deep and has a capacity of 8.9 thousand cubic metres. The water is supplied by surface runoff and shallow ground waters. The purpose of the cryological studies conducted in the water body examined alongside meteorological observations was to identify the mechanisms of ice cover development in a small water body situated in an undrained depression. The observations were made daily with some more frequent visits, i.e. 2-3 times a day. It involved the mapping of ice processes. The studies conducted revealed the presence of ice cover of varying thickness and structure. Within ice cover, the following types of ice were identified: crystal ice, turbid ice, water and snow ice, two-layer and multilayer ice, aufeis, frazil ice and water. It was found that in some cases, the thickness of ice cover increased from below (the freezing of limnic water) and in some cases from above (the freezing of rainwater or snow and snow ice). For two-layer ice with a layer of water inside, there were cases where the upper layer was freezing from below while the lower layer was melting from above. During the melting of ice cover, ice loss occurred primarily from below.

J	Purvis, M; Robertson, A				Purvis, M; Robertson, A			Miocene sedimentary evolution of the NE-SW-trending Selendi and Gordes basins, W Turkey: Implications for extensional processes	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Western Turkey is one of the classic regions for the study of extensional processes. In a recent interpretation, the regional metamorphic basement, the Menderes Massif, was exhumed related to large-scale extensional processes, possibly during latest Oligocene time. Regional-scale NE-SW-trending basins, including the Gordes and Selendi basins, were created, associated with this exhumation. The NE-SW-trending basins are seen as regional-scale "corrugations" (10-15 km across) in the surface of an extensional detachment orientated parallel to the direction of extension. The detached upper plate is represented by erosional remnants of unmetamorphosed Tethyan ophiolitic melange. We describe and interpret the Gordes and Selendi basins separately and then show that their sedimentary facies and evolution are very similar. Basal coarse alluvial fan deposits accumulated after extensional removal of the upper plate. These basal sediments, rarely exposed, were rotated by up to 50degrees, probably as a result of local extension or transtension. Later during the early Miocene, the Gordes and Selendi basins were infilled by a generally fining-upward succession derived from the south, based on palacocurrent evidence. Coarse alluvial fan deposition was followed by the deposition of finer-grained alluvial deposits from braided streams flowing northwards over a topographically subdued flood plain. Later, deposition was within shallow ephemeral lakes after a possible change to a moister climate. Calc-alkaline magmatism was initiated with the fall-out of fine-grained silicic ash, followed by coarser-grained tuff derived from local magmatic centres. During early Pliocene time, the basins were dissected by E-W extensional faults, associated with the establishment of the modem pattern of westward drainage to the Aegean Sea. We use the assembled sedimentary evidence to test alternative tectonic models for Miocene basin formation in western Turkey. Our preferred tectonic model emphasises the importance of deposition in regional basins created by exhumation of metamorphic basement that was previously assembled during early Tertiary closure of the Tethys ocean.

J	Krishna, S; Ulloa, HN; Barbe, E; Wüest, A				Krishna, Shubham; Ulloa, Hugo N.; Barbe, Emile; Wuest, Alfred			Disentangling the effects of climate change and reoligotrophication on primary production in a large lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Climate change and reduction in nutrient loads have significant effects on primary production and phytoplankton growth dynamics. Since in the last few decades in many regions, nutrients in lakes were reduced simultaneously as the climate changed. Yet, it remains unclear which of the two has impacted primary production the most. In this study, we couple the General Ocean Turbulence Model with the Ecological Regional Ocean Model to disentangle the effects of climate change and reoligotrophication on primary production (PP) in Lake Geneva, Switzerland-France. We apply a data assimilation method to calibrate the model with the observations from the past (1981-1990) and validate it against the in situ data from the present decade (2011-2019). Both decades represent different climate conditions and trophic states of the lake. We show that the model is skilful to reproduce assimilated and unassimilated observations from both periods. According to our results, the effect of reoligotrophication on PP is marginally higher than that of warming, leading to a net decrease in primary production by 10% from the past to the present. The areal phosphorus supply in Lake Geneva, in spite of a decrease by similar to 70%, is still characteristic of a meso-to-eutrophic ecosystem. This points towards an incomplete reoligotrophication of the lake. The effects of future climate change on winter mixing and PP dynamics have also been studied. Although there would be a significant reduction in deep mixing, the autotrophic production in Lake Geneva is expected to increase by similar to 20% by the end of twenty-first century, largely due to stimulation in biomass build-up of temperature-dependent algae (e.g. dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria). Considering our results to represent other large temperate lakes with similar trophic status and water residence time as Lake Geneva, future climate scenarios are expected to bring back symptoms of eutrophication.

The low detection limit (14 pmol) of the method enabled us to study concentration profiles and reaction kinetics under natural conditions. Significant nitrate concentrations (1 to 27 .mu.M) were observed in the sediment of Lake Vechten [The Netherlands] during the nonstratified period; the concentration profiles showed a successive depletion of oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate with depth. The profiles were restricted to the upper 3 cm of the sediment which is rich in organics and loosely structured. Nitrate reduction in the sediment-water interface followed first-order reaction kinetics at in situ concentrations. Remarkably high potential nitrate-reducing activity was observed in the part of the sediment in which nitrate did not diffuse. This activity was also observed throughout the whole year. Estimates of Km varied between 17 and 100 .mu.M and Vmax varied between 7.2 and 36 .mu.mol cm-3 day-1 for samples taken at different depths. The diffusion coefficient of nitrate ([10 .+-. 0.4] .times. 10-6 cm2 s-1) across the sediment-water interface was estimated by a constant-source technique and applied to a mathematical model to estimate the net nitrate reduction during the nonstratified period. In this period, observed nitrate reduction rates by the model, 0.2 to 0.4 mmol m-2 day-1, were lower than those found for oxygen (27 mmol m-2 day-1) and sulfate (0.4 mmol m-2 day-1). During the summer stratified, nitrate was absent in the sediment and reduction could not be estimated by the model.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				FEB	1987	53	2					217	223		10.1128/AEM.53.2.217-223.1987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.53.2.217-223.1987								16347270					WOS:A1987F857600001
J	THRELKELD, ST				THRELKELD, ST			MIDSUMMER DYNAMICS OF 2 DAPHNIA SPECIES IN WINTERGREEN LAKE, MICHIGAN	ECOLOGY												During 1976, midsummer reductions in densities of D. pulicaria and D. galeata mendotae populations occurred in Wintergreen Lake, Michigan [USA]. Previous attempts to determine the causes of such declines have indicated correlations between predator populations, the presence of unpalatable algae or high midsummer water temperatures and the reduction or disappearance of the daphnid populations. In this study, in situ life table experiments were performed to assess the influence of natural food and temperature conditions on population growth. A weekly sampling program showed that D. pulicaria was dielly concentrated, after early summer, at depths between the anaerobic hypolimnion and the warmer epilimnion, consistent with previous information indicating it to be a cold-water species. However, in situ life table data showed that D. pulicaria was capable of surviving in epilimnetic water up to 27.degree. C, although reproduction was greatly reduced for a 6-day period in mid-July. This reduction in reproduction appeared to be the result of an interaction of high temperatures, declining standing crops of small algae and increasing amounts of Anabaena, Ceratium and Volvox. D. galeata mendotae did not show any adverse response to these mid-July algae-temperature conditions. Analysis of predator gut contents suggested that both daphnids were heavily preyed upon by bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus). Shifts in the size structure of the daphnid populations were also consistent with intense size-selective predation by bluegills, as was the tendency for the age distribution of parthenogenic eggs to become skewed to younger eggs as the midsummer deline proceeded. Differences in body size, ephippial production and habitat preferences between the 2 spp. are also consistent with the hypothesis that planktivory is a strong selective force in their evolution.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1979	60	1					165	179		10.2307/1936478	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1936478													WOS:A1979GW05900019

Here, we explore the joint analysis of imagery from different sensors in the light of representation learning: we propose to learn a joint embedding of multiple satellite sensors within a deep neural network. Our application problem is the monitoring of lake ice on Alpine lakes. To reach the temporal resolution requirement of the Swiss Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) office, we combine three image sources: Sentinel-1 SAR (S1-SAR), Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Suomi-NPP visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS). The large gaps between the optical and SAR domains and between the sensor resolutions make this a challenging instance of the sensor fusion problem. Our approach can be classified as a late fusion that is learned in a data-driven manner. The proposed network architecture has separate encoding branches for each image sensor, which feed into a single latent embedding, i.e., a common feature representation shared by all inputs, such that subsequent processing steps deliver comparable output irrespective of which sort of input image was used. By fusing satellite data, we map lake ice at a temporal resolution of <1.5 days. The network produces spatially explicit lake ice maps with pixelwise accuracies >91% [respectively, mean per-class Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores >60%] and generalizes well across different lakes and winters. Moreover, it sets a new state-of-the-art for determining the important ice-on and ice-off dates for the target lakes, in many cases meeting the GCOS requirement.					; Tom, Manu/ABV-9231-2022	Jiang, Yuchang/0000-0001-7293-1304; Tom, Manu/0000-0002-0352-7153													0196-2892	1558-0644					2022	60								4306315	10.1109/TGRS.2022.3211184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2022.3211184													WOS:000871054100003

Dispersed ground ice of permafrost peatlands: Potential unaccounted carbon, nutrient and metal sources	CHEMOSPHERE												The physical and chemical consequences of massive ground ice (wedges) melt upon permafrost thaw is one of the central issues of environmental research linked to climate warming in the Arctic. Little is known about the chemical properties of dispersed ground ice abundant throughout permafrost peatlands that can easily melt with increasing active layer thickness (ALT). This is especially pertinent in continental lowlands, that account for sizeable areas of the Arctic, and contain high amount of organic carbon in both solid (peat) and liquid (porewater) phases. Here we studied 8 peat cores (0-130 cm depth)-comprised of porewater from the active layer (0-45 cm) as well as ice dispersed in frozen peat (40-130 cm)-across a latitudinal profile of Western Siberia Lowland (WSL) extending from discontinuous into continuous permafrost zones. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), alkali and alkaline-earth metals (Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba, Li, Rb, Cs), sulfate, phosphorus, some trace elements (Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Co, V, As, Y, REE, Zr, Hf, U) were sizably [more than 3 times] enriched in peat ice compared to peat porewaters from the active layer. In most sampled cores, there was a local maximum of strong enrichment (up to factors between 14 and 58) in DOC, P, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Sr, As located 30-50 cm below the active layer. This maximum likely occurred due to solute concentration during full freezing of the soil column during winter. There was a sizable correlation between DOC, Al, Fe and other major and trace element concentrations that suggests strong control of organic complexes and organo-mineral (Al, Fe) colloids on element migration throughout the peat profile. The pool of C, major cations and trace metals in peat ice (40-130 cm) was approximately 3-55 times higher than the pool of these elements in porewaters from the active layer (0-40 cm). A 1-m increase of the ALT over the next 100 years is capable of mobilizing 58 +/- 38 Tg of DOC from soil ice into the rivers and lakes of the WSL latitudinal belt (63-67 N). This fast lateral export of C (3.7 +/- 2.7 t C km(-2) y(-1)) may double current C yields in WSL rivers (3.4 +/- 1.3 t C km(-2) y(-1)). A strong increase (150-200%) in riverine export of Zn, P and Cs may also occur while other micronutrients (Fe, Ni, Co, Ba, Mo, Rb) and toxicants (Cd, As, Al) may be affected to a lesser degree (20-30% increase). We propose a global peat ice inventory in permafrost regions is essential for assessing the consequences of permafrost thaw on surface aquatic systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The copepods were incubated in quartz tubes (11) or in quartz tubes wrapped with Mylar D(R) to exclude most of the UVB radiation. The organisms were exposed at 0.5 m depth for 10-72 h on cloudless days. Both lakes were very transparent to UVB and 10% of the surface radiation at the nominal wavelength of 305 nm was still present at 9.6 m in GKS and at 12.8 m in Laguna Negra. These species migrate vertically and have a maximum daytime distribution close to the bottom (C.abyssorum tatricus) or below 15 m depth (B.gracilipes). Both species were red, but the carotenoid concentration was higher in C.abyssorum tatricus than in B.gracilipes (6.5 and 2.3 mu g mg(-1) dry weight, respectively). W-absorbing compounds with a maximum absorption at similar to 334 nm were also detected. Cyclops abyssorum tatricus was highly resistant to UVB radiation and no significant lethal effect was observed. Boeckella gracilipes had a mortality similar to 5 times higher in the treatment receiving full sunlight than in the Mylar treatment (3.2%) only when exposed for 70 h. The resistance of B.gracilipes was higher than that reported in the literature for the same species, suggesting the existence of intraspecific differences in UV sensitivity.					; Sommaruga, Ruben/E-5335-2011	Tartarotti, Barbara/0000-0002-7171-0216; Sommaruga, Ruben/0000-0002-1055-2461													0142-7873					MAR	1999	21	3					549	560		10.1093/plankt/21.3.549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.3.549													WOS:000079208900008

The Baikal subtype of tick-borne encephalitis virus is evident of recombination between Siberian and Far-Eastern subtypes	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES												Author summaryTick-borne encephalitis is a serious and frequently deadly infectious disease. It is caused by a virus of the same name with genome composed of single-stranded RNA. The known genomes of this virus fall into three large regional groups: Europe, Siberia, or the Russian Far East. These groups have originated from a common ancestor several hundred or thousand years ago and were assumed to have evolved independently since then. This study shows that a previously described group of viruses obtained in the vicinity of Lake Baikal in Russia have a mosaic genome: some parts of it are more closely related to those of the Siberian group, while others, to the Far Eastern group. Such a pattern probably arose through recombination-a process during which a cell infected with two distinct viruses produces "hybrid" viral progeny carrying genetic material from both parents. While recombination is frequent in other RNA viruses, it has not been previously described for the tick-borne encephalitis virus. These findings show that mixture of genetic information from distinct sources can contribute to genetic diversity of this group of viruses, and potentially accelerate their adaptation. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a flavivirus which causes an acute or sometimes chronic infection that frequently has severe neurological consequences, and is a major public health threat in Eurasia. TBEV is genetically classified into three distinct subtypes; however, at least one group of isolates, the Baikal subtype, also referred to as "886-84-like", challenges this classification. Baikal TBEV is a persistent group which has been repeatedly isolated from ticks and small mammals in the Buryat Republic, Irkutsk and Trans-Baikal regions of Russia for several decades. One case of meningoencephalitis with a lethal outcome caused by this subtype has been described in Mongolia in 2010. While recombination is frequent in Flaviviridae, its role in the evolution of TBEV has not been established. Here, we isolate and sequence four novel Baikal TBEV samples obtained in Eastern Siberia. Using a set of methods for inference of recombination events, including a newly developed phylogenetic method allowing for formal statistical testing for such events in the past, we find robust support for a difference in phylogenetic histories between genomic regions, indicating recombination at origin of the Baikal TBEV. This finding extends our understanding of the role of recombination in the evolution of this human pathogen.

In order for hazard estimates to reflect future, rather than past, behavior, it is vital to assemble as much reliable age data as possible on past eruptions. Multiple swamp/lake records have been extracted from the Aucldand Volcanic Field, underlying the 1.4 million-population city of Auckland. We examine here the problem of matching these dated deposits to the volcanoes that produced them. The simplest issue is separation in time, which is handled by simulating prior volcano age sequences from direct dates where known, thinned via ordering constraints between the volcanoes. The subproblem of varying deposition thicknesses (which may be zero) at five locations of known distance and azimuth is quantified using a statistical attenuation model for the volcanic ash thickness. These elements are combined with other constraints, from widespread fingerprinted ash layers that separate eruptions and time-censoring of the records, into a likelihood that was optimized via linear programming. A second linear program was used to optimize over the Monte-Carlo simulated set of prior age profiles to determine the best overall match and consequent volcano age assignments. Considering all 20 matches, and the multiple factors of age, direction, and size/distance simultaneously, results in some non-intuitive assignments which would not be produced by single factor analyses. Compared with earlier work, the results provide better age control on a number of smaller centers such as Little Rangitoto, Otuataua, Taylors Hill, Wid Mountain, Green Hill, Otara Hill, Hampton Park and Mt Cambria. Spatio-temporal hazard estimates are updated on the basis of the new ordering, which suggest that the scale of the 'flare-up' around 301 a, while still highly significant, was less than previously thought.

The upper 3 lakes were most affected by acidification and the number of perch caught per unit effort indicate three-fold increase in density from the upper Gjerstadvann to the lower Broborvann. Low density of perch in the upper lakes is explained by; 1) Abnormal mortality occurring in episodes due to acidification, probably caused by aluminium toxicity at pH = 5.2-5.4.2). Acid water (pH less-than-or-equal-to 5.0) during spawning and development of eggs and larvae, resulting in recruitment failure. Juvenile mortality of perch may depend on the density of the parental stock. In the 3 upper lakes, the density of adult perch probably was too low to produce significant juvenile mortality, and in these lakes the recruitment probably depended more on the May water quality. Improved water quality increases egg hatching and survival and also benefits zooplankton production, the main food for perch during the first summer. Low population density has reduced competition for food and thus improved growth of perch in the 3 upper lakes compared to the lower lake. The perch in Broborvann mature at higher age and have lower individual fecundity than perch in Gjerstadvann, an effect of both slower growth and lower length specific fecundity in Broborvann. In Gjerstadvann, the perch therefore have a higher reproductive potential relative to the stock density, and may, when the water quality is good enough, give rise to strong year-classes and more frequent year-class fluctuations than perch in the less acid Broborvann.																			0018-8158					AUG 15	1991	220	3					179	188		10.1007/BF00006574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006574													WOS:A1991GK31000001

Yu			The Records of Environmental Changes in Lacustrine-Swamp Sequences within the Mountain Area of Iturup Island since the Late Glacial Period	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PACIFIC GEOLOGY												We have received unique material on the development of the natural environment for the last 12400 cal. yr. BP in the central part of Iturup Island. High-resolution paleoreconstructions have been based on the multi-proxy study of paleolake sediments found on the plateau (height 400-420 m) located northwest of the Baransky Volcano. For the first time, a record of paleogeographic events has been obtained for the Late Glacial and the Early Holocene. The age model is based on nine radiocarbon dates. Diatom analysis has made it possible to distinguish 11 stages of lake-swamp evolution. The paleolake reached its maximum depth at similar to 9890-7900 cal. yr. BP and became extinct at 1400 cal. yr. BP. The vegetation development stages and the landscape change factors have been restored. The Younger Dryas cooling recorded in Iturup was characterized by humidity changes. The role of forest vegetation rapidly increased at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary of similar to 11470 cal. yr. BP under warmer climatic conditions. Distribution of dwarf pine as an indicator of stable snow cover has been analyzed. Dark-coniferous forests existed in the mountainous part of the island since the Late Glacial and were the most widespread in the Early Holocene. The onset of birch forest expansion at 6200 cal. yr. BP was related to the intensification of volcanic activity and frequent ash falls. A number of identified cold events were enhanced by the weakening of the warm Soya Current. The intensive transfer of allochthonous pollen from the southern Kuril Islands and the Japanese Islands at 3540 cal. yr. BP is a sign of cyclogenesis intensification in the Kuril Islands. The Holocene climatic rhythms in the landscape development of the Iturup mountains, as well as the influence of warm and cold currents and other regional factors, have been analyzed.

Environmental evolution of western Tierra del Fuego (-54°S) since ice-free conditions and its zonal/hemispheric implications	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												By virtue of its position adjacent to the Drake Passage, Tierra del Fuego in South America allows examining the vegetation and environmental history of the southernmost continental landmass outside Antarctica, and the evolution of the Southern Westerly Winds-Southern Ocean (SWW-SO) coupled system since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). For that purpose, we studied sediment cores from Lago Charquito, a small closed-basin lake in central-west Tierra del Fuego with a continuous lacustrine record since-17.3 ka. Ice-free conditions at the site imply a-70 km retreat of the Bahia Inutil glacier lobe from its LGM position during a-800-year interval, a trend that continued until its disappearance-100 km upstream from L. Charquito,-800 years later. Our palynological data show an open landscape dominated by cold-tolerant shrubs and herbs between-17.3-12.9 ka, with increases in precipitation of SWW origin at-16.3 ka,-14.7 ka, between-8.7-7.6 ka, and after-6.8 ka. Warming at-12.9 ka initiated an abrupt afforestation trend that stalled during the early Holocene (-12-8.7 ka) owing to a precipitation decline and wildfires, and later resumed in response to invigorated SWW. We hypothesize that sparse Nothofagus tree populations inhabited the periphery of the Patagonian Ice Sheet (PIS) during the LGM and migrated toward the Andes contemporaneous with glacier recession as temperature rose during the Last Glacial Termination (T1). We posit that besides establishing topographic and climatic barriers for land biota, the PIS enabled the connectivity of cold-tolerant hygrophilous plant populations along a humid fringe adjacent to its land-based perimeter, despite the presumably dry conditions downwind from the eastern PIS margin. Our results suggest that southward shifts or expansion of the SWW toward or beyond Tierra del Fuego enhanced upwelling and ventilation of deep waters in the SO, northward shifts or weakening had the opposite effect. We observe that the time evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, high-latitude air and sea-surface temperatures, and sea level during T1 fall short in explaining the timing and abruptness of the Bahia Inutil glacier lobe collapse, and quite possibly multiple other glacier lobes from the PIS.

Abrupt increases in Pb concentration and delta C-13 values ca. 14 420 cal. YBP indicate significant runoff to the shallow lake that existed at that time. Weathering and transport of local volcanic rocks resulted in the delivery of Pb-bearing minerals to the basin, while a C-13-enriched terrestrial vegetation source increased the delta C-13 values of the sedimentary material. Wet conditions developed over a 300 a period and lasted for a few hundred years. The Younger Dryas period (ca. 12 700-11 500 cal. YBP) caused a reduction in terrestrial productivity reflected in decreasing C/N values, delta N-15 values consistently greater than 0 parts per thousand and low organic content. By contrast, aquatic productivity increased during the second half of this period, evidenced by increasing delta C-13 values at the time of highest abundance of algae. Dry conditions ca. 8000-6 000 cal. YBP were characterised by low organic carbon content and high Pb concentrations, the latter suggesting enhanced erosion and aeolian transport of volcanic rock. The range in delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N values in the sedimentary record fall within the range of modern plants, except during the periods of runoff and drought. The sedimentary record provides evidence of natural climate variability in northern New Mexico, including short- (multi-centennial) and long-(millennial) term episodes during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.

Analysis, Evaluation and Measures to Reduce Environmental Risk within Watershed Areas of the Eastern Zauralye District Lakes	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSTRUCTION, ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOSPHERE SAFETY (ICCATS 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				International Conference on Construction, Architecture and Technosphere Safety (ICCATS)	SEP 21-22, 2017	Chelyabinsk, RUSSIA	S Ural State Univ, Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Far Eastern Fed Univ				The authors have performed an analysis for the use of watershed areas of the lakes of the Eastern Zauralye district (the territory to the east of Ural) for national economic purposes. The analysis gave a possibility to assess the impact of watersheds depending on the applied technologies on the dump of various runoff into the reservoir waters. The watershed areas of all lakes have been found to be actively used as pastures, farmland and recreational resources. Some of the main sources of solid and liquid industrial waste are cattle farms and agricultural land using outdated equipment and technologies. The study of 26 km of the watershed line areas showed that pollutants (household garbage, fuels and lubricants) and organic substances (phosphorus and nitrogen) got into the waters of the reservoirs. The maximum runoff of solid and liquid waste into the waters of the lakes happens in summer which leads to increased concentrations of organic substances, an increase in productivity of alga and higher aquatic flora determining the degree of eutrophication and trophy in the reservoirs. The average annual trophic status of TSI lakes of the Eastern Zauralye district is 56 which corresponds to the typical phase of eutrophy. The reduced transparency of lakes is also the evidence of an increase in biological productivity of reservoirs, their eutrophication and, as a result, the water quality deterioration. The intensive eutrophication of reservoirs, in its turn, most significantly affects the concentration of the ammonium form of nitrogen, total phosphorus and total nitrogen, increase in pH and deterioration of oxygen condition. The authors have developed various activities to reduce a technogenic risk in the watershed areas of the lakes in the Eastern Zauralye district which can be applied to other areas using the analogy method.

The lake was used for fish farming until World War II and was drawn down about every 5 years to harvest fish. Despite its dense historical carp population, it had clear water and a rich Littorelletea vegetation. During the course of the 20th century, the lake became eutrophic and the Littorelletea vegetation degraded. The northern basin, which was still drawn down about every decade after 1957, retained its clear water and had a dense submerged macrophyte vegetation. The southern basin, which was never drawn down after 1957 and which received direct surface water inputs, had become a turbid shallow lake with phytoplankton blooms in summer. In 2000, efforts were taken to restore the lake: the entire lake was drawn down, the fish community was biomanipulated, nutrient-rich surface water inputs were diverted from the southern basin and sediments were removed (only in the northern basin). Fish biomanipulation and sediment removal were successful in the northern basin, as nutrient levels declined and the Littorelletea vegetation recovered. In the southern basin, sediment analyses indicated that drawdown resulted in sediments with a lower water and organic matter content and water column turbidity decreased after the drawdown. But pH in the southern basin declined to < 4, probably because sulphides in the sediment were oxidized during drawdown and sediment desiccation. In contrast, desiccated sediments were removed from the northern basin and pH did not decline below 6 after restoration. In spite of the still high dissolved nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton biomass declined significantly in the southern basin, probably due to acidification. However, no Littorelletea species colonised the lake bottom in the southern basin. Thus, lake drawdown may be a useful management technique to promote clear water conditions in shallow lakes. However, acidification due to sulphide oxidation may be an undesirable outcome and should be considered in drawdown and sediment desiccation manipulations.					; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015; Hoffmann, Maurice/GRK-5532-2022; Van+Wichelen, Jeroen/AAP-6900-2021; Declerck, Steven/E-4338-2010	Van Wichelen, Jeroen/0000-0002-0255-9591; Muylaert, Koenraad/0000-0001-9645-4063; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; Declerck, Steven/0000-0001-6179-667X													0018-8158					JUN	2007	584						291	303		10.1007/s10750-007-0611-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0611-z													WOS:000246583500027
J	Horn, W				Horn, W			Long-term development of the crustacean plankton in the Saidenbach Reservoir (Germany) - changes, causes, consequences	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th International Conference on Reservoir Limnology and Water Quality	AUG, 2002	CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC					The drinking water reservoir Saidenbach (Germany) has been investigated continuously from the year 1975 onwards. Since 1987, daphnids (Daphnia galeata)-an essential component in the cycle of matter and energy in the pelagic zone of reservoirs and lakes-became less and less abundant. Its total and relative biomass declined drastically and the exponential population growth began later in the year. After 1990, also the biomass of the copepods decreased significantly. Thus, the total crustacean biomass declined from 0.35 cm(3) m(-3) (mean 1975-1990) to 0.22 cm(3) m(-3) in the 1990s. Top-down effects seem to be responsible for all these changes, because stocks of both native planktivorous fishes, mainly roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), and non-native silver carps (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) have increased over the years. A second observation confirms this conclusion: the significant temperature effects on the growth rate of Daphnia observed every year in early summer (May) in the first years under investigation were not detectable anymore after the year 1987. Since then, the exponential population development did not start until end of June/beginning of July. This delay and the substantial decrease of the mean body length of the daphnids are clear indications for the enormous predation pressure on this zooplankton group. Simultaneously, the concentration of nanoplankton increased and the Secchi depth decreased indicating the diminishing impact of crustaceans on phytoplankton in the course of the years. Thus, a significant relationship between the concentration of Daphnia and the water transparency could be obtained-a confirmation of their great importance for the water clarity. Consequently, if Daphnia shall provide a positive contribution to water quality (e.g., by effective particle elimination), a well structured fish community with regard to species composition, size structure, standing stock and functional groups will be needed as a prerequisite.																			0018-8158					SEP 1	2003	504	1-3					185	192		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008518.30455.5e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008518.30455.5e													WOS:000188316100019
J	Hannoun, D; Tietjen, T				Hannoun, Deena; Tietjen, Todd			A three-part coupled statistical and physical model to monitor water quality parameters governing disinfection byproduct risk at an urban drinking water intake	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Extended drought in the twenty-first century has led to loss of volume for lakes and reservoirs across the globe. In the Colorado River Basin, USA, Lakes Powell and Mead have experienced a 68 and 71% decline in volume, respectively, since 2000. Lake Mead is important to the Las Vegas Valley as it accounts for 90-100% of the source water used to serve the 2.2 million residents and 43 million annual tourists. Lake Powell is also vital to maintaining water quality in Lake Mead as it is located upstream and provides 97% of the water entering Mead. As Lakes Powell and Mead are projected to continue decreasing in volume over the next 5 years, it is important to understand the effects of loss of lake volume on water quality in this highly-managed system. Here, the effects of lake drawdown on water quality parameters that affect disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation in the source water for the Las Vegas Valley are projected over the next 5 years using Federal flow projections, regression modeling to project influent temperature from Lake Powell into Lake Mead, and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model for Lake Mead. Results from these modeling efforts include projections for changes in values of water temperature, bromide, and total organic carbon (TOC) at the modeled cell that contains the Las Vegas Valley's urban drinking water intake. Raw water bromide was found to have little change across modeled scenarios; however, raw water temperature is projected to increase because of falling lake surface elevations. Raw water TOC is projected to increase three-fold in the simulated scenario that includes the most loss of volume but remains close to historic values in the remaining simulated scenarios. With these raw water quality projections, water managers can better plan for alterations to the water treatment processes, including mitigation of DBP formation.

Suitability of Sentinel-3 chlorophyll a products based on optical water types	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Analysis of the suitability of water colour products for the reliability of subsequent applications, or improvements of the algorithm at later stages, is important. We used three types of water bodies: Type 1 (Southern Ocean and Qinghai Lake) clean oceanic water bodies dominated by chlorophyll and clean inland water bodies dominated by chlorophyll and coloured dissolved organic matter; Type 2 (Taihu Lake and Chagan Lake) turbid inland water bodies dominated by suspended matter and chlorophyll and Type 3 (Xiaoxingkai Lake and Daxingkai Lake) turbid inland water bodies dominated by suspended matter. The accuracies of two Chl a concentration products data for synchronous Sentinel-3 OLCI Neural Network (NN) and ocean colour 4 band ratio (OC4Me) algorithms were verified using two metrics combined with in situ data (to compare the applicability of Chl a concentration algorithms for the three types of water bodies). The optimal Chl-a concentration algorithm was selected to analyse the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of monthly concentrations of Chl a. Based on the analysis, (1) the NN algorithm had better applicability to Type 1 water bodies ; the NN algorithm had better applicability to Type 2 water bodies, ; and both algorithms had poor applicability to Type 3 water bodies, (2) Limitations: An overall low derivation value was obtained for the Sentinel-3 OLCI NN algorithm with water concentrations of Chl a, higher than 25 mg m(-3). The OC4Me Chl a concentration product only applies to the concentrations of Chl a in Type 2 during the summer. (3) When the Sentinel-3 OLCI Chl a concentration product was compared with the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and visible infrared imaging radiometer (VIIRS) Chl a concentration products, the distribution trends of the Chl a concentrations were consistent. Furthermore, the Sentinel-3 OLCI Chl a concentration product was more dominant in spatial resolution.

Dominant bacteria in soils of Marble Point and Wright Valley, Victoria Land, Antarctica	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY					Workshop on Synthesis of Soil Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning in Victoria Land, Antarctica	APR, 2005	Jekyll Isl, GA					A combination of culture-independent and culturing methods was used to assess the diversity of soil bacterial communities from four locations along 77 degrees S in Victoria Land, Antarctica. Soil samples were from the coast at Marble Point, in the Wright Valley from Bull Pass and near Lake Vanda, and from Mt. Fleming near the polar plateau. Total carbon and nitrogen, and water content of the soils were low, whereas total P was very high. The pH of the soils varied from extremely alkaline to slightly acid and electrical conductivity was medium to high on the coast and very high in inland soils from Bull Pass and Mt. Fleming. The average monthly air temperature was similar (-18 degrees C to -24 degrees C) at all the sites; however, in summer surface soil temperatures were > 0 degrees C at Marble Point and in the Wright Valley for a total of I 100 and 1700 h, respectively. Marble Point soil had the most potential to support bacterial growth and activity with a mean total of 310 h per year when surface soils had a liquid volumetric soil moisture content > 5%. Highest counts of culturable heterotrophs occurred in soil from Marble Point, whereas Mt. Fleming soil contained few organisms and had no liquid soil moisture recorded. Seven hundred and twenty-eight clones and 71 bacterial isolates were screened by restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and representatives of those dominant ribotypes that occurred more than 3 times were sequenced. The dominant ribotypes grouped within the bacterial divisions Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Thermus-Deinococcus, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria. The closest relatives of the amplicon library clones or cultured bacteria include the genera Hymenobacter, Gillisia, Arthrobacter, Rubrobacter, Friedmanniella, Deinococcus and Leptolyngbya. Many of the clones and bacteria were most similar to others from Antarctic sources, in particular a cyanobacterium-dominated cryptoendolithic community in Beacon sandstone. Some ribotypes were more prevalent in drier soils of the Wright Valley, including relatives of Deinococcus, Rubrobacter and clone FBP460 from Beacon sandstone. Bacterial communities from Marble Point soils were more diverse than those of the Wright Valley. Very few bacteria were isolated from Mt. Fleming soil. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

According to a study of geological hazards in typical salt lake areas in China and other regions, the authors explain how geological hazards in salt lake areas are caused by natural agents and how humans can seek benefits, avoid hazards and reduce losses on the premise that they have monitored and mastered the trend of salt lake changes in advance and even can store flood and recharge water in lakes and extract saline resources. The climate in western China is probably turning from warm-dry to warm-moist. The authors analyze the change trend of salt lakes sensu lato (with salinitygreater than or equal to0.3 wt% (NaCl)(eq)) and salt lakes sensu stricto (with salinity greater than or equal to3.5 wt% (NaCl)(eq)) in China in such climatic conditions and distinguish three types of salt lake areas (i.e. lake water rising type, lake water falling type and lake water rising and unstable type) according to the characteristics of lake water rising and shrinking. In order to conform to the climatic and lake changes in China's salt lake areas, the authors propose to add and improve hydrological and meteorological observation stations and integrate observations with remote sensing monitoring in important salt lake areas and set up multidisciplinary and interdepartmental basic projects to monitor and study recent climatic and environmental changes in salt lake areas of western China. Moreover, it is necessary to build additional flood-control and drought-preventing water conservancy facilities in key salt lake areas and work out measures for ecological protection in salt lake areas. Full consideration should be given to the influence of flooding when building saltfields and implementing capital projects.																			1000-9515	1755-6724					2004	78	3					795	807																WOS:000223386300026

We identify the sedimentary provenance, the (post)depositional environment and the palaeo-climate based on sedimentological, petrographical, mineralogical, and (isotope) geochemical signatures recorded in authigenic and detrital silicates as well as soil carbonates in a sedimentary succession spanning from similar to 34 to 21 Ma. The depositional setting was characterized by an ephemeral braided river system draining prograding alluvial fans, with episodes of lake, playa or open-steppe sedimentation. Metamorphics from the northern adjacent Neoarchean to late Proterozoic hinterlands provided a continuous influx of silicate detritus to the basin, as indicated by K-Ar ages of detrital muscovite (similar to 798-728 Ma) and discrimination function analysis. The authigenic clay fraction is dominated by illite-smectite and "hairy" illite (K-Ar ages of similar to 34-25 Ma), which formed during coupled petrogenesis and precipitation from hydrothermal fluids originating from major basalt flow events (similar to 32-29 and similar to 29-25 Ma). Changes in hydroclimate are recorded in delta O-18 and delta C-13 profiles of soil carbonates and in silicate mineral weathering patterns, indicating that comparatively humid to semi-arid conditions prevailed in the late(st) Eocene, changing into arid conditions in the Oligocene and back to humid to semi-arid conditions in the early Miocene. Aridification steps are indicated at similar to 34-33, similar to 31, similar to 28 and similar to 23 Ma and coincide with some episodes of high-latitude ice-sheet expansion inferred from marine deep-sea sedimentary records. This suggests that long-term variations in the ocean-atmosphere circulation patterns due to pCO(2) fall, reconfiguration of ocean gateways and ice-sheet expansion in Antarctica could have impacted the hydroclimate and weathering regime in the basin. We conclude that the aridification in Central Asia was triggered by reduced moisture influx by westerly winds driven by Cenozoic climate forcing and the exhumation of the Tian Shan and Altai Mountains and modulated by global climate events.

The East Africa (EA) region has received high amounts of rainfall in the recent past as evidenced by the rising lake levels in the GRV lakes. In Kenya, few studies have quantified soil loss at national scales and erosion rates information on these GRV lakes' regional basins within the ASALs is lacking. This study used the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model to estimate soil erosion rates between 1990 and 2015 in the Great Rift Valley region of Kenya which is approximately 84.5% ASAL. The mean erosion rates for both periods was estimated to be tolerable (6.26 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and 7.14 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1990 and 2015 respectively) resulting in total soil loss of 116 Mt yr(-1) and 132 Mt yr(-1) in 1990 and 2015 respectively. Approximately 83% and 81% of the erosive lands in KGRV fell under the low risk category (<10 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) in 1990 and 2015 respectively while about 10% were classified under the top three conservation priority levels in 2015. Lake Nakuru basin had the highest erosion rate net change (4.19 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) among the GRV lake basins with Lake Bogoria-Baringo recording annual soil loss rates >10 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in both years. The mountainous central parts of the KGRV with Andosol/Nitisols soils and high rainfall experienced a large change of land uses to croplands thus had highest soil loss net change (4.34 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). In both years, forests recorded the lowest annual soil loss rates (<3.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) while most of the ASAL districts presented erosion rates (<8 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). Only 34% of all the protected areas were found to have erosion rates <10 t ha(-1) yr(-1) highlighting the need for effective anti-erosive measures.					; Kenduiywo, Benson/AAX-3961-2020; de Dieu Nambajimana, Jean/AAJ-1204-2021; YU, Lijun/HGB-4869-2022	zhu, jian feng/0000-0001-9717-1372; Nambajimana, Jean de Dieu/0000-0002-0335-7246; Kenduiywo, Benson/0000-0002-8448-0499; 														2071-1050				JAN	2021	13	2							844	10.3390/su13020844	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13020844													WOS:000611781100001
J	ROBARTS, RD				ROBARTS, RD			HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIAL-ACTIVITY AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN A HYPERTROPHIC AFRICAN LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The relationship between heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton in the epilimnion (0-10 m) of hypertrophic Hartbeespoot Dam, South Africa, was examined by statistically analyzing three years of parallel measurements of heterotrophic bacterial activity (glucose uptake) and phytoplankton particulate and dissolved organic carbon production. Algal biomass ranged between 4.0 and 921.1 mg Chl a m-3 at the surface. Primary production varied between 69.5 and 3010.0 mg C m-2h-1 while algal production of dissolved organic carbon (EDOC) ranged from 2.5 to 219.2 mg C m-2h-1. Bacterial numbers reached a summer peak of 44.23 .times. 106 cells ml-1 in the first year and showed no depth variation. The maximum rate of glucose of uptake, Vmax, reached a peak of 5.52 .mu.g C 1-1h-1. Vmax, maximum glucose concentration (Kt + Sn) and glucose turnover time (Tt) were usually highest at the surface and decreased with depth concomitant with algal production. At the surface, Vmax was correlated to EDOC (r=0.59, n=67, p > 0.0001) and primary production (r = 0.71, n = 70, p > 0.0001). At 5 and 10 m, Vmax was correlated to integral euphotic zone (.apprx. 4 m) algal production and bacterial numbers. Glucose turnover time was inversely related to integral algal production (r = -0.72, n = 70, p > 0.001) and less strongly to bacterial numbers. The data indicated that although bacterial numbers and biomass were low relative to algal biomass in this hypertrophic lake, the heterotrophic bacteria attained high rates of metabolic activity as a result of enhanced algal production of available organic carbon.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 16	1988	162	2					97	107		10.1007/BF00014532	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014532													WOS:A1988N276200001

Tracking putative Microcystis viruses and virus-host associations across distinct phases of a Microcystis-dominated bloom	MSYSTEMS												Viruses significantly impact microbial community composition and function. Yet their role in the fate of freshwater cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs), an increasing threat to freshwater systems, remains poorly understood. Here, we address this with a metagenomic analysis of viruses of bloom-forming Microcystis aeruginosa through a seasonal cHAB in the western basin of Lake Erie. We identified globally distributed Microcystis viruses in Lake Erie based on sequence homology to well-studied isolates. A machine-learning model was then used to predict associations between uncharacterized viral populations and the Microcystis and non-Microcystis hosts of the cHAB. Size fractionation of water samples allowed us to identify significant fraction-specific trends in Microcystis viral diversity that corresponded with Microcystis genetic diversity. Viral diversity was highest in the non-colony-associated fraction and lowest in the colony-associated fraction, suggesting that colony formation may lead to bottlenecks in viral diversity in cHABs. Significant turnover of predicted Microcystis virus populations was observed through time, but not between stations miles apart. The virus-host networks revealed extensive interconnectivity and the potential for virus-mediated cross-species genetic exchange. The networks predicted that Lake Erie Microcystis viruses infect hosts spanning phyla, in agreement with lab studies in other systems but challenging previous notions of "narrow" host-virus associations in this genus. Abundant Microcystis virus genes revealed a potential role in key metabolic pathways and host adaptation. These findings advance our understanding of Microcystis viruses and their potential influence on host metabolism, species interactions, and coevolution in Microcystis-dominated cHABs.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding associations between viruses, their hosts, and environmental factors is key for identifying the mechanisms behind the rise and fall of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. This study explores the diversity and host ranges of viruses predicted to infect Microcystis, reporting how these properties vary over time, across sample stations in western Lake Erie, and among different filter size fractions. We found that Microcystis virus diversity is highest in non-colony-associated fractions and the lowest in colony-associated fractions, suggesting a link between Microcystis colony formation and reduced viral diversity. We identify abundant genes belonging to predicted Microcystis viruses and their potential roles in key metabolic pathways and adaptation to environmental changes. These findings enhance our understanding of the interplay among viruses, Microcystis, and co-occurring bacteria in cHABs, offering insights into the mechanisms driving bloom dynamics, species interactions, and coevolutionary processes.

Response of the Lake Ecosystem of the Lesser Kuril Ridge to Paleoclimatic and Seismic Events	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												In this paper we restore moisture changes since the Younger Dryas based on the study of diatom flora in sediments of the Zelenyi coastal paleolake, the Lesser Kuril Ridge. The section includes numerous interlayers of tephra, the sources of which were located on the islands of Kunashir and Hokkaido, and interlayers of tsunamigenic sands, which made it possible to determine the impact of catastrophic events on changes in the ecological situation. The stages of the development of the lake are identified and its evolution is analyzed during short-period climatic rhythms. The reservoir had its maximal depth at the beginning of the Holocene, and planktonic forms predominated among diatoms. Three phases when the lake turned into a lagoon were established, and the erosion of the barrier form most likely caused this during large tsunamis associated with earthquakes. Except for these cases, the main factor leading to the change in lacustrine-marsh environments was climate change. We identified relatively dry periods and wet periods associated with an increase in the intensity of cyclogenesis in the South Kurils region. We correlated with high-resolution paleoclimatic records from archives for the Southern Kuriles; the most striking events were compared with data for Sakhalin and the continent. Changes in moisture on the islands and the margin of the mainland in the Middle-Late Holocene were established to be in antiphase in most cases, except for the cooling of 2800-2500 BP and the Little Ice Age. The connection of regional climatic changes with anomalies in the ocean and atmosphere of the Asia-Pacific region is shown.

Microscopically, blooms of one cyanobacterium (Synechococcus sp.-like), one green sulfur bacterium (Chlorobium phaeobacteroides-like), and one purple sulfur bacterium (Thiocystis minor-like) were observed at different depths and times. DGGE retrieved these populations and, additionally, populations related to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum as predominant community members. The analyses of partial 16S ribosomal DNA sequences from the DGGE fingerprints (550 bp analyzed) revealed higher genetic diversity than expected from microscopic observation for most of these groups. Thus, the sequences of two Synechococcus spp. (both had a similarity of 97% to Synechococcus sp. strain PCC6307 in 16S rRNA), two Thiocystis spp. (similarities to Thiocystis minor of 93 and 94%, respectively), and three Cytophaga spp. (similarities to Cytophaga fermentans of 88 and 89% and to Cytophaga sp. of 93%, respectively) were obtained. The two populations of Synechococcus exhibited different pigment compositions and temporal distributions and their 16S rRNA sequences were 97.3% similar. The two Thiocystis populations differed neither in pigment composition nor in morphology, but their 16S rRNA sequences were only 92.3% similar and they also showed different distributions over time. Finally, two of the Cytophaga spp. showed 96.2% similarity between the 16S rRNA, sequences, but one of them was found to be mostly attached to particles and only in winter. Thus, the identity of the main populations changed over time, but the function of the microbial guilds was maintained. Our data showed that temporal shifts in the identity of the predominant population is a new explanation for the environmental 16S rRNA microdiversity retrieved from microbial assemblages and support the hypothesis that clusters of closely related 16S rRNA environmental sequences may actually represent numerous closely related, yet ecologically distinct, populations.

J	Lyons, J				Lyons, J			Patterns in the species composition of fish assemblages among Wisconsin streams	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												To better understand patterns of fish assemblage composition in Wisconsin streams in relation to major environmental gradients, I carried out multivariate direct gradient analysis (canonical correspondence analysis) of two large independent datasets on fish species abundance in Wisconsin streams. Analysis of the two datasets yielded similar results, suggesting that observed patterns and relationships were real. Stream sites were distributed along fish species-environment gradients, but segregation into distinct stream temperature and geographic groups was also evident. The strongest gradient in both datasets was related to summer water temperature patterns, and encompassed a transition from small, coldwater streams dominated by salmonids, cottids, certain cyprinids, and few other species, to both small and large, warmwater streams dominated by a high diversity of different cyprinids, catostomids, ictalurids, centrarchids, and percids. A second gradient in both datasets was complex but largely geographic. Within it,sites from each of the four ecoregions that occupy Wisconsin formed fairly discrete groups. The strongest differences were between sites in the two southern Wisconsin ecoregions, the Driftless Area and the Southeastern Wisconsin Till Plains, that were dominated by certain cyprinids, ictalurids, and centrarchids, and sites in the two northern Wisconsin ecoregions, the North Central Hardwood Forests and the Northern Lakes and Forests, that were dominated by a different set of cyprinids and ictalurids, plus some petromyzontids, salmonids, catostomids, and percids. Sites from the Driftless Area that were mostly higher-gradient (steep stream slope) and had many riffle-dwelling species could also be distinguished from sites in the Southeastern Wisconsin Till Plains that were mostly lower-gradient and had many pool-dwelling species. The patterns of fish assemblage composition among sites and the associated fish species-environment relationships that were revealed by the analyses provided a framework for developing an ecologically meaningful hierarchical classification of Wisconsin stream sites based on stream thermal regime, ecoregion, stream size, and stream gradient.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	1996	45	4					329	341		10.1007/BF00002524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002524													WOS:A1996UA94200001
J	Butler, H; Atkinson, A; Gordon, M				Butler, H; Atkinson, A; Gordon, M			Omnivory and predation impact of the calanoid copepod Boeckella poppei in a maritime Antarctic lake	POLAR BIOLOGY												The copepod Boeckella poppei is a major species in high latitude lakes of the Southern Hemisphere. In such lakes the reduced diversity of metazoans contrasts with a rich microbial assemblage, making these systems amenable to the study of predation controls on the microbial food web. However, the diet of B. poppei is subject to conflicting reports, with little information on feeding rates. We incubated this species in water from Sombre Lake, a much-studied maritime Antarctic Lake on the South Orkney Islands, in order to quantify its feeding rates and potential impact on the microbial assemblage. Overall, clearance rates were similar across 4 experiments spanning November 1999-March 2000, but increased with prey size over the range of 2.7-18 mu m equivalent spherical diameter (esd). B. poppei fed omnivorously, although small phototrophic flagellates comprised the bulk of the diet because of their overwhelming dominance in the incubation water. Larger motile preys-heterotrophic ciliates of similar to 18 mu m esd-were cleared fastest (mean 555 ml mg(-1) dry mass day(-1)) and at equivalent rates to those found for freshwater and marine copepods of similar size and at similar temperatures. Estimated predation impact on the microbial food web varied with the abundance of copepods; these were similar to 30-fold greater in March than in December. In March even the relatively abundant B. poppei (1.7 adults l(-1)) had a negligible impact on nanoflagellates, due to the low clearance rate on these small cells. However, in March, B. poppei adults were estimated to clear 24% of the lake water of ciliates daily. Given the generation time of ciliates (1.6 days measured in a previous summer study), and the fact that other larval stages of B. poppei were not assessed, this species has the potential to control this part of the microbial assemblage in Sombre Lake.

J	Yu, YX; Gong, CL; Li, DW; Liu, PY; Li, YC				Yu, Yixin; Gong, Chenglin; Li, Dongwei; Liu, Puyu; Li, Yichao			The pivotal but underappreciated role of time scales on clinothem-based prediction of sediment dispersal to deepwater: Insights derived from greenhouse clinothem pairs in the Bohai Bay Basin	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												Twenty-five 10(6) yr-scale and fifteen 10(5) yr-scale greenhouse aggradational to progradational clinothem pairs with rising-then-flat rollover trajectories were recognized in the Oligocene Qikou and Eocene Dongying sags in the Bohai Bay Basin. A comparison of them highlights the pivotal but underappreciated role of time scales on shelf-edge- or clinothem-based prediction of sediment dispersal to deepwater (i.e., different time scales involve different drivers of sediment dispersal to deepwater), drawing the attention of the pitfall of mechanically applying sequence stratigraphy to lacustrine basins. Over time scale of 10(6) yr, flat topset-to-foreset rollover trajectories and aggradational-progradational-degradational (APD) clinothem sets are all the predictors of the delivery of coarse-grained terrestrial sediments into deep-lake floors of the Eocene Qikou sag, as evidenced by the occurrence of aggradational bottomsets in front of them. Over time scale of 10(5) yr, rising topset-to-foreset rollover trajectories and aggradational-progradational (PA) clinothem sets are, in contrast, the proxy for sediment dispersal to lake-floor areas of the Eocene Dongying sag, as evidenced by the occurrence of aggradational clinoforms in front of them. On a longer time scale of 10(6) yr or more, tectonics and climates are greatly varied. Sediment dispersal to deepwater is then facilitated by the base-level falls, and is predicted by flat shelf-edge or rollover trajectories and PA clinothem sets. On a shorter time scale of 10(5) yr or less, only climates are highly variable. Sediment dispersal to deepwater is then facilitated by the lake-level rises (i.e., more humid climates), and is predicted by rising shelf-edge or rollover trajectories and APD clinothem sets.

Glacial Lake Musselshell: Late Wisconsin slackwater on the Laurentide ice margin in central Montana, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Cosmogenic surface exposure ages of glacial boulders deposited in ice-marginal Lake Musselshell suggest that the lake existed between 20 and 11.5 ka during the Late Wisconsin glacial stage (MIS 2), rather than during the Late Illinoian stage (MIS 6) as traditionally thought. The altitude of the highest ice-rafted boulders and the lowest passes on the modem divide indicate that glacial lake water in the Musselshell River basin reached at least 920-930 m above sea level and generally remained below 940 in. Exposures of rhythmically bedded silt and fine sand indicate that Lake Musselshell is best described as a slackwater system, in which the ice-dammed Missouri and Musselshell Rivers rose and fell progressively throughout the existence of the lake rather than establishing a lake surface with a stable elevation. The absence of varves, deltas and shorelines also implies an unstable lake. The changing volume of the lake implies that the Laurentide ice sheet was not stable at its southernmost position in central Montana. A continuous sequence of alternating slackwater lake sediment and lacustrine sheetflood deposits indicates that at least three advances of the Laurentide ice sheet occurred in central Montana between 20 and 11.5 ka. Between each advance, it appears that Lake Musselshell drained to the north and formed two outlet channels that are now occupied by extremely underfit streams. A third outlet formed when the water in Lake Musselshell fully breached the Larb Hills, resulting in the final drainage of the lake. The channel through the Larb Hills is now occupied by the Missouri River, implying that the present Missouri River channel east of the Musselshell River confluence was not created until the Late Wisconsin, possibly as late as 11.5 ka.

The system benefits from a water quality monitoring program for which consistent data have been collected since about 1986. We used a set of mathematical tools called 'topological data analyses' to help identify common water quality conditions or 'states' of this important river system. We also explored when and why the states have changed over the past 27 years. The tools identified five common water quality states, distinguished by nutrients and clear waters or muddy and turbid waters. State changes were commonly detected as seasonal transitions in the higher latitude reaches. The state changes also showed that water quality had improved or declined gradually over many years, depending on the river reach. River reaches named Pool 4 and Pool 8 had become clearer over time. Pool 13 became muddier over time with several undesirable state changes to a turbid-state. Three other river reaches were consistently muddy. Our study is a good example of how these topological data analysis tools may help others managing ecosystems by improving communications about what states exist and which are desirable. Coupling these tools with long-term data can also alert ecosystem managers to the ongoing, complex changes and vulnerability to help prioritize ecosystem rehabilitation. Aquatic systems worldwide can exist in multiple ecosystem states (i.e., a recurring collection of biological and chemical attributes), and effectively characterizing multidimensionality will aid protection of desirable states and guide rehabilitation. The Upper Mississippi River System is composed of a large floodplain river system spanning 2200 km and multiple federal, state, tribal and local governmental units. Multiple ecosystem states may occur within the system, and characterization of the variables that define these ecosystem states could guide river rehabilitation. We coupled a long-term (30-year) highly dimensional water quality monitoring dataset with multiple topological data analysis (TDA) techniques to classify ecosystem states, identify state variables, and detect state transitions over 30 years in the river to guide conservation. Across the entire system, TDA identified five ecosystem states. State 1 was characterized by exceptionally clear, clean, and cold-water conditions typical of winter (i.e., a clear-water state); State 2 had the greatest range of environmental conditions and contained most the data (i.e., a status-quo state); and States 3, 4, and 5 had extremely high concentrations of suspended solids (i.e., turbid states, with State 5 as the most turbid). The TDA mapped clear patterns of the ecosystem states across several riverine navigation reaches and seasons that furthered ecological understanding. State variables were identified as suspended solids, chlorophyll a, and total phosphorus, which are also state variables of shallow lakes worldwide. The TDA change detection function showed short-term state transitions based on seasonality and episodic events, and provided evidence of gradual, long-term changes due to water quality improvements over three decades. These results can inform decision making and guide actions for regulatory and restoration agencies by assessing the status and trends of this important river and provide quantitative targets for state variables. The TDA change detection function may serve as a new tool for predicting the vulnerability to undesirable state transitions in this system and other ecosystems with sufficient data. Coupling ecosystem state concepts and TDA tools can be transferred to any ecosystem with large data to help classify states and understand their vulnerability to state transitions.

Regional data assimilation of multi-spectral MOPITT observations of CO over North America	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Chemical transport models (CTMs) driven with high-resolution meteorological fields can better resolve small-scale processes, such as frontal lifting or deep convection, and thus improve the simulation and emission estimates of tropospheric trace gases. In this work, we explore the use of the GEOS-Chem four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system with the nested high-resolution version of the model (0.5A degrees x 0.67A degrees) to quantify North American CO emissions during the period of June 2004-May 2005. With optimized lateral boundary conditions, regional inversion analyses can reduce the sensitivity of the CO source estimates to errors in long-range transport and in the distributions of the hydroxyl radical (OH), the main sink for CO. To further limit the potential impact of discrepancies in chemical aging of air in the free troposphere, associated with errors in OH, we use surface-level multispectral MOPITT (Measurement of Pollution in The Troposphere) CO retrievals, which have greater sensitivity to CO near the surface and reduced sensitivity in the free troposphere, compared to previous versions of the retrievals. We estimate that the annual total anthropogenic CO emission from the contiguous US 48 states was 97 Tg CO, a 14 % increase from the 85 Tg CO in the a priori. This increase is mainly due to enhanced emissions around the Great Lakes region and along the west coast, relative to the a priori. Sensitivity analyses using different OH fields and lateral boundary conditions suggest a possible error, associated with local North American OH distribution, in these emission estimates of 20 % during summer 2004, when the CO lifetime is short. This 20 % OH-related error is 50 % smaller than the OH-related error previously estimated for North American CO emissions using a global inversion analysis. We believe that reducing this OH-related error further will require integrating additional observations to provide a strong constraint on the CO distribution across the domain. Despite these limitations, our results show the potential advantages of combining high-resolution regional inversion analyses with global analyses to better quantify regional CO source estimates.

Organic N and particulate organic matter fractions in organic and conventional farming systems with a history of manure application	PLANT AND SOIL												Indicators of soil fertility are needed for the effective management of organic farming systems. Sustainable management hinges upon our gaining an improved understanding of C and N dynamics. The influence of cropping systems and amendments applied in the Lakeland Wisconsin Integrated Cropping Systems Trial on total hydrolyzable organic N (THN) fractions and particulate organic matter (POM) was investigated after a decade in a conventional cash grain system (Conv) of continuous maize amended with inorganic fertilizer, an organic cash-grain system (Org-CG) that relied on legume N, and an organic animal-based system (Org-AN) that included alfalfa and manure additions. Maize yields had consistently ranked Org-CG < Conv < Org-AN. The THN and amino acid-N (AA-N) contents were ranked Org-AN > Org-CG > Conv. Amino sugar-N (AS-N) contents, which reflect microbially derived N, did not differ among systems and concentrations were quite high (346.5 mg AS-N/kg soil in the 0-50 cm depth). This, and soil variability were attributed to the sites' history of manure application. The amount (1.3 g POM-C/kg soil) and proportion (approximate to 7.5% of total SOC) of POM-C were quite low and did not differ among systems. Failure to accumulate SOC or POM in these soils, even under organic management, is attributed to rapid C decay and/or limited root growth. An N rate study was added the fall before samples were taken and N addition did increase yield in the Conv and Org-CG systems despite evidence of soil N surplus. This suggests that either amino N is unavailable to plants or that root N acquisition is limited by other constraints. Low POM-C contents accompanied by high AS-N and AA-N levels reveal an imbalance in these soils which are likely to be C limited. Based on this, we conclude excess N has prevented use of organic practices from enhancing soil quality at this site.

We evaluated the performance of juvenile lake sturgeon fed different proportions of two natural food types-adult brine shrimp Artemia spp. and larval bloodworms Chironomus spp.-over a 10-week laboratory experiment. The following five diet treatments were provided: (1) 100% bloodworms; (2) 75% bloodworms: 25% brine shrimp; (3) 50% bloodworms: 50% brine shrimp; (4) 25% bloodworms: 75% brine shrimp; and (5) 100% brine shrimp. Lake sturgeon growth was positively related to bloodworm content in the diet and was significantly different among treatments. Although the initial sizes of fish were similar, mean fork length and wet weight were greatest for the 100% bloodworm treatment (183.1 mm and 37.5 g, respectively) and lowest for the 100% brine shrimp diet (118.4 mm and 9.5 g) by the end of the study. Mean specific and absolute growth rates in length (0.93% and 1.28 mm/d, respectively) and weight (2.61% and 0.45 g/d) were greatest for the 100% bloodworm diet, followed by the other treatments in order of decreasing amount of bloodworms in the diet. Percent weight gain (525%) and food conversion efficiency (67%) were also greatest for the 100% bloodworm diet, followed by the other treatments in order of decreasing dietary bloodworm content. Whole-body protein (13.9%), lipid (2.5%), and gross-energy (3.77 kJ/g) content were greatest for fish fed 100% bloodworms, with these proximate-composition measures also ranked in order of decreasing dietary bloodworm content for the other treatments. We recommend that juvenile lake sturgeon reared in hatchery environments be fed high proportions of bloodworms to maximize growth, body size, and lipid content for rehabilitation stocking programs.

An insect net was used instead of traps and an LD40 wide mouth liquid nitrogen container was used for asphyxiating, freezing and storing the specimens in the field. Biting flies were collected at intervals during the summer from June, 1970-Aug., 1972 at 5 localities: Northway, Dot Lake, Fairbanks, New Minto and Tanana. Snowshoe hare (SSH) virus of the California complex was recovered from Aedes cinereus Meigen, A. communis (DeGeer), A. excrucians (Walker), A. fitchii (Felt and Young), A. hexodontus complex, A. intrudens Dyar, A. punctor complex and from a black fly, Simulium n. sp? There were 48 recoveries, some from all localities. This is the only virus of the California complex known to occur in Alaska. Therefore California encephalitis [CE] disease caused by CE virus, the type virus of the complex, is now believed not to occur in Alaska. Northway virus, of the Bunyamwera group, was discovered from A. excrucians, A. hexodontus complex, A. punctor complex and Culiseta alaskaensis (Ludlow). There were 5 recoveries from 3 localities: Northway, Dot Lake and New Minto. One recovery was from pool 0234 containing the Northway type virus. The viruses were recovered by the Virology Unit at the Arctic Health Research Center and identified by the Arbovirus Section at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia.

At 18.degree.-20.degree. C the 1st molt occurred 10 days and the 2nd, 18 days postinfection. Worms developed in the proventriculus of experimentally infected gulls, the 3rd molt occurred 2.5 days and the 4th, 5 days postinfection. In 8 days immature adults were found under the gizzard lining near the proventriculus. Females found 16 days postinfection had larvated eggs. Developmental stages in amphipods and gulls were described. Prevalance and intensity of P. adunca were studied in adult and juvenile gulls at the Eastern Headland (Leslie Spit) of the Outer Toronto Harbor, Lake Ontario [Canada]. The low mean intensity (1.6) in adult birds examined on April 2 suggests that there was little or no transmission of the parasite on the wintering grounds of the gulls. Intensity and prevalance increased in adult birds on the breeding grounds from April 2-June 25 and larval stages were found in the birds. Prevalance in young-of-the-year birds increased with age of the birds. Intensity reached a high of 3.2 (1-6) in 35- to 42-day-old-birds (July 3). Infective larvae became encapsulated on the mesentery of experimentally infected goldfish (Carassius auratus). Infective larave of P. adunca were found in the mesentery of fish (Culaea inconstans, Notropis hudsonius, Semotilus atromaculatus) collected in waters adjacent to the breeding grounds. Paracuaria adunca was transmitted experimentally to geese (Anser anser) and ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) but few worms were recovered from the few birds that became infected.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1982	60	12					3092	3104		10.1139/z82-393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z82-393													WOS:A1982QD95700013
J	He, JL; Zha, Y; Zhang, JH; Gao, J; Wang, Q				He, Junliang; Zha, Yong; Zhang, Jiahua; Gao, Jay; Wang, Qiang			Synergetic retrieval of terrestrial AOD from MODIS images of twin satellites Terra and Aqua	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is one of the most important indicators of atmospheric pollution. It can be retrieved from satellite imagery using several established methods, such as the dark dense vegetation method and the deep blue algorithm. All of these methods require estimation of surface reflectance prior to retrieval, and are applicable to a certain pre-designated type of surface cover. Such limitations can be overcome by using a synergetic method of retrieval proposed in this study. This innovative method is based on the fact that the ratio K of surface reflectance at different angles/geometries is independent of wavelength as reported by Flowerdew and Haigh (1995). An atmospheric radiative transfer model was then established and resolved with the assistance of the ratio K obtained from two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) spectral bands acquired from the twin satellites of Terra and Aqua whose overpass is separated by three hours. This synergetic method of retrieval was tested with 20 pairs of MODIS images. The retrieved AOD was validated against the ground observed AOD at the Taihu station of the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). It is found that they are correlated with the observations at a coefficient of 0.828 at 0.47 mu m and 0.921 at 0.66 mu m wavelengths. The retrieved AOD has a mean relative error of 25.47% at 0.47 mu m and 24.3% at 0.66 mu m. Of the 20 samples, 15 and 17 fall within two standard error of the line based observed AOD data on the ground at the 0.47 mu m and 0.66 mu m, respectively. These results indicate that this synergetic method can be used to reliably retrieve AOD from the twin satellites MODIS images, namely Terra and Aqua. It is not necessary to determine surface reflectance first. (C) 2014 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They have privileged the typicality to create a fidelity with the consumers in the small ruminant production system, because of the long tradition and its less industrialisation, Of course the mean of this term varies according with people culture and tradition and with production (cheese, meat, fibre). In cheese field the differences between geographic areas, culturally homogeneous, are evident. In United Europe the historical and traditional motivations prevail and these products are protected by low. Some cheeses give their typicality to a breed, some other to the cellar, to a technique or to a feeding system. In USA, safety is the most important condition for the consumer. In Latin American countries people are giving more and more importance to the typicality even if there is a lake of regulations. In meat sector the situation is the same. The meaning of quality and typicality changes according to the local customs. In the more developed areas carcass quality is evaluated by grids that determine the price of the product. The quality indicated on many labels is made according to some grid evaluation, Quite different is the situation of the fibre sector. In the last years, the textile industry is discovering certain interest towards the typicality as regards the home-made, the ecological production and the naturally coloured wool, Consumers appear to be attracted by the typicality message if this term has some contents. Research is trying to study some factors influencing the typicality and in this report we referred about theirs. The future of a lot of small ruminant production depends from the capacity of research organisations to explore and to find the scientific reasons of typicality.

J	Brooks, GR				Brooks, GR			Overbank deposition along the concave side of the Red River meanders, Manitoba, and its geomorphic significance	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Slow earth sliding is pervasive along the concave side of Red River meanders that impinge on Lake Agassiz glaciolacustrine deposits. These failures form elongated, low-angled (c. 6 to 10 degrees) landslide zones along the valleysides. Silty overbank deposits that accumulated during the 1999 spring freshet extend continuously along the landslide zones over hundreds of metres and aggraded the lower slopes over a distance 50 to 80 m from the channel margin. The aggradation is not obviously related to meander curvature or location within a meander. Along seven slope profiles surveyed in 1999 near Letellier, Manitoba, the deposits locally are up to 21 cm thick and generally thin with increasing distance from, and height above, the river. Local deposit thickness relates to distance from the channel, duration of inundation of the landslide surface, mesotopography, and variations in vegetation cover. Immediately adjacent to the river, accumulated overbank deposits are up to 4 m thick. The 1999 overbank deposits also were present along the moderately sloped (c. 23 to 27 degrees) concave banks eroding into the floodplain, but the deposits are thinner (locally up to c. 7 cm thick) and cover a narrower area (10 to 30 m wide) than the deposits within the landslide zones. Concave overbank deposition is part of a sediment reworking process that consists of overbank aggradation on the landslide zones, subsequent gradual downslope displacement from earth sliding, and eventually reworking by the river at the toe of the landslide. The presence of the deposits dampens the outward migration of the meanders and contributes to a low rate of contemporary lateral channel migration. Concave overbank sedimentation occurs along most Red River meanders between at least Emerson and St. Adolphe, Manitoba. (c) Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada.

The here-obtained results showed that feeding inhibition tests has a sensible cost-effective methodology to assess the effects of abiotic stresses in freshwater ecosystems. Environmental disturbance on freshwater ecosystems significantly impacts all levels of the trophic web. Salinity in lentic freshwater ecosystems, as a consequence of climatic changes, is rising concern in the scientific community. These alterations affect water quality, the composition and diversity of the aquatic communities. This study aimed to assess the seston quality of two lentic ecosystems, Crestuma reservoir and lake Vela, and evaluate the effects of salinity on food performance of Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina (isolated from the referred ecosystems). Feeding inhibition tests were used to conduct these two evaluations. Physical and chemical water classification revealed a poor or good ecological potential of the two lentic ecosystems, according to WFD approach. To evaluate seston quality, filtered and unfiltered water samples from the lentic ecosystems were used as treatments. Although only summer samples from Crestuma presented good water quality, the results from the feeding inhibition tests showed that seston from lake Vela presented more nutritional quality. Concerning the assay to evaluate the salinity effect on Daphnia spp., a significant reduction in the filtration rate was observed. The NOEC value was 0.7 g/L NaCl and 0.8 g/L NaCl for D. magna and D. longispina C and V, respectively. The LOEC value was also distinct between species, being 1.0 g/L and 0.9 g/L, respectively. This work allowed to verify that feeding inhibition tests are not sensitive enough for assess the quality of natural waters. However, these tests are economically viable and have high sensitivity to evaluate NaCl effects on Daphnia spp.					Queirós, Vanessa/HRA-2553-2023; Azeiteiro, Ulisses/C-5933-2008; Antunes, Sara/C-7150-2008	Azeiteiro, Ulisses/0000-0002-5252-1700; Queiros, Vanessa/0000-0001-6426-0512; Antunes, Sara/0000-0002-6686-9919													0003-4088	2100-000X				NOV 25	2019	55								23	10.1051/limn/2019020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2019020													WOS:000501180000001

Organogenic sediments (LOI >60% dm, TP >1.2 mg P/g dm, TN >2% dm) declined non-linear towards open water. Additionally, irregular periods of anaerobiosis and increased Sigma S2- concentrations (1.316 mu g S2-/l) were measured. Wave breakers, which were built in front of mechanically damaged reed significantly promote littoral accumulation and protect deposition zones from erosion. However, embankment with fagots produces a fine-grained organogenic mud towards open water. These sediments revealed significantly increased O-2 consumption rates (610 mg O-2/m(2).d) and steeper gradients of NO3-, SO42- and CH4 indicating intensified anaerobic reduction processes when compared with unsheltered sites. The nutrient gradients differed from those of 'natural' accumulation zones and caused diminished O-2 saturation (by 30%) specially in summer months. Sigma S2- concentration was positively correlated to TC content of sediments and temperature and negatively to distance from shore. The annual mean concentration ranged among 10 and 51 mu g S2-/l and was not affected by wave breakers.																			0020-9309						1997	82	3					329	339		10.1002/iroh.19970820305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19970820305													WOS:A1997YC64000003

Relationships Between Chlorophyll, Salinity, Phosphorus, and Nitrogen in Lakes and Marine Areas	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This work presents empirical data from several databases Empirical data ultimately form the basis for most ecological/environmental studies, and this work uses what may be the most comprehensive data set ever compiled concerning relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations, nitrogen, phosphorus, and salinity, since the data in this study concerns about 500 lakes and coastal areas The focus has been on how variations between systems in median summer values of chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl) depend on variations in total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and salinity The salinities range from 0 to 275 PSS78 in hypersaline systems, the median salinity is 12 5 The range in nutrients is from ultraoligotrophic (totalP, or TP, is less than 1 mu g/L) to hypertrophic systems (TP is greater than 1000 mu g/L) The chlorophyll values vary from 0 12 to 60 mu g/L Results showed that there is a minimum in the Chl/TP ratio in the salinity range between 2 and 5, followed by an increase up to a salinity range of 10-15, and then a continuous reduction in the Chl/TP ratio until a minimum value of about 0 012 is reached in hypersaline systems We have also identified a threshold value for the salinity In systems dominated by freshwater influences, the ratio of Chl to total nitrogen, or TN, increases steadily from about 0 008 in lakes to 0 02 when the salinity is 10 At higher salinities than 10, the Chl/TN ratio decreases in a nonlinear fashion We have also presented several empirical models to predict chlorophyll concentrations from levels of TP, TN, and salinity The model predicting Chl from TP and salinity is generally the best one The next best model according to the criteria (r(2) value, median error, and standard deviation for the error) is the model using TN and salinity Models not including salinity predict chlorophyll less well																			0749-0208	1551-5036				MAY	2010	26	3					412	423		10.2112/08-1121.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/08-1121.1													WOS:000277947000003

This dataset is highly unusual in North America for its longevity of record. consistency of methodology and location, diversity of species available, and availability of local daily meteorological data. For each phenology series, we examined the flowering and first sighting Julian calendar dates for the existence of temporal trends. Only one of the five animal species (katydid) showed any evidence for a significant trend in first sighting. In contrast, the plant species showed a rich mixture of temporal trends in flowering that could be divided into four classes: woody plant-no trend, woody plant-negative trend, herbaceous plant-ne-ative trend, and herbaceous plant-positive trend. Many of the trends were found to be statistically significant and robust to the method of trend estimation. The data within each of the four plant classes were also pooled as anomalies to provide more complete temporal coverage for tests of trend robustness. The results were strongly consistent with the trends of the individual species Within each class and highly significant statistically. We next correlated the flowering and first sighting dates against growing degree-day (GDD) surninations for each day of the year to measure the sensitivity of each species to this common form of climatic forcing oil phenologoy. All species showed a significant sensitivity to GDD summations, with peak correlations falling oil or near the varying median flowering or first sighting dates. These results were robust Whether the GDD analyses were conducted over the complete set of observations for each species (beginning oil or after 1928) or over a latter period with a more serially complete set of cross-taxa observations (1970-2002). The GDD correlations indicate significant climate sensitivity in all species, but the different magnitudes of correlation and timing of maximum correlation imply that plant and animal responses to climate changes in the future Will not be homogeneous for the tested species at Mohonk Lake.

When compared to normal chemical gradients near bottom, i.e. O2 decrease and SiO2 increase, three types of anomalies (lens, interface, and behaviour) have been observed on O2 and SiO2, the most sensitive chemical species. These anomalies were found throughout the year, in several stations of the deepest part of the lake and even along the slope of the lake basin. Major anomalies (DELTA-O2 + 3 to 10 mg.l-1; DELTA-SiO2 - 1 to 2 mg.l-1) were generally found at the sediment water interface and may extend 10-20 m above the sediment and last 10 weeks. Others marked lens anomalies could be observed for 3 to 4 months. Several mechanisms are probably responsible for this injection of surface waters along the lake slope (accumulation of turbid water on lake banks after severe windstorms; river density currents due to temperature and/or turbidity difference with lake waters). These water-inputs do not represent important volumes (less-than-or-equal-to 1% total lake volume) but, when occuring at the interface, they ensure a sufficient oxygen level to prevent diffusion of phosphate and ammonia from pore waters when winter lake overturns do not reach bottom layers (from 1972 to 1980). Complete overturns, as observed in 1980/81, are connected with major interface anomalies (bottom O2 moves up from 2 to 10 mg.l-1) occuring before surface mixing reaches the deepest layers.																			1015-1621						1991	53	4					273	289		10.1007/BF00877137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877137													WOS:A1991GW17600001

This study has intended to engage the different water quality indices to categorize the suitability of the water quality of Lake Hawassa Watershed for anthropogenic uses and identify the trophic state of Lake Hawassa. Analysis of physicochemical water quality parameters at selected sites and periods was conducted throughout May 2020 to January 2021 to assess the present status of the Lake Watershed. In total, 19 monitoring sites and 21 physicochemical parameters were selected and analyzed in a laboratory. The Canadian council of ministries of the environment (CCME WQI) and weighted arithmetic (WA WQI) water quality indices have been used to cluster the water quality of Lake Hawassa Watershed and the Carlson trophic state index (TSI) has been employed to identify the trophic state of Lake Hawassa. The water quality is generally categorized as unsuitable for drinking, aquatic life and recreational purposes and it is excellent to unsuitable for irrigation depending on the sampling location and the applied indices. Specifically, in WA WQI, rivers were excellent for agricultural uses and Lake Hawassa was good for agricultural uses. However, the CCME WQI findings showed rivers were good for irrigation but lake Hawassa was marginal for agricultural use. Point sources were impaired for all envisioned purposes. The overall category of Lake Hawassa falls under a eutrophic state since the average TSI was 65.4 and the lake is phosphorous-deficient, having TN:TP of 31.1. The monitored point sources indicate that the city of Hawassa and its numerous industrial discharges are key polluters, requiring a fast and consequent set-up of an efficient wastewater infrastructure, accompanied by a rigorous monitoring of large point sources (e.g., industry, hospitals and hotels). In spite of the various efforts, the recovery of Lake Hawassa may take a long time as it is hydrologically closed. Therefore, to ensure safe drinking water supply, a central supply system according to World Health organization (WHO) standards also for the fringe inhabitants still using lake water is imperative. Introducing riparian buffer zones of vegetation and grasses can support the direct pollution alleviation measures and is helpful to reduce the dispersed pollution coming from the population using latrines. Additionally, integrating aeration systems like pumping atmospheric air into the bottom of the lake using solar energy panels or diffusers are effective mitigation measures that will improve the water quality of the lake. In parallel, the implementation and efficiency control of measures requires coordinated environmental monitoring with dedicated development targets.

J	POST, FJ				POST, FJ			MICROBIAL ECOLOGY OF GREAT SALT LAKE	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The Great Salt Lake [Utah, USA] is actually 2 lakes; a highly saline (330-gml-1) northern arm and a moderately saline (120-gml-1) southern arm separated by a semipermeable rock causeway. The lake, particularly the northern arm, has a massive accumulation of organic matter resulting from more than 100,000 yr of productivity, cycling from a freshwater to a saline lake, plus the influence of human industry and agriculture in more recent times. The north arm planktonic and attached community consists principally of, in order of biomass: bacteria of at least 2 genera, Halobacterium and Halococcus; 2 algae, Dunaliella salina and D. viridis; the brine shrimp, Artemia salina; and 2 spp. of brine fly, Ephydra gracilis and E. hians and possibly 1 more species. The algae and the bacteria appear to depend on each other for nutrients. The bacteria use organic matter produced by the algae and the algae use NH3 produced by the bacteria and possibly the brine shrimp. The production of NH3 appears to be the rate-limiting step although there is no shortage of other forms of N in the north arm. Based on aquarium studies, the potential for biomass production of algae and bacteria is much higher than actually observed in the north arm, leading to the postulation of 2 additional factors controlling population; the grazing of the algae by invertebrates with the excretion of compounds rich in N, and the effect of a low habitat temperature and winter cold on the bacteria, reducing their metabolic activities to nearly zero. Some aspects of the various organisms and their metabolism are discussed. A comparison is made with recent work on the Dead Sea.																			0095-3628	1432-184X					1977	3	2					143	165		10.1007/BF02010403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02010403								24233467					WOS:A1977CW78400005

ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA												Quaternary Volcano Cluster of Wulanhada, 300km away from Beijing, is located around the Right-back-banner, Chahaer, Inner Mongolia, situated in the southern border of the Mongolian Plateau. The volcano cluster overlies the Archean Wulashan Rock Group and Neogene basalt, with an area about 280km(2). Volcanic activity can be divided into both the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene epoches (30.56 + 2.59ka BP; 21.05 + 1.79ka BP). On the whole, volcanoes are Fissure eruptions or fissure-central eruptions. Spatter cones and levees are formed along the NE and NW faults in the late Pleistocene. Most of cones built by basaltic agglutinate and clastogenic lava have been denuded to some extent though most of vents still remain the basic form. The Holocene comprises three cupola volcanoes built by alkali-basaltic scoria cones and lavas produced by central eruptions. Holocene volcanoes are controlled by the same NE basement fault as the late Pleistocene and are Strombolian type. The dimensions of the volcanoes are large and the volcanic structures tire complete. The body of the cones consists of the earlier fallen pumice cones and the later spattered agglutinates. The movements of the lava flow are constrained by the landscape, and flow from northwest to southeast. The longest flow is about 18 km. The lava flows cover over the gravels of valley, eolian sand and swamp deposits of the Holocene, indicating their formation age. The primary type of lava is pahoehoe which develops inflation cracks and depressions. The flow-fronts developing pressure ridges, spiracles and characteristic large groups of tumuli reached around Baiyinnao, and obstructed the drainage, and then formed volcanic dammed lakes such its Moshigainao and Wulanhushaohai. Quaternary Volcano Cluster of Wulanhada is the only one which once erupted in Holocene in the southern border of the Mongolian Plateau, is a natural "Volcano Museum", and is a window to research the deeper structure and activity of the modern crust in this area.																			1000-0569	2095-8927				NOV	2008	24	11					2585	2594																WOS:000262521300013

This paper presents a carbon isotopic curve of organic matter linked to the main results of the pollen analysis. Interpretation of this carbon isotopic curve is simplified (1) because of the weak role played by the phytoplankton in the balance of the organic particle flux, and (2) because of the presumed absence of diagenetic alteration of the isotopic composition. The carbon isotopic curve exhibits an almost linear correlation with that of total grass pollen which form the main part of the C4 biomass. The major fluctuations of isotopic and pollen curves allow four main phases to be distinguished: from ca. 25,000 to 20,000 yr B.P., deltaC-13 values of -25 to -30 parts per thousand (PDB) are related to a forest environment associated with a montane floral element; from 20,000 to 13,000 yr B.P., the deltaC-13 values are between -23 and -28 parts per thousand and are linked to openings of landscape with a mosaic of forest and savanna and a fall of lake level with colonization of the shores by Cyperaceae and other aquatic plants; from 13,000 to 10,000 yr B.P., the forest extended again reaching a maximum density during the period from 9500 until 3000 yr B.P. and with an average deltaC-13 value of -32 parts per thousand; a new dry phase occurred at around 2500-2000 yr B.P., with temporary openings in the forest, marked by a deltaC-13 excursion above -30 parts per thousand, but during the last 2 millennia, the forest developed again with deltaC-13 values of -32 parts per thousand.																			0031-0182					FEB 15	1994	107	1-2					65	78		10.1016/0031-0182(94)90165-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(94)90165-1													WOS:A1994NA95700004

Ladakh Himalaya has fascinating and exquisite landforms and landscapes. The area of interest in the present study is located along the Indus Tsangpo Suture Zone (ITSZ), caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. In the context of diverse geology, structure, topography, tectonic history, and climatic variability, there is an immense diversity of landforms (geodiversity) in the Ladakh region. The region has always attracted tourists/geoscientists from all over the world because of its unique culture, language, religion, geology, and others. Researchers have identified various geoheritage sites, including structural features, lacustrine lake deposits, geothermal hot springs, semi-precious minerals, etc. The protection and preservation of these geoheritage sites in Ladakh Himalaya are essential to promote geotourism and sustainable growth. The proposed sites need to be conserved as needs of the people living in the region. The present study identifies various geosites related to sedimentary (lacustrine deposits), high-grade metamorphic rocks, intrusives rocks and minerals of igneous origin etc. from the northwestern to southeastern Ladakh Himalaya based on their unique geological features and significance. Besides geological aspects, these geosites in Ladakh are habited with diverse flora and fauna which makes it more significant for preservation. A detailed evaluation of these geosites is established based on the extensive field investigation and literature review. The present study involves the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to these geoheritage sites and emphasizes the importance of its recognition and geoconservation. The proposed geosites are facing serious challenges of its destruction due to anthropogenic activities, unsustainable growth of tourism, lack of public awareness, and non-involvement of any governmental agencies for its protection and conservation has put continuous pressure on the sensitive and fragile ecology of geosites in Ladakh and causing environmental and socio-cultural impact.					; Nayak, Ranjit/AAN-6862-2021	/0000-0002-9082-7524; 													1867-2477	1867-2485				JUN	2024	16	2							39	10.1007/s12371-024-00942-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12371-024-00942-0													WOS:001199731900001

Primarily, surface water pollution is linked to human and animal waste discharges. This study aimed to investigate the physico-chemical characteristics of drinking water under both dry and wet conditions, assess the extent of bacterial contamination in samples collected from various locations in District Shangla, and evaluate potential health risks associated with consuming contaminated water within local communities. For this purpose, 120 groundwater and surface water samples were randomly collected from various sources such as storage tanks, user sites, streams, ponds and rivers in the study area. The results revealed that in Bisham, lakes had the highest fecal coliform levels among seven tested sources, followed by protected wells, reservoirs, downstream sources, springs, rivers, and ditches; while in Alpuri, nearly 80% of samples from five sources contained fecal coliform bacteria. Similarly, it was observed that the turbidity level, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, biological oxygen demand, and dissolved oxygen in the surface drinking water sources of Bisham were significantly higher than those in the surface drinking water sources of Alpuri. Furthermore, the results showed that in the Alpuri region, 14% of the population suffers from dysentery, 27% from diarrhea, 22% from cholera, 13% from hepatitis A, and 16% and 8% from typhoid and kidney problems, respectively, while in the Bisham area, 24% of residents are affected by diarrhea, 17% by cholera and typhoid, 15% by hepatitis A, 14% by dysentery, and 13% by kidney problems. These findings underscore the urgent need for improved water quality management practices and public health interventions to mitigate the risks associated with contaminated drinking water. It is recommended to implement regular water quality monitoring programs, enhance sanitation infrastructure, and raise awareness among local communities about the importance of safe drinking water practices to safeguard public health.					salam, muhammad/KIB-9747-2024; Hossain, Md Nuralam/V-4431-2019; Ullah, Waheed/NJR-4192-2025	Hossain, Md Nuralam/0000-0003-0029-9367; Ullah, Dr. Waheed/0000-0002-9153-3069													0269-4042	1573-2983				JUN	2024	46	6							209	10.1007/s10653-024-01965-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-024-01965-w								38814487					WOS:001235595500001
J	Heegaard, E; Lotter, AF; Birks, HJB				Heegaard, E; Lotter, AF; Birks, HJB			Aquatic biota and the detection of climate change: Are there consistent aquatic ecotones?	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												In this study, we analyse the cumulative rate of compositional change along an altitudinal gradient in the Swiss Alps for three different groups of aquatic organisms - Cladocera, chironomids, and diatoms. In particular, we are interested in the magnitude of unusually large changes in species composition that allows the detection of critical ecotones for each of these three organism groups. The estimated rate-of-change is the distance in ordination space using principal coordinate analysis based on chord distance and chi-square distance. These analyses highlight the cumulative rate-of-change and the cumulative relative rate-of-change, as the chi-square distance is relative to the total species composition. We found that the major changes in taxonomic composition for the three organism groups and therefore also the major ecotones are just below the modern tree-line (1900-2000 m a.s.l.), which may indirectly be an effect of the tree-line. For diatoms and Cladocera (only chi-square distance) there is also an ecotone at 2055 m a.s.l., which may be a direct or indirect response to climate. Further, the ecotone region below the modern tree-line is much wider for chironomids, with an extension downwards due to a shift in relative abundance patterns. For diatoms there is a stronger rate-of-change above 1650 m a.s.l. when chi-square distance is used. Coupled with the even distribution of diatom richness, this suggests that at higher altitudes the change is more strongly associated with a few species becoming dominant compared to lower elevations. Hence, there are considerable differences among the three organism groups, suggesting that different environmental factors may influence the rates of compositional change within and among groups. This supports the general usefulness of multi-proxy studies, namely the study of several independent groups of organisms to reconstruct past environmental conditions but also points to the importance of careful site selection in such studies.

Temporal Trends of Persistent Organic Pollutants in Sarasota Bay Common Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were measured in blubber samples collected from 196 common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from 2000 to 2016 in the Sarasota Bay, Florida, ecosystem. Legacy POPs included polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (sigma PCB; sum of 37 congeners or congener groups), dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and transformation products (sigma DDT), chlordane and related compounds (sigma Chlor), mirex, polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners (sigma PBDE, sum of five congeners), dieldrin and hexachlorobenzene (HCB). All POP compounds or compound groups declined in dolphin blubber over the study period. POP classes declined at different rates within classifications (sex, adult or calf). For example, dieldrin decline in male dolphins was greatest (-13% per year) while HCB decline was lower (-6.3% per year). For individual POP classes, rates of decline depended on classification. For example, sigma PCB, the POP class present at the highest concentration relative to other POPs, declined at -8.4, -7.8, and -5.6% per year in adult females, adult males and calves, respectively. Overall POP declines were highest in adult males and lowest in calves. Declines in POP concentration with time based on individual dolphins resampled at different time points were consistent with declines calculated based on yearly or biennial cross-sections taken from 2000 through 2016. Overall rates of decline in Sarasota Bay bottlenose dolphins were like declines seen for Great Lakes fish and about twice the rate of decline observed in arctic temporal trend data sets. POP trends appear to have leveled off since 2009 in Sarasota Bay dolphins. For example, sigma PCBs in calves appear to have stabilized at 21 mg/kg lipid. Recent published work on delphinids with blubber concentrations spanning those observed in the present work suggest that levels of legacy POPs currently observed in Sarasota dolphins may suppress population growth. Results from this study confirm the need for continued monitoring of POPs in the Sarasota Bay bottlenose dolphin population to see if concentrations are continuing to fall or have indeed plateaued.

Convection of this type occurs in ice-covered freshwater lakes in late spring, when the snow cover vanishes and solar radiation is absorbed beneath the ice cover. The vertical temperature structure, bulk mixed layer scaling, and mixed layer deepening are examined for a number of temperate and polar lakes. A bulk mixed layer scaling for this type of convection is based on energy arguments underlying the classical Deardorff convective scaling. The depth of the convective layer serves as an appropriate length scale. However, a modified scale that takes account of the energetics of a distributed radiation source term replaces the surface buoyancy flux velocity scale used by Deardorff. The scaling compares favorably with large-eddy simulations of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and with both observations and large-eddy simulations of the TKE dissipation rate. Mixed layer deepening is simulated with a model of convection beneath lake ice. The model describes the structure of the stably stratified layer just beneath the ice with a stationary solution to the heat transfer equation; the structure of the entrainment layer is parameterized with a zero-order jump approach. The entrainment equation is derived from the mixed layer TKE budget and bulk mixed layer scaling. Entrainment regimes characteristic of convection beneath ice are analyzed. It is shown that if the Deardorff convective velocity scale is replaced with a scale incorporating the distributed buoyancy flux, the entrainment equation describing atmospheric and oceanic convective boundary layers also applies beneath the ice. Model predictions compare well with data from observations in a number of lakes. We propose and compare with observations an extension of the mixed layer model that allows for the inclusion of salinity. Although the salt concentration is low in most temperate and polar lakes, its dynamical effect can be significant close to the temperature of maximum density.

Several hundred glacial moraines have been dated, using lichenometry and dendrochronology in conjunction with radiocarbon dating, studies of lake-level changes, and archeological and historical data. Comparisons are made with data from the Caucasus, the Alps, and other mountain regions. Broad conclusions of importance to the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program are given and areas where additional research is needed are identified. Many Tien Shan glaciers show evidence of advances that predate the conventional time span of the Little Ice Age; many advances and recessions have occurred synchronously, although the magnitude of such trends varied significantly between regions and within the same region; fluctuations in equilibrium-line altitudes were more pronounced in the outer, or more maritime, areas and became progressively less prominent toward the interior where the climate is more continental. While it may be claimed that glacier-climate analysis has been developed to the point where climate forecasting is feasible, the recent anthropogenic impacts on the atmosphere and their potential for climate change cannot yet be incorporated into such forecasting. This is because the complex relationships between natural variations in precipitation and temperature are not sufficiently well understood and because the record of glacier fluctuation is by no means fully systematic. Nevertheless, if the pattern of the last thousand years in the Tien Shan persists, one can expect pseudo-cyclic oscillations of summer temperature with an amplitude of about 2-degrees-C and a periodicity of 30-50 years.

These climate trends are particularly apparent on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. However, the Tibetan Plateau (due to its heterogeneous mountain landscape) has very complex and spatially differing temperature and precipitations patterns. As a result, intensive palaeolimnological investigations are necessary to decipher these climatic patterns and to understand ecological responses to recent environmental change. Here we present palaeolimnological results from a Pb-210/Cs-137-dated sediment core spanning approximately the last 200 years from a remote high-mountain lake (LC6 Lake, working name) on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Sediment profiles of diatoms, organic variables (TOC, C:N) and grain size were investigated. The Pb-210 record suggests a period of rapid sedimentation, which might be linked to major tectonic events in the region ca. 1950. Furthermore, unusually high Pb-210 supply rates over the last 50 years suggest that the lake has possibly been subjected to increasing precipitation rates, sediment focussing and/or increased spring thaw. The majority of diatom taxa encountered in the core are typical of slightly acidic to circumneutral, oligotrophic, electrolyte-poor lakes. Diatom species assemblages were rich, and dominated by Cyclotella sp., Achnanthes sp., Aulacoseira sp. and fragilarioid taxa. Diatom compositional change was minimal over the 200-year period (DCCA = 0.85 SD, p = 0.59); only a slightly more diverse but unstable diatom assemblage was recorded during the past 50 years. The results indicate that large-scale environmental changes recorded in the twentieth century (i.e. increased precipitation and temperatures) are likely having an affect on the LC6 Lake, but so far these impacts are more apparent on the lake geochemistry than on the diatom flora. Local and/or regional peculiarities, such as increasing precipitation and cloud cover, or localized climatic phenomena, such as negative climate feedbacks, might have offset the effects of increasing mean surface temperatures.					; Mischke, Steffen/L-9300-2015	Appleby, Peter/0000-0002-6945-1841; Herzschuh, Ulrike/0000-0003-0999-1261; Mischke, Steffen/0000-0003-3821-8497													0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2011	46	2					215	227		10.1007/s10933-011-9533-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-011-9533-x													WOS:000293145000004

Trace element composition of freshwater pearl mussels Margaritifera spp. across Eurasia: Testing the effect of species and geographic location	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												To reveal the geographical and inter-species variability of the major and trace element (TE) compositions of freshwater mussel shells across Eurasia, we used ICP MS after acid digestion to analyze 50 samples of shells from five species of the genus Margaritifera spp. (Bivalvia: Margaritiferidae) collected in 20 minor rivers located in NW Russia, Sakhalin, Amur basin, Kuril Islands, Kamchatka and Laos. The variations between replicates from the same site were smaller than the variations between samples from different localities or between different mollusk species. Using normed PCA, we observed significant biological and geographical controls of the trace element composition in freshwater shells, with five main species exhibiting distinct features of TE concentration corresponding to four major geographical locations. Four PCA factors explain 81% of the TE variability, which is closely linked to specific geographical location and weakly linked to the identity of the species. The first two factors (F1 x F2) are the element concentration and its biological affinity. The other two factors (F3 x F4) likely are the nutrient status of the river, corresponding to its proximity to wetlands or mountains, and the degree of the influence of volcanic/hydrothermal activity. The analysis of water samples collected during the active growth period in summer baseflow was used to quantify the distribution coefficients (K-d) of trace elements between the aragonite shells and the river water. All species are significantly enriched in Mn relative to the river water, with distribution coefficients of up to 5. The other elements exhibit Kd values that were similar for the five species. This suggests that the obtained distribution coefficients may be universal constants reflecting uptake of each element by the organism from the river water and its intracellular transport and biocalcification processes. Taken together, the chemical composition data for pearl mussel shells may not only reflect the geographical locality and species identity but also provide insights into biochemical processes of element uptake in the form of biominerals.

J	Fard, AM				Fard, AM			Large dead-ice depressions in flat-topped eskers: evidence of a Preboreal jokulhlaup in the Stockholm area, Sweden	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE					Symposium on Subglacial Lakes	2001	SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA					Sedimentological investigations in Palamalm, one of the few elongated, flat-topped, raised glaciofluvial deposits of the Stockholm area, show that the deposit was formed in a subglacial tunnel environment during the early Preboreal. The study provides evidence for dynamic links between the morphology of a subglacial conduit, the regional subglacial discharge, and the regional ice-sheet dynamics. The general morphology of the deposit and the lateral esker displacement are parts of a regional pattern. The development and interrelations of the eight distinguished lithofacies at Palamalm provides evidence for the triggering mechanism responsible for the deposition of this 3-km-long glaciofluvial deposit. Strongly deformed gravels occur close to large dead-ice structures. The occurrence of another elongated and flat-topped glaciofluvial deposit, Jordbromalm, further to the east suggests a sudden regional subglacial outburst (jokulhlaup) in the area. The sudden, intensive enhancement of water discharge in Palamalm is probably due to the same outburst. This is assumed to have caused the ice roof of the conduit to collapse. The high meltwater-pressure gradient caused the diameter of the conduit to increase rapidly. In addition, the subglacial tunnel took a new route because the original course became blocked by large ice blocks that had fallen from the roof. The steep flanks of the deposit, the presence of large dead-ice depressions along the central part of the deposit and the appearance of two different tunnel-core facies in the main cross-section of the Palamalm deposit support the hypothesis of a course change after the jokulhlaup. A probable late-glacial crustal rebound in response to the rapid deglaciation in the area may have been the triggering mechanism for the abrupt discharge of the subglacial lake.

Since 1950s, the water level of Qinghai Lake has been changing rapidly, which induces great effects on the surrounding traffic facilities, residents' safety and the development of animal husbandry, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to study the water level evolution and water balance of Qinghai Lake under the main impact of climate change. Based on meteorological and hydrological data from Buha River Hydrological Station, Xiashe Hydrological Station, and Gangcha Meteorological Station, CMFD, and water balance equation, this article first analyzes the interannual and intra-year water level evolution characteristics of Qinghai Lake from 1956 to 2020, including lake surface precipitation (P), runoff into the lake (Rs) and evaporation (E). Secondly, we conducted a study on the water level change characteristics calculated for fixed months. Finally, the contribution rate of each factor to the fluctuation of Qinghai Lake water level was quantitatively calculated using the ridge regression method. Results show that the annual average water level declined at a rate of 0.8 m decade-1 from 1956 to 2004, primarily due to E exceeding the sum of P and Rs. However, from 2004 to 2020, the water level increased at a rate of 1.7 m decade-1, mainly attributed to the increase in P and Rs. Qinghai Lake exhibits evident intra-year variations, with the water level starting to rise in May and reaching its peak in September, which aligns with the monthly variations of Rs, P, and E. Furthermore, the impacts of the current year's P, Rs, and E on the annual water level fluctuations for fixed months of September to December is greater than that of the previous year. Specifically, the contributions of the current year's P, Rs and E to the water level fluctuations calculated based on December data are 10%, 70%, and 20%, respectively. The contribution rate of meteorological factors to the rise and fall of water level was wind speed (33%), downward short-wave radiation (27%), precipitation (27%), downward long-wave radiation (11%) and specific humidity (2%).					; Yang, Liuyiyi/JYQ-3247-2024; Shu, Lele/U-9428-2019; Wang, Mengxiao/ABD-2144-2020	Wen, Lijuan/0000-0001-9243-9499; Shu, Lele/0000-0002-6903-4466; Zheng, Jingyuan/0009-0008-8274-0892; 														2073-4441				OCT	2023	15	20							3614	10.3390/w15203614	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15203614													WOS:001093533500001

Climate changes in East Siberia (Russia) in the Holocene based on diatom, chironomid and pollen records from the sediments of Lake Kotokel	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We analysed a 620-cm-long sediment record from Lake Kotokel located in East Siberia (Russia) for subfossil diatoms, chironomids and pollen to provide a reconstruction of the climate history of the area for the last 12.2 kyr. The subfossil records show differing time lags in their responses to climate change; diatoms and chironomids were more sensitive to climate change than the pollen record. Changes in the biogenic proxies seem related with changes in insolation, the temperature of the North Atlantic and solar activity. The chironomids Chironomus plumosus-type and Einfeldia carbonaria-type and the diatom Aulacoseira granulata were interpreted as markers of warm climate condition. The proxy records were divided into four periods (A, B, C and D) suggesting differing climate in East Siberia during the Holocene. Period D (12.2-9.5 kyr BP) at the beginning of the Holocene, according to chironomid and diatom records, was characterized by warm climate with summer temperatures close to modern. However, forest vegetation had not become fully established yet. During Period C (9.5-5.8 kyr BP), the climate seemed to gradually become colder and wetter from the beginning of Period C to 7 kyr BP. From 7 to 5.8 kyr BP, the climate seemed to remain cold, but aridity increased. Period B (5.8-1.7 kyr BP) was characterised by frequent and sharp alternations between warm and cold conditions. Unstable conditions during this time are also registered in records from Lakes Baikal, Khubsugul and various other shallow lakes of the region. Optimal warm and wet conditions seemed to occur ca. 4 kyr BP. During Period A (the last 1.5 kyr) the diatom and chironomid records show evidence of cold conditions at 1.5-1 kyr BP, but the forest vegetation did not change significantly.

J	Ye, LL; Shi, X; Wu, XD; Zhang, M; Yu, Y; Li, DM; Kong, FX				Ye, Linlin; Shi, Xiao; Wu, Xiaodong; Zhang, Min; Yu, Yang; Li, Daming; Kong, Fanxiang			Dynamics of dissolved organic carbon after a cyanobacterial bloom in hypereutrophic Lake Taihu (China)	LIMNOLOGICA												To establish the influence of the cyanobacterial bloom collapse on the characteristics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Lake Taihu, high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM), with sizes between 1 kDa and 0.5 mu m, were collected using cross-flow ultrafiltration, from three different eutrophic regions. Isolated HMW-DOM was further characterized by atomic carbon to nitrogen ratio and neutral sugars composition by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the cyanobacterial cell lysis induced by nitrate depletion is the likely mechanism for DOC release. The relatively high DOC level was associated with the high chlorophyll a concentration in Meiliang Bay, one of the most eutrophic bays in the northern part of the lake. However, no significant correlations were observed between chlorophyll a concentration and HMW-DOC concentration during the demise of the cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu. No significant differences were found in the HMW-DOC concentration among the three sampling sites, which were selected to represent different eutrophic status. However, a significant difference in the HMW-DOC concentration was found between October 2009 and January 2010 in all three sampling sites (p = 0.02). The HMW-DOC release may be attributed to the cyanobacterial cell lysis after the peak of summer bloom. The similarity in neutral sugar composition between the HMW-DOM and cyanobacterial exopolysaccharides suggests that the cyanobacterial bloom is the source of HMW-DOM. However, the significant correlation between the carbon to nitrogen ratio in HMW-DOM and chlorophyll a concentration was only observed in Meiliang Bay, which implies that apart from the cyanobacteria-derived DOC, a fraction of DOC was from riverine input. The decline of the cyanobacterial bloom also changed the overall DOM pool, leading to a shift in the component of HMW-DOM from a C-enriched material to an N-enriched material, as revealed by the variation in the carbon to nitrogen ratios. Overall, these results demonstrate that the quantitative and qualitative DOM is affected by the post-cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

HEMOGLOBIN SOLUTIONS AS BLOOD SUBSTITUTES	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS												Dogs, anesthetized with pentobarbital-Na, were shocked by bleeding at 50 mm. Hg for 1 hr. The metabolic rate was detd. before and during shock, and after treatment of shock with Hb solns. prepared by various methods from ox, dog, and human blood. The effects of the infusion of the various types of Hb solns., as well as laked whole blood, upon the blood pressure and pulse pressure of shocked dogs have been investigated. The metabolic rate during shock may fall to as low as 30-40% of the control values, and return to normal or greater than normal values in 15-20 mins. after the injn. of an Hb soln. (7%) in quantities equal to some 25% of the blood vol. lost during the production of shock. Following the injn. of Hb solns. the blood pressure and pulse pressure increased gradually and these increases were maintained over a long period of time. Although there is a rapid return to normal of the metabolic rate, blood pressure and pulse pressure in shocked dogs after the injn. of Hb containing solns., and even though the dogs come out of anesthesia in 8-10 hrs. they die routinely in a few more hrs. The adm. of glucose, various amino acids and vits. in addition to the Hb to these shocked dogs failed to prevent the delayed death. In contrast to the results obtained in shocked dogs treated with Hb solns., dogs treated with the same type of Hb solns. immediately after a massive acute hemorrhage, 4-5% of the body wt., will survive.																			0022-3565	1521-0103					1945	83	3					225	234																WOS:A1945XZ79200007

Monitoring of the species in 2003-2019 shows that the Pochard breeds in the wetlands of the Ararat Plain, on the Shirak and Lori Plateaus, and at Lake Sevan, c. 800-2,040 m above sea level. It occurs in a core area of c. 64 km(2), but defining a minimum area polygon that includes all known breeding sites extends to over c. 14,887 km(2). In 2019, the total number of breeding Pochard pairs in Armenia was estimated at 1,917 (95% CI = 1,186-2,647) with a mean breeding density of 30.4 (+/- 5.91 s.e.) pairs/km(2) (95% CI = 18.8-42.0 pairs). TRIM analysis of available count data found a moderate decline in the breeding population during 2003-2019, with Pochard numbers diminishing by 33% over the 17-year period, and by 16% in the last ten years. Numbers recorded in winter ranged from 34 birds in 2008 to 3,421 in 2015, with the variation apparently attributable to whether water bodies were frozen. A review of the potential threats to the species in Armenia showed that the primary threats are from habitat loss and/or degradation following changes in fish farm management, and also hunting pressure resulting from poor recognition of game species by hunters and a lack of control of hunting regulations. Pochard in Armenia should be considered as Vulnerable under International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria, and two main measures are recommended to improve the conservation status of the species: better control of hunting and poaching nationally, and protection and improved management of key habitats used by the Pochard. Continued monitoring of the species is also essential, for assessing future population changes and to evaluate the efficacy of conservation interventions.

In this paper we present the results of our investigations in the surroundings of the Northern Inylchek Glacier, namely in the Peremitschka, the seasonally flooded plain situated between the Southern Inylchek Glacier and Upper Lake Merzbacher. During the summer, this plain is flooded by melt water discharged from the Northern Inylchek Valley, creating the up to 120 m deep Lower Lake Merzbacher, which regularly bursts out and releases its water through an englacial piping system of the Southern Inylchek Glacier in. It is due to this unique phenomenon that Lower Lake Merzbacher has been the subject of study by scientists on numerous expeditions during the last century. As a mapping basis for our field works, we used an enlarged scene acquired in September 2005 from the Quickbird satellite with 60 cm ground resolution. For identification of advancing and retreating parts of the Inylchek Glacier system, a pan-sharpened Landsat 7 ETM+ scene (bands 1, 4 and 7) with a ground resolution of 15 m acquired in 2006 was used. A time series analysis of aerial photos dating from 1943 and 1956 was compared to the Quickbird scene from 2005 and revealed first the retreat and later the rapid advance of the Northern Inylchek Glacier along a distance of at least two kilometres. Since neither indications of a glacier lake outburst around Upper Lake Merzbacher nor stretched ogives or erosional scars in the Northern Inylchek Glacier implying a rapid surge could be detected, the mechanism of this fluctuating glacier is subject to ongoing investigations. Our helicopter-supported campaign in the Peremitschka at altitudes between 3300 and 3500 meters lasted only four days. For the glaciogeologic and geomorphologic interpretation of remote sensing imageries we used geophysical methods such as electric resistivity tomography (ERT) and frequency domain electromagnetics (FDEM). The 800 m long ERT-profile crossing the Peremitschka plain revealed resistivities ranging from 6 Ohmmeter (ohm. m) in the near subsurface to 100.000 ohm. m down to a depth of 45 meters. A series of thin, undulated, low-resistivity layers are underlain by a thick high-resistivity layer, which has been interpreted as dead ice from the formerly advancing Northern Inylchek Glacier. A small river flows down the Northern Inylchek Valley, here termed "Merz Rivulet" or "Merzbach", with a flow of about 30 m(3)/second. Along its course it has locally eroded the Peremitschka plain to a depth of 20-25 meters. This steep slope within the Peremitschka reveals an intercalation of silty calcareous lake deposits with ice layers and ice lenses respectively. These outcrops have been interpreted as near subsurface permafrost layers, which can be correlated with the undulated low-resistivity layer of the ERT-profile. Additionally, high resolution mapping of this permafrost zone using frequency domain electromagnetics with 2525 Hertz (Hz) and 5025 Hz revealed cone-like depressions, which were interpreted as glacier karst.

Approximately 42 PBDEs were extracted by DLLME and determinated by gas chromatography coupled with the micro-electron capture detector (GC-mu ECD) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In this method, the mixture of chlorobenzene(25 p,L) and acetonitrile (1.0 mL) were injected into samples rapidly, then centrifugated for 15 min at 3000 r/min, after that the organic phase was drawn from the centrifuge tube and evaporated to dryness by nitrogen. The residue was dissolved by 17 ill, acetone, and 1 mu L was injected into the GC. Under the optimized conditions, PBDEs can be extracted completely and separated well. Good linear relationships were obtained in the concentrations of 2.0 - 250.0 mu g/L of the analyte with the correlation coefficients of 0.9982 - 0.9999. The limits of detection were between 0.2 and 4.9 ng/L(S/N = 3). The water samples collected from Baiyang Lake were successfully analyzed using the proposed method. BDE-166 and BDE-209 were detected in all water samples. The recoveries, which had been spiked with different levels (0.017 and 0.170 mu g/L), fell in the range of 71.4% - 110.8% and the relative standard deviations were between 1.0% and 11.9% (n = 3). The results showed that the proposed method would be valuable for PBDEs analysis in environmental water samples.																			0253-3820	1872-2040				APR	2010	38	4					498	502		10.3724/SP.J.1096.2010.00498	http://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1096.2010.00498													WOS:000277393500009

In the proglacial lake Bukkehammartjorna, sediment analyses of loss-on-ignition (LOI), magnetic susceptibility and analyses of grain-size distribution have been used to reconstruct Holocene variations in glacier activity and other catchment processes. The glacier has low-sediment production, hence a low signal-to-noise ratio of mincrogenic sediment flux is found. Grain-size analyses are used to enhance the glacigenic signal and to detect glacier variations and other changes in sediment input. The sedimentological record from Bukkehammartjorn is compared with three other lake records from the same region in order to separate the glacial signal from variations in organic production and episodes of enhanced non-glacial minerogenic sedimentation. Subsequent to the deglaciation after the Younger Dryas, a preboreal glacial advance culminated before 10,100cal. BP. This was followed by a prolonged period with no glaciers in the catchment until 7500 cal. BP, after which there is evidence of limited glacier activity lasting until 6800 cal. BP. Between 6700 and 6000 cal. BP the catchment was deglaciated. After 6000 cal. BP Bukkehammarbreen reformed, increasing in size towards similar to3800 cal. BP, with evidence for reduced glacier activity around 5200 cal. BP. A glacier with approximately similar size as at present has existed after similar to3800 cal. BP. The investigation has demonstrated the usefulness of multi-site and multi-parameter lacustrine investigations in reconstructing glacier fluctuations and for testing and validating the results. The investigations have shown that grain-size variations in sediment cores located at increasing distance from the meltwater inlet of a lake may provide an indicator of paraglacial activity in the catchment during the Holocene. The results also suggest that the lower altitudinal limit of permafrost in eastern Jotunheimen remained below about 1800 m during the Holocene.

J	SARVALA, J				SARVALA, J			PATTERNS OF BENTHIC COPEPOD ASSEMBLAGES IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												The benthic copepod assemblages in an oligotrophic lake were studied from quantitative samples collected from 57 sites at depths of 0.2-65 m. Numerical classification and ordination of sites resulted in six site groups: stony shores, emergent macrophyte (Equisetum) stands, and depth zones of 1-2 m (littoral), 2-5 m (littoriprofundal), 5-10 m (upper profundal) and between 10 m (lower profundal). Classification and ordination of species showed that the stony shores and the lower profundal had characteristic species assemblages. The total number of benthic copepod species decreased from the littoral (23 species) to the profundal (14-16 species); in the littoral it was among Equisetium. Both the harpacticoid and omnivorous cyclopoid guilds showed parallel trends. Several other, diversity measures (Hill''s numbers, Kempton and Taylor''s mid-range satistic and rarefied species numbers) showed approximately similar patterns. Dominance was inversely related to diversity; it was lowest on littoral soft bottoms, and increased with depth and towards the shoreline; it was higher among emergent macrophytes than on stony shores. The benthic copepod diversity in the Equisetum stands, the most productive area in the lake, was probably restricted by poor oxygen conditions in the sediment, which excluded burrowing forms, mainly harpacticoids. The stony shores, the most diverse littoral area relative to productivity, probably offered the most varied microhabitats. The decreasing species diversity pattern on the soft bottoms from the open littoral towards the depths probably reflected partly the decreasing productivity of the benthic subsystem and partly the abundance of two main faunal components: littoral, warm-water species decreased with depth, and a group of cold-water adapted species favoured the deep profundal. The fluctuating summer temperatures around the thermocline depth perhaps contributed to this faunal turnover, restricting the reproduction of cold-adapted species.

J	Smajic, S; Kulenovic, S; Pavic, D				Smajic, Sabahudin; Kulenovic, Salih; Pavic, Dragoslav			Geographical Consequences of the Surface Exploitation of Coal on the Area of Tuzla Basin (Bosnia and Herzegovina)	GEOGRAPHICA PANNONICA												The paper analyses, from a geographical aspect, consequences of the surface exploitation of coal on the area of Tuzla basin, and offers the comparison of the results achieved in the revitalization of exposed territories with some examples (the Rhine basin, Lusatia region etc). The surface exploitation of coal caused significant geomorphological and anthropogenic changes on the area of the Tuzla basin. They can be noticed particularly in the change of scenery by the creation of land-forms (open pits, slag heaps etc). Coal surface exploitation also includes the relocation of water flows, destruction of drinking water springs, soil and vegetation degradation, air pollution above the exploitation areas and in their surroundings, etc. Anthropogenic changes can be seen primarily in the relocation of settlements or parts of them, depopulation, relocation of roads, etc. For example, coal surface exploitation in the Tuzla basin so far resulted in the following: 785 million m(3) of waste material, 150 million tons of coal, 4400 ha of degraded land, 20 relocated villages or parts of them, 20 new anthropogenic lakes etc. The Law on Mining of the Federal Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Statute on long-term programs and mining projects (which broadly covers the exploitation of mineral resources and the environment protection) have obliged coalmines to re-cultivate the degraded surface. According to these legal regulations the re-cultivation of the degraded soil on the territory of the Tuzla basin started at the end of 1970s and so far around 800 ha have been re-cultivated.																			0354-8724	1820-7138					2009	13	2					32	40		10.5937/GeoPan0902032S	http://dx.doi.org/10.5937/GeoPan0902032S													WOS:000421029600001
J	Wilcox, EJ; Wolfe, BB; Marsh, P				Wilcox, Evan J.; Wolfe, Brent B.; Marsh, Philip			Assessing the influence of lake and watershed attributes on snowmelt bypass at thermokarst lakes	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Snow represents the largest potential source of water for thermokarst lakes, but the runoff generated by snowmelt (freshet) can flow beneath lake ice and via the outlet without mixing with and replacing pre-snowmelt lake water. Although this phenomenon, called "snowmelt bypass", is common in ice-covered lakes, it is unknown which lake and watershed properties cause variation in snowmelt bypass among lakes. Understanding the variability of snowmelt bypass is important because the amount of freshet that is mixed into a lake affects the hydrological and biogeochemical properties of the lake. To explore lake and watershed attributes that influence snowmelt bypass, we sampled 17 open-drainage thermokarst lakes for isotope analysis before and after snowmelt. Isotope data were used to estimate the amount of lake water replaced by freshet and to observe how the water sources of lakes changed in response to the freshet. Among the lakes, a median of 25.2 % of lake water was replaced by freshet, with values ranging widely from 5.2 % to 52.8 %. For every metre that lake depth increased, the portion of lake water replaced by freshet decreased by an average of 13 %, regardless of the size of the lake's watershed. The thickness of the freshet layer was not proportional to maximum lake depth, so that a relatively larger portion of pre-snowmelt lake water remained isolated in deeper lakes. We expect that a similar relationship between increasing lake depth and greater snowmelt bypass could be present at all ice-covered open-drainage lakes that are partially mixed during the freshet. The water source of freshet that was mixed into lakes was not exclusively snowmelt but a combination of snowmelt mixed with rain-sourced water that was released as the soil thawed after snowmelt. As climate warming increases rainfall and shrubification causes earlier snowmelt timing relative to lake ice melt, snowmelt bypass may become more prevalent, with the water remaining in thermokarst lakes post-freshet becoming increasingly rainfall sourced. However, if climate change causes lake levels to fall below the outlet level (i.e., lakes become closed-drainage), more freshet may be retained by thermokarst lakes as snowmelt bypass will not be able to occur until lakes reach their outlet level.

J	Sergio, F; Newton, I				Sergio, F; Newton, I			Occupancy as a measure of territory quality	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Territory quality may affect individual fitness and contribute to density-dependent reproduction, with repercussions on population regulation. We investigated the probable causes and population consequences of spatio-temporal variations in territory quality, measured by occupancy, in eight black kite Milvus migrans Boddaert populations, one of them studied for 10 years (Lake Lugano) and the rest for 4-5 years. 2. Over a period of years, the occupation rate of territories varied from a random pattern. Some territories were preferred while others were avoided. On return from migration, males and females settled earlier on high-occupancy territories. 3. The positive association between territory occupancy and breeding performance held in all years of study at Lake Lugano, and in six of seven tested populations. As a result, high-occupancy territories contributed most of the young produced by each population. 4. The occupation rate of the overall 225 territories was related positively to food availability and negatively to mortality risk, measured as proximity to the nearest eagle owl Bubo bubo Linnaeus nest. 5. At the population level, spatial variation in mean occupancy was positively correlated with spatial variation in mean productivity, suggesting that mean occupancy could be used as a measure of overall habitat quality and population performance. 6. In the Lake Lugano area, a higher proportion of low quality territories was occupied in years of higher density and annual productivity was related negatively to its coefficient of variation. However, annual productivity was not related significantly to the proportion of low quality territories occupied, so support for the theory of site-dependent population regulation was only partial. 7. In a review of 22 studies of territory occupancy in 17 species, occupancy always deviated from a random pattern in species in which it was tested and was always correlated with productivity and/or with some other measure of territory quality. Our results confirm the importance of prioritizing conservation of high quality territories. Occupancy may be a reliable method of quality assessment, especially for populations in which not all territories are always occupied, or for species in which checking occupancy is easier than finding nests.

After a few historical notes on the early surveys of the Anticosti flora, the author lists in their natural order the different spp. of Carex occurring on the island, with distr. and references, for each. x C. saxeni (C. palacea Wahl. x C. recta Boott.) and x C. josephi-schmittii (C. intumescens var. fernaldii x C. retrorsa) are descr. In the 3d part, the author gives some phytogeographical conclusions. The sedges enumerated fall in the following categories (1) Arctic-alpine spp. at their southernmost limit or nearly so, (2) euryatlantic spp., i.e., spp. occurring on both sides of the Atlantic, but very often with their main area in Europe, (3) spp. of the upper subarctic, (4) spp. of the lower subarctic, (5) cold-temperate spp. at their northernmost limit, and (6) halophytic spp. A line drawn from Anticosti island to Lake Mistassini and James Bay seems to constitute an important natural limit for many spp. in the flora of Quebec. Special consideration is given to the members of the critical section Extensae (the flava-group) and their numerous hybrids. The general conclusion is that Anticosti belongs to the colder part of the temperate zone, with arctic or subarctic "islands" on the river flats, on wind-swept cliffs, or in bogs. A few notes are given on the economic value of sedges as pasture and their relation to deer-grazing.																			0366-7405						1950	28	4					406	444		10.1139/cjr50c-024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjr50c-024													WOS:A1950XW67000002

In this research, macrozoobenthos, and surface water and sediment heavy metal (Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cd, and As) samples were collected from 23 sites in the upper and middle reaches of the Heihe River in the summers of 2019-2020. The interrelationships between heavy metals and macrozoobenthos were analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA), and the contamination level and potential ecological risk of the heavy metals in surface water and sediments were assessed by comprehensive pollution index (WQI), single potential ecological risk index (E-r(i)), and sediment quality guideline-quotient (SQG-Q), respectively. The results showed that the level of heavy metal pollution in the surface water of the Heihe River was extremely low, but the contents of Mn and Pb exceeded the third class of surface water environmental quality standards (GB 3838-2002). The spatial distribution of heavy metals in surface sediments were significantly different, and the average concentration of 8 heavy metals exceeded the background values of Gansu Province. Meanwhile, the pollution level of heavy metals in surface sediments was high pollution, and the ecological risk level was moderate risk. Combining E-r(i) and SQG-Q evaluations showed that Cd, Ni, and Cr were the main ecological risk factors. In addition, the distribution coefficients of Cr and Cd were low, indicating that Cr and Cd were easily released from the surface sediments, causing secondary pollution. In terms of the source of the heavy metals, Cu, As, Zn, Cr, and Ni mainly came from industrial and agricultural wastewaters, Pb was from the mining industry and natural sources, and Mn and Cd mainly came from tailings and their landfill leachate. Basommatophora and Araneae can be used as potential indicator organisms for heavy metal pollution in surface water, and Basommatophora, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Araneae can be used as indicator species for heavy metal pollution in surface sediments. The study showed that macroinvertebrate community characteristics had a sensitive response to heavy metals in the surface waters and sediments of the Heihe River, which can be used to evaluate the pollution status of heavy metals in inland rivers.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2022	29	23					35253	35268		10.1007/s11356-022-18663-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18663-8		JAN 2022						35060050					WOS:000744997500005
J	Xu, HF; Dong, B; Xu, ZL; Ma, JJ; Shen, F				Xu, Haifeng; Dong, Bin; Xu, Zhili; Ma, Jinji; Shen, Fei			Study on habitat suitability and ecological network of rare cranes in Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve (PLNNR) is the most important reserve for wintering migratory birds in the Poyang Lake basin. The analysis of the spatial distribution of rare crane habitats and their response mechanisms to environmental variables is crucial for the conservation and restoration of both species and habitats. This study focuses on the rare crane species in the PLNNR, including Siberian Cranes (Grus leucogeranus), Hooded Cranes (Grus monacha), White-naped Cranes (Grus vipio) and Common Cranes (Grus grus). Based on occurrence data and environmental variables, the Maximum Entropy (Maxent) model was used to analyze the habitat suitability of the four crane species and to discuss their response mechanisms to key environmental variables. In addition, an ecological network was constructed for the four crane species using circuit theory and the Minimum Cumulative Resistance (MCR) model. The research results indicated that the highly suitable habitats for the four crane species were distributed along the edges of lake wetlands, with an area ranging from 63.97 to 128.21 km2, accounting for 15.31 to 30.69 %. The unsuitable areas were located in Wucheng town and along the waterways, with each area exceeding 25 %. Land use types, including reed beach, mudflat, waters, and cultivated land, were the main factors influencing crane habitat, with a contribution rate ranging from 15.9 to 36.3 %. In addition, the significant environmental variables varied among crane species. For the Siberian Crane, key factors included distance from grassland, aspect of slope, and distance from water. The Hooded Crane was primarily influenced by distance from water. The White-naped Crane was significantly affected by distance from grassland, cultivated land, and waterways. For the Common Crane, distance from water and construction land were the main influencing factors. Ecological networks were constructed for the four crane species and the PLNNR. The ecological network of the PLNNR consisted of 9 ecological sources, 13 ecological corridors, and 27 ecological nodes. Overall, the construction of the ecological network in the PLNNR was superior to that of individual crane species.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				MAY	2025	174								113480	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113480		APR 2025											WOS:001475975200001
J	Pereira, IM; Botelho, SA; Machado, ELM; Silveira, CJA				Pereira, Israel Marinho; Botelho, Soraya Alvarenga; Mendonca Machado, Evandro Luiz; Andrade Silveira, Carlos Jose			Tree species occurring on ariparian slope and correlations with soil variables in the upper Grande River, Minas Gerais, Brazil	CIENCIA RURAL												Historically, forest landscapes have been modified by human activities, causing its destruction and fragmentation to exploit its resources. However, forests play a vital role in protecting the environment, especially on slops, hilltops, lakes, springs and river banks. This study aimed to understand the diversity and structure of vegetation on a slope of riparian forest in Bocaina de Minas, MG and identify key environmental variables that influence the spatial distribution of individual trees. An inventory of the tree community was conducted, in which ten of 10mx40m plots were allocated and systematically distributed throughout the study area. All individuals existing shrubs and trees within the plots with 1.30m diameter >= 5.0cm of soil were sampled in order to generate information on the horizontal structure, richness and diversity of the community. Variables related to the substrata were obtained for each plot from the topography and laboratory analysis of soil samples (pH, levels of P, K, Ca, Mg and Al, base saturation (V), organic matter and levels of sand, silt and clay). Other variables such as distance from the river and successional stage of the plots, were also evaluated. In order to correlate environmental variables with the abundance distribution of the species, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Spearman correlation were used. The Shannon diversity index (H') and evenness index (J') obtained were 3.53 and 0.76, respectively. The emerging patterns of environmental variables and the abundance of species indicate that these were distributed throughout the fragment, mainly due to the P content in soil and successional stage of the plots. In addition, several species have produced significant correlations between their abundance in the plots and the variables related to successional stage, variations in soil, and distance from the banks of water courses.					; Alvarenga Botelho, Soraya/HLW-6767-2023; Machado, Evandro/HLG-3731-2023	Machado, Evandro Luiz Mendonca/0000-0002-9301-5257; Alvarenga Botelho, Soraya/0000-0003-4178-465X; Pereira, Israel/0000-0003-1035-1253; 													0103-8478	1678-4596				DEC	2012	42	12					2192	2198		10.1590/S0103-84782012005000092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S0103-84782012005000092													WOS:000312032400014
J	Zou, FX; Wang, BZ				Fuxia, Zou; Bizhe, Wang			Research on allocation efficiency of ecological tourism resources in Hunan Province	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												The exploration of approaches of efficiency improvement for the ecotourism resource allocation is conducive to the sustainable use of ecotourism resources and the high-quality development of the tourism industry. The unbalanced and inadequate utilization of ecological tourism resources in Hunan Province has seriously affected the resource allocation efficiency and sustainable utilization. In light of this, data in 2005-2017 were adopted in this paper as the sample, and the input-output theory in economics was used as the basis to measure the ecological resource allocation efficiencies of Hunan Province's four major tourism circles, as well as the tourism industries across 14 cities and prefectures within the extended HK model. In light of this, this study adopted as the sample the data of Hunan Province's four major tourism circles, as well as the tourism industries across 14 cities and prefectures between 2005 and 2017. The ecological resource allocation efficiencies of these areas were then computed based on the economic input-output theory using the extended HK model. The results show that the degree of ecotourism resource mismatch varies from region to region in Hunan Province. In terms of potential TFP benefits, it can be divided into three levels: "high mismatch area," "moderate mismatch area," and "low mismatch area." Among the four major regions, Daxiangxi region fell within the high mismatch region, Huandongting Lake and Daxiangnan regions within the moderate mismatch regions, whereas the Changzhutan region within the low mismatch region. Moreover, out of the 14 cities and prefectures, Yongzhou, Shaoyang, Xiangxizhou, Yiyang, and Loudi were high mismatch areas, whereas Zhuzhou, Huaihua, Chenzhou, Xiangtan, and Yueyang were moderately mismatched regions, and Hengyang, Zhangjiajie, Changde, and Changsha were low mismatch areas. From the above distribution, it could be observed that the higher the degree of resource misallocation was, the lower the allocation efficiency would be. Therefore, each region was suggested to optimize resource allocation and improve its efficiency from the perspective of marginal cost-benefit.					wang, bizhe/ABA-8567-2021														1387-585X	1573-2975				NOV	2022	24	11					12813	12832		10.1007/s10668-021-01965-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01965-1		JAN 2022											WOS:000737762000011
J	Kurz, H; Demaree, D				Kurz, H; Demaree, D			Cypress buttresses and knees in relation to water and air	ECOLOGY												In 1929 and 1930, the water level of Reelfoot Lake, Tennessee, fell considerably below normal. As a result cypress (Taxodium) buttresses were unmasked. Surprisingly enough, the trunk segments below the normal water line disclosed no more excessive growth in diam. than the segment definitely above the normal water level. That is, buttress formation in the deep waters of this lake is confined only to the zone of normal water level fluctuation. The segment of the trunk above the buttress is normal in diam. because it is always aerated but seldom hydrated. The diam. of the segment below the buttress is normal because it is nearly always hydrated but rarely aerated. Between these 2 segments is the zone of normal water level, some particular horizon of which is nearly always contacted by water plus air. This is the zone of buttress formation. The profiles of buttresses are the curves that express the relative total time that the various horizons are simultaneously subjected to aerated water or hydrated air. E.g., if a conical buttress is turned 90[degree], the profile of any side makes a straight line curve which may be used to express the proportional total time or amount that a given horizon has been contacted by water plus air. It will be seen that the characteristic cypress buttresses of a given habitat offer profiles or curves by which can be estimated the relative stability or fluctuation of water level, as well as the max, depths of bodies of water. Cypress knees are also considered reactions to water plus air.

Thiamine Content of Eggs and Lengths of Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in Relation to Abundance of Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) in Eastern Lake Ontario, 2003 to 2006	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Early mortality syndrome in fry of Great Lakes salmonines is linked to reduced levels of thiamine in eggs, which reflects maternal consumption of forage fishes such as alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) that contain thiaminase, an enzyme that destroys thiamine. We assessed annual variations in abundance and condition of alewives and thiamine status of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in Lake Ontario. We analyzed total thiamine in eggs of 20 coho salmon collected annually between 2003 and 2006 at the Salmon River Hatchery on the Salmon River, New York. Alewife abundance was assessed annually in southern and eastern Lake Ontario with bottom trawls during late April and early May. Mean thiamine concentration in eggs varied annually, with those collected in 2003 (2.5 nmol/g) being significantly higher than those collected in 2004 to 2006 (1.5 to 1.7 nmol/g). Although we did not test survival of fry, if reported threshold levels of thiamine for preventing mortality of Lake Michigan coho salmon fry apply, then many or most Lake Ontario coho salmon produced fry were likely to incur thiamine-deficiency mortality, especially during years 2004 to 2006. Comparison to indices of annual abundance of alewife in Lake Ontario with thiamine concentration in coho salmon eggs failed to show any significant Correlations (P > 0.05). However, total length of female spawning coho salmon was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with increasing condition and estimated energy content of adult alewives in the previous spring. These results suggest that growth of coho salmon in Lake Ontario was first limited by energy intake, whereas the amount of thiamine provided by alewives was sufficient for growth (in length) but not for producing thiamine-adequate eggs.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2009	24	2					247	254		10.1080/02705060.2009.9664289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2009.9664289													WOS:000265956400008

Based on the lacustrine landform, and by using the lake hydrologic model, this study quantitatively reconstructed precipitation and lake areas during the early to middle Holocene in the MUD. The results revealed the following: 1) A total of 127 paleolakes existed in the closed drainage area during the early to middle Holocene. The area of paleolakes was 896.1 km(2), which is 2.96 times that of modern lakes. The relative height between the highstand and the modern lake surface is similar to 5-9 m. 2) Precipitation during the early to middle Holocene decreased from 550 mm in the southeast to 350 mm in the northwest. The 400 mm isohyet moved 130-170 km to the northwest, roughly coincident with the modern 250 mm isohyet. 3) The relative increase in precipitation was similar to 32-60%, and the increase in the west was significantly higher than in the east. The precipitation gradient in much of the MUD was lower than the present. The results show that the monsoon edge area and monsoon rain belt migrated to the northwest during the early to middle Holocene. The MUD was stably dominated by the EASM. Data also showed that the spatio-temporal pattern of the climate during the early to middle Holocene was relatively humid with a decreased precipitation gradient for millennia.																				2296-6463				MAR 2	2022	10								850633	10.3389/feart.2022.850633	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.850633													WOS:000773035400001
J	Lee, CL; Chen, HY; Chuang, MY				Lee, CL; Chen, HY; Chuang, MY			Use of oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and ambient water to assess metal pollution status of the charting coastal area, Taiwan, after the 1986 green oyster incident	CHEMOSPHERE												Most of the oyster mariculture beds in Taiwan are in areas located along the west of the island. One of these areas is the Charting coast, where green oysters were found in 1986. During this incident, which became internationally notorious, mass mortality occurred in the Charting oyster beds. After this discovery, measures were taken by the authorities to counter pollution which lead to the problem. The effectiveness of these pollution control actions was evaluated in this study. Two water column indicators, particulate and sediment, and oysters were sampled and analyzed for metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni) in Charting and its neighboring areas, Kuen-Shen Lake and Shin-Da Harbor, and the control area/station; Dah-Pen Wan. The current study shows that copper and zinc concentrations in both oysters and particulates significantly decreased in the Charting area, compared with concentrations found during the period of the green oyster incident. Six years after the incident, the copper concentration in oysters had fallen from a high of 4400 mu g/g dry weight to an average of 300+/-69 mu g/g dry weight, figures similar to the copper concentration in 1982. The pollution control actions taken after the incident are believed to be the cause of this recovery of the coastal environment. Nevertheless, Charting still produced oysters with the highest copper and zinc concentrations among the areas investigated. Further measures currently being taken by the government, including removing the sediment of some portions of Erhjin Chi, should be able to bring the oyster copper concentrations down to the levels similar to those observed in the neighboring area, (average concentration below 200 mu g/g dry weight or all time maximum concentration below 500 mu g/g dry weight).

J	Lilach, G; Yonaton, G				Lilach, Gonen; Yonaton, Goldsmith			Middle Eastern cloud distillation throughout the Holocene-Quantified using oxygen isotopes from speleothems and deep-sea cores	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Middle East is considered a climate change "hot spot", where rainfall is expected to decline in the upcoming decades due to Global Warming. Reconstructing the long-term natural climate variability of this region is critical for understanding and contextualizing the current hydroclimate change and enables evaluating potential mechanisms that govern it. Oxygen isotopes (818O) from cave deposits are a highresolution paleohydrological proxy, which previously has been interpreted as direct measures of rainfall amount. However, cave 818O is controlled by a series of processes (e.g., evaporation, condensation and rainout history), and therefore, any paleohydrological interpretation using cave 818O requires a thorough understanding and quantification of the full hydrological cycle. In this paper, we use a simple Rayleigh distillation model to assess the various processes that govern the isotopic composition of precipitation and quantify changes in cloud distillation during the Holocene throughout the Middle East. The results show that a west-east isotopic distillation gradient persisted throughout the Holocene in the Middle East. The early Holocene, coeval with Sapropel 1, was characterized by high distillation and a large west-east distillation gradient. At the end of sapropel 1, distillation dropped and the west-east gradient declined. The middle to late Holocene was characterized by a gradual increase in distillation, however the westeast distillation gradient continued declining. Similarity between the late Holocene distillation reconstruction and the Dead Sea lake-levels, strengthens the reliability of cloud distillation as a suitable hydroclimate proxy. These results show that periods of high distillation in the Levant occurred during both high and low summer insolation (early and late Holocene, respectively), and thus, were most likely the result of two different climatic mechanisms. Our distillation and distillation gradient records provide a new way to characterize the long-term natural climate variability in the Middle East and thus help resolve the climatic mechanisms governing this variability.

Bream (Abramis brama L.), white bream (Blicca bjoerkna L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) made up 75% of the total cyprinid biomass, with wild carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) as the remaining 25%. The introduced fish spawned successfully. The high (above 300 kg/ha) planktivorous and benthivorous fish stocks resulted in several qualitative and quantitative alterations of the food chain structure in our simulation pond experiments. These alterations must primarily be assigned to changes caused by both the zooplanktivory and benthivory nature of the stocked fish populations. At the higher levels of fish biomass, Secchi depth was influenced significantly by chlorophyll-a concentration. Most of the variance in suspended solids concentration could be explained by the biomass ratio of the mature benthivorous fish. There was a clear shift in algal cell size in the ponds with the higher fish stocks: ponds with more fish had larger cells later in the summer. The relative influence of young cyprinid fish on crustaceans species composition and biomass, and mature populations on benthic fauna abundance and biomass, was sufficiently greater at higher (300-500 kg/ha) fish stock rates.

A step reduction in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration within the effluent (5 to 13 fold) was observed from several STWs discharging to the river in the mid-2000s. This translated to over halving of SRP concentrations within the lower Kennet. Lower Kennet SRP concentrations change from being highest under base-flow to highest under storm-flow conditions. This represented a major shift from direct effluent inputs to a within-catchment source dominated system characteristic of the upper part to the catchment. Average SRP concentrations in the lower Kennet reduced over time towards the target for good water quality. Critically, there was no corresponding reduction in chlorophyll-a concentration, the waters remaining eutrophic when set against standards for lakes. Following the up gradient input of the main water and SRP source (Wilton Water), SRP concentrations in the canal reduced down gradient to below detection limits at times near its junction with the Kennet downstream. However, chlorophyll concentrations in the canal were in an order of magnitude higher than in the river. This probably resulted from long water residence times and higher temperatures promoting progressive algal and suspended sediment generations that consumed SRP. The canal acted as a point source for sediment, algae and total phosphorus to the river especially during the summer months when boat traffic disturbed the canal's bottom sediments and the locks were being regularly opened. The short-term dynamics of this transfer was complex. For the canal and the supply source at Wilton Water, conditions remained hypertrophic when set against standards for lakes even when SRP concentrations were extremely low. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Lake systems in mountain borders of the Great Lakes Basin of Mongolia: From Pleistocene catastrophes to Holocene gradual evolution (case study from southwestern Tuva)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Workshop on Palaeohydrological Extreme Events - Evidence and Archives (EX-AQUA)	SEP 26-OCT 01, 2016	Padova, ITALY					The paper presents results of integrated geological, geomorphological, geochronological, and geoarchaeological studies in the basin of Lake Ak-Hol located in southwestern Tuva (Russia), in mountains north of the Great Lakes Basin of Mongolia. The Pleistocene-Holocene history of the basin consisted of several stages recorded in terrain and deposition patterns. The highest stand of Lake Ak-Hol (180m above the present level and 16 times greater area) was due to an ice dam and was coeval to the appearance of organic matter (remnants of higher aquatic plants and algae) in lake sediments about 14 ka cal BP. At the next stage, the lake was impounded by a moraine dam. C-14 ages of buried soils indicate that the level of the ice- and moraine-dammed lake fell to below 222m asl long before 8.5 ka cal BP. Erosion of the moraine dam may correspond to the event of lake drying about 12 ka cal BP evident from a deposition gap in sedimentary cores. That event of sudden drainage may have been the last catastrophic flood into the Great Lakes Basin traceable in the catchment of the Mogen-Buren River. Judging from the obtained C-14 ages of sediments from the Mogen-Buren Valley, ice- and moraine-dammed lakes in the Ak-Hol system underwent cataclysmic outburst floods only before 11.6 ka cal BP. In the Holocene, after the moraine dam failure, the lake level changes were controlled solely by climate. The general decreasing trend was repeatedly interrupted by high stand excursions (up to 15m of relative level rise). Nomad peoples settled on the floor of the highland Ak-Hol basin since the Late Bronze Age. All archaeological sites (from that time to the time of Turkic cultures) mapped in the basin are located above 2220m asl and lack signatures of water erosion, indicating that the lake never rose above that altitude for the past 3 ka years.

J	Och, LM; Müller, B; März, C; Wichser, A; Vologina, EG; Sturm, M				Och, Lawrence M.; Mueller, Beat; Marz, Christian; Wichser, Adrian; Vologina, Elena G.; Sturm, Michael			Elevated uranium concentrations in Lake Baikal sediments: Burial and early diagenesis	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The water column of Lake Baikal (Siberia) is pervasively oxic and O-2 penetrates several cm into the sediment, followed by distinct layers of Fe/Mn oxide that undergo reductive-dissolution/oxidative-precipitation cycles. Uranium (U) contents of the oxic surface sediment layers were similar to 15 mu g g(-1), which is unparalleled in oxygenated lakes. To understand the processes leading to this enrichment we investigated the geochemical composition of the particulate matter and pore water of four sediment cores from different locations in the lake and performed mass balance calculations based on sediment mass accumulation rates and published loads from major tributaries. The comparison of loads and export of U in Lake Baikal suggested that current estimates of loads are too low by a factor of about 3 compared to sediment mass accumulation rates. Peak loads during spring ice melt in tributaries that are difficult to monitor and quantify might be the main cause for the deviation. The high U concentrations in the lake sediments originated from the scavenging of U in the water column through association with settling organic particles and particulate Fe(III)- and, to a lesser extent, Mn(IV)-oxides. We outline the hypothesis that two distinct U phases, lithogenic and non-lithogenic U reach the lake sediment and that authigenic U is subsequently formed under reducing conditions within the sediment. In some cores we found that most U was remobilized during the degradation of organic matter, in particular within the top oxygenated layer of the sediment. Significant enrichments prevailed due to U adsorption to and/or co-precipitation with Fe-oxides. When Fe-oxides and, to a lesser extent, Mn-oxides were reductively dissolved, they released U to the pore water, leading to peak dissolved U concentrations in the anoxic sediment, which in turn, precipitated as authigenic U under predominantly sulphate-reducing conditions. The onset of the accumulation of authigenic U coincided with the formation of distinct Fe/Mn oxide layers above. We argue that the resilience of Fe-oxides (especially crystalline goethite and hematite), in association with phosphate, even within reducing (but non-sulfidic) sediments support the burial of substantial amounts of U.

Consequently, range-restricted species inhabiting Arctic freshwater ecosystems, where global warming is most pronounced, face the challenge of coping with changing abiotic and biotic conditions or risk extinction. Here, we use an extensive fish community and environmental dataset for 1762 lakes sampled across Scandinavia (mid-1990s) to evaluate the climate vulnerability of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), the world's most cold-adapted and northernly distributed freshwater fish. Machine learning models show that abiotic and biotic factors strongly predict the occurrence of Arctic char across the region with an overall accuracy of 89 percent. Arctic char is less likely to occur in lakes with warm summer temperatures, high dissolved organic carbon levels (i.e., browning), and presence of northern pike (Esox lucius). Importantly, climate warming impacts are moderated by habitat (i.e., lake area) and amplified by the presence of competitors and/or predators (i.e., northern pike). Climate warming projections under the RCP8.5 emission scenario indicate that 81% of extant populations are at high risk of extirpation by 2080. Highly vulnerable populations occur across their range, particularly near the southern range limit and at lower elevations, with potential refugia found in some mountainous and coastal regions. Our findings highlight that range shifts may give way to range contractions for this cold-water specialist, indicating the need for pro-active conservation and mitigation efforts to avoid the loss of Arctic freshwater biodiversity. This study assesses the climate vulnerability of Arctic char across Scandinavian lakes. Using extensive datasets, it shows that warming temperatures, increased dissolved organic carbon, and the presence of competitors and predators like northern pike pose significant threats to Arctic char populations. Climate warming projections suggest that a large majority of populations are at risk of extirpation by the century's end under high emissions scenarios. Pro-active conservation efforts are needed to prevent the loss of this cold-water specialist and preserve Arctic freshwater biodiversity.image					Perrin, Sam/ABG-6903-2020; Finstad, Anders Gravbrot/H-6519-2015; Hessen, Dag/AFI-5448-2022; Vøllestad, Leif/H-7305-2019; Finstad, Anders/H-6519-2015	Finstad, Anders Gravbrot/0000-0003-4529-6266; Perrin, Sam Wenaas/0000-0002-1266-1573; Cline, Timothy/0000-0002-4955-654X; Muhlfeld, Clint/0000-0002-4599-4059; Vollestad, Leif Asbjorn/0000-0002-9389-7982; Whited, Diane/0000-0002-6255-715X													1354-1013	1365-2486				JUL	2024	30	7							e17387	10.1111/gcb.17387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17387								38971982					WOS:001263532700001

During recent decades several hydrological and land-use changes in the watershed have increasingly threatened the conservation of the lagoon due to the development of urban areas, tourism and agriculture. A dynamic system model has been developed at the watershed scale to estimate the annual load of nutrients reaching the Mar Menor-associated wetlands. At present, mean annual loadings of approximately 2000 tonnes of nitrogen and 60 tonnes of phosphorus are delivered to the lagoon. The simulation results emphasize the role of heavy rainfall events and floods in the formation of the total nutrient load. The composition of aquatic bird communities has been used to assess the nutrient impact on the lagoon food-web. The Great Crested Grebe is apparently the species most closely dependant on local trophic conditions. The related Black-necked Grebe, that dominates the waterbird plays a similar role, but its more opportunistic response to changes in food community of the lagoon resources, reduces its indicator value. The abundance of the two species of grebes seems to closely track the nitrogen load curve, especially during the first phase of enrichment, suggesting the existence of a direct trophic relationship. In the following phase, jellyfish blooms coincide with the bird decline. Jellyfishes seem to have a buffering effect towards nutrients, determining a bottom up limitation to other trophic compartments. In recent years, this buffering capacity has probably been overloaded, favouring the growth of new food resources available to the grebes. Unlike grebes, Mergus serrator, a typical piscivorous bird, does not seem to be affected positively by eutrophication since it shows a long-term stability in numbers or even a slight decline. Since this suspected decline would parallel a Iona-term reduction of fish catches, the species could be regarded as a potential indicator of habitat deterioration.

Phosphate uptake kinetics and uptake rates were calculated for planktonic (phytoplankton and bacterioplankton) and benthic (epiphyton and epipelon) assemblages in a large, shallow, subtropical lake. Samples were taken bimonthly over the period of 1 year at three different sites to examine spatial and temporal variability in these processes. 2. Two of the sites, located at the edge of the Littoral zone next to the open water (ecotone sites), had low irradiance at the sediment surface and high total phosphorus (TP) concentration (annual mean TP = 112 mu g L-1). The third site,located in the littoral marsh zone, had high irradiance at the sediment surface and Low TP concentration (annual mean TP = 7 mu g L-1). 3. Based on P-32-PO4 turnover time, P availability varied temporally and spatially. At the two high TP ecotone sites, P concentration was lowest in July and August. At the low TP marsh site, P Limited algal production throughout the year. 4. The quotient of maximum uptake rate to half saturation constant (V-m/K-s) in the plankton increased by over two orders of magnitude during the P-limited (summer) period at the two ecotone sites, suggesting that plankton used the scarce phosphorus more efficiently. The specific uptake rate of plankton was significantly greater than that of periphyton at all sites, suggesting that the plankton were more efficient than periphyton at taking up phosphate. 5. Periphyton biomass, as well as absolute and percentage P uptake rate, was greater at the marsh site than at the ecotone sites, despite the lower P concentrations in the marsh. This was probably a result of rapid nutrient cycling, combined with high Light availability in the marsh.					; Hwang, Sunjin/AAK-7149-2020; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014	Hwang, Soon-Jin/0000-0001-7083-5036; Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305													0046-5070					DEC	1998	40	4					729	745		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.d01-660.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.d01-660.x													WOS:000077818600011

These are the Lembolovskoye Lake section located in the southern part of the Karelian Ithmus and the Mshinskoye bog section located in the southwestern part of the Leningrad province. The data obtained allow us to reconstruct the main features of the vegetation cover evolution, the chronology for the appearance and a real distribution of the main arboreal species from the south of the Leningrad province to the north, and to construct curves of the paleoclimate parameter changes for the area under study. Thirty-six C-14 dates were obtained for the Lembolovskoye Lake section (7 m thick). According to those dates, the organic gyttja formation in the lake began 9870 +/- 170 BP. Spore-pollen spectra with high percentage of herbs, arborescent, and shrub-birch dated back to the Younger Dryas were found out in clay layers at a depth of 6.5 m. An appearance of spruce and alder pollen is dated at 6860 +/- 120 and 7510 +/- 150 BP, respectively. The maximal percentage of broad-leaved species falls on the first half of the Atlantic (AT-1). Thirty-two dates were obtained for the Mshinskoye bog section (6 m thick): from 60 +/- 70 to 9520 +/- 170 BP (the last date fixed the beginning of peat formation); 12 palinozones from the Preboreal to the Subatlantic were recognized there. The spruce and alder pollen began to appear 7520 +/- 110 and 7670 +/- 130 BP, respectively. The maximal amount of broad-leaved species is observed at 4690 +/- 80 BP. The detailed reconstruction of changes in vegetation communities during the Late Glacial and Holocene was correlated with paleoclimatic characteristics, which have been reconstructed for the sections under study by using the information from a statistical method of spore-pollen data processing.

Most of the samples were collected in the summit area of the volcano around the Santiago crater, and two samples, representative of the local background, were collected at a 4.3 km upwind site. Samples from the summit are very acidic with pH down to 2.14 and contain large amounts of volcanogenic elements that can be clearly distinguished from the local background. These elements are released into the atmosphere from the continuously degassing lava lake of the Santiago crater, Masaya volcano. The emissions result in a volcanic plume that includes solid particles, acidic droplets, and gaseous species. The plume-rain interaction imprints the chemical signature of the volcanic emissions in falling raindrops. The most acidic gases (e.g. HCl and HI) readily dissolve in water, and so their ratio in rain samples reflects that of the volcanic plume. The transport of HF is mediated by the large amount of silicate particles generated at the lava-air interface. SO2 is only partially converted into H2SO4 that dissolves in water. The refractory elements dissolved in rain samples derive from the dissolution of silicate particles, and most of them (Al, Mg, Ca, Fe, Be, Ti, Mn, and Sr) are present at exactly the same molar ratios as in the rocks as well as rare earth elements (REEs). By contrast, Li, Na, K, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Cd, Sb, Te, Cs, Tl, Pb, and Bi are enriched relative to the whole-rock composition, suggesting that they are volatilized during magma degassing. After correcting for the dissolution of silicate particles, we can define the relative volatility of these elements. The comparison with other volcanoes on the Pb emissions highlights the effect of oxygen fugacity in determining its volatility.

The results showed that the TSP, PM2.5, and PM2.5-10 concentrations of particulate mass averaged 120.6, 38.1, and 24.2 mu g/m(3), respectively. In general, the ionic species of SO42-, NH4+, and NO3- were higher, being considered the major pollutants for traffic, suburban, rural, urban, and airport sampling sites in central Taiwan. Soil, secondary aerosol, and marine salt were the major pollutant sources at the Taichung harbor sampling site. In addition, the photochemical gas-phase oxidation is the predominant formation mechanism during summer at suburban and urban sampling sites. The secondary aerosol was the dominant factor responsible for this result for the traffic-sampling site. The results also reflected that the water-soluble ionic species in the coarse particulates occupied the major portions except for the ionic species of Na+ and Mg2+ at the Taichung airport sampling site in central Taiwan. Additionally, the results indicated that the sulfate has the highest average composition compared with the other ionic species in TSP and PM2.5 at this airport sampling site. Such information may be useful in forensic investigations at the studied site.																			1527-5922					MAR-JUN	2007	8	1-2					53	62		10.1080/15275920601180578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275920601180578													WOS:000245358000005

USDA has classified 27% of U.S. agricultural land as being highly erodible. Because of the erosion, rivers, lakes, and water table are contaminated due to the agriculture chemicals such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides contained in the runoff water. This is a serious environmental problem nationwide. It is well recognized that residue coverage on the soil surface can reduce soil erosion. The objective of this paper was to explore the potential of using ASTER data for soybean plant residue cover estimation. In the spring of 2004, personnel from Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) and Institute for Technology Development (ITD) did a traditional windshield survey in three Indiana Counties, Wabash, Huntington, and Grant. Fields with greater than 30% residue cover were classified as conservation tillage (no till); those with 16-30% residue cover as reduced tillage; and those with less than 15% residue cover as traditional tillage. ASTER data was collected over the study sites on April 14, 2004. Spectral infortnation was extracted from the ASTER image for statistical analysis. Field values for various indices were calculated from the reflectance data. Residue coverage estimation from the survey was used as the ground truth for the field. Analysis was performed to determine the capability of ASTER data to identify crop residue coverage. The initial results indicated that ASTER imagery has moderate capability to identify residue coverage - or tillage practice within the soybean fields.

Elasticity analysis is a means of assessing changes to lambda resulting from conservation initiatives. The elasticity of lambda to survival has a characteristic profile that includes a plateau of high elasticity values across the young of the year and the juvenile ages. However, survival elasticity falls at maturity and declines rapidly with increasing adult age. Changes to fecundity have relatively little impact; the total of the fecundity elasticities over all ages is equal to the single young-of-the-year survival elasticity. Even though the young-of-the-year survival elasticity is equal to that of any other juvenile age, the overall opportunity for affecting lambda is strongest in the young-of-the-year age-class because of its exceptional potential for increase to survival. The juvenile and adult stages have roughly equal total survival elasticities. These findings are particularly relevant in understanding the contributions of hatcheries, harvest regulations and habitat restoration as strategies for sturgeon conservation. Hatcheries are focused on the young of the year, the demographically most sensitive component of sturgeon life histories, and thus have the potential to make significant increases to lambda if the genetic, evolutionary and ecological impacts of hatcheries can be controlled. Harvest, even at low levels, can have a significant negative impact on lambda when it affects multiple age classes. Managers can use elasticity analysis to calculate the total impact of harvest and to mathematically evaluate the trade-off in exploiting young versus older individuals. Habitat restoration strategies, usually assessed in terms of survivals of the age classes impacted, would also benefit from using elasticity analysis to interpret their contributions to lambda. If restoration efforts target the survival of age classes with high elasticities, significant population growth may be achieved.

J	MATTY, JM; ANDERSON, JB; DUNBAR, RB				MATTY, JM; ANDERSON, JB; DUNBAR, RB			SUSPENDED SEDIMENT TRANSPORT, SEDIMENTATION, AND RESUSPENSION IN LAKE-HOUSTON, TEXAS - IMPLICATIONS FOR WATER-QUALITY	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY AND WATER SCIENCES												Lake Houston is a man-made reservoir located northeast of Houston, Texas. The purpose of this investigation was to document suspended sediment transport, sedimentation, and resuspension in the lake with a view towards estimating the influence of sedimentation on water quality. Sediment traps were placed in strategic locations in the lake to collect suspended sediments. Samples were analyzed for bulk density, grain size, organic carbon, and a number of trace elements. These data were analyzed along with meteorological data to examine those factors which regulate suspended sediment input and dispersal, and the role of suspended sediments in controlling water quality within the lake. Sediment input to the lake depends primarily on the intensity of rainfall in the watershed. Sediment movement within the lake is strongly influenced by wave activity, which resuspends sediments from shallow areas, and by wind-driven circulation. The increased residence time of suspended sediments due to resuspension allows greater decomposition of organic matter and the release of several trace elements from sediments to the water column. Virtually all samples from sediment traps suspended between 1 and 5 m above the lake bottom contain medium to coarse silt, and even some very fine sand-sized material. This implies that circulation in Lake Houston is periodically intense enough to transport this size material in suspension. During winter, northerly winds with sustained velocities of greater than 5 m/sec provide the most suitable condition for rapid (< 1 d) transport of suspended sediment down the length of the lake. Fluctuations in current velocities and the subsequent suspension/deposition of particles may explain variations in the abundance of coliform bacteria in Lake Houston.					; Anderson, John/B-1011-2012	Dunbar, Robert/0000-0002-9728-5609; 													0177-5146						1987	10	3					175	186		10.1007/BF02580473	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02580473													WOS:A1987K576500008
J	Aden, AH; Raymond, J; Giroux, B; Sanjuan, B				Hassan Aden, Abdek; Raymond, Jasmin; Giroux, Bernard; Sanjuan, Bernard			New Insights into Hydrothermal Fluid Circulation Affected by Regional Groundwater Flow in the Asal Rift, Republic of Djibouti	ENERGIES												The Asal Rift hosts a lake located in a depression at 150 m below sea level, where recharge is influenced by regional groundwater flow interacting with the Ghoubbet Sea along the coast of Djibouti. This regional groundwater flow is believed to influence hydrothermal fluid circulation, which we aim to better understand in this study, having the objective of developing concepts for geothermal exploration in the area. To this end, magnetotelluric data acquired in the Asal Rift were processed and analyzed. 1D inversion models of electrical conductivity were interpolated for interpretation. These data were then used to build a 2D hydrogeological model, allowing multiphase flow and heat transfer simulations to be performed, considering the regional groundwater flow near the surface and the site topography, in order to confirm the preferred path of fluid flow. Geophysical data analysis indicates the presence of normal faults, notably the H fault, which may act as a conduit for the circulation of hydrothermal fluids and where the hanging wall can be a hydrogeological barrier within the hydrothermal system of the Asal Rift. The results from the 2D numerical flow and heat transfer modelling show the importance of groundwater flow responsible for thermal springs located at the periphery of Asal Lake. Reservoir temperature inferred by means of geothermometry ranging from 200 to 270 degrees C was shown to correspond to simulated temperature at potential reservoir depth. Moreover, simulated temperature between 600 and 1700 m depth is close to the temperature profile measured in the geothermal well Asal 6 of the area, with less than 20 degrees C difference. Simulations indicate that hydrothermal fluid circulation is likely influenced by the regional groundwater flow controlled by the topography and the major water bodies, the Ghoubbet Sea and Asal Lake, feeding buoyant fluids interacting with a deep magmatic source and where tectonic activity created normal faults offering a preferred path for fluid circulation.					; Giroux, Bernard/AAG-1069-2019; SANJUAN, BERNARD/AAM-3450-2020	Raymond, Jasmin/0000-0002-7486-9185; 														1996-1073				FEB	2021	14	4							1166	10.3390/en14041166	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14041166													WOS:000623452200001
J	Helama, S; Arppe, L; Mielikäinen, K; Oinonen, M				Helama, Samuli; Arppe, Laura; Mielikainen, Kari; Oinonen, Markku			Arctic moistening provides negative feedbacks to riparian plants	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Arctic moistening will affect the circumpolar forested riparian ecosystems. Upward trends observed for precipitation in high latitudes illustrate that the moistening may be underway to influence the woody biomass production near the inland waters, lakes and streams with effects on carbon pools and fluxes. Although the flooding and waterlogging tolerance of seedlings has been investigated, our understanding of responses in mature trees is still limited. Here we employ tree-ring delta C-13 and width data from a subarctic riparian setting in Lapland, where artificially high lake level (HLL) has already altered the ecophysiological and growth responses of riparian Pinus sylvestris trees to external drivers under conditions simulating moister environment. Prior to the HLL event, the carbon assimilation rate was primarily limited by irradiance as reflected in the delta C-13 data and the radial growth of south-facing riparian trees remained increased in comparison to shaded upland trees. By contrast, the riparian trees were not similarly benefited during the HLL period when reduced assimilation depleted the riparian in comparison to upland delta C-13 despite of increased irradiance. As a result, the radial growth of riparian trees was markedly reduced over the HLL event while the upland trees benefited from increased irradiance and summer time warming. Although the production of biomass at high latitudes is commonly considered temperature-limited, our results highlight the increasing role of Arctic moistening to limit the growth when increased precipitation (cloudiness) reduces the incoming solar radiation in general and when the riparian habitat becomes increasingly waterlogged in particular. The effects of high-latitude warming to induce higher biomass productivity may be restricted by negative feedbacks.

The recent launch of Landsat 8 coupled with Geoscience Australia's recent reprocessing of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) archives over the whole of Australia to a consistent surface reflectance product enables sub continental scale spatio-temporal analysis of freshwater optical water quality in support of monitoring and decision making for water management agencies. In this research, we present an objective assessment of the potential of Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for monitoring inland water quality dynamics over a number of lakes and reservoirs with a range of optical water types in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. We used bio-optical modelling to develop sensor specific total suspended matter (TSM) retrieval algorithms that account for the difference in relative spectral response between Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI. We were able to compare the suitability of the different sensors for optical water quality measurements using water bodies that fell within Landsat path overlaps where Landsat images of surface reflectance were acquired within 24 h between Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ or Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI. These water bodies represent a range of hydrological and limnological conditions, and enabled us to assess: 1) the comparability of TSM measurements retrieved from each sensor, and 2) the surface reflectance to image noise characteristics of Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI. Comparisons of lake surface reflectance and noise equivalent reflectance difference show that the improved radiometric resolution and increased quantization of Landsat 8 OLI relative to Landsat 7 ETM+ significantly reduce image noise and spectral heterogeneity, indicating that Landsat 8 OLI data are expected to provide more precise water quality retrievals relative to Landsat 7 ETM+. We found that: 1) the TSM retrievals from the different sensors are highly comparable; 2) Landsat 5 TM overestimated TSM relative to Landsat 7 ETM+ by 6.4%; and 3) Landsat 7 ETM+ overestimated TSM relative to Landsat 8 OLI by only 1.4%. Retrieved TSM values were highly correlated with independent in situ data acquired within 24 h of satellite overpass (r = 0.99) with a mean average error of 14 mg/L. The results demonstrate that time series analysis of TSM retrievals can be conducted across a wide range of lakes at the sub-continental scale to characterise the multi-decadal TSM dynamics.

A total of six major and sub-zones are recognized according to the diatom fossil assemblages, and we discuss aquatic environmental change in Lake Kitaura mainly based on these diatom assemblage change. Zone Ia and Zone Ib (older than AD 1707) are marine to brackish. In Zone IIa (AD 1707-AD 1836), most of the brackish diatoms disappeared, and were replaced by freshwater species indicating a decrease in salinity. We interpret the salinity decrease in Zone I-IIa as a sea-level fall during the Little Ice Age. The salinity of the lake decreased to near freshwater conditions in Zone IIb (AD 1836-AD 1970), which could arise from alteration in River Tone or development of a sandspit in the mouth of River Tone in addition to sea-level change. In Zone IIIa (AD 1970-AD 1987), the diatom assemblage indicates a freshwater environment, and sedimentation rates increase rapidly. These changes reflect sedimentary environment change and an ecosystem transition due to the construction of the tide gate. In Zone IIIb (AD 1987-AD 2002), the diatom flux (valves cm(-2) y(-1)) increased and species composition changed. The changes in Zone IIIb show a good agreement with limnological monitoring data gathered from the lake. These paleolimnological data suggest that the recent human-induced changes of the aquatic environment of the lake after the 1970s exceed rates during the period concerned in this study.

Development of current ambient background threshold values for sediment quality parameters in US lakes on a regional and statewide basis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												For the first time, background threshold values have been developed for a large suite of sediment quality parameters from 969 lakes spanning the conterminous United States (U.S.). These values provide a statistical basis for estimating current ambient background, which refers to chemical and physical (e.g., grain size) concentrations derived from natural and/or widespread diffuse anthropogenic sources (e.g., nonpoint sources like atmospheric deposition and land runoff). Surficial sediment quality data, collected based on the randomized, probability-based sampling design of the 2017 National Lakes Assessment (NLA) study, were utilized for this effort. These data included 16 metal(loid)s, 25 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 53 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, 27 legacy organochlorine pesticides and metabolites, total organic carbon (TOC), and grain size parameters. The data were analyzed based on different geographic areas, including: 10 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regions, two major ecoregions bisecting the State of Minnesota (i.e., Temperate Plains and Upper Midwest), and for Minnesota. Hypothesis testing of 47 sediment quality parameters was performed on three geographic areas bisecting Minnesota, and there were many statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences between geographic pairs that included Minnesota. Background threshold values were calculated for parameters with >20% detects using 95% one-sided upper tolerance limit (UTL) with 95% coverage (UTL95-95) values. The UTL95-95 represents the value below which 95% of the population values are expected to fall with 95% confidence. These values were compared to matching sediment quality guidelines for the protection of benthic organisms, both with and without potential outliers removed. Applications and limitations of the UTL9595 values are discussed. Jurisdictions within the continental U.S. could use these same publicly available sediment quality data to calculate UTL95-95 values for specific geographic areas, and other countries could design similar probabilistic field studies to determine current ambient background of sediment quality parameters in lake sediments.

Cores collected from two small lakes in the foreland of Berendon Glacier and pits dug in a nearby fen record Little lee Age and older glacier advances. The first Little Ice Age advance in this area began more than 500 years ago and peaked in the early 17th century. An earlier Neoglacial advance began about 2800-3000 cal yr ago and may have lasted for hundreds of years. There is also evidence for an intervening advance of even smaller magnitude around 1200-1300 cal yr ago. The advances are broadly synchronous with those in other parts of western North America, indicating that they were caused by regional, possibly global, changes in climate. Plant communities within the study area did not change dramatically during the late Holocene. The ranges of some plants, however, likely retracted or extended near treeline in response to changes in mean temperatures of perhaps 1-2degreesC, as A well as changes in summer snow cover. The greatest changes in vegetation occurred within and just beyond the forefields of Berendon, Frank Mackie, and other nearby glaciers. The largest climate shifts of the last 3000 years took place during the late Little Ice Age and the last century. Climate warmed about 1-2degreesC during the 20th century, accompanied by a rise in treeline, an increase in coniferous tree cover in the subalpine zone, and an increase in the temperature and biological productivity of ponds. These trends are likely to continue if climate, as expected, continues to warm. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A modified version of the rate constant model (RateCon) (J. Great Lakes Res. 20 (1994) 625), which is one of three mass balance models incorporated into the system, has been run for anthracene, benzo(a) pyrene (B(a)P), dieldrin, fluoranthene, lead, DDE, DDT, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), mercury, mirex, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins (TCDDs), pentachlorophenol, and furans (TCDFs) for Lake Ontario. A subset of these has been run for Lake Erie, due to more limited loadings data being available. The steady-state model results indicate that both lakes are still net sinks for metals such as mercury and lead, and that for concentrations in the water column, the model predicted values fall within the observed ranges plus or minus the confidence intervals for PCBs, HCB, B(a)P, mirex, DDE, lead, and anthracene. Currently there is still insufficient data to allow a simple screening level model such as RateCon to be applied for octachlorostyrene, chlordane, toxaphene, heptachlor, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, hexachlorocyclohexane, 1,6-dinitropyrene, 1,8-dinitropyrene, and tributyl tin, and many of the PAH's. Concentrations to loadings calculations for Lake Erie indicate that either the lake is very far from steady-state and is responding to historically higher loadings or the estimated loadings are extremely underestimated for PCBs, lead, and fluoranthene, assuming that the measured concentrations at the outlet (Fort Erie) are representative of whole lake values.

Unravelling neomorphism: recrystallization pathways in Proterozoic microfossiliferous chert	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Early diagenetic chert serves as a critical archive of life on Earth, yet the mechanisms of chert formation and diagenesis remain uncertain. The present research deciphers chert formation and recrystallization through petrographic observations of Proterozoic microfossiliferous chert and explores its relationship to microfossil preservation. Petrographic analyses reveal that the primary chert fabric consists of a network of spherules that consist of chalcedony fibers that radiate outward from a central nucleation point. Original spherules then undergo neomorphic recrystallization that results in systematic grain coarsening and a range of distinctive textures. Subsequent recrystallization can largely erase evidence of primary spherules, but often maintains distinct internal domains within crystals that exhibit sweeping extinction consistent with initial spherulitic growth. We attribute the range of neomorphic features described here to a combination of 1) growth of initial chalcedony spherules within a silica gel that permeates the primary substrate, 2) the degree of alignment of the chalcedony fibers within and between adjacent spherules, 3) the behavior of the amorphous silica component within and external to chalcedony spherules during early neomorphic recrystallization, and 4) coalescence of adjacent grains with similar lattice orientation. Notably, in nearly all cases, remarkable fidelity is maintained in the preservation of microfossil morphology and primary sedimentary fabrics. These observations lead us to a refined model for microfossil silicification and emphasizes both the complex role of neomorphism in chert formation and the low levels of water-rock interaction required for the neomorphic process.

J	Seong, JC; Lee, S; Cho, Y; Hwang, C				Seong, Jeong Chang; Lee, Seungyeon; Cho, Yoonjae; Hwang, Chulsue			Beyond the Road: A Regional Perspective on Traffic Congestion in Metro Atlanta	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION												Traffic congestion not only affects traffic flow but also influences public perception of congested regions. While analyzing congestion at the road section level can help identify engineering solutions, it often fails to reveal broader spatial patterns and trends at the regional or macro scale unless summarized effectively. This study aims to address these challenges by focusing on regional-scale traffic congestion amounts measured by distanceTime metrics. A 12-month dataset, sampled every 10 min, was analyzed to identify spatial patterns, temporal trends, regional variations, and predictive models in the Metro Atlanta area. The results show that congestion is the most severe and increasing at key urban corridors like Brookhaven-Sandy Springs, the downtown connector, Druid Hills-Decatur, and Johns Creek-Cumming, aligning with recent urban developments. Cities such as Alpharetta, Dunwoody, Brookhaven, Austell, Stone Mountain, East Point, Lake City, Morrow, Fairburn, and Jonesboro show high increasing trends in congestion. Predictive modeling with the long short-term memory (LSTM) method shows promising results for short-term forecasts, though variability in data requires further optimization for certain cities. This research is significant because it demonstrates that congestion amounts measured by distanceTime metrics can be used for assessing regional characteristics broadly at a metropolitan city scale. The findings and methodologies identified in this research might support urban and transportation planning efforts in metropolitan planning organizations, such as the Atlanta Regional Commission, by identifying congestion amounts and trends at both the regional and road scales.					; Hwang, Chul/AAF-9289-2021	Hwang, Chul Sue/0000-0001-9933-2432; 														2220-9964				FEB	2025	14	2							61	10.3390/ijgi14020061	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi14020061													WOS:001429995200001

The genome sequences of these ubiquitous and prolific chemolithoautotrophs suggest a surprising diversity of mechanisms for the uptake and fixation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); these mechanisms are verified here. Carboxysomes are apparent in the transmission electron micrographs of most of these organisms but are lacking in Thiomicrorhabdus sp. strain Milos-T2 and Thiomicrorhabdus arctica, and the inability of Thiomicrorhabdus sp. strain Milos-T2 to grow under low-DIC conditions is consistent with the absence of carboxysome loci in its genome. For the remaining organisms, genes encoding potential DIC transporters from four evolutionarily distinct families (Tcr_0853 and Tcr_0854, Chr, SbtA, and SulP) are located downstream of carboxysome loci. Transporter genes collocated with carboxysome loci, as well as some homologs located elsewhere on the chromosomes, had elevated transcript levels under low-DIC conditions, as assayed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). DIC uptake was measureable via silicone oil centrifugation when a representative of each of the four types of transporter was expressed in Escherichia coll. The expression of these genes in the carbonic anhydrase-deficient E. coil strain EDCM636 enabled it to grow under low-DIC conditions, a result consistent with DIC transport by these proteins. The results from this study expand the range of DIC transporters within the SbtA and SuIP transporter families, verify DIC uptake by transporters encoded by Tcr 0853 and Tcr_0854 and their homologs, and introduce DIC as a potential substrate for transporters from the Chr family. IMPORTANCE Autotrophic organisms take up and fix DIC, introducing carbon into the biological portion of the global carbon cycle. The mechanisms for DIC uptake and fixation by autotrophic Bacteria and Archaea are likely to be diverse but have been well characterized only for "Cyanobacteria." Based on genome sequences, members of the genera Hydrogenovibrio, Thiomicrospira, and Thiomicrorhabdus have a variety of mechanisms for DIC uptake and fixation. We verified that most of these organisms are capable of growing under low-DIC conditions, when they upregulate carboxysome loci and transporter genes collocated with these loci on their chromosomes. When these genes, which fall into four evolutionarily independent families of transporters, are expressed in E. coil, DIC transport is detected. This expansion in known DIC transporters across four families, from organisms from a variety of environments, provides insight into the ecophysiology of autotrophs, as well as a toolkit for engineering microorganisms for carbon-neutral biochemistries of industrial importance.

In addition it contains Chalcolithic remains and 5th century BC burials attributed to the Persian period, cemented and covered by Late Holocene travertine flowstone. These deposits represent a chain of Late Pleistocene and Holocene interconnected environmental and human events, echoing broader scale regional and global climate events. A major shift between depositional environments is associated with the rapid fall of Lake Lisan level during the latest Pleistocene. This exposed the sediments, providing for cave formation processes sometime between the latest Pleistocene (ca. 15 ka) and the Middle Holocene (ca. 4500 BC), eventually leading to human use of the cave. The Chalcolithic use of the cave can be related to a relatively moist desert environment, probably related to a shift in the location of the northern boundary of the Saharo-Arabian desert belt. The travertine layer was U-Th dated 2.46 +/- 0.10 to 2.10 +/- 0.04 ka, in agreement with the archaeological finds from the Persian period. Together with the inner consistency of the dating results, this strongly supports the reliability of the radiometric ages. The 2.46-2.10 ka travertine deposition within the presently dry cave suggests a higher recharge of the Judean Desert aquifer, correlative to a rising Dead Sea towards the end of the 1 st millennium BC. This suggests a relatively moist local and regional climate facilitating human habitation of the desert. (c) 2007 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

J	JENNINGS, CA; WILSON, DM				JENNINGS, CA; WILSON, DM			SPAWNING ACTIVITY OF PADDLEFISH (POLYODON-SPATHULA) IN THE LOWER BLACK RIVER, WISCONSIN	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We present indirect evidence of successful paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) reproduction in 1989 and 1991 in the lower Black River, Wisconsin, about 5 km upstream of the confluence with the upper Mississippi River. This is the first indication of successful reproduction by paddlefish at the northern end of its range in the central United States. Attempts to document paddlefish Polyodon spathula reproduction by sampling eggs and larvae began in the early 1900s (e.g., Stockard 1907), but the exact timing and location of fish spawning were unknown until the early 1960s. Actual spawning by paddlefish was first observed over gravel bars in the Osage River, Missouri, by Purkett (1961), who then collected eggs and larvae. Paddlefish eggs and larvae have since been collected below dams on the Missouri (Ruelle and Hudson 1977, Unkenholz 1982), Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers (Pasch et al. 1980, Wallus 1986). However, the spawning areas for most paddlefish populations remain unknown. Because larval paddlefish are rarely sampled, the presence of post-larval and juvenile paddlefish is often interpreted as indirect evidence of successful reproduction. Such evidence has been used in Illinois (Adams 1942), Oklahoma (Houser and Bross 1959), the Missouri River along the Nebraska-South Dakota border (Ruelle and Hudson 1977), Pool 13 of the upper Mississippi River (Gengerke 1978), and Louisiana (Reed et al. 1992) to document successful paddlefish reproduction. We gathered similar evidence from the lower Black River, near La Crosse, Wisconsin. This information is important because Wisconsin represents the northern limit for paddlefish in the central United States (Gengerke 1986) and because attempts to document reproduction by the few remaining localized populations in the state have been unsuccessful (Lyons, In press). Additionally, paddlefish are of special concern in Wisconsin because of low numbers and limited distribution (Johnson 1987). During November 1990, we observed a small paddlefish (about 700 mm total length, TL) in the catch of commercial seine fishermen working in the lower Black River (about 5 km upstream from its confluence with the Mississippi River). On April 15, 1992, commercial fishermen working the same section of the Black River found five small paddlefish (<350 mm TL) in their catch. Additionally, three small paddlefish (about 800 mm TL) were taken on December 28, 1992, during commercial seining operations in the lower Black River. In Pool 13 of the upper Mississippi River, age-I paddlefish averaged 498 mm fork length (Gengerke 1978), and the growth of paddlefish is faster in backwaters than in the main channel (Rosen 1976, Russell 1986). Therefore, we think that the three 800-mm paddlefish taken on December 28, 1992 were age-1 fish that hatched during spring 1991 near the Lake Onalaska spillway on the lower Black River. We also think that the 700-mm paddlefish observed in November 1990 was an age-1 fish that had hatched in the same area during spring 1989. The presence of age-1 paddlefish in the lower Black River represents indirect evidence of successful reproduction somewhere in the upper Mississippi River, probably in the area where they were found. Paddlefish in the upper Mississippi River make random within-pool movements and occasionally make inter-pool movements (Southall and Hubert 1984, Moen 1989). However, many seem to establish home ranges (Southall and Hubert 1984) and to exhibit strong homing tendencies despite frequent excursions away from the home area (Southall and Hubert 1982, Moen 1989). The paddlefish we observed were in an area immediately downstream of the Lake Onalaska spillway. Because paddlefish spawn at the base of dams (e.g., Wallus 1986), we think these fish did not come from another pool, but hatched near the Lake Onalaska spillway, found suitable habitat in the immediate area, and stayed. The acceptance of these fish as indirect evidence of successful paddlefish reproduction in the lower Black River supports the existence of a self-sustaining paddlefish population at the northern edge of the species' range.																			0270-5060					SEP	1993	8	3					261	262		10.1080/02705060.1993.9664862	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1993.9664862													WOS:A1993LZ34400009

FATE, TRANSPORT AND EFFECTS OF POLLUTANTS ORIGINATING FROM ACID MINE DRAINAGE IN THE OLIFANTS RIVER, SOUTH AFRICA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Concentrations of pollutants were measured in water, sediment and algal samples collected along a longitudinal gradient from a stretch of the Olifants River, South Africa, that receives acid mine drainage (AMD) from the Klipspruit River. The effects of AMD were determined through macroinvertebrate biotic indices (SASS5) and multivariate analysis of macroinvertebrate communities. The acidic Klipspruit River caused increased concentrations of total Al, Fe and Mn in the Olifants River. Upon mixing of the Klipspruit with that from the alkaline Olifants River, Al and Fe precipitate rapidly, leading to lower concentrations in the dissolved phase and higher concentrations in the suspended phase and in sediment at sites in close proximity to the confluence. Similarly, filamentous algae accumulated high concentrations of Al, Fe and Zn immediately after the confluence. Mn remains in the dissolved phase, and sediment and algal concentrations increase with increasing distance downstream. Metal speciation analysis indicate that Al is rapidly converted from more toxic forms (e.g. Al3+ and Al(OH)(2+)) to less toxic forms (e.g. Al(OH)(3)(aq) and Al(OH)(4-)). In contrast, Mn remains in the soluble Mn2+ form. Macroinvertebrate metrics and community structure showed clear signs of deterioration in water quality in the Olifants River downstream of the point of AMD input. While total TDS concentrations at all sites fall within ranges likely to affect macroinvertebrates, the relative composition of major ions changes as a result of AMD input, which may also account for the observed changes in macroinvertebrate communities. Further downstream, the Wilge River discharges into the Olifants River and significantly improves water quality downstream of the confluence. Future mining and development activities in the Wilge catchment should be carefully managed and monitored so as to ensure sufficient flows of acceptable quality to prevent further deterioration of water quality in the Olifants River and downstream reservoirs.

We have complete lists of vascular plant species for 40 of these islands from 1886, 1892, 1903-04, 1927-28 and 1984-85. 2 We have investigated the seed bank on nine of these islands and compared species composition at different soil depths with the species lists from the islands in 1886-1985, and with the present vegetation in the area of seed bank sampling. We have also investigated the distribution in the soil of seeds from species with different ecological attributes, including seed longevity, successional status, seed weight, seed form and species longevity. 3 Seeds in soil samples were allowed to germinate over the course of two summers with an intermediate cold storage. We found 1944 seeds representing 65 taxa. The mean seed density was 84 seeds dm(-2). 4 The similarity between the surface soil (0-3 cm) seed bank and the vegetation at the different vegetation analyses increased from 1886 to 1993. The similarity between the present vegetation and the seed bank decreased with increasing soil depth, and the soil at 12-15 cm had no species in common with the present vegetation. Several species now absent from the vegetation were found in the seed bank. 5 Deeply buried seeds came from early successional, annual species with long-term persistent and low-weight seeds, as expected from seed bank theories, but were slightly elongated, which was in contrast to theories. Spherical seeds were associated with the surface soil, as were short-lived and high-weight seeds from late successional, perennial species.					; Grandin, Ulf/HKO-5291-2023	Grandin, Ulf/0000-0003-0320-0692; 													0022-0477	1365-2745				APR	1998	86	2					293	303		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00252.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00252.x													WOS:000073764500009

Accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexachlorobenzene, and trace metals were measured in the transplanted mussels and levels compared to levels in indigenous mussels. Additionally, zebra mussels were exposed at a small lake in the vicinity of Antwerp (Belgium), and accumulation of contaminants was followed for an extended period from December 2001 to April 2002. Analysis of the pollutants in the indigenous mussels showed that the selected sites displayed a wide range of pollution from near to background to very high levels of metals and/or organic contaminants when compared to the literature. For organic contaminants and for most metals, comparison of levels between caged and resident mussels revealed no significant differences. Only for cadmium and nickel, significant differences were observed, with levels being either higher (cadmium) or lower (nickel) in caged mussels. For organic contaminants, significant correlations between levels in caged and resident mussels were found with r(2) values up to 0.98. For some metals, no or poor correlations were found. At most sites, concentrations of those metals were of the same order of magnitude and comparable to levels in mussels from unpolluted sites. This might explain the absence of significant correlations. When mussels were exposed for an extended period, the concentration of some pollutants increased, whereas others decreased with time. Only in the case of certain metals did levels differ significantly because of the slow deputation of metals already present in the transplanted mussels. This is an additional indication that measured concentrations in transplanted mussels indeed reflected the local situation. With this study, we were able to prove the applicability of transplanted mussels as a biomonitoring too] for the accumulation of pollutants over a wide range of pollution.

J	Uchiyama, T				Uchiyama, Takashi			Hydrogeological Structure and Hydrological Characterization in the Northern Foot Area of Fuji Volcano, Central Japan	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI												Quaternary volcanoes and their surrounding terrains typically have excellent water resources and generally are more abundant in groundwater than other areas, because aquifers consist of very permeable volcanic materials, such as lava flows and fall deposits. However, the groundwater-flow systems and storage processes are complex, due to the geological setting and volcanic histories. Fuji Volcano is the most famous Quaternary volcano in Japan, and is one of the most active. Volcanic activity at Fuji Volcano began about 100,000 years ago. Fuji Five Lakes (FujiGoko, , consisting of Lake Motosu, Lake Shoji, Lake Sai, Lake Kawaguchi and Lake Yamanaka, lying in the northern foot area, were dammed by pyroclastic flows from Fuji Volcano. The groundwater-flow system at the northern foot area of Fuji Volcano is summarized based on the results of previous hydrogeological research and joint research on the groundwater-flow system and volcanic geology. The results of aquifer unit classification and hydrogeological characterization at the northern foot of Mt. Fuji are summarized as follows with the aquifer unit classified into five divisions. The aquifers are subdivided into Saq-1 and 2, Faq-1 and 2, and Haq-2 in descending order of depth. Haq-1 is a volcanic mudflow deposit that was formerly known as the Old Fuji Mudflow, and is considered an impervious layer. The timing of the formation of Fuji Five Lakes is as follows: Lake Yamanaka has two formation times, about 5 ka and 1.4 ka. Lake Kawaguchi was dammed up about 20 ka and took almost its present shape in 10 ka. Lake Motosu was prototyped in 30 ka and remains to the present day. In the process, the "Lake Se (Se no Umi)" was formed, and about 1,200 years ago, the Jogan eruption divided Se no Umi into Lake Sai and Lake Shoji. This timeline was confirmed by observations of the groundwater level, indicating that the water flows out from Lake Kawaguchi to the south through lava flow Faq-1 and 2.																			0022-135X	1884-0884					2020	129	5			SI		697	724		10.5026/jgeography.129.697	http://dx.doi.org/10.5026/jgeography.129.697													WOS:000590967200008
J	Maharaj, R; Maharaj, C; Mahase, M				Maharaj, Rean; Maharaj, Chris; Mahase, Martina			The performance and durability of polyethylene terephthalate and crumb rubber-modified road pavement surfaces	PROGRESS IN RUBBER PLASTICS AND RECYCLING TECHNOLOGY												This research investigates the influence of waste polymeric polyethylene terephthalate (PET) materials obtained from waste plastic bottles and crumb rubber (CR) obtained from used automobile tyres on the performance (Marshall stability, flow and compression) and durability (weathering) characteristics of road-paving material made from Trinidad Petroleum Bitumen and the world-renowned Trinidad Lake Asphalt. Apart from possibly serving as additives to improve performance, incorporating waste PET and CR in asphaltic road-paving materials also offers a viable means of alleviating health and environmental problems associated with the waste disposal of PET and CR. The results of the Marshall testing found that the optimum dosage for polymer modification was 1.0% and 5.0% for PET and CR polymers, respectively. In comparison with a Marshall stability value for the unmodified asphalt sample of 10.2 kN with a corresponding flow value of 3.1 mm, the 5% PET modified sample had a Marshall stability value of 10.2 kN with a flow value of 3.2 mm, while the CR modified sample recorded the highest Marshall stability value of 10.7 kN at corresponding flow value of 2.8 mm. An undesirable trend of the gradual increasing of the voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) with incremental increases in the % of added PET and CR was observed; however, for all the modified specimens with the exception of the 5% PET modified sample, the VMA fell within the acceptable range of between 14% and 20%. The results of accelerated weathering and compression testing demonstrated that both the 1% PET and the 5% CR-modified samples had higher durability and compressive strength characteristics than the unmodified samples. Compressive stress values for the polymer-modified specimens were in excess of 45% compared to the unmodified ones. The relevance of the values obtained in this study cannot be ignored as it provides practical and essential data, especially of the optimal dosages of PET and CR required for the enhancement of the mechanical and durability properties of the Trinidad road-paving materials while simultaneously providing an environmentally desirable and sustainable method for reusing these waste polymers. Commercial application of the optimum formulation can be immediately implemented.

Subsequent Late Glacial and Holocene vegetation changes are better known; however, it is unclear if the few available palynological and macrofossil records are able to capture the entire vegetation variability of the region. A new palaeoecological multi-proxy study using pollen, spores, charcoal and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) from Burgaschisee (Swiss Plateau, 465 m a.s.l.) is applied to reconstruct vegetation, fire and land use for the past 19,000 cal years. Steppe tundra vegetation established at c. 18,700 cal bp only c. 300 years after the end of the LGM and deglaciation. A shift from steppe tundra (Artemisia, Helianthemum) to shrub tundra (Betula nana, Salix, Juniperus) with sporadic tree Betula stands occurred around 16,000 cal bp, most likely in response to climate warming after the end of Heinrich event 1. Abundant spores of coprophilous fungi (Sporormiella, Cercophora) may reflect the presence of Pleistocene large herbivores (e.g. Mammuthus primigenius, Bison bonasus, Rangifer tarandus). Afforestation started more than 2,000 years later with Juniperus and tree Betula around 14,500 cal bp. Mixed Betula and Pinus sylvestris forests persisted until 10,800 cal bp, when mixed elm forests expanded into the region in response to climate warming. Around 8,200 cal bp, mesophilous Fagus sylvatica and Abies alba partly replaced more heliophilous species in the forests, when climate became less continental and more moist. Pollen of Cerealia, Plantago lanceolata and other crops and weeds suggest that agricultural activities became significant during the Neolithic around 6,500 cal bp (4550 cal bc). Archaeological findings from Neolithic pile dwellings around 5,950 cal bp (4000 cal bc) indicate local settlements around the lake. The lake sediments are laminated for most of the last c. 6,800 years. With two independent proxies (XRF and pollen), we can demonstrate that these laminations are annual, suggesting short-term mixing of the lake water due to a more open landscape in response to land use. Our study shows that the annually laminated (varved) sediments from Burgaschisee have a great potential for high-resolution multi-proxy analyses covering the past c. 6,800 years. They can provide accurate ages of cultural phases that might be compared with dendrochronologically dated evidence from lake dwellings.					; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Gilli, Adrian/B-5238-2014; Hafner, Albert/ABH-4856-2020	Rey, Fabian/0000-0002-0737-3921; Hafner, Albert/0000-0003-2159-8569; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; Gilli, Adrian/0000-0003-4193-2157; 													0939-6314	1617-6278				NOV	2017	26	6					571	586		10.1007/s00334-017-0635-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-017-0635-x													WOS:000413944100002

The 14 years of experience gathered from NOVA have shown that discharges of total N (TN) and P (TP) from point sources to the Danish Aquatic Environment have been reduced by 69% (N) and 82% (P) during the period 1989-2002. Consequently, the P concentration has decreased markedly in most Danish lakes and estuaries. Considerable changes in agricultural practice have resulted in a reduction of the net N-surplus from 136 to 88 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (41%) and the net P-surplus from 19 to 11 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) (42%) during the period 1985-2002. Despite these efforts Danish agriculture is today the major source of both N (> 80%) and P (> 50%) in Danish streams, lakes and coastal waters. A non-parametric statistical trend analysis of TN concentrations in streams draining dominantly agricultural catchments has shown a significant (p < 0.05) downward trend in 48 streams with the downward trend being stronger in loamy compared to sandy catchments, and more pronounced with increasing dominance of agricultural exploitation in the catchments. In contrast, a statistical trend analysis of TP concentrations in streams draining agricultural catchments did not reveal any significant trends. The large reduction in nutrient loading from point and non-point sources has in general improved the ecological conditions of Danish lakes in the form of increased summer Secchi depth, decreased chlorophyll a and reduced phytoplankton biomass. Major changes have also occurred in the fish communities in lakes, with positive cascading effects on water quality. In Danish estuaries and coastal waters only a few significant improvements in the ecological quality have been observed, although it is expected that the observed reduced nutrient concentrations are likely to improve the ecological quality of estuaries and coastal waters in Denmark in the long term.

The H-3 excess in the INPP environment was analyzed and compared to the variable H-3 background level over the period of operation of the INPP (end of 1983 - end of 2009) and during the initial stage of decommissioning (2010-2017). H-3 in the INPP vicinity has been studied in the water of artificial channels related to operation of the INPP and site drainage, in natural surface water bodies and, at a smaller scale, in unconfined groundwater. This study presents an extensive H-3 data set extending back to 1980, i.e. before INPP operation started. To assess the contribution of global sources to H-3 dynamics, monthly precipitation was also studied, along with water from the Baltic Sea, Curonian Lagoon and Nemunas River were studied as well, all three of these located in the Lithuanian maritime zone. The H-3 activity concentration in water was measured using liquid scintillation counting (LSC) techniques (direct counting and counting after enrichment). During the period of INPP operation, H-3 from liquid effluent could be clearly observed in discharge channels, occurring in rather low diluted conditions, as well as in Lake Druksiai, the cooling basin, at an even more diluted level. The highest H-3 activity concentration in Lake Druksiai was observed in 2003 and reached 201.3 +/- 1.3 TU at a time when H-3 activity concentrations in background water bodies was 9.2 +/- 3.5 TU. After the closure of the INPP, the an liquid effluent rate reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude (from 10(12) Bq in 1991 to 10(10) Bq in 2016) and when decommissioning activity commenced then the H-3 activity concentration fell to that approaching the background level (19-27 TU) that can still be observed in industrial discharge and rainwater drainage channels. H-3 as a result of leakage from the INPP can be observed in groundwater only in direct proximity to the INPP site near the radioactive waste storage zone.																			0265-931X	1879-1700				AUG	2018	188				SI		11	17		10.1016/j.jenvrad.2017.11.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2017.11.028								29198785					WOS:000429762500002

However, little is known about the effects of drought on reed-dominated wetlands and the possibility of Pannonian reed ecosystems being a source of greenhouse gases (GHG). The drought at Lake Neusiedl had a particular impact on the water level, but also had consequences for the reed belt. Therefore, we investigated the drought-influenced C fluxes and their drivers in the reed ecosystem of this subsaline lake over a period of 4.5 years (mid-2018 to 2022). We applied eddy covariance technique to continuously quantify the vertical turbulent GHG exchange between reed belt & atmosphere and used vegetation indices to account for reed growth. Methane emissions decreased by 76% from 9.2 g CH4-C m-2a-1 (2019) to 2.2 g CH4-C m-2 a-1 (2022), which can be explained by the falling water level, the associated drying out of the reed belt and its consequences. Carbon dioxide emissions initially decreased by 85% from 181 g CO2-C m-2 a-1 (2019) to 27 g CO2-C m-2 a-1 (2021), but then increased to twice the 2019 level in 2022 (391 g CO2-Cm-2 a-1). Due to the drying reed belt, the reed initially grew into formerly water-covered areas within the reed belt, especially in 2021, leading to higher photosynthesis through 2021. This development stopped and even reversed in 2022 as a consequence of the sharp decrease in sediment water content from about 65 to 32 Vol-% in mid-2022. Overall, drought led to a decoupling of the reed ecosystem from the open lake area and developed the wetland into a strong C source.					; Maier, Andreas/AAV-6505-2021; Glatzel, Stephan/AAE-8189-2019; Baur, Pamela/GWZ-8887-2022	Glatzel, Stephan/0000-0002-2572-5484; Maier, Andreas/0009-0005-9743-3789; Baur, Pamela/0000-0002-7258-4194; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				DEC 1	2024	262		2						119907	10.1016/j.envres.2024.119907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.119907		SEP 2024						39251177					WOS:001315564200001
J	Bouchard, HJ; Aloisi, DB				Bouchard, HJ; Aloisi, DB			Investigations in concurrent disinfection and de-adhesion of lake sturgeon eggs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Recent interest in the restoration of lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens and in the development of new culture techniques has led to many new management programs designed to stabilize and enhance existing wild populations. The spread of pathogens affecting both wild and propagated sturgeon is a major concern for restoration programs. In 1999, two methods of egg de-adhesion were used on two separate groups of lake sturgeon eggs prior to disinfection with 100 mg/L of iodine for 10 min. The de-adhesion of eggs with urea-NaCl-tannic acid solutions produced hatch and 14-d-posthatch survival rates of 77.2% and 71.0%, respectively. These results were compared with those for eggs treated with Fuller's Earth (control), which had survival rates of 88.0% and 86.0%, respectively, at hatch and 14 d. In 2000, we compared three methods of deadhesion: (1) a solution of distilled water (jelly inhibitor) and iodine, (2) a solution of urea, NaCl, and tannic acid, and (3) a solution of Fuller's Earth and iodine. With all three methods, eggs were disinfected with a 50-mg/L buffered iodine solution for 30 min during or immediately following de-adhesion. Survival to hatchout for the distilled water, urea-NaCl-tannic acid, and Fuller's Earth methods was 95.3, 99.6, and 97.7%, respectively. Survival to 14 d posthatch was 76.8, 84.2, and 85.6%, respectively, for the three methods. Iodine disinfection during the de-adhesion and water absorption processes does not appear to be toxic to lake sturgeon eggs. Topical iodine disinfection of lake sturgeon eggs immediately (< 10 min) following fertilization increased the exposure of both the internal and external portions of the egg to the iodine during the hydration of the egg envelope.																			1522-2055	1548-8454				JUL	2002	64	3					212	216		10.1577/1548-8454(2002)064<0212:IICDAD>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8454(2002)064<0212:IICDAD>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000176827600008

The remaining 403 treatment plants are scattered throughout the province, with an average size of 20 000 m(3)/d. Ontario Hydro commissioned a study of the wastewater treatment plants to identify the main power users at the various types of sewage treatment plants, as well as potential areas within each plant where significant energy savings could be generated. By using this information, Ontario Hydro hoped to assess the potential to reduce the load and identify any electrical efficiency improvements, fuel switching and load shifting opportunities that may exist as well as the impact of environmental regulations on power saving initiatives. It was found that several major opportunities existed, These included: that up to 25% of power currently used can be reduced by introducing energy efficient measures of all the unit operations in wastewater treatment plants, aeration accounts for 42% of the power usage, influent and effluent pumping - 20%, and dewatering - 6%. Of this influent and effluent pumping, specifically influent represented the best target area as significant aeration system upgrade had already taken place.																			0273-1223						1994	30	4					17	23		10.2166/wst.1994.0149	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1994.0149													WOS:A1994QA56800004

Status of Freshwater Mussels (Unionidae) in the French Creek Watershed, USA at the Onset of Invasion by Round Goby, Neogobius melanostomus	WATER												Freshwater mussels are an imperiled group of organisms that are vital to aquatic ecosystems. Services performed by freshwater mussels, coupled with their use for biomonitoring, make them an invaluable asset. Neogobius melanostomus (Round Goby), a recently introduced invasive species to the French Creek watershed, was once restricted to the watershed of Lake Erie in Pennsylvania. The Round Goby's propensity to consume Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra Mussel) and Dreissena bugensis (Quagga Mussel) in their native habitat raises concerns about this recent introduction into Pennsylvania's Allegheny River watershed. Since the discovery of their introduction within the watershed, we have followed the range expansion and dispersal rate of Round Gobies, which makes this study unique. The objectives of this study were to quantify baseline data on the contemporary diversity and abundance of unionid mussels in the upper French Creek watershed, and to explore potential habitat factors that influence or limit the size of the mussel populations. We gathered baseline data on freshwater mussel diversity and abundances across eight sites in the French Creek watershed and examined substrate particle size and host availability as potential limiting factors of the freshwater mussel distribution. Freshwater mussel surveys were conducted during the summer months (July-September) of 2017 using area-constrained surveys. Results showed a significant relationship between mussel diversity and substrate particle size (p < 0.05). From the data collected, we were able to calculate population estimates for the species found across the sample sites. Our results regarding the locations of native mussel populations and characteristics of their habitat provide the needed insight for establishing priority areas for the conservation of freshwater mussels, facilitating planning for protection, mitigation, and adaptation as the invasive Round Goby continues its spread.

Even though temperature is often less of a key driver of diatom ecology than other environmental parameters (water chemistry), diatom inference models have been shown to be reliable in deducing past temperature trends. In addition, the oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18(diatom)) preserved in buried diatom frustules has demonstrated its potential to reflect climatic and hydrological conditions at the time of frustule formation. This study combines results from both diatom-based climate proxies to reconstruct summer water and mean annual air temperatures, and hydrological trends in Nettilling Lake, Baffin Island, from ca. 5000 to 500 cal a bp. Diatom-inferred temperatures revealed an overall ca. 2 degrees C cooling throughout the Late-Holocene. The delta O-18(diatom) values showed an increasing trend up to ca. 1900 cal a bp, where they reached their highest values (+24.8 parts per thousand at 15 cm) and thereafter decreased to their lowest values (+21.4 parts per thousand at 4 cm). These trends were linked to meltwater inflows associated with Penny Ice Cap thaw rate that was in turn controlled by regional climatic conditions which went from intensified cooling during the Neoglacial period to slight warming thereafter. Our results suggest that diatom- and diatom-isotope-based temperature and hydrological reconstructions can identify trends related to the natural climate system variability. The diatom oxygen isotopes are useful for paleoenvironmental studies of terrestrial aquatic ecosystems, but not for all hydrological systems are the ideal temperature proxy. Hence, the combination of proxies helps to disentangle temperature and hydrological effects for paleoclimatic reconstructions and may support future studies of postglacial environmental change in northern lakes.

Connecting tributary mercury loads to nearshore and offshore sediments in Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Superior has a vast and largely undeveloped watershed in comparison to the other Great Lakes, which makes it challenging to study mercury (Hg) sources and cycling. To examine Hg inputs to Lake Superior, we conducted an expansive binational assessment in 40 watersheds from a diverse range of landcover types. We further paired tributary Hg data to sediment source portfolios in the nearshore and offshore zones of Lake Superior through partnership with the Great Lakes Sediment Surveillance Program. We observed that total Hg loads were highest in the spring driven by the combination of elevated Hg concentrations and increased water discharge from snowmelt. In addition, total Hg concentrations in tributaries from remote, heavily forested regions, such as Pukaskwa National Park and the Minnesota Northshore, were higher than the Southshore and Thunder Bay regions. Methylmercury concentrations and loads were more spatially dependent, often corresponding to regions with more wetlands (e.g., Michigan Upper Peninsula). We estimated that the total Hg tributary load to Lake Superior in 2021 was 126 kg per year. To further examine the fate of watershed Hg sources, we examined sediments from 28 sites in Lake Superior using Hg stable isotopes. At open water sites, precipitation was the primary Hg source to sediments, but within nearshore sites Hg originated predominantly from watershed runoff. This work further defines the sources and fate of Hg within Lake Superior and highlights how Hg delivery is intrinsically tied to varying hydrologic regimes.					; Robertson, Dale/O-1913-2018	Reavie, Euan/0000-0001-8871-5809; Janssen, Sarah/0000-0003-4432-3154; Filstrup, Christopher/0000-0003-3812-2831													0380-1330					FEB	2025	51	1							102381	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102381		JAN 2025											WOS:001408343900001

Since 2000, for water quality improvement, a large amount of the Tone River water was discharged into Lake Tega, resulting in an improvement in the water quality together with transition of algal dominant species from cyanobacteria to diatoms (mainly the genus Cyclotella). Although several factors including nutrient concentration and daily renewal rate (d) could have been related to the succession of algal dominant species, these effects have not been understood very well. This study investigated the effects of the daily renewal rate and nitrate-nitrogen (hereafter nitrogen) concentration (N) on the competition between the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and the diatom Cyclotella sp. through monoculture and monoxenic culture experiments. Based on the experimental results, a simulation model was constructed to predict the competitive growth pattern of each species. Monoxenic culture experiments showed that M. aeruginosa outcompeted Cyclotella sp. under conditions of N = 0.5 (1.0 mg-N L-1) and d = 5, 15, and 20%. The domination of M. aeruginosa could be attributed to smaller values for the half-saturation constant and the minimum nitrogen cell quota for this species with respect to Cyclotella sp. However, Cyclotella sp., possessing higher values of nitrogen cell quota and nitrogen uptake rate, dominated by an increasing nitrogen concentration (N = 1.0 mg L-1) and daily renewal rate (d = 30%). The competitive growth patterns of M. aeruginosa and Cyclotella sp. could roughly be predicted by the simulation model. These results suggested that the daily renewal rate as well as the nitrogen concentration, could affect the competition and be influential factors as to which species dominates between M. aeruginosa and Cyclotella sp.					; MACHIDA, Motoi/D-7533-2015	MACHIDA, Motoi/0000-0001-5197-660X; 													1322-0829	1440-1835				JUL	2016	64	3					123	132		10.1111/pre.12129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.12129													WOS:000379941200001

Comparison of Landsat 8 and Landsat 7 for regional measurements of CDOM and water clarity in lakes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The potential strengths and limitations of the Landsat systems for water clarity and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measurement were evaluated in Minnesota in the summers of 2013 and 2014. Optical water quality characteristics, including chlorophyll a, total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and CDOM were collected along with imagery from Landsats 7 and 8. Sites represented a wide range of concentrations of CDOM, chlorophyll, and mineral suspended solids (MSS), the primary factors that affect reflectance. Clear images from September 24, 2013 (Landsat 7) and September 16, 2013 (Landsat 8) acquired for northern Minnesota eight days apart allowed comparison of the respective ETM + and OLI sensors for CDOM measurements. We examined a wide variety of potential band and band ratio models and found some two-variable models that included the NIR band worked well for Landsat 8 (R-2 = 0.82) and reasonably well for Landsat 7 (R-2 = 0.74). The commonly used green/red model had a poor fit for both sensors (R-2 = 0.24, 0.25), and five sites with high MSS were clear outliers. Exclusion of these sites and other sites not included with the Landsat 7 dataset yielded a less optically complex subset of 20 coincident lakes. For this subset strong models were found for many band and band ratio models, including the commonly used green/red model with R-2 = 0.79 for Landsat 7 and R-2 = 0.81 for Landsat 8. The less optically complex subset may explain why the green/red model has worked well in other areas. For optically complex waters CDOM models that used the new Landsat 8 ultra-blue and narrower NIR band worked best for the full dataset indicating that the new bands and other Landsat 8 characteristics, such as higher radiometric sensitivity and improved signal-to-noise ratios, improve CDOM measurements. For water clarity measured as Secchi depth (SD), we compared September 1, 2008 Landsat 7 and August 22, 2013 Landsat 8 images from path 28 using stepwise regression to identify the best model using all bands and band ratios including the new blue and narrower NIR band. The best water clarity model for Landsat 8 used the OLI 2/4 band ratio plus OLI band 1 and was nearly identical with a model using the OLI 2/4 band ratio plus OLI band 2. The latter model is similar to the model used for previous Landsat water clarity assessments, which used the ETM + 1/3 band ratio plus ETM + band 1. For SD measurements we found strong relationships with both sensors, with only slight improvements for the OLI sensor for the lakes in our datasets. In contrast to some previous reports that indicated Landsat 7's ETM + lacked sufficient sensitivity for reliable retrieval of CDOM, we found that overall both sensors worked well for water clarity and CDOM measurements. This will allow their continued use for current and historical measurements of important water characteristics on a regional scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The paleolimnological record of LMC contains information on the environmental variability that occurred in a large area of Southern South America since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) until the present. As inferred from the diatom assemblages, sedimentary features and geochemical proxies, prolonged intervals of high and lowstands have caused variations in water salinity, trophic state and sedimentary processes. This is the first paleolimnological reconstruction covering the hydroclimatic variability that occurred over the last 25,000 cal yr BP in the Argentinean Pampean region. Results are in accordance with well-known global climatic phases. The Late Pleistocene record is characterized by a scenario dominated by lowstands, hypersaline, and oligotrophic lake conditions. Radiocarbon ages (25,000-19,000 cal yr BP) indicate that the onset of the record is coeval with the LGM. Later, a progressive lake water level increase was registered at 17,000 cal yr BP, which can be assigned to the Heinrich Stadial 1. A shift toward comparatively drier conditions identified in the record between 14,700 and 13,000 cal yr BP can be chronologically related to the Antarctic Cold Reversal. The transition from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene (13,500-10,500 cal yr BP) is recorded by highstand phases while the Early Holocene record is characterized by high to intermediate water levels. The hydrological reconstruction corresponding to the Mid-Holocene is characterized by alternating phases of high/lowstands. The onset of the Late Holocene record is marked by the development of dry conditions and thus lowstand phases, while around 1300 cal yr BP a distinct water lake level increase is recognized. This humid phase, ascribed to the Medieval Climatic Anomaly, is followed by the record of lowstands between 500 and 1000 cal yr BP, being coeval with the Little Ice Age. The uppermost part of the record of LMC encompasses the Current Warm Period, showing a marked shift towards high lake water level conditions. The hydrological variability registered in the paleolimnological record, highlights the importance of Laguna Mar Chiquita as an outstanding paleoclimate sensor of hydroclimatic variations for a large area of South Eastern South America.

The response of Fraxinus nigra forest ground-layer vegetation to emulated emerald ash borer mortality and management strategies in northern Minnesota, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												When an invasive organism targets a dominant tree species, it can trigger unprecedented shifts in forest plant communities. Emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), an invasive insect that kills by girdling trees, represents a significant threat to North American Fraxinus (ash) species. EAB has already decimated many Fraxinus populations and threatens loss of overstory cover in Great Lakes region wetland forests dominated by Fraxinus nigra (black ash). Canopy treatments, such as clearcutting and group selection, are being evaluated to promote regeneration of non-EAB-host tree species. Studies suggest clearcutting may raise water tables, lower tree regeneration, and shift the composition of woody and herbaceous ground-layer plant communities. However, no empirical research to date has examined the effects of canopy treatments on ground-layer plant communities in F. nigra wetlands. We used a large-scale field experiment in northern Minnesota F. nigra wetlands to examine the response of the woody and herbaceous ground-layer to four overstory treatments: clearcutting, group selection, F. nigra girdling, and unharvested forest. Our objectives were to determine: (1) to what extent established regeneration of associated tree species could be expected to contribute to overstory maintenance under EAB- and management-induced canopy changes; (2) the impact of canopy changes on the composition of the overall woody ground-layer; and (3) the effect of canopy treatments on the herbaceous layer. We found density of established tree regeneration was significantly higher in the clearcut treatment than in the group selection, girdle, and control. Fraxinus nigra had the highest seedling density in all treatments, while Ulmus americana (American elm) was the most abundant non-EAB-host tree species across treatments. Regeneration density of associated tree species varied by treatment and fell short of seedling stocking guidelines. Background variation in experimental blocks exerted a greater influence than treatment on overall woody community composition. Treatment influenced herbaceous layer height, but did not significantly impact total cover. Herbaceous species richness and diversity increased in all treatments, with the clearcut and group selection moving toward greater graminoid cover, while the control and girdling treatment increased in wetland indicator species. Our findings suggest artificial regeneration, combined with herbaceous and shrub competition control treatments, will be necessary to restock F. nigra forests following EAB invasion. Sites with lower abundance of shrub species and higher established tree regeneration should be prioritized for management activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wardle, P; Ezcurra, C; Ramírez, C; Wagstaff, S				Wardle, P; Ezcurra, C; Ramírez, C; Wagstaff, S			Comparison of the flora and vegetation of the southern Andes and New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The annual range of temperatures in the southern Andes is similar to that in New Zealand, although they are cooler at comparable latitudes. South of 45 degreesS in Chile the precipitation regime is also similar to New Zealand, but northwards and also east of the Andes there is an increasing period of summer dryness. There are corresponding similarities in vegetation, especially in evergreen Nothofagus forests, tussock grassland in eastern rain shadows, and cushion bogs. Deciduous Nothofagus species are absent from New Zealand, but dominate widely in drier and colder environments of the southern Andes. In the southern Andes deciduous Nothofagus forms the subalpine forest and krummholz although, in the northern part of the region, there is also Araucaria araucana growing as erect, emergent trees. Volcanic eruptions may lower the tree limit so that it intersects with evergreen Nothofagus forest. In New Zealand, evergreen Nothofagus species. which are less cold-resistant than the deciduous Andean species, form most tree limits, and a belt dominated by tall Chionochloa tussocks intervenes between forest and low-growing alpine vegetation. The absence of very hardy tree species in the New Zealand mountains may be related to isolation and late uplift. Extrapolation to tree limit indicates southern Andean warmest-month mean temperatures from around 7 degreesC in northern localities to only 5.7 degreesC at 55 degreesS, compared with 10 degreesC which prevails in New Zealand. Since tree limit altitudes in the Southern Andes exceed those of New Zealand by at least 250 m, this indicates that in temperature terms New Zealand tree limits are 550 m lower than those of the southern Andes, corresponding with summer isotherms 3.3 degreesC warmer. Vascular species were listed from equivalent vegetation types in the southern Andes and New Zealand, including forest, rain-shadow grassland, alpine, coastal, swamp, lake-edge, and bog vegetation, and also from communities near the upper tree limit without close equivalents, notably deciduous forest in the Andes and Chionochloa grassland in New Zealand. Phytogeographic categories were assigned to all species, genera, and families. These were grouped as shared-austral, shared with wider distributions, "realm-endemic" confined to either South America or Australasia, and non-shared with wider distributions. About 90% of the 465 species listed from the southern Andes and 522 listed from New Zealand are realm-endemics. Forty species or closely related pairs of species are shared, nearly half of these being coastal. Among genera, realm-endemics are the largest element overall and exceed 30% in forests of both regions and in New Zealand subalpine, grassland, alpine, successional, and bog vegetation. Shared genera that extend to north temperate regions form the next most important, reaching over 40% in southern Andean swamp and New Zealand coastal samples. Shared genera with austral distributions reach 21-32% in all New Zealand vegetation classes and southern Andean bog, compared with 5-20% in other southern Andean vegetation classes. They contribute disproportionately to the physiognomic similarities between the two regions, notably in Nothofagus forests and bogs. Non-shared genera with austral or subtropical distributions are most numerous in forest samples from each region. Non-shared genera with north temperate distributions constitute only 2% in New Zealand, contrasting with the southern Andes where they constitute 19% overall and 20-29% in subalpine, grassland, alpine, successional, and coastal vegetation. Distribution of families among phytogeographic categories is similar to that of genera, except that more are shared-widespread and fewer are shared-austral and realm-endemic. Sequencing of the gene rbcL for pairs of taxa in shared-austral genera and for populations of Hebe salicifolia yields divergence estimates ranging from 130 +/- 75 to 7 +/- 4 million years. Divergences among tree species in shared genera may predate the separation of Australasia from Antarctica and South America, but not the separation of New Zealand from Australia. Taxa of open habitats show the most recent divergences, and their presence in both regions demands some mode of transoceanic dispersal. Possibly as late as the Pliocene, this may have involved a partly vegetated Antarctica.

Resolution of patterns in time and space is supported by water quality monitoring that extends back to the late 1970s. Patterns are evaluated to describe the stability of impacts and quantify metabolic activity of the invader. The water quality impacts that have persisted unabated for 10 years since the invasion are the most severe documented for a river in North America. Changes in summer median conditions since the invasion include: (1) a 16-fold decrease in chlorophyll concentration (Chl), (2) a 2.5-fold increase in Secchi disc transparency, (3) a 17-fold increase in soluble reactive phosphorus concentration, (4) a 3.7-fold increase in total ammonia concentration, (5) a greater than 25 percent decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and (6) a decrease in pH of 0.55 units. The strength of these signatures has been driven by anthropogenic influences that include upstream nutrient loading and morphometric modifications of the river, and the functioning of Cross Lake, through which the river flows. This hypereutrophic lake sustains dense zebra mussel populations and related water quality impacts in the river downstream of the lake outflow by acting as a source of veligers and suitable food for this bivalve. Evidence is presented that levels of metabolic activity of the zebra mussel in this river have been resource limited, manifested through increased consumption of Chl and DO with increased delivery of these constituents in the lake's outflow.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2004	40	3					737	754		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2004.tb04456.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2004.tb04456.x													WOS:000222484600014
J	Helvaci, C; Öztürk, YY; Emmermann, A				Helvaci, Cahit; Ozturk, Yesim Yucel; Emmermann, Axel			Fluorescence survey of Turkish borate minerals: comparative measurements of fluorescence spectra of the most important borate mineral species, Turkey	NEUES JAHRBUCH FUR MINERALOGIE-ABHANDLUNGEN												The dominant and most important borate minerals, from a worldwide commercial standpoint, are borax, ulexite, and colemanite. They are produced in a limited number of countries, essentially by Turkey and the United States. The main borate districts of Turkey are Bigadie, Kestelek, Sultaneayir, Emet, and Kirka. These borate deposits of western Turkey are associated with extensive medium- to high-K calc-alkaline ignimbritic volcanism and a differentiated co-magmatic alkaline trachybasalttrachydacite lava suite. Ignimbritic air-fall and reworked pumiceous elastic materials are intimately associated with saline-alkaline lakes that host the borate deposits. Our aim was to compare the spectra of these different borate species and to attempt to explain the mechanisms behind these common features using steady state spectrometry. Eventually, it provided the answer to the emission spectra. We investigated the fluorescence, at room temperature of borax, ulexite, colemanite, priceite, probertite, teruggite, tunellite and howlite, using UV-LED's and a 405 nm laser. It appears that all the spectra share common features. Visual observation of the samples under ultraviolet light showed that the orange fluorescence is predominantly present in well-crystallized material. Only a very small portion of the fluorescence is due to the presence of lanthanide elements, but the high solubility in water of minerals like colemanite, borax, and ulexite may lower the concentration threshold at which these lanthanide elements become exploitable. We propose that the calcium humate complex is the main cause of the orange fluorescence seen in colemanite and other borate mineral specimens. However, the study shows that both As3+ and As5+ are present in concentrations up to 125 ppm in the colemanite specimens that were examined and may contribute to the fluorescence. Although we selected clean and pure colemanite sample for this study, arsenic present could be due to substitution in the colemanite crystal lattice structure as well as some individual arsenic minerals (e.g. realgar and orpiment) that occur rarely in the deposit.

Phreatic activity and hydrothermal alteration in the Valley of Desolation, Dominica, Lesser Antilles	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Phreatic eruptions are possibly the most dramatic surface expressions of hydrothermal activity, and they remain poorly understood. The near absence of precursory signals makes phreatic eruptions unpredictable with respect to both time and magnitude. The Valley of Desolation (VoD), Dominica, located close to the Boiling Lake, the second largest high-temperature volcanic crater lake in the world, hosts vigorous hydrothermal activity with hot springs, mud pools, fumaroles, and steaming ground. A phreatic or phreatomagmatic eruption from this site is considered to be the most likely scenario for future volcanic activity on Dominica. Yet there is little information regarding the trigger mechanisms and eruption processes of explosive events at this active hydrothermal center, and only a very small number of studies have investigated hydrothermal activity in the VoD. We therefore conducted two field campaigns in the VoD to map hydrothermal activity and its surficial phenomena. We also investigated alteration processes and their effects on degassing and phreatic eruption processes. We collected in situ petrophysical properties of clayrich unconsolidated samples, and together with consolidated rock samples, we investigated the range of supergene and hydrothermal alteration in the laboratory. In addition, we performed rapid decompression experiments on unconsolidated soil samples. Our results show that alteration leads to an increasing abundance of clay minerals and a decrease in both strength and permeability of the rocks. In the immediate vicinity of degassing acid-sulfate fluids, advanced argillic alteration yields a mineral zoning which is influenced by meteoric water. The water-saturated basal zone is dominated by kaolinite run 0whereas alunite formation is favored at and above the groundwater table where atmospheric oxidation of H2S to H2SO4 occurs (e.g., steam-heated alteration). Alteration effects may in turn inhibit degassing at the surface, increasing the potential for pressurization in the subsurface and thus lead to phreatic eruptions. Rapid decompression experiments, together with ballistic trajectory calculations, constrain estimates of the conditions prior to the 1997 small-scale phreatic event in the VoD. The results presented here may serve as a contribution to the understanding of the hazard potential of ongoing hydrothermal activity within the VoD. On a broader perspective, our results will help evaluate hydrothermal activity in similar areas worldwide which might also have the potential for phreatic eruptions, for instance Poas (Costa Rica) or Tongariro andWaimangu (New Zealand).					scheu, betty/A-5348-2009; Montanaro, Cristian/AAJ-6564-2021; Joseph, Erouscilla/KLD-4633-2024; Dingwell, Donald/A-4724-2011	Joseph, Erouscilla/0000-0002-4836-8715; Montanaro, Cristian/0000-0002-7896-3419													0258-8900	1432-0819				DEC	2017	79	12							82	10.1007/s00445-017-1166-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-017-1166-0													WOS:000417573800002

To allow calculation of W-r, we developed standard weight (W-s) equations for both species, using the regression-line-percentile (RLP) technique. The proposed W-s equation in metric units (grams wet weight and millimeters total length, TL) for pumpkinseed is log(10)W(s) = -5.179 + 3.237 log(10)TL; for golden shiner it is log(10)W(s) -5.593 + 3.302 log(10)TL. Spatial and temporal variation in W,was highly significant and largely asynchronous in both species, although spring values were lowest in most lakes. The W-r index frequently varied with length, prompting us to examine relationships in stock and quality length fish separately. We found little evidence for a relationship between W-r and growth in either species. Pumpkinseed W(r)s were positively correlated with total benthic invertebrate biomass: stock length W-r was positively correlated with chironomid biomass, and quality length W-r was positively correlated with gastropod biomass. The relative weight of quality length golden shiners was positively correlated with chironomid biomass. Our results and those of other studies suggest that the common assumption of a relationship between W-r and growth in field populations should be reconsidered, but that W-r could be cautiously used as a working index of prey availability. We recommend empirical or experimental verification when W-r is used as an assessment tool in field populations.

J	Alheit, J; Bakun, A				Alheit, Juergen; Bakun, Andrew			Population synchronies within and between ocean basins: Apparent teleconnections and implications as to physical-biological linkage mechanisms	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					Workshop on the Impact of Climate Variability on Marine Ecosystems	SEP 04-08, 2006	Alexander VonHuboldy Univ, Museum Nat Hist, Berlin, GERMANY		Alexander VonHuboldy Univ, Museum Nat Hist			Major fish populations in large marine ecosystems separated by thousands of kilometres often seem to fluctuate in decadal-scale synchrony indicating strong forcing of ecosystem processes and population dynamics by regional and global climatic variability. The climate signals propagating through the atmosphere appear to act as synchronizing agents leading to teleconnection patterns between distant marine ecosystems and populations. This review is an attempt (i) to summarize these apparent within and between ocean basin teleconnection patterns in a comparative framework using particularly suggestive examples and (ii) to unravel physical-biological linkage mechanisms between a climate signal and fish populations. Synchronies in the timing of physical and biological processes between the Kuroshio and the Humboldt Current ecosystems are particularly striking. The collapse of the Peruvian anchovy in 1971 and the rapid decrease of the Japanese anchovy seem not to be directly associated with climate indices such as the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The "climate regime shift" in the mid-1970s in the North Pacific indicated by the PDO is not reflected in the dynamics of anchovies and sardines and other main components in both ecosystems, whereas the Asian Winter Monsoon Index (MOI) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) seem to correlate with these events, at least in the Northwest Pacific. We speculate that the synchrony between processes in the Kuroshio and Humboldt systems is brought about by changes in the basin-scale coupled ocean-atmosphere circulation in North and South Pacific basins. The example of European aquatic systems describes physical-biological synchronies for which the NAO appears to be the synchronizing agent. When the NAO index changed in the late 1980s from a negative to a positive phase, a coherent increase in water temperature was observed in the Central Baltic, the North Sea, the NW Mediterranean and north and central European lakes which was associated with regime shifts in all these ecosystems and which involved all trophic levels. Finally, apparent physical-biological synchronies between the Pacific and Atlantic basins are presented. It is concluded that the multi-regional, multi-species comparative approach, in which the available time series can be considered as different realizations of a common set of basic issues, may be the only way to make real progress.

Implementing perennial strips alongside agricultural ditches and streams could reduce negative impacts of intensive agriculture and restore wildlife habitats in cultivated floodplains. To successfully set up perennial strips, it is important to understand the parameters that drive their establishment. Here we assessed the establishment success of reed canarygrass (RCG; Phalaris arundinacea) strips in the lake Saint Pierre (LSP) floodplain, Quebec, Canada by monitoring RCG biomass and vegetation height over 4 years and identify the factors driving its establishment. A total of 26 RCG strips across six municipalities of LSP were monitored. Biomass and vegetation height of RCG increased over time to reach an average of 5048 kg/ha in year 4 and 104 cm in year 3 in established strips. The RCG established successfully in 62% of surveyed plots and three environmental parameters explained 61% of this success. Establishment of RCG was most successful when a first rain came right after seeding (<3 days). High clay content and low elevation were associated with establishment failures. Overall, our results highlight the ability of RCG strips to restore dense perennial vegetation cover in cultivated floodplain, thereby providing suitable habitat for fish spawning during spring floods. This study provides significant insight into the drivers of establishment of perennial grass strips in highly constrained cultivated areas such as floodplains.					; Bourgeois, Bérenger/S-2485-2019	Vaillancourt, Mathieu/0009-0005-0670-2227; 													1061-2971	1526-100X				JAN	2025	33	1								10.1111/rec.14302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.14302		OCT 2024											WOS:001339498600001
J	Szpunar, R; Bradley, E				Szpunar, Ruth; Bradley, Eric			Finding the Holy Grail of Library Value: Characteristics of Academic Libraries at Universities with High Retention Rates	EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE												Objective - What are the characteristics of academic libraries at schools with high retention rates? To help libraries tell the story of their impact, we sought to determine which academic library practices were linked to high retention rates. Methods - The investigators created a survey for the United States Great Lakes region library deans and directors in the Spring of 2022 with 19 questions about their library services and staffing. The survey was sent to 226 schools and had a response rate of 31%. We compared the resulting information to publicly available data on student retention from ACRL Metrics and IPEDS to look for correlations and associations. Results - Statistical analysis used the Chi-squared test and the Pearson correlation to calculate association and correlation. This found six attributes of student connections with library staff and with unique local collections that were associated with statistically significant differences in retention rates and institutions. These attributes were institutions who: used students as archives student workers, used students to staff reference desks, conducted multiple library instruction sessions with the same class, had a staffed archive or special collection space, had an institutional repository that included student work, or had an Instagram account. Conclusion - The survey results gave a clear profile of academic libraries with above average retention, particularly in terms of student focused initiatives and the curation of unique collections. Additionally, the survey gave a foundation, with recommendations, for future researchers to build upon.																			1715-720X						2024	19	3					60	86		10.18438/eblip30495	http://dx.doi.org/10.18438/eblip30495													WOS:001337077900005

Analysis of Compensatory Responses in Land-Locked Alewives to Walleye Predation: A Tale of Two Lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We compared one established population (Cayuta Lake) and one expanding population (Canadarago Lake) of landlocked alewives Alosa pseudoharengus to evaluate compensatory responses of alewives to predation by walleyes Sander vitreus. Alewives have been present in Cayuta Lake since at least 1977, and during the years 1995 to 2009 the population ranged from 24,470 fish/ha in 2000 to 3,800 fish/ha in 2007. Alewives were first observed in Canadarago Lake during 1999, and the population remained at low densities (<26 fish/ha) until reaching 370 fish/ha in 2006 and 1,050 fish/ha in 2009. Differences in zooplankton reflected higher planktivory rates in Cayuta Lake than in Canadarago Lake. Density of age-3 and older walleyes was higher in Canadarago Lake (21-24 fish/ha) than in Cayuta Lake (12-14 fish/ha), despite elevated stocking rates of fingerling walleyes in Cayuta Lake during 2002-2006. Alewife density explained 77-84% of the variation in alewife length at age and 48-84% of the variation in condition (ages 0, 1, and 2) among years and lakes. Alewife length at age under low densities in Canadarago Lake was similar to observations in anadromous populations. Alewife recruitment (number of fall age-0 recruits/spawner) was higher in Canadarago Lake than in Cayuta Lake. The combined data yielded a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment curve that rose rapidly at low alewife densities, and 50% of the maximum recruitment was predicted to occur at 400 spawners/ha. Compensatory responses of alewives at low densities include decreased cannibalism and increased growth rates of both adults and age-0 fish. Compensatory responses should be considered when evaluating the piscivore levels needed to control alewife populations or, conversely, when evaluating the risk of alewife population collapse in response to increased predation rates. Although alewife abundance declined in response to the experimental walleye stocking in Cayuta Lake, we were unable to increase the walleye population sufficiently to decrease alewife recruitment.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2011	140	6					1587	1603		10.1080/00028487.2011.639265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2011.639265													WOS:000301153700014

This was addressed by pollen analysis along three cores sampled from lakes on a coastal plateau, pri-marily influenced by rainfall, and from a fluvial valley, influenced by sea-level and fluvial discharge, in northeast-ern Brazil. Pollen records from the fluvial valley indicated the presence of mangroves along an estuary in the mid-Holocene. During the past-5800 cal yr BP, mangroves, adapted to brackish water, were replaced by herbaceous vegetation adapted to freshwater in the fluvial valley. Concurrently (-5680-240 cal yr BP), expansion of Atlantic Forest and contraction of herbaceous vegetation occurred on the coastal plateau. This divergence of pollen re-cords between two distinct sedimentary environments (lakes on a coastal plateau and fluvial valleys) was attrib-uted to RSL and climate effects. The combination of RSL fall and higher fluvial discharge favored seaward mangrove migration and expansion of herbaceous vegetation along the fluvial valley during the mid-late Holo-cene. However, the increase in rainfall on the coastal plateau favored the expansion of arboreal vegetation and contraction of herbaceous vegetation. At-1700 CE, an abrupt shift from arboreal to herbaceous vegetation oc-curred on the coastal plateau. This vegetation change is likely attributed to European colonization on the south-ern coast of the state of Bahia, which was colonized by Portuguese navigators-1500 CE. Part of the Atlantic Forest has naturally regenerated and was preserved as a national park in recent decades. This study showed that although the sampling sites are close, pollen assemblages can differ considerably depending on the depositional environment. Therefore, pollen analyses in different depositional environments are necessary to assess individ-ually driving forces impacts on coastal vegetation dynamics during the Holocene.

Sedge-grass meadows are especially sensitive to such fluctuations. We conducted vegetation sampling in a sedge-grass dominated Lake Michigan drowned river mouth wetland in 1995, 2002, and 2010 following high lake levels in 1986 and 1997. We also conducted photointerpretation studies in 16 years dating back to 1965 to include responses to high lake levels in 1952 and 1974. Topographic data were collected to assess their influence on areal extent of sedge-grass meadow. Dominant species in short emergent and submersed/floating plant communities changed with water availability from 1995 to extreme low lake levels in 2002 and 2010. Sedge-grass meadow was dominated by Calamagrostis canadensis and Carex stricta in all years sampled, but Importance Values differed among years partly due to sampling in newly exposed areas. Photointerpretation studies showed a significant relation between percent of wetland in sedge-grass meadow and summer lake level, as well as the number of years since an extreme high lake level. From the topographic map created, we calculated the cumulative area above each 0.2-m contour to determine the percent of wetland dewatered in select years following extreme high lake levels. When compared with percent sedge-grass meadow in those years, relative changes in both predicted land surface and sedge-grass meadow demonstrated that accuracy of lake level as a predictor of area of sedge-grass meadow is dependent on topography. Our results regarding relations of plant-community response to hydrology are applicable to other Great Lakes wetlands.

Long-term observation of waterfowl migration in the south-east of the forest zone of Western Siberia, Russia	SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT												The aim of this research is an analysis of the long-term dynamics of the composition and number of migratory waterfowl in the southeast of the forest zone of Western Siberia. Visual observations of waterfowl migration were carried out in the format of daily 2-hour morning counts in April-May through a period 18 years (1998-2023) near the Tomsk on the Tom river. Additionally, in 2002-2003, simultaneous migration was also observed on the Ob river in the southern, central and northern parts of the Tomsk region. The method of E.I. Gavrilova and E.V. Kumari was used with some modifications. Birds were counted which were transit flying via the territory, as well as birds sitting on the lake water in the area of the observation point. Twenty-one species of waterfowl have been registered. Analysis of long-term dynamics has revealed a trend towards a decrease in the total number of migrating waterfowl. In the most abundant species, Anas acuta, , this trend is statistically significant. In some species - Anas strepera and Cygnus Cygnus - the trend of dynamics is positive. Most likely reason for the decline in waterfowl numbers is excessive spring hunting. A reduced hunting duration or the introduction of a moratorium every few years may be among the responses required. We suggest using the period of mass migration to monitor the waterfowl resource. This period is shorter and when the greatest number of birds migrate.

These cores were analyzed and compared with meteorological data (air temperature, precipitation, and wind) from climate stations in the study area. Comparison of metrological data from four stations shows similar climate fluctuations. When the temperature was high, less precipitation occurred in general. The sedimentary features measured in this study were water content, organic matter, carbonate, amorphous silica contents, whole and mineral grain size, and grain density. Excess Pb-210 measurements were used to estimate sedimentary ages. According to principal component analysis (PCA), temperature correlates well to sediment characteristics in Olgoy Lake. Whole and mineral grain sizes are coarser when the temperature is high, while the amorphous-silica concentration is lower. A coarse grain size is interpreted to reflect low lake levels due to evaporation under high temperature with less precipitation. Amorphous silica may be from surrounding plants and reflects less vegetation when the temperature is high. However, in the recent 30 years, after the social system changed and overgrazing became a problem, the amount of amorphous silica has positively correlated with temperature on a short time scale. In the past 30 years, with less vegetation, amorphous silica has mainly come from weathered mineral particles. High temperature caused a thick, weathered mantle for each mineral particle, resulting in high amorphous-silica concentration. In Boontsagaan Lake, whole and mineral grain sizes are coarser when the wind speed is increased. Low precipitation correlates with a decrease in organic matter and an increase in carbonate and amorphous silica. In Orog Lake, it is difficult to establish an age model due to dried-up events. Some fluctuations in sedimentary characteristics may correspond to extreme events, such as earthquakes, and natural hazards, such as dzuds (harsh winters).

Coastal Upwelling Influences Hypoxia Spatial Patterns and Nearshore Dynamics in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Hypoxia, defined as dissolved oxygen (DO) < 2 mg/L, in the central basin of Lake Erie has been studied since the mid-1900s. Even so, spatial patterns of hypoxia, and episodic hypoxia in nearshore areas where drinking water plant intakes are located, are not well characterized owing to limited observations and short-term dynamics. We evaluated a physically based, DO model with respect to patterns of hypoxia observed in Lake Erie. The DO model used assigned rates of sediment and water column oxygen demand that were temperature dependent but otherwise spatially and temporally uniform. The DO model was linked to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Lake Erie Operational Forecasting System hydrodynamic model, an application of the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). Model temperature and DO were compared with observations from ship-based studies, real-time sensor networks and an array of moored sensors that we deployed in 2017. In years with dominant southwesterly winds, persistent downwelling occurred along the south shore, which resulted in a thinner thermocline and earlier initiation of hypoxia along the south shore than the north. Occasional northeast winds temporarily reversed this pattern, causing upwelling along the south shore that brought hypoxic water to nearshore locations and water intakes. The DO model reproduced observed spatial and temporal patterns of hypoxia and revealed locations subject to episodes of hypoxia, including nearshore Ohio, north of Pelee Island, and near the Bass Islands. Model skill was limited in some respects, highlighting the importance of accurate simulation of the thermal structure and spatial patterns of oxygen demand rates. Plain Language Summary Hypoxia, defined as dissolved oxygen (DO) < 2 mg/L, results from a combination of physical and biological processes. Hypoxia in Lake Erie reduces habitat and food supply for fish and complicates drinking water treatment. We applied a mathematical model that was driven by weather information (wind and air temperature) and simulated water temperature, currents, and DO. By evaluating whether a model that focused on physical processes could predict hypoxia, we investigated the relative importance of physical versus biological drivers. We compared model temperature and DO with measurements conducted by us and by others. In years with dominant southwesterly winds, persistent downwelling occurred along the south shore, which resulted in a thinner thermocline and earlier initiation of hypoxia along the south shore than the north. Occasional northeast winds temporarily reversed this pattern, causing upwelling along the south shore that brought hypoxic water to nearshore locations and water intakes.

Observations on the metabolic activity (for algae and bacteria) and density (for all organisms) were carried out three times in 1990 using successive sampling of the same water parcel during its transport in the lower 660 km reach of the river. High algal densities (up to 170.5 mug chlorophyll a l-1), rotifers (up to 1728 l-1), crustaceans (up to 65 l-1) and bacteria (up to 16 x 10(9) l-1) were found. Algae and rotifers showed a rapid successive development during transport, while crustaceans were only abundant in the tidal reach of the river. In May, a vigorous growth of phytoplankton, zooplankton and bacteria was found. The diatom-dominated phytoplankton depleted the dissolved silicate in the river water and this led to a collapse of the populations, indicated by a decreased specific rate of photosynthesis (measured by the C-14 method) and vigorous bacterial growth (measured by [H-3]thymidine incorporation). Subsequently, the remaining phytoplankton diminished to very low levels near the river mouth. In July and September, it seemed that biological interactions within the plankton populations or between plankton and benthos balance the population densities so that separate developmental stages, as in spring, were less prominent. Estimates of the growth rates and loss rates of the phytoplankton were made. Phytoplankton exerted a substantial influence on the partitioning of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, silicate) over water and suspended matter (as analysed by element analysis). It seems likely that only the reduction of phosphate, as planned under the Rhine Action Programme, and not that of nitrogen, may restrict the peaks of plankton growth described here.					van Steveninck, Erik/M-7540-2013														0142-7873					OCT	1992	14	10					1351	1368		10.1093/plankt/14.10.1351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/14.10.1351													WOS:A1992JT94500001

H2 concentrations decreased with depth in the anaerobic hypolimnion and were often below the detection limit (2.5 nl of H2 l-1) in the water adjacent to the lake sediment. H2 was apparently not released from the lake sediment. The highest H2 concentrations (> 4 .mu.l of H2 l-1) were observed in the aerobic water of the epilimnion and metalimnion. There, the H2 concentrations changed with time, indicating a turnover of H2. The H2 production processes could not be studied in the laboratory since incubation of water samples in light or darkness did not result in H2 production but rather always in H2 consumption. The possible role of cyanobacteria and algae for H2 production is discussed. Aerobic or anaerobic H2 consumption activities were observed at all depths of the water column, with highest activities in the hypolimnion. Aerobic H2 consumption activity was insensitive to azide inhibition, but sensitive to heat, mercuric chloride or cyanide. It was restricted to a particle fraction of 0.2-3.0 .mu.m in size, so that it must be due to single bacterial cells. Aerobic hydrogen bacteria occurred in clusters of > 3.0 .mu.m. The hydrogen bacteria could not have caused the H2 consumption in lake water. The aerobic H2 consumption activity followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a Km of 67 nM H2. This is an exceptionally low value compared with Km values of hydrogenases in hydrogen bacteria and other species, but is similar to that for H2-decomposing abiontic soil hydrogenases.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1983	45	2					502	510		10.1128/AEM.45.2.502-510.1983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.45.2.502-510.1983								16346198					WOS:A1983QB28500023

First-Year Density and Growth as They Relate to Recruitment of White Perch to the Adult Stock in Oneida Lake, New York, 1968-2011	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Recruitment of fish to the adult stock is often determined early in life, and identifying relationships between first-year abundance and subsequent recruitment has significant implications for monitoring and management. Despite the importance of White Perch Morone americana as both predator and prey in systems where they are abundant, relatively little has been published on their early life history, and their recruitment patterns are generally not well understood. We use data over a period of 44 years to investigate factors related to first-year density and growth of White Perch and their recruitment to the adult stock in Oneida Lake, New York. Simple linear regression was used to examine the relationships between select physical and biological factors and first-year density and growth of White Perch estimated from Miller high-speed sampler and trawl surveys and estimates of year-class recruitment to the adult stock determined from gill-net surveys. Akaike's information criterion corrected for small sample size was then used to compare different model structures for predicting age-0 White Perch density and growth and recruitment to the adult stock. Year-classes that were dense at the larval stage tended to have higher densities as juveniles and higher recruitment to the adult stock. Year-classes with higher first-year densities grew slower and experienced higher mortality, but mortality did not compensate for the higher initial densities. The model that best explained White Perch recruitment to the adult stock was composed of larval density and predator biomass, indicating White Perch year-class strength is at least partly determined at the larval stage or earlier in Oneida Lake, and later interactions serve largely to modify initial differences.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					2016	145	2					416	426		10.1080/00028487.2015.1131743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2015.1131743													WOS:000374323600017
J	Fast, JD; Heilman, WE				Fast, JD; Heilman, WE			The effect of lake temperatures and emissions on ozone exposure in the western Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												A meteorological-chemical model with a 12-km horizontal grid spacing was used to simulate the evolution of ozone over the western Great Lakes region during a 30-day period in the summer of 1999. Lake temperatures in the model were based on analyses derived from daily satellite measurements. The model performance was evaluated using operational surface and upper-air meteorological measurements and surface chemical measurements. Reasonable agreement between the simulations and observations was obtained. The bias (predicted - observed) over the simulation period was only -1.3 ppb for the peak ozone mixing ratio during the day and 5.5 ppb for the minimum ozone mixing ratio at night. High ozone production rates were produced over the surface of the lakes as a result of stable atmospheric conditions that trapped ozone precursors within a shallow layer during the day. In one location, an increase of 200 ppb of ozone over a 9-h period was produced by chemical production that was offset by losses of 110 ppb through vertical mixing, horizontal transport, and deposition. The predicted ozone was also sensitive to lake temperatures. A simulation with climatological lake temperatures produced ozone mixing ratios over the lakes and around the lake shores that differed from the simulation with observed lake temperatures by as much as 50 ppb, while the differences over land were usually 10 ppb or less. Through a series of sensitivity studies that varied ozone precursor emissions, it was shown that a reduction of 50% in NOx or volatile organic compounds would lower the 60-ppb ozone exposure by up to 50 h month(-1) in the remote forest regions over the northern Great Lakes. The implications of these results on future climate change and air quality in the region are discussed.																			0894-8763					SEP	2003	42	9					1197	1217		10.1175/1520-0450(2003)042<1197:TEOLTA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(2003)042<1197:TEOLTA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000185088100001

Algal concentration and pH were measured during growth cycles, and inorganic C quantities determined by potentiometric Gran titrations and from pH-alkalinity relationships. After the primary growth with CO2 depletion and pH increase, successive CO2 enrichments induced further such cycles and produced a final 3- to 5-fold increase in algal biomas over that of unenriched controls. The extent of CO2 depletion, and pH rise, was greater in later cycles, indicative of some cellular adaptation. Values of pH reached 9.7 for Asterionella and 9.9 for Fragilaria. The lowest residual quantities of free CO2 were 0.1 and 0.03 .mu.mol l-1 for Asterionella and Fragilaria, respectively, which were less than 0.05% of the corresponding residual quantities of total CO2. The primary limitation of CO2 uptake and growth was probably related to the concentration of free CO2, given the relative excess of other major nutrients (N, P, Si) in the media used. Limited CO2 uptake could be restored without CO2 additions if the CO2 present was redistributed between its several forms (increasing free CO2) by the addition of strong acid, although growth was still restricted. Limitation of CO2 uptake, either by CO2 depletion or the addition of an inhibitor of photosynthesis (DCMU), increased the sinking rate of Asterionella cells from 0.3 to 1 m day-1. The possible ecological implications of CO2-pH growth and CO2-pH buoyancy relationships are discussed, which may contribute to the frequent paucity of diatoms during summer in many productive lakes.																			0007-1617						1981	16	4					395	410		10.1080/00071618100650461	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071618100650461													WOS:A1981MT76100008

However, due to the limitations of aeolian sand cover, it is challenging to directly investigate the underground contact relationship between lake water and groundwater. In the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) of China, the fresh groundwater near salt lakes is the sole source of drinking water. Consequently, a pressing concern arises regarding how groundwater exploitation impacts the intrusion of salt water into groundwater. In this study, Lake Cherigele (CRG) was chosen as a case to investigate the characteristics and migration mechanisms of the saltwater-freshwater interface using numerical simulation methods. The results reveal that: (1) The saltwater-freshwater mixing zone exhibits a wedge-shaped morphology, with a length of 250 to 290 m and a depth ranging from 50 to 70 m within the model. (2) The hydrodynamic conductivity coefficient (K) of the sand layer and molecular diffusion coefficient (Dm) in the desert are identified as the primary parameters influencing the characteristics of the interface. (3) The annual fluctuations in the current groundwater level have a limited impact on the saltwater-freshwater interface; however, excessive groundwater exploitation can lead to the intrusion of salt water into freshwater body. (4) The density difference between groundwater and lake water results in the concentration of groundwater flow lines around the lake, giving rise to the numerous springs observed in the field.					; Cheng, Zhongshuang/HWQ-4040-2023	CAO, Le/0000-0002-4062-2985; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2024	83	22							636	10.1007/s12665-024-11952-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-024-11952-0													WOS:001352387800001

Estimating slip distribution along the southernmost ∼80 km of the San Andreas Fault by examining tectonically offset features	GEOMORPHOLOGY												We measured tectonically offset geomorphic features along approximately 80 km of the southernmost San Andreas Fault (sSAF) between Bombay Beach and Indio Hills in the Salton Trough to obtain a better estimate for slip distribution and slip-per-event for the past several large, surface rupturing earthquakes along this segment of the fault. In addition to gathering aerial imagery from previously published B4 light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, we constructed new high-resolution orthomosaic images and digital surface models (DSMs) generated from Structure-from-Motion-Multiview Stereo (SfM-MVS) techniques from UAV imagery at multiple localities along the San Andreas fault in the Salton Trough region of California, which include study areas at Durmid Hill, Salt Creek, Ferrum, Mecca Hills, and Indio Hills. The aerial imagery, along with field mapping, were used to identify and measure a total of 146 offset features with lateral displacement measurements ranging between 1.5 and 23 m, with all measurements below 2.5 m found along multi-stranded sections of fault. Investigation of offset features suggests that the last several large, surface rupturing events produced average displacements of 3.0-4.4 m per event, with lower overall lateral slip values where multiple fault strands are present. Offset features along sections of the fault with multiple active strands with only partial displacement measured were not considered in our final slip distribution.

Irrigation is the main way for material migration, and it has been suggested as one of the sources of BPs. But the attention to irrigation water and sediment, and further to the ecological risks, is rare. In a hilly irrigation area in southern China, the partition and accumulation, contribution sources, and potential ecological risk of four bisphenols (BPA, bisphenol S, F, and AF) in the irrigation canal were investigated in the spring of 2023 and 2024. All four BPs were detected in the irrigation water and sediment. BPF was the dominant of 19.6-60.9 ng/L in water, while BPA was still the prominent compound (46.2-54.4% of & sum;BPs) in sediment. BPs in the irrigation canal were related to the direct discharge of aquaculture, domestic, and planting drainage. Although low risks for each compound, the comprehensive risk (& sum;RQ) of sediments went into medium risk. BPF and BPA were the main risk contributors. BPs in sediments increased steadily during the investigation. The special accumulative point was where slow flow maintained, especially caused by the hilly change. This comprehensive study of BPs in hilly irrigation canals should be valuable for reference in similar areas. And it will be beneficial for environmental protection and production safety.					huili, luo/HII-5170-2022; Anxin Li, Anxin Li/HKM-5946-2023														0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL 14	2025	197	8							910	10.1007/s10661-025-14358-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-14358-y								40653541					WOS:001527141500001

Impact of the artificial Czorsztyn Lake on groundwater and land management is assessed. The study is based on long-term observations of chemistry. groundwater levels and spring discharges during reservoir construction, filling, and 25-year-long exploitation. Land management changes caused by reservoir construction were recognized using remote sensing. Reservoir construction resulted in land management change in the study area. Built-up and forest areas gained prevalence over farmland areas. Two types of groundwater dominate: HCO3-Ca and HCO3-Ca-Mg, both before reservoir filling (68% analyses) and afterwards (95% analyses). and in control analyses from September 2020 (100% analyses). Gradual decrease in the occurrence of water types with the sulphate ion exceeding 20% mvals is documented, which points to water quality improvement trends. Moreover, changes of water saturation index values with regard to aquifer-forming mineral phases during reservoir construction and early exploitation phase indicate hydrochemical modifications. Decrease of groundwater level was related with transformation of the Dunajec river valley during reservoir construction and, accordingly, decrease of regional drainage base level. Groundwater level increased after reservoir filling, which points to coupled impact of the reservoir and increased precipitation recharge. Construction of the Czorsztyn Lake resulted in gradual land management transformation from farmlands into tourist-recreational areas. This change and river valley flooding by surface waters did not cause significant modifications in groundwater quantity and quality. Organization of water-sewage management related with reservoir construction resulted in noticeably improved quality trends.					; Krogulec, Ewa/AFH-8224-2022	Malecki, Jerzy/0000-0001-9382-0160; Zaszewski, Daniel/0000-0003-0830-8547; Humnicki, Wlodzimierz/0000-0001-9633-888X													2083-4772	2083-4810					2022	48	2					65	78		10.24425/aep.2022.140767	http://dx.doi.org/10.24425/aep.2022.140767													WOS:000826932000007

Evolution of NAO and AMO strength and cyclicity derived from a 3-ka varve-thickness record from Iceland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A 3000-year varve-thickness record from Hvitarvatn, a glacier-dominated lake in central Iceland, preserves inter-annual variations in the delivery of glacially eroded sediment to the lake. The first-order low-frequency trend in varve thickness reflects increased glacial erosion through the Late Holocene, reaching a peak during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Superimposed on this trend are large inter-annual to decadal fluctuations in varve thickness that we suggest reflect variability in climate parameters that determine the efficiency of the fluvial transport system to deliver glacially eroded sediment to the lake each year. We use spectral analysis to test whether regular high-frequency cyclicity in varve thickness exists in the 3-ka record after removing the low-frequency variability. Spectral analyses from three sediment cores recovered from the lake show essentially the same periods of 2.8-3.4, 13, 35-40 and 85-93, for the overlapping similar to 900-year period. Additionally, cycles of 55, 130 and 290 years are found in the spectrum for the 3000-year record that do not show up in the spectra for the shorter cores. Some of these cycles show similar variability to those of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). This relationship is supported by a significant correlation between varve thickness and both the NAO (precipitation) and AMO (summer temperature) indices over the 180-year instrumental period. NAO cyclicities (2-15 years) are weakly expressed in the first half of the record, increase between 600 and 1000 AD, decrease in strength during medieval time, and are most strongly expressed between 1300 AD and the early 20th century. AMO cyclicities (50 to 130 years) are also relatively weak in the first half of the record, becoming quite strong between 600 and 1000 AD and again between 1100 and 1500 AD, but are essentially absent through the peak of the LIA, between 1500 and 1900 AD, a time when strong cyclicities of about 35 years appear.

J	Scott, DM; Lucas, MC; Wilson, RW				Scott, DM; Lucas, MC; Wilson, RW			The effect of high pH on ion balance, nitrogen excretion and behaviour in freshwater fish from an eutrophic lake: A laboratory and field study	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Slapton Ley is a freshwater hyper-eutrophic lake of two basins connected by a narrow channel. One part of the lake experiences summer blooms of cyanobacteria and poor water quality, including elevated water pH (maximum pH recorded = 10.54), the other part is shaded by reed beds, and remains clear and neutral. This study used laboratory and field physiological measurements together with radio-tracking to investigate the potential impacts of alkaline pH on the physiology and behaviour of fish from Slapton Ley. Exposure of perch (Perca fluviatilis) from Slapton Ley to pH 9.50 water in the laboratory caused an immediate inhibition of sodium uptake and ammonia excretion to 34 and 32% of control levels, respectively. Net sodium balance recovered by day 3 of exposure whereas ammonia excretion only partially recovered to 60-70% of the control value from 8 h onwards. Urea excretion did not increase as a result of high pH exposure. Fish from the alkaline part of the lake (pH 9.90) had almost three-fold greater plasma ammonia compared to fish from neutral waters, indicating a pronounced disruption of ammonia excretion in the field. There was no significant disturbance to plasma sodium, chloride or total protein in fish sampled from the alkaline water of Slapton Ley. The radio-tracking provided no evidence of adult perch and pike (Esox lucius) trying to seek refuge front the alkaline conditions, despite having access to adjacent parts of the lake with neutral pH. It seems likely that there are advantages (e.g. better foraging, less predation) of withstanding the high pH conditions that outweigh the benefit of moving into more pH neutral parts of the lake.

In this study, oxygen isotopic compositions of bulk carbonates from Lake Kuhai in the headwaters of the Yellow River were evaluated as an indirect proxy of past Yellow River streamflow in order to place the recent flow reduction in a long-term context. The results indicated that delta 18O values of bulk carbonates from core KHC14-1 generally vary with changes in the Yellow River streamflows related to the precipitation/evaporation (temperature) ratio above the Tangnaihai hydrological station over the past 50 years. In general, the Yellow River streamflow in the headwaters area continued to decrease from the early 1980s to the late 1990s because of decreased precipitation and increased temperature. Then, the streamflow increased with enhancing precipitation over the last two decades. In addition, delta O-18 values of bulk carbonates in the Lake Kuhai core roughly correlate with the streamflows of the upper reaches of the Yellow River recorded by tree ring width over the past 800 years. The enriched delta O-18(BC) values showed that the precipitation/evaporation (P/E) ratio or streamflow was very low and the climate might be very dry in the middle of the 1400s CE in the headwaters of the Yellow River over the past 800 years. Our results suggested that changes in the P/E ratio or streamflow of the upper reaches of the Yellow River were dominated by variations in Indian Summer Monsoon precipitation over a long time scale, consistent with other records from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.

Study involved collection of sediments from various depositional environments for analyses. The sand-silt-clay ratios determined from these samples show that the sand percentage is varying between 71% and 95.22%, silt percentage varies between 3.06% and 15.54% and the clay percentage falls within 1.72-13.46% range indicating that the sand constitutes major part of the soil while clay fraction is generally negligible to minimum. It is in the vertical sections of some lake margins that fine lamiae of clay are seen. The organic carbon content and the inorganic carbon, as also the variation in the CaCO3 in the samples is very low. The sediments indicate a quartzose provenance and abundance of heavy minerals. Glacial till around Maitri were mapped on 1:1000 scale to understand the depositional history of sediments. The samples collected from each level were analysed for Accelerated Mass Spectrometer (AMS) dating. The results indicate four distinct surfaces of these deposits between the Priyadarshini Lake (towards north) and the area in the immediate vicinity of Maitri Station deposited between the span of 4702 and 8942 years BP. The surface textures and the morphological features on the quartz grains further indicate differential transportation, essentially by the glacial agency as the angularities of the edges are still preserved and the sub-rounding to rounding of the grains, typical of the fluvial action, is present only in case of channel deposits. Periods of residency of the grains for long span of time is shown by the engraved features on the surfaces of the quartz grains.																					978-3-030-21679-5; 978-3-030-21678-8				2020							31	57		10.1007/978-3-030-21679-5_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-21679-5_4	10.1007/978-3-030-21679-5												WOS:000672411400006

Water quality in mined out open pits can present a water treatment challenge at the time the pit is flooded. For the uranium industry water quality concerns are of particular significance, because of the long-term concerns relating to the radionuclides. The B-Zone pit in Northern Saskatchewan was force flooded in the winter of 1991. It was used as the research facility to demonstrate that natural water cleansing processes can be quantified and thus, through optimization, utilized as a process to improve water quality. Contaminants of concern were low concentrations of As and Ni (0.22 mg/L and 0.03 to 0.26 mg/L) in the 5 million in 3 pit. Particulate matter sedimenting to the bottom of the pit, forming the sediment, was quantified with sedimentation traps. The traps were placed at 2, 12, 22 and 32 in ranged from 0.8 to 28.7 g/m(2)/day, declining from the high rates in 1993 to lower rates in 1999. Sediment was collected in 1997 and 1999 from the bottom of the pit and the concentrations in the top layer of the samples agreed well in concentration determined in the particulate matter from the sedimentation traps. In total over the observation period, sedimenting particulate transported 42 g/m(2) As and 18 g/m(2) Ni to the bottom sediment in which 30 g/m(2) As and 17 g/m(2) Ni were determined. The surface layer up to 3 cm. thick consisted of organic matter, which originated within the pit. Through stimulating algae growth, water quality can be improved as evidenced by this data set, representing a sustainable approach to decommissioning pit lakes.

The fades in such basins are thus characterised by frequently changed fades and complex relationship of overlapped sand bodies (e.g. Liaoxi Depression of Liaodong Bay, Bohai Sea, China). Therefore, it's a great challenge to quantitatively describe evolution of sand bodies and their overlap relationship. In this study a three-dimensional stratigraphic forward model is used to solve this problem, which is corrected according to well log data. After the parameter optimization was verified against borehole strata thickness and lithology, this model had a thickness error within 8%, and the lithology distribution agreed with the well data as a whole. Four evolution phases of the Shahejie 3 Formation were recognised through the modeling. In the first phase, the lake level rose, and the eastern fan delta sand developed. In the second phase, the fan delta sand scaled up, and the braided river delta front sand developed at a small scale. In the third phase, the lake level shifted from falling to rising, the fan delta sand further expanded the scale, and the braided river delta developed at a large scale. Sands on both sides overlapped at a large scale. In the fourth phase, the lake level rose, the lake basin expanded, and lake shale was the main lithology in the study area. From the sedimentary evolution of Es3 formation, sand overlapped in the third stage. In 39.75 Ma, two parts of the sand body began to overlap and reached largest scale in 39.6 Ma, which was approximately 10 km(2). Both then retrograded to a separation in 39 Ma when the overlap ended. Coupling stratigraphic forward simulation with uncertainty quantification allowed us to estimate the influence of each stratigraphic parameter on sand overlap. Fluvial discharge appears to be the most influential parameter while the initial bathymetry and lake level variations exert a minor to moderate impact. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The organism was found in water samples collected at sites in mountainous (over 80 km from potato-producing regions), trasitional (upland) and arable regions every month in 1982 and 1983. Filter concentration and anaerobic enrichment of 3-10 l of water yielded E. carotovora from 82.cntdot.8% of the water samples collected from streams, canals and lakes. The organism was detected by direct enrichment of 50 ml water samples in 56.cntdot.3% of surface water samples collected. Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora was the predominant subspecies isolated. Of 1029 strains, 999 (97.cntdot.1%) were identified as E. carotovora subsp. carotovora and 30 (2.cntdot.9%) as E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica. Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica was found primarily in water samples collected in arable regions during spring months. Erwinia chrysanthemi was never isolated. Quantitative bacteriological methods were used in 1982 and 1983 to monitor populations of E. carotovora in two streams in south central Colorado. These ranged from undetectable levels to 8.cntdot.5 cfu/ml of water in Rio Grande River and Saguache Creek. Maximum populations were usually reached by August or September in both streams in both years. Erwinia carotovora was isolated from well water samples collected in the San Luis Valley, but only 15.cntdot.6 and 15.cntdot.4% of the samples yielded the organism during 1982 and 1983, respectively. Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica was found only once, and E. carotovora subsp. carotovora was the predominant subspecies detected.

With the immense strain of resources and environment, it is critical to assess whether human activities fall within the carrying capacity range of a natural ecosystem in a rural system. Taking the rural areas of Liyang county as an example, this study aims to assess the rural resource and environmental carrying capacity (RRECC) and diagnose its critical obstacles. Firstly, a social-ecological framework focusing on human-environment interaction was employed to construct the RRECC indicator system. Subsequently, the entropy-TOPSIS method was introduced to assess the performance of the RRECC. Finally, the obstacle diagnosis method was applied to identify the critical obstacles of RRECC. Our results show that the distribution of RRECC presents a spatial heterogeneity, with high- and medium-high-level villages primarily concentrated in the south of the study area, where there are abundant hills and ecological lakes. Medium-level villages are scattered throughout each town, and low and medium-low level villages are concentrated across all the towns. Moreover, the resource subsystem of RRECC (RRECC_RS) exhibits a similar spatial distribution to RRECC, while the outcome subsystem of RRECC (RRECC_OS) has a comparable quantity proportion of different levels to RRECC. Furthermore, the diagnosis results of critical obstacle vary between the town scale divided by administrative units and the regional scale divided by RRECC values. In detail, arable land occupied by construction is the main critical obstacle at the town scale, while the poor people in villages, people left-behind, and arable land occupied by construction are the main critical obstacles at the regional scale. Targeted differentiated improvement strategies for RRECC at regional scale from various perspectives of global, local, and single are proposed. This research can serve as a theoretical foundation for assessing RRECC and developing differentiated sustainable development strategies for the path forward to rural revitalization.

Properly Timing Foliar-applied Fertilizers Increases Efficacy: A Review and Update on Timing Foliar Nutrient Applications to Citrus and Avocado	HORTTECHNOLOGY												Foliar fertilization efficiently meets the nutrient demand of tree fruit crops during periods when soil conditions (low or high temperatures, low or excess soil moisture, pH, salinity) render soil-applied fertilizers ineffective, when nutrients (e.g., phosphate, potassium, and trace elements) become fixed in the soil, and when tree nutrient demand is high. Applying nutrients directly to leaves ensures that the metabolic machinery of the tree is not compromised by low availability of an essential nutrient. It should be noted that phloem mobile nutrients applied to the foliage are translocated to all tree parts, even feeder roots. Because foliar application of fertilizers can reduce nutrient accumulation in soil, runoff water, surface water (streams, lakes, ocean), and groundwater (drinking water supply), where they contribute to salinity, eutrophication, or nitrate contamination, with negative consequences to the environment and humans, it is highly desirable to replace soil-applied fertilizers at least in part with foliar-applied fertilizers. However, not all nutrients are taken up through leaves and, even if taken up, some nutrients are not phloem mobile. In addition, although foliar fertilizer rates are typically lower than soil fertilizer rates, application can be more costly. The goal has been to time the application of foliar fertilizers to key stages of citrus (Citrus sp.) and avocado (Persea americana) tree phenology when demand for the nutrient is likely to be high and especially when soil conditions are likely to compromise nutrient uptake by roots. This approach has proven successful for increasing yield, fruit size, and grower income even when the tree is not nutrient deficient by standard leaf analysis. Winter prebloom foliar-applied low-biuret urea was previously documented to increase total yield of both navel and 'Valencia' oranges (Citrus sinensis). Adaptation of this treatment to 'Nules' Clementine mandarin (Citrus reticulata) increased the yield of commercially valuable size fruit in two experiments. Foliar application of boron or low-biuret urea to 'Hass' avocado trees at the "cauliflower" stage of inflorescence development increased total yield; potassium phosphite applied at this stage of tree phenology increased the yield of commercially valuable size fruit.																			1063-0198	1943-7714				OCT	2013	23	5					536	541		10.21273/HORTTECH.23.5.536	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.23.5.536													WOS:000333481200002

Effects of water warming on bank filtration: experimental enclosure studies	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT VII	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment				7th International Conference on Sustainable Water Resources Management	MAY 21-23, 2013	ENGLAND	Wessex Inst Technol, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm, Int Journal Sustainable Dev & Planning				In the context of climate change artificial recharge of groundwater becomes increasingly important. The two main climate change factors affecting ground water recharge performance are water warming and extreme precipitation events with drought and floods. This will strongly influence self-purification processes, indirectly due to changes in the stratification and circulation characteristics of the lake and directly due to the intensification of metabolic processes and biodegradation efficiency, which are responsible for water self-purification. At the study site Lake Tegel, Berlin (Germany), epilimnion water warming of 0.9 degrees C per decade from 1980 to 2007 was detected. Moreover, continuous measurements of temperature for a yearly period from 2010 to 2011 in the open-water epilimnion and littoral zone showed a maximum difference of 5.2 degrees C on a sunny summer day (T-Lake,T-max = 25.3 degrees C, T-Air,T-max = 26.2 degrees C). The present work describes the development and operation of enclosure field experiments conducted to simulate water warming (up to 30 degrees C) and to provide a detailed picture of the processes which occur in the uppermost sediment layers (0-20 cm depth) at a littoral bank site. To illustrate the performance of the enclosure setup with a mean temperature increase of 4.6 degrees C (May-August 2012), microbial activity as well as pore water analysis was examined monthly. Microbial activity was measured by enzymatic TTC- and FDA-methods. Both showed a highly microbial active upper layer down to 5 and 10 cm depth, respectively. However, no clear water warming effects on redox-chemical and microbial activity could be detected. This paper is intended to contribute to an ongoing discussion, if in-situ enclosures enable realistic experimental studies to allow investigations of the interactions between simulated climate warming and their impacts on biological structure and ecosystem processes.																			1743-3541		978-1-84564-710-0				2013	171						209	224		10.2495/WRM130191	http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/WRM130191													WOS:000341003400019
J	Selitrina, TL				Selitrina, Tamara L.			NEO-GOTHIC TREND IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN TEENAGE LITERATURE (JOHN AUGUST'S ARLO FINCH TRILOGY)	PHILOLOGICAL CLASS												The article analyzes the novels by a famous American screenwriter John August "Arlo Finch in the Valley of Fire" (2018), "Arlo Finch in the Lake of the Moon" (2019) and "Arlo Finch in the Kingdom of Shadows" (2020). The trilogy of Arlo Finch is the author's literary debut. It is demonstrated that the author makes extensive use of literary allusions and reminiscences, images and motifs of mythology, and materials of European medieval legends. Written in praise of the scouts, reminding of fortitude, endurance, perseverance and group solidarity, the novel is filled with intense drama, as teenagers during a sports game fall into the world of the Long Woods, the world of death, understood as a transgressive transition to another world. The magical world serves as a means of testing the protagonist and his initiation. In contrast to a widespread theme of suicide in contemporary American literature for teenagers, John August's trilogy is filled with optimism, since it inspires the reader with confidence in the world and man. Despite the game setting, the book is open to the latest spiritual trends. John August places the novel in the genre system of fantasy, however, in our opinion, the genre specificity of a fairy tale and Neo-Gothic novel are clearly visible here. It is proved that the interference of the unknown supernatural for-ces in the characters' fates is interpreted as hidden, not yet known.																			2071-2405						2022	27	2					208	216																WOS:000829115600020

These caves have no direct connection with the sea, and form at or close to the tidally influenced fluctuating water table. After sea-level fall, in their subaerial parts caves are enlarged mainly by rock dissolution and by erosion close to the water level, condensation-corrosion and breakdown processes. For understanding the geomorphological features observed in these caves and how they are related to light attenuation, we investigated three sampling sites in the tidally influenced zone of Lighthouse Cave, which has been re-invaded by seawater during the Holocene sea-level highstand. A freshwater lens no longer exists within or adjacent to the cave. Rock samples were collected above and below the internal lake shores close to the entrance, and in the twilight and dark zones of this cave. Light and electron microscopy examinations were conducted for detecting microbial cells, as well as bioconstruction and bioweathering features. In addition, a high precision laser scanner was used for characterising sample microtopography. Our data showed that the microtopography and geomorphology of the lake shore samples (cave entrance) are dominated by bioweathering, whereas the samples of the twilight and dark zones are controlled by a combination of both bioweathering and bioconstructive processes depending on light availability. Bioconstructive structures, such as semi-planar lamination, at the fluctuating water level of the Lighthouse Cave show that dissolution due to water mixing of sea and freshwater in the Holocene is no longer the most important speleogenetic process. We propose that the geomorphological evolution is strongly influenced by the degree of rock diagenesis more than the initial mechanism of speleogenesis.

The objectives of this study are to understand Hg transfer in the food web in this eutrophic, shallow lake and to evaluate the exposure risk of Hg through fish consumption. Biota samples including macrophytes, sestons, benthic animals, and fish were collected from Lake Taihu in the fall of 2009. The total mercury (THg), methyl mercury (MeHg), delta C-13 and delta N-15 in the samples were measured. The signature for delta N-15 increased with the trophic levels. Along with a diet composed of fish, the significant relationship between the delta C-13 and delta N-15 indicated that a pelagic foraging habitat is the dominant pathway for energy transfer in Lake Taihu. The concentrations of THg and MeHg in the organisms varied dramatically by similar to 3 orders of magnitude from primary producers (macrophytes and sestons) to piscivorous fish. The highest concentrations of both THg (100 ng g(-1)) and MeHg (66 ng g(-1)), however, were lower than the guideline of 200 ng g(-1) of MeHg for vulnerable populations that is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The daily intake of THg and MeHg of 92 and 56 ng day(-1) kg(-1) body weight, respectively, was generally lower than the tolerable intake of 230 ng day(-1) kg(-1) body weight for children recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. Significant relationships between the delta N-15 and the logarithm of THg and MeHg showed an obvious biomagnification of Hg along the food web. The logarithmic bioaccumulation factor of MeHg in the fish (up to 5.7) from Lake Taihu, however, was relatively low compared to that of other aquatic ecosystems. Health risk of exposure to Hg by consumption of fish for local residents is relatively low in the Lake Taihu area. Dilution of Hg levels in the phytoplankton induced by eutrophication is a possible factor inhibiting accumulation of MeHg in fish in eutrophic Lake Taihu.					王, 少锋/K-6612-2013; Wei, Chaoyang/AHB-0836-2022; Jia, Yongfeng/HGF-2271-2022	Wang, Shaofeng/0000-0001-6989-336X													0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2012	19	7					2820	2831		10.1007/s11356-012-0787-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-0787-2								22351254					WOS:000306790200037

Boulder rounding appears related to the cirque-to-moraine transport distance at each site with subrounded boulders being typical of the 2-km-long Chicago Lakes Glacier, subangular boulders being typical of the 1-km-long Butler Gulch Glacier, and angular boulders being typical of the few-hundred-m-long Isabelle Glacier. Surface-exposure ages of angular boulders from the Isabelle Glacier moraine, which formed during the Little Ice Age (LIA) according to previous lichenometric dating, indicate cosmogenic inheritance values ranging from 0 to similar to 3.0 Be-10 ka. (1) Subangular boulders from the Butler Gulch end moraine yielded surface-exposure ages ranging from 5 to 10.2 Be-10 ka. We suggest that this moraine was deposited during the 8.2 cal ka event, which has been associated with outburst floods from Lake Agassiz and Lake Ojibway, and that the large age range associated with the Butler Gulch end moraine is caused by cosmogenic shielding of and(or) spalling from boulders that have ages in the younger part of the range and by cosmogenic inheritance in boulders that have ages in the older part of the range. The surface-exposure ages of eight of nine subrounded boulders from the Chicago Lakes area fall within the 13.0-11.7 Be-10 ka age range, and appear to have been deposited during the Younger Dryas interval. The general lack of inheritance in the eight samples probably stems from the fact that only a few thousand years intervened between the retreat of the Pinedale glacier and the advance of the Chicago Lakes glacier; in addition, bedrock in the Chicago Lakes cirque area may have remained covered with snow and ice during that interval, thus partially shielding the bedrock from cosmogenic radiation.

Carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic compositions from sediment organic matter, algal pigments, and diatom assemblages are integrated to provide robust indices of paleoclimatic variability. In particular, the ratio between individual carotenoid pigments (lutein:diatoxanthin) reveals a shift in dominant primary production from 'green' taxa (chlorophytes, higher plants, and bryophytes) during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) to 'brown' taxa (diatoms and chrysophytes) over the mid- to late Holocene. Green pigment abundance appears most sensitive to mean summer temperatures, and their increased relative abundance in the past serves as an indicator of warm times. Regionally, the HTM occurred shortly after local deglaciation (10 ka), persisting until similar to 7 ka. This timing agrees with that revealed by chironomid assemblages and ice-core records elsewhere in the Canadian Arctic, but is significantly earlier than suggestions from palynology on Baffin Island. This study provides additional evidence that this discrepancy represents the ecesis for higher plant dispersal and colonization on distal, freshly deglaciated landscapes. Pigment and diatom data indicate that mid Holocene cooling began between 7 and 6 ka, intensifying after 3 ka. All proxies show pronounced change after 1.5 ka, with the greatest divergence from average Holocene values occurring during the Little Ice Age (LIA), supporting the growing consensus that the LIA was the coldest multi-centennial interval of the Holocene. In the twentieth century, most proxies, including sedimentary carotenoid ratios, abruptly returned to a similar state as the Holocene Thermal Maximum, while diatom species assemblages present a more muted response. This underscores that anthropogenic alteration of the Earth system has created conditions with no exact analog in the past 10,000 years. Collectively, these results add new information on the dimensions of Arctic lake responses to Holocene climate change, which in turn can be used to reconcile paleoclimate reconstructions from diverse proxies.					; Geirsdottir, Aslaug/L-3267-2015; Fogel, Marilyn/M-2395-2015; Geirsdóttir, Áslaug/L-3267-2015; Vinebrooke, Rolf/A-3766-2014	Florian, Christopher/0000-0003-4217-0684; Geirsdottir, Aslaug/0000-0003-3125-0195; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2015	54	1					53	69		10.1007/s10933-015-9835-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-015-9835-5													WOS:000355218100003
J	Demchenko, N; Chubarenko, I; van Heijst, G				Demchenko, Natalia; Chubarenko, Irina; van Heijst, GertJan			On the fine structure of the thermal bar front	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												The thermal bar-a hydrodynamic phenomenon, arising in natural basins due to successive changes of the water temperature across the temperature of maximum density (T-m, which is close to 4 degrees C)-has been studied in laboratory experiments and by numerical simulations. The experiments were performed in a rectangular tank with an inclined bottom, filled with water with initial temperature T-0 < T-m and then heated at the surface. During the heating a basin-wide circulation develops, consisting of down-slope cascades in regions where T < T-m, a subsurface off-shore jet in the region where T > T-m, and a compensating flow at intermediate depths towards the shallow part of the tank, supplying both off-shore flows with waters from deeper regions. Analysis of the water temperature and density fields as well as the currents has revealed that the location of the convergence zone of the surface current (when formed) does not coincide with that of the T-m-isotherm. The thermal bar front is typically understood as a convergence zone near the 4 degrees C-isotherm, formed due to the effect of cabbeling. Our experiments demonstrate, however, that the front is associated with the leading edge of the subsurface current. The increasing distance between the 4 degrees C-isotherm and the subsurface jet has been recorded in the laboratory experiments. Numerical simulation results corroborate the laboratory experiments. A scaling analysis predicts the speed of propagation of this frontal zone to be U similar to [g x Lambda rho/rho xH](1/2), where H is the depth (increasing with time) of the upper thermo-active layer, rho(0) a reference density, and Delta rho is the characteristic horizontal density difference across the front. A combined analysis of laboratory, field and numerical data has corroborated this law.

Geochemical and isotopic characterization of the Bodele Depression dust source and implications for transatlantic dust transport to the Amazon Basin	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The Bodele Depression (Chad) in the central Sahara/Sahel region of Northern Africa is the most important source of mineral dust to the atmosphere globally. The Bodele Depression is purportedly the largest source of Saharan dust reaching the Amazon Basin by transatlantic transport. Here, we have undertaken a comprehensive study of surface sediments from the Bodele Depression and dust deposits (Chad, Niger) in order to characterize geochemically and isotopically (Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes) this dust source, and evaluate its importance in present and past African dust records. We similarly analyzed sedimentary deposits from the Amazonian lowlands in order to assess postulated accumulation of African mineral dust in the Amazon Basin, as well as its possible impact in fertilizing the Amazon rainforest. Our results identify distinct sources of different ages and provenance in the Bodele Depression versus the Amazon Basin, effectively ruling out an origin for the Amazonian deposits, such as the Belterra Clay Layer, by long-term deposition of Bodele Depression material. Similarly, no evidence for contributions from other potential source areas is provided by existing isotope data (Sr, Nd) on Saharan dusts. Instead, the composition of these Amazonian deposits is entirely consistent with derivation from in-situ weathering and erosion of the Precambrian Amazonian craton, with little, if any, Andean contribution. In the Amazon Basin, the mass accumulation rate of eolian dust is only around one-third of the vertical erosion rate in shield areas, suggesting that Saharan dust is "consumed" by tropical weathering, contributing nutrients and stimulating plant growth, but never accumulates as such in the Amazon Basin. The chemical and isotope compositions found in the Bodele Depression are varied at the local scale, and have contrasting signatures in the "silica-rich" dry lake-bed sediments and in the "calcium-rich" mixed diatomites and surrounding sand material. This unexpected finding implies that the Bodele Depression material is not "pre-mixed" at the source to provide a homogeneous source of dust. Rather, different isotope signatures can be emitted depending on subtle vagaries of dust-producing events. Our characterization of the Bodele Depression components indicate that the Bodele "calcium-rich" component, identified here, is most likely released via eolian processes of sand grain saltation and abrasion and may be significant in the overall global budget of dusts carried out by the Harmattan low-level jet during the winter.

On the basis of the retention curves of the two lakes that formed in the north-western and south-western sectors, we calculated the total infiltration capacity of the polje to have a maximum value of 3-3.5 m(3)/s. Thus we infer that when the flow of the Arroyo de la Madre exceeds this value, there will be a risk of flooding in the polje. We also propose a model for the 1996 flood that can be extended to other similar occurrences in this and other poljes where we can establish the role played by groundwater and surface water during this flood. In response to the heavy precipitation, the flow of the Arroyo de la Madre rose abruptly, exceeding the infiltration capacity of the main swallow holes on the polje, causing first the northern lake and then the southern lake to form with only surface water supply. The water table of the karst aquifer rose sharply, reaching a situation of equilibrium between the level in the lakes and the water table in this sector that prevented infiltration through the swallow holes. In the case of the southern lake, there were even cases of swallow holes that began to operate as estavelles. During this phase of maximum flooding one single lake was present, which was divided into two once more when the water table of the karst aquifer in the polje sector began to fall and surface supply also began to decrease.

Paleolimnological evidence of the response of the central Canadian treeline zone to radiative forcing and hemispheric patterns of temperature change over the past 2000 years	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Instrumental climate records from the central Canadian treeline zone display a pattern of variation similar to general Northern Hemisphere temperature trends. To examine whether this general correspondence extends back beyond the instrumental record, we obtained a sediment core from Lake S41, a small lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada at 63A degrees 43.11'A N, 109A degrees 19.07'A W. A radiocarbon-based chronology was developed for the core. The sediments were analyzed for organic-matter content by loss-on-ignition (LOI), biogenic-silica content (BSi), and chironomid community composition to reconstruct July air temperature and summer water temperature. The paleolimnological records were compared with records of atmospheric CO2 concentration, solar variability, and hemispheric temperature variations over the past 2000 years. The results of the analyses suggest that widely-documented long-term variations in Northern Hemisphere temperature associated with radiative forcing, namely the cooling following the medieval period during the Little Ice Age (LIA), and twentieth century warming, are represented in the central Canadian treeline zone. There is also evidence of a brief episode of warming during the eighteenth century. As evidenced by LOI and BSi, the twentieth century warming is typified by increased lake productivity relative to the LIA. Depending upon the measure, the increased productivity of the twentieth century nearly equals or exceeds that of any other period in the past 2000 years. In contrast, the rate of chironomid head capsule accumulation decreased and remained low during the twentieth century. Although the chironomid-inferred temperature reconstructions indicate cooling during the LIA, they present no evidence of greatly increased temperatures during the twentieth century. Warming during the twentieth century might have enhanced lake stratification, and the response of the chironomid fauna to warming was attenuated by decreased oxygen and lower temperatures in the hypolimnion of the more stratification-prone lake.					; Kaufman, Darrell/A-2471-2008; Porinchu, DF/S-4360-2019	Rolland, Nicolas/0000-0001-9883-8124; Porinchu, David/0000-0002-0495-3082; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2009	41	1					129	141		10.1007/s10933-008-9250-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9250-2													WOS:000262505400009
J	Allan, EL; Froneman, PW				Allan, E. L.; Froneman, P. W.			Spatial and temporal patterns in bacterial abundance, production and viral infection in a temporarily open/closed southern African estuary	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The spatial and temporal patterns in bacterial abundance, biomass, production, nanoflagellate abundance and the loss of bacterial production due to viral lysis were investigated in a temporarily open/closed estuary along the eastern seaboard of southern Africa over the period May 2006 to April 2007. Bacterial abundance, biomass and production ranged between 1.00 x 10(9) and 4.93 x 10(9) cells l(-1), 32.43 and 108.59 mu g C l(-1) and 0.01 and 1.99 mu g C l(-1) h(-1), respectively. With a few exceptions there were no significant spatial patterns in the values (P > 0.05). Bacterial abundance, biomass and production, however, demonstrated a distinct temporal pattern with the lowest values consistently recorded during the winter months. Bacterial dynamics showed no effect of mouth opening events. Nanoflagellate and bacterial abundances were significantly correlated to one another (P < 0.05) suggesting a strong predator-prey relationship. The frequency of visibly infected bacterial cells and the number of virus particles within each bacterial cell during the study demonstrated no significant temporal or spatial pattern (P > 0.05) and ranged from 0.5 to 6.1% and 12.0 to 37.5 virus particles per bacterium, respectively. Viral infection and lysis was thus a constant source of bacterial mortality throughout the year. The estimated percentage of bacterial production removed by viral lysis ranged between 7.8 and 88.9% (mean = 30.3%) of the total which suggests that viral lysis represents a very important source of bacterial mortality during the study.

Holocene environmental changes in the highlands of the southern Peruvian Andes (14°S) and their impact on pre-Columbian cultures	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												High-altitude peatlands of the Andes still remain relatively unexploited although they offer an excellent opportunity for well-dated palaeoenvironmental records. To improve knowledge about climatic and environmental changes in the western Andes of southern Peru, we present a high-resolution record of the Cerro Llamoca peatland for the last 8600 years. The 10.5m long core consists of peat and intercalated sediment layers and was examined for all kinds of microfossils. We chose homogeneous peat sections for pollen analysis at decadal to centennial resolution. The inorganic geochemistry was analysed in 2mm resolution (corresponding > 2 years) using an ITRAX X-ray fluorescence core scanner. We interpret phases of relatively high abundances of Poaceae pollen in our record as an expansion of Andean grasslands during humid phases. Drier conditions are indicated by a significant decrease of Poaceae pollen and higher abundances of Asteraceae pollen. The results are substantiated by changes in arsenic contents and manganese/iron ratios, which turned out to be applicable proxies for in situ palaeoredox conditions. The mid-Holocene period of 8.6-5.6 ka is characterised by a series of episodic dry spells alternating with spells that are more humid. After a pronounced dry period at 4.6-4.2 ka, conditions generally shifted towards a more humid climate. We stress a humid/relatively stable interval between 1.8 and 1.2 ka, which coincides with the florescence of the Nasca culture in the Andean foothills. An abrupt turn to a sustained dry period occurs at 1.2 ka, which is contemporaneous with the demise of the Nasca/Wari society in the Palpa lowlands. Markedly drier conditions prevail until 0.75 ka, providing evidence of the presence of a Medieval Climate Anomaly. Moister but hydrologically highly variable conditions prevailed again after 0.75 ka, which allowed re-expansion of tussock grasses in the highlands, increased discharge into the Andean foreland and resettling of the lowlands during this so-called late Intermediate Period (LIP). On a supraregional scale, our findings can ideally be linked to and proved by the archaeological chronology of the Nasca-Palpa region as well as other high-resolution marine and terrestrial palaeoenvironmental records. Our findings show that hydrological fluctuations, triggered by the changing intensity of the monsoonal tropical summer rains emerging from the Amazon Basin in the north-east, have controlled the climate in the study area.					; Reindel, Markus/HGD-0736-2022; Schäbitz, Frank/ABE-5116-2020; Wennrich, Volker/I-3435-2012	Schittek, Karsten/0000-0002-2135-7856; Wennrich, Volker/0000-0003-3617-1963													1814-9324	1814-9332					2015	11	1					27	44		10.5194/cp-11-27-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-11-27-2015													WOS:000348928700003

A semistandardized methodology for 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) analysis was proposed that featured similar physical and chemical conditions yet allowed for different instrumentation and techniques. Postmitochondrial supernatants (PMSs) were analyzed for EROD activity by 14 laboratories, and repeat EROD analyses were performed within one laboratory to estimate within-laboratory variability. All laboratories found significantly higher levels of EROD activity (approximately threefold) in males from the BKME-exposed site; only 5 of 14 laboratories found significantly higher levels in exposed females. Data from three labs were dropped from the analysis because of outlying values. The mean coefficient of variation (C.V.) for the remaining 11 laboratories was 34.7%, which was not significantly different from the C.V. determined for Six analyses by one technician (28.4%). The mean C.V. for five analysts within one laboratory was significantly lower (16.4%) than either of the former values. There was no difference in absolute values or the variability of microplate and conventional EROD assay data. Analysis of Bradford and Lowry protein data showed that both assays have low variability (C.V.s = 16.8 and 17.4%, respectively); these two techniques produced very similar estimates of protein content. Immunochemical analysis demonstrated a significant correlation existed among microsomal P4501A concentration and EROD activity.

J	Dielforder, A; Hetzel, R				Dielforder, Armin; Hetzel, Ralf			The deglaciation history of the Simplon region (southern Swiss Alps) constrained by 10Be exposure dating of ice-molded bedrock surfaces	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The deglaciation history of the Swiss Alps after the Last Glacial Maximum involved the decay of several ice domes and the subsequent disintegration of valley glaciers at high altitude. Here we use bedrock exposure dating to reconstruct the temporal and spatial pattern of ice retreat at the Simplon Pass (altitude: similar to 2000 m) located 40 km southwest of the 'Rhone ice dome'. Eleven Be-10 exposure ages from glacially polished quartz veins and ice-molded bedrock surfaces cluster tightly between 13.5 +/- 0.6 ka and 15.4 +/- 0.6 ka (internal errors) indicating that the Simplon Pass depression became ice-free at 14.1 +/- 0.4 ka (external error of mean age). This age constraint is interpreted to record the melting of the high valley glaciers in the Simplon Pass region during the warm Bolling-Allerod interstadial shortly after the Oldest Dryas stadial. Two bedrock samples collected a few hundred meters above the pass depression yield older Be-10 ages of 17.8 +/- 0.6 ka and 18.0 +/- 0.6 ka. These ages likely reflect the initial downwasting of the Rhone ice dome and the termination of the ice transfluence from the ice dome across the Simplon Pass toward the southern foreland. There, the retreat of the piedmont glacier in Val d'Ossola was roughly synchronous with the decay of the Rhone ice dome in the interior of the mountain belt, as shown by Be-10 ages of 17.7 +/- 0.9 ka and 16.1 +/- 0.6 ka for a whaleback at similar to 500 m elevation near Montecrestese in northern Italy. In combination with well-dated paleoclimate records derived from lake sediments, our new age data suggest that during the deglaciation of the European Alps the decay of ice domes was approximately synchronous with the retreat of piedmont glaciers in the foreland and was followed by the melting of high-altitude valley glaciers after the transition from the Oldest Dryas to the Belling-Allerod, when mean annual temperatures rose rapidly by similar to 3 degrees C.

J	BLINDOW, I				BLINDOW, I			LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DYNAMICS OF SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES IN 2 SHALLOW EUTROPHIC LAKES	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Periods with dear water and abundant submerged vegetation have alternated with periods of turbid water and sparse vegetation during recent decades in Lake Takern and Lake Krankesjon, two shallow, calcium-rich, moderately eutrophic lakes in southern Sweden. Between 1983 and 1991, submerged vegetation (predominant species: Chara tomentosa, Nitellopsis obtusa, Myriophyllum spicatum) covered about 50% of the open lake area in Lake Takern. In Lake Krankesjon, submerged vegetation was sparse during 1983-84, but increased continuously in the following years and covered about 50% of the open lake area by 1990 and 1991. Potamogeton pectinatus was the first species to expand in Lake Krankesjon, but was later replaced by C. tomentosa. 2. During 1983-84, turbidity was high in Lake Krankesjon, which indicated that submerged macrophytes were light-limited. During 1986-91, there was a negative correlation between the areal coverage of charophytes and angiosperms, indicating that competition for space had become an important limiting factor. The same negative correlation was found in Lake Takern for 1983-91. 3. Charophytes had much higher biomass per unit area than angiosperms in both lakes and reduced water movement considerably. This was probably one reason for the increase of water transparency in Lake Krankesjon during the spatial expansion of these plants. Charophytes also stored large amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen. Charophytes are probably superior competitors for both space and nutrients and thus have competitive advantage over angiosperms in this lake type. 4. In Lake Krankesjon, both P. pectinatus and C. tomentosa were negatively affected by high water level during the growing period. Total disappearance of submerged vegetation occurred in both lakes after catastrophic events (dry-out during summer or mechanical damage by ice) caused by extremely low water level. Changes in water level are thus one of the most important reasons for among-year fluctuations in areal coverage of submerged macrophytes in these lakes.																			0046-5070					AUG	1992	28	1					15	27		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1992.tb00558.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1992.tb00558.x													WOS:A1992JL91000003

This multi-proxy study for the first time in the region of the northern foreland of the Western Carpathians included quantitative thermal reconstruction based on Chironomidae and high-stratigraphic resolution of C-14 AMS dating. We hypothesised that (i) climate events during the Early Holocene contributed to ecosystem turnovers via stimulating disturbances related to the river's fluvial activity and (ii) woodland and oxbow lake ecosystems became more resilient to flood disturbances along with the advance of forest succession on the floodplain. The results revealed that the response of ecosystems on the Early Holocene warming was strongly linked with the decrease in fluvial activity of the river. The reconstruction of the mean July temperature based on Chironomidae revealed the exceptionally high rate of warming during the period of ca. 11,490 -11,460 cal. BP (at least 1 degrees C per decade) up to values > 2 degrees C than modern ones. During this period, the lake trophy and productivity started to increase with a simultaneous spread of Betula woodlands on the alluvial plain. The "Preboreal oscillation" cooling was dated at ca. 11,450-11,250 cal. BP. At that time, an increased climate instability led to a higher rate of extremal events such as flood at ca. 11,400-11,330 cal. BP, which probably led to the disruption of the Betula population. The development of riparian woodlands, initiated by the expansion of Ulmus from ca. 11,100 cal. BP, and further spread of Quercus and Fraxinus excelsior on the alluvial plain and lower river terraces increased plant transpiration and therefore limited the river runoff and its fluvial activity. This, together with the expansion of reed belt communities, probably limited the impact of floods on the oxbow lake. However, ca. 10,010-9880 cal. BP traces of higher fluvial activity, but of lower impact, were recorded. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Shanahan, TM; Hughen, KA; Ampel, L; Sauer, PE; Fornace, K				Shanahan, Timothy M.; Hughen, Konrad A.; Ampel, Linda; Sauer, Peter E.; Fornace, Kyrstin			Environmental controls on the 2H/1H values of terrestrial leaf waxes in the eastern Canadian Arctic	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The hydrogen isotope composition of plant waxes preserved in lacustrine sediments is a potentially valuable tool for reconstructing paleoenvironmental changes in the Arctic. However, in contrast to the mid-and low-latitudes, significantly less effort has been directed towards understanding the factors controlling D/H fractionation in high latitude plant waxes and the impact of these processes on the interpretation of sedimentary leaf wax delta D records. To better understand these processes, we examined the D/H ratios of long chain fatty acids in lake surface sediments spanning a temperature and precipitation gradient on Baffin Island in the eastern Canadian Arctic. D/H ratios of plant waxes increase with increasing temperature and aridity, with values ranging from -240 parts per thousand to -160 parts per thousand over the study area. Apparent fractionation factors between n-alkanoic acids in Arctic lake sediments and precipitation(epsilon(FA-ppt)) are less negative than those of mid-latitude lakes and modern plants by 25 parts per thousand to 65 parts per thousand, consistent with n-alkane data from modern Arctic plants (Yang et al., 2011). Furthermore, epsilon(FA-ppt) values from Arctic lakes become systematically more positive with increasing evaporation, in contrast to mid-latitude sites, which show little to no change in fractionation with aridity. These data are consistent with enhanced water loss and isotope fractionation at higher latitude in the Arctic summer, when continuous sunlight supports increased daily photosynthesis. The dominant control on delta D-FA variations on Baffin Island is temperature. However, changing epsilon(FA-ppt) result in steeper delta D-FA-temperature relationships than observed for modern precipitation. The application of this delta D-FA-based paleotemperature calibration to existing delta D-FA records from Baffin Island produces much more realistic changes in late Holocene temperature and highlights the importance of these effects in influencing the interpretation of Arctic delta D-FA records. A better understanding of the controls on hydrogen isotope fractionation in high latitude leaf waxes will be essential to the proper interpretation of isotope records from sedimentary plant waxes in the Arctic.

J	Chucholl, C				Chucholl, Christoph			Disjunct distribution pattern of Procambarus clarkii (Crustacea, Decapoda, Astacida, Cambaridae) in an artificial lake system in Southwestern Germany	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Procambarus clarkii is among the worst invasive species that have invaded Europe. It originates from the central south of the USA and northeastern Mexico and is a hardy, r-selected generalist. There exists a marked gradient in population numbers from southwestern to northeastern Europe: The Iberian Peninsula, Italy and France have the bulk of the populations, while northeastern populations are mainly scattered and isolated from each other. In the present study I report on the distribution of P. clarkii in an artificial lake system along the River Danube in Southwestern Germany, which is within its northeastern range limit. The presence of P. clarkii was confirmed in nine lakes and one canal with stagnant water. Procambarus clarkii was absent from lotic situations, which may indicate that P. clarkii thrives chiefly in stagnant or slow flowing waters. A probable explanation is that those habitats heat up faster and reach higher summer temperatures than most lotic habitats. Since P. clarkii is considered as a 'warm water' species, lentic habitats probably offer more favorable temperatures. The populations form two disjunct distribution centres, isolated from each other by around seven km linear distance. It is not known for sure when the species was initially introduced, but it may have been present in the western distribution centre since the mid 1970s. The emerging disjunct distribution pattern is a synergistic result of introductions into two lakes and subsequent active spread to surrounding habitats, including migration overland. Procambarus clarkii numbers are often high and the species has become a nuisance to recreational fishery, since it tends to grab on to exposed fish bait. Two noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) populations were wiped out rapidly by P. clarkii, presumably due to crayfish plague transmission. Although eradication may prove impossible, population management, e.g. intense trapping and stocking of predatory Fish, is strongly suggested. Early eradication, if necessary relying on extreme control methods (e.g. chemical agents), should be attempted when P. clarkii invades further lakes.					; Chucholl, Christoph/AAF-3808-2020	Chucholl, Christoph/0000-0002-2834-8426; 													1798-6540	1818-5487				MAR	2011	6	1					109	113		10.3391/ai.2011.6.1.14	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2011.6.1.14													WOS:000290839600014

Results show that the mass concentrations of atmospheric particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) and main gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, and O-3) decrease during the Meiyu period, with the largest decline in PM10 and the smallest in CO. TWSII in atmospheric particles are mainly concentrated in fine particles during the Meiyu period. The values of rho (TWSII) for PM1.1, PM1.1-2.1, and PM2.1-10 before the Meiyu onset are generally greater than those during the Meiyu period. During the first pollution process, the rho(TWSII) for PM1.1 and PM1.1-2.1 first increase to the peak values, and then decrease during the moderate rainfall period, when the rho(TWSII) in PM2.1-10 increase to its maximum before the Meiyu onset. The mass concentrations for anions, cations, and total ions at different particle-size sections all exhibit bimodal distributions before and after the Meiyu onset. The mass concentration peaks at a particle size of 1.1-2.1 mu m for fine particles, while at 5.8-9.0 mu m (before the Meiyu onset) and 9.0-10.0 mu m (during the Meiyu period) for coarse particles, respectively. The peak particle size for mass concentration of coarse particles moves toward larger sizes during the Meiyu period. The mass concentrations of SO42- at different particle-size sections show a bimodal distribution before the Meiyu onset and a multi-modal distribution during the Meiyu period. The mass concentrations of NO3- at different particle-size sections show a bimodal distribution before the Meiyu onset and a unimodal distribution during the Meiyu period. The mass concentrations of NH4+ at different particle-size sections present a bimodal distribution before and after the Meiyu onset, with the particle-size for peak concentrations distributing in 1.1-2.1 and 5.8-9.0 mu m before the Meiyu onset, and 9.0-10.0 mu m during the Meiyu period. The mean value of nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) is higher before the Meiyu onset than after, indicating that the secondary conversion of NO2 before the Meiyu onset is enhanced. The sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) values are greater than NOR values, but the concentrations of NO2 in the same period during the Meiyu period are higher than those of SO2, which indicates that the secondary conversion of SO2 during the Meiyu period on the north bank of Taihu Lake is stronger than that of NO2. During the whole observation, the contribution of stationary sources mainly contributed to the atmospheric particulate matters during the Meiyu period. The contributions of vehicle exhaust and coal combustion to fine particles are more obviously affected by the changes in meteorological conditions during the Meiyu period, and the vehicle emissions contribute more to PM1.1-2.1 than to PM1.1.

Variability in early development and growth of Great Lakes burbot: developmental patterns in cultured and wild-caught larval burbot	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Throughout the Great Lakes, burbot Lota lota are a native, high-trophic level predator that plays a substantial ecological role. L. lota spawning occurs during wintertime and early spring with length-at-hatch of 3 mm. Wild-caught larval L. lota were obtained from three different locations: Lake Superior Keweenaw Peninsula, Ontonagon, Michigan (LSKP), Lake Michigan Midlake Reef (LMMR) and the St. Clair-Detroit River System (SCDR). Adult spawning L. lota were captured from the Sturgeon River, Pelkie, Michigan (LSSR) and were artificially fertilized; eggs were retained and reared in a laboratory setting. Throughout the first 10 weeks of development, cultured larval L .lota were randomly selected and photographed to measure morphological features. These features were contrasted between cultured larvae and wild-caught larvae to understand developmental variability in L. lota. From patterns discerned in both cultured and wild-caught larval L. lota we demonstrated the importance of asynchronous hatching, source location, and variability in larval L. lota development. Comparisons of wild-caught larval L. lota showed morphological differences, as well as variability in stage and size based on sampling month. These results established that larval L. lota development in the Great Lakes is highly flexible and both species-specific and environmental processes create the observed variability. The impact of this variability on L. lota populations must be explored to further understand this native Great Lakes species.

A commemoration of the fourth centenary of the Blue Nile Sources discovery by the Spanish Jesuit Pedro Paez Xaramillo (April 21th, 1618)	CULTURE & HISTORY DIGITAL JOURNAL												On April 21, 1618 Pedro Paez visited the small spring where the waters of the Blue Nile rise before passing through Lake Tana. The site had been seen before by the military leader of the group of Ethio-Portuguese descendants of the Portuguese soldiers who had helped the Christian kingdom in the wars of 1541-1543, who passed the news to the missionaries shortly before 1607. In both cases the Ethiopian kings, Sarsa Dengel and Susenyos, took them to the sources, showing that the local population had a clear knowledge of the river course. Paez was the first European who described all its characteristics, occupying a complete chapter of his "History of Ethiopia". Although this book was not published until the 20th century, the manuscript was copied and the information was incorporated into the global knowledge before the end of the 17th century, through the works of the German Jesuit Athanasius Kircher and the maps of the Venetian geographer, Vincenzo Coronelli. In this way, a problem that had intrigued travellers, geographers and historians since antiquity was solved. The next European who visited the place was the Scottish James Bruce in 1770, and the sources in Lake Victoria of the other large arm of the river, the White Nile, were not discovered until two and a half centuries later, with the travels of the English John Hanning Speke in 1858-1862.

Soil water sensor accuracy for predicting seedling emergence using a hydrothermal time model	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT												Hydrothermal time models are used to predict seed germination overtime in seedling establishment models. Soil matric potential data from three resistance-type sensors (Colman cells [Soiltest, Inc. Lakebluff Illinois, USA], Watermark brand sensors [Irrometer Co., Riverside, California, USA], and Delmhorst gypsum blocks [Delmhorst Instrument Company, Towaco, New Jersey, USA]), from a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) probe (Campbell Scientific 615 [Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah, USA]), and from gravimetric sampling of the seed zone were input into a hydrothermal time model to determine if we could accurately predict seedling emergence over time in a growth chamber experiment for six desert grass species. Seeds were sown in a structureless sandy loam soil which received four different irrigation amounts and was allowed to dry in a growth chamber programmed to simulate spring soil temperatures in Provo, Utah. Cells and gypsum blocks were more sensitive to soil surface drying than Watermark sensors and TDR probes. Only gravimetric sampling correctly predicted no emergence for the driest soil and fastest drying conditions when surface soil dried out 2-4 days sooner than indicated by the most sensitive sensors. For wetter and slower-drying soils, soil water potential inputs from all sensors were similar and high and predicted seedling emergence within 1-2.5 days of observed emergence. For these wet seed-zone conditions, use of thermal time to predict emergence was as accurate as use of hydrothermal time, evidently because all seeds had high water potentials during germination. Because the soil water sensors we used must be buried deeper than the seed zone, accuracy of hydrothermal time model prediction of field germination using these sensors depends greatly on how fast soils dry out in the sensor measurement zone compared to how fast the seed zone dries out relative to the speed at which seeds accumulate thermal time to germinate.																			1532-4982	1532-4990				JUL-SEP	2007	21	3					229	243		10.1080/15324980701465106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324980701465106													WOS:000247999200005

The case of a small eutrophic Lake Wirbel in Poland is an example of how useful it could be to apply demographic and behavioural analysis of dominant planktonic herbivores to explain the sequence of events following biomanipulation measures. At a certain stage of a seven-year (1988-1994) biomanipulation experiment, rotenone was applied to remove all fish. Following fish removal, summer algal biomass in the 'edible' fraction of phytoplankton (< 30 mu m) was on average 2.5 times lower. Besides the significant increase in the density of herbivorous zooplankton (above all the largest cladoceran Daphnia cucullata), we identified three other phenomena underlying the observed reduction in algal biomass which may contribute to the overall zooplankton grazing efficiency: (1) the significant increase in the mean body size of the dominant cladoceran Daphnia cucullata, calculated for the whole water column, (2) the clear shift in the vertical distribution of Daphnia towards the surface and (3) the increase in mean Daphnia size in the surface waters. We postulate that this type of analysis should be performed along with the measures conventionally used in biomanipulation studies, first, as a tool to fully understand the sequence of events generated by manipulations at the top of the food chain and, second, as a perfect opportunity to study population and individual responses (e.g. morphological, life-history and behavioural) to varying predatory pressure.

J	Dee, JR; Menges, ES				Dee, Justin R.; Menges, Eric S.			Gap ecology in the Florida scrubby flatwoods: effects of time-since-fire, gap area, gap aggregation and microhabitat on gap species diversity	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: The ecology of landscape gaps is important for the maintenance of species diversity in a variety of plant ecosystems. In the scrubby flatwoods community type of the pyrogenic Florida scrub, we aimed to identify the relationship between time-since-fire, gap area, quality (microhabitat) and aggregation (structural connectivity) with neighbouring gaps on gap species diversity and occupancy. Location: Archbold Biological Station (ABS), Lake Wales Ridge, south-central Florida, USA. Methods: We measured species diversity, gap area, aggregation and microhabitat (percentage bare sand) in 120 gaps divided evenly amongst 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 26 yrs since fire in the scrubby flatwoods of ABS (typical fire return interval of 5-20 yrs) throughout the summer of 2011. Results: Gap area and aggregation were significantly highest in the first 4 yrs after fire, but decreased and remained fairly constant at longer times-since-fire. Percentage bare sand gradually decreased with time-since-fire until a strong decline at the 26-yr mark, where litter cover was significantly higher than all previous years. Gap area strongly and positively predicted species richness (total and herb spp.) and total species diversity (H'). Bare sand content was positively correlated with the richness of species that are obligate seeders post-fire. Gap aggregation was generally a poor predictor of diversity components, although it positively influenced the occurrence of Stipulicida setacea, a seeder species that occasionally resprouts after fire. Overall, species richness and diversity peaked at intermediate times-since-fire, probably because long-unburned gaps were too small and inundated with litter to sustain higher richness of herbs and obligate seeders. Conclusion: In a prior gap ecology study, in neighbouring more xeric rosemary scrub, gaps were larger, more persistent and had higher bare sand cover, resulting in higher levels of total species richness and diversity for decades longer after fire than gaps in this study. In both these types of Florida scrub, the threat of fire suppression and its adverse effects on gap area and microhabitat may be detrimental for several endemic species that depend on gaps.																			1100-9233	1654-1103				SEP	2014	25	5					1235	1246		10.1111/jvs.12170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12170													WOS:000340572700016

To understand the mechanisms governing the changes of erosion rates, it is important to study erosion rates by different methods and for different time scales. In inland drainage basins, deposition rates of terminal lake sediments can indicate basin-wide erosion rates at the millennial-scale. This paper presents three lake records of the Last Deglaciation and Holocene (Huahai Lake, Zhuye Lake and Yanchi Lake) from the Hexi Corridor, north of the Qilian Mountains, in arid China. Organic matter, terrestrial pollen concentrates, seeds, grasses and plant debris are used for conventional and AMS C-14 dating. On the basis of 66 radiocarbon dates, lithology and grain-size, we infer relatively high basin-wide erosion rates during the Last Deglaciation and early Holocene in the three drainage basins, when the three lake sediments were seriously affected by reworking. The deposition rates were an order of magnitude or greater in these lakes during the Last Deglaciation and early Holocene than during the mid-to-late Holocene. During the transition period of the last glacial-interglacial cycle, significant climatic changes occurred in East and Central Asia, corresponding to the strengthening of the Asian summer monsoon and to increasing effective moisture in arid Central Asia, which can have strong impacts on basin-wide erosion rates north of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Moreover, melting glaciers in the Qilian Mountains probably also contributed to the high basin-wide erosion rates. At the same time, tectonic activity was not recognizable in the study area during that period. In the arid and semiarid regions surrounding the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, dramatic changes in erosion rates appear during the transition periods of the glacial-interglacial cycles, which illustrate the climatic controls on erosion rates at this time scale.

J	Hembre, LK				Hembre, Leif K.			Effects of a rainbow trout stocking moratorium on the Daphnia species composition and water quality of Square Lake (Minnesota)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Hembre, LK. 2019. Effects of a rainbow trout stocking moratorium on the Daphnia species composition and water quality of Square Lake (Minnesota). Lake Reserv Maange. XX:XX-XX. Square Lake is among the clearest lakes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul (Minnesota) metropolitan area, but its water clarity has decreased over the past several decades despite levels of total phosphorus (TP) remaining relatively stable. Predation by zooplanktivorous rainbow trout annually stocked since the early 1980s was hypothesized to be the cause for this eutrophication trend. To evaluate this hypothesis, a 3-year moratorium on trout stocking was imposed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) and water quality and zooplankton monitoring data from 2 years prior to the moratorium (2010 and 2012) were compared to data from the 3 moratorium years (2013-2015). Significant changes observed during the moratorium years that support the hypothesis include (1) an increase in biomass concentrations of the large-bodied Daphnia pulicaria, (2) a coincident decrease in biomass concentrations of the smaller bodied D. mendotae, and (3) more pronounced spring clear-water phases when D. pulicaria reached peak densities. In addition, the volume of hypoxic water (dissolved oxygen [DO] < 1 mg/L) that developed in deep water was less in moratorium years compared to the premoratorium years. Unexpectedly, surface water TP concentrations were significantly lower during the moratorium years than in premoratorium years. Greater sequestration of P in the biomass of Daphnia during the moratorium years is the likely cause for the decrease in surface water TP levels in those years. Natural resource managers from the MNDNR have extended the moratorium and are using the conclusions from this study to determine the future fisheries management plan for Square Lake.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				APR 3	2019	35	2					127	139		10.1080/10402381.2019.1576813	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2019.1576813		APR 2019											WOS:000465697400001

At a first glance, molar and humerus size, geological time interval, and geographical location suggested that this specimen could correspond to Talpa minor. However, after some mechanical preparation of the clay block (matrix removal, consolidation, and cleaning) and a micro-CT scan, this excellently preserved specimen turned out to be an unknown species to science. The resulting 3D models of this new form, Vulcanoscaptor ninoti gen. et sp. nov., revealed some peculiar morphological traits in teeth, mandible, and postcranial elements, which according to the phylogenetic analysis carried out, would allocate this new species within the tribe Scalopini. This is surprising, because the closest relatives of the new species within this tribe live nowadays in North America, and only some related taxa had been previously reported in the Oligocene and Miocene fossil record from Europe. The postcranial construction of this specimen reveals a highly fossorial lifestyle supported by a complex forelimb structure. How such a specialized digging animal reached the maar lake sediments where it was finally preserved is still to be solved. Some hypotheses consider swimming abilities for this extinct species. Alternatively, this specimen could be the remaining portions of a floated or scavenged carcass whose remains fell into the lake and reached the anoxic bottom.

With trees and shrubs forming an important constituent of such landscapes, and its composition characterizing different types of land-use, anthracology is a tool particularly well suited to trace developments and changes through human exploitation of the landscape. Within the West African savanna belts, regions shaped by prolonged annual floods, such as the Middle Senegal Valley, the Inland Niger Delta and the Chad Basin, offer particular ecological preconditions for land-use. We present here a charcoal study for the Chad Basin of northeast Nigeria, demonstrating the special development of a cultivated landscape in an alluvial context. Charcoal samples from stratified Late Stone Age and Iron Age sites within the southwestern Chad Basin, Nigeria were analyzed. Main focus is on the site Mege, spanning more than 2500 years of occupation history. The results are supplemented with and compared to data from other, earlier as well as contemporary sites, in similar or slightly different environments and representing different settlement types, in order to discern general trends. The results illustrate the exploitation of woody vegetation mainly from the clay soils. This is in stark contrast to the results from other regions within the savanna belt, where the vegetation on sandy soils was preferentially exploited for fuel wood. The vegetation changes evidenced through the charcoal assemblages are attributed to reduced flooding as a consequence of falling lake levels during the Late Holocene. Parklands, typical cultivated landscapes of West African savannas, are invisible in the charcoal spectra, and fallow species and useful trees are rarely present. We postulate that the ecological conditions of the floodplain environment have decisively paved a different, less obvious trajectory of cultivated landscape development between 2000 BC and AD 1500 and that the cultivated landscapes present in the region today largely result from the increasing human impact of the last 500 years.					; Höhn, Alexa/ABC-5771-2020	Hohn, Alexa/0000-0003-2943-7858; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				AUG 20	2021	593						224	235		10.1016/j.quaint.2020.11.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.11.014		JUN 2021											WOS:000661857900002

The responses of the two dominant species, Potamogeton pectinatus L. and Potamogeton perfoliatus L., to water quality, depth, exposure, sediment type and meteorological conditions were examined with the use of multiple logistic regression. The resulting models can explain about half the variance in the vegetated surface percentage of the examined lakes. The presence of both species is predominantly related to rooting depth and water transparency. Additional positive relationships to wave exposure and spring water temperature were found for P. pectinatus. The data are not in agreement with the simple general view that macrophytes occur up till a transparency-dependent depth. Firstly, the probability for macrophyte presence decreased very smoothly with depth so that no clear maximum depth could be established. Secondly, the depth range of the vegetation was hardly related to transparency. Increase of turbidity leads to a strong reduction of the vegetated area, but this is due to disappearance of vegetation not only from the deep but also from the shallow sites. The yearly change in vegetation abundance is considerable in these lakes. On average, the vegetated area of a lake in two successive years differed by 50%. On a local scale, dynamics were even higher. Large vegetation stands disappeared from one year to another whereas in the same lake new areas were colonized. Such local changes cannot be explained by the examined environmental factors. as none of the parameters varies both in time and within a lake. The results indicate that it is only possible to predict from the examined environmental factors where a macrophyte will not grow in these lakes, not where it will grow. The derived logistic models provide a useful tool to visualize this uncertainty, when predicting the effect of changes in water quality.

Reduced reproductive success of hatchery fish from a supplementation program for naturalized steelhead in a Minnesota tributary to Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Reduced reproductive success of hatchery fish spawning in the natural environment will reduce the ability of stocking programs to enhance wild populations. We used DNA-based parentage assignment to compare the reproductive success of wild fish and first-generation hatchery fish from a smolt stocking program that used broodstock from within the naturalized steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss population in a Minnesota tributary to Lake Superior. The reproductive success of hatchery females was significantly lower than that of wild females (approximately 60%) in all three study years; however, the reproductive success of hatchery males was only significantly lower in one year. Higher reproductive success of wild fish was attributed to greater probability of success (i.e., having at least one offspring) and not differences in numbers of offspring among successful parents. Generalized linear models indicated that run timing was associated with probability of success although this did not explain differences between hatchery and wild fish. Despite runs that extended 7-9 weeks, most successful adults arrived in the first three weeks of the run (85-98% of all successful females, 98-100% of successful males). The early part of the run corresponded to periods of high flow, which likely increased access to quality spawning and rearing habitat higher upstream in the system. Relationships between fish length and reproductive success were inconsistent. Managers may minimize potential environmental and genetic contributors to reduced performance by hatchery fish, but continued reliance on hatchery supplementation may hinder achievement of the long-term goal of a fishery supported largely by naturally reproducing populations.

J	TERASMAE, J				TERASMAE, J			SOME PROBLEMS OF LATE WISCONSIN HISTORY AND GEOCHRONOLOGY IN SOUTHEASTERN ONTARIO	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Palynological studies and radiocarbon dating of sediments from .apprx. 20 lakes and bogs in southeastern Ontario were used to establish a palynostratigraphic sequence of 6 pollen zones extending to .apprx. 12,000 yr B.P. and indicating that deglaciation occurred between 12,500 and 11,500 yr BP, probably during the Two Creeks interstadial interval. The glacial Lake Iroquois existed in the Lake Ontario basin from .apprx. 12,500-11,800 yr B.P. while the Lake Ontario ice lobe was retreating northeastward, and the Kirkfield-Fenelon Falls outlet from glacial Lake Algonquin (in the Georgian Bay-Lake Huron basin) to Lake Iroquois opened .apprx. 12,000 yr ago when the Dummer Moraine was deposited as a stagnant ice disintegration feature south of the Algonquin and Haliburton Highlands. Most radiocarbon dates (.apprx. 25) on marine shells, whale bone and algae from Champlain Sea beach deposits are in the range of 10,000-11,800 yr B.P., indicating that the Champlain Sea episode is younger than glacial Lake Iroquois. A few Champlain Sea dates are older than 12,000 yr B.P. and present an unresolved problem in geochronological correlation because they conflict with proposed deglaciation histories for southeastern Ontario. Late Wisconsin ice marginal positions are poorly known in southeastern Ontario and pose another problem for further study. The end of glacial Lake Algonquin phase (the main drainage event in the North Bay area) probably occurred between 10,800 and 10,500 yr B.P. after the Champlain Sea had reached its maximum western limit in the Pembroke area (upper Ottawa River valley) as indicated by stratigraphic relationships of surficial deposits.																			0008-4077	1480-3313					1980	17	3					361	381		10.1139/e80-035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e80-035													WOS:A1980JM58500007

Taking into account the high variability of meteorological conditions in the region, both in time and in space, a method of observing the chemical composition of atmospheric precipitation has been developed, which makes it possible to determine its composition depending on the conditions of air mass formation. Using statistical analysis, marker substances characterizing the main groups of sources influencing the composition of atmospheric precipitation were identified. Joint analysis of air mass trajectories and data on chemical composition of precipitation allowed for establishing the areas of location of potential sources of precipitation pollution. All precipitation events were categorized based on the similarity of air mass formation conditions and chemical composition. Precipitation composition data collected on the shores of Lake Baikal reflect the influence of different types of pollutants such as industrial emissions, motor vehicles, dust storms, and forest fires. The results of the study are relevant for air quality assessment in the region and demonstrate the potential of using precipitation chemistry data to understand the long-range transport of pollutants, which contributes to sustainable development by increasing the availability of air quality data in ecologically significant regions such as Lake Baikal.

J	Nevalainen, L; Rautio, M				Nevalainen, Liisa; Rautio, Milla			Spectral absorbance of benthic cladoceran carapaces as a new method for inferring past UV exposure of aquatic biota	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We developed a method for measuring fossil cladoceran (Branchiopoda) carapace absorbance to infer past ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure in lakes. This was done under the presumptions that cladocerans synthesize photoprotective compounds, of which melanin is the main UV-absorbing pigment, to their exoskeletons and melanin is preserved in sedimentary cladoceran remains. We extracted large-sized cladoceran (benthic Alona spp.) carapaces from subsections of sediment cores from two environmentally divergent lakes; a humic boreal forest lake in eastern Finland (past 1500 years) and a clear-water mountain lake in the Austrian Alps (past 300 years). We measured the absorbance of extracted carapaces with a spectrophotometer under visible light and UV wavelengths using an adapter, which was designed to hold the microfossils. When compared to the spectrum of synthetic melanin, the shapes of absorbance spectra at the 700-280 nm range suggested that the fossil carapaces contained melanin. The carapace absorbance under UV throughout the sediment cores was significantly higher in the clear-water alpine lake than in the humic boreal lake reflecting differences in the general underwater UV and optical environments between the sites. In addition, carapace absorbance was significantly higher during the Little Ice Age (LIA) than during pre- or post-LIA periods in both lakes. In the alpine lake, this was most likely a response to increased underwater UV induced by reduced primary production and more transparent water column during the cold summers of LIA, whereas reduced input of carbon compounds from the catchment through elongated permafrost and ice-cover periods likely induced higher water transparency in the boreal lake during this cold climate phase. We conclude that fossil melanin provides a good estimation of past underwater UV exposure in lakes with large cladoceran carapaces preserved in sediments and that the method introduced here is easy and cost- and time-efficient technique to be widely used in paleoaquatic UV inferences.

The rate of total nitrogen (sum of ammonium, nitrate and urea) uptake was in the range of 62-594 ng N l(-1) h(-1). The percentage contribution of ammonium uptake was 41-92%, that of urea 4-58% and that of nitrate <1-28% of total uptake. The annual mean new production which was supported by nitrate uptake was similar to 18% of the total production in 1986. The phytoplankton assemblage in Lake Biwa preferentially utilized regenerated nitrogen, such as ammonium and urea, whose concentration was much lower than that of nitrate throughout the observation period without in summer. The in situ nitrogen uptake rate was almost sufficient to meet the nitrogen requirement of the phytoplankton assemblage, except in midsummer when the nitrate concentration was below the detection limit of 0.3 mu g N l(-1). In the trophogenic layer, the rate of ammonium regeneration was 66-272 ng N l(-1) h(-1). Although the ambient ammonium concentration in the trophogenic layer was maintained at around the half-saturation constant for ammonium uptake kinetics, the ammonium uptake rates were always highly correlated with ammonium regeneration rates. From the size fractionation experiments and estimates from the literature, it was suggested that the microbial assemblage <1 mu m may have been the most important agent responsible for the ammonium regeneration processes in the trophogenic layer.

JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Ciliate picoplanktivory was studied in two different freshwater systems with abundant autotrophic picoplankton (APP): the eutrophic Rimov Reservoir (South Bohemia) during the late summer of 1993 and the oligo- to mesotrophic lake Piburger See (Tyrol) during May 1994. Picoplankton were sized by an image-analysis system and species-specific grazing rates of ciliates on bacteria and APP were determined using fluorescently labelled prey. According to the grazing data (as the mean uptake rate of picoplankton ind.(-1) h(-1)), ciliates were split into three ecological groups in order of their decreasing picoplanktivory and increasing significance of nanophytoplankton in their diet. (i) Highly efficient fine suspension feeders consisting of vorticellids (4200 bacteria, 560 APP), four oligotrichs and Cyclidium sp. (380-1580 bacteria, 57-210 APP), with <7% of individuals ingesting algae >2 mu m. (ii) Less efficient fine suspension feeders, coarse filter feeders and detritophages consisting of Cinetochilum margaritaceum, Pelagostrombidium fallax, Cyrtolophosis mucicola and Coleps spp. (60-173 bacteria, 2-27 APP), with 7-32% of individuals ingesting algae >2 mu m. (iii) Raptorial feeders consisting of four prostomatids belonging to the genera Urotricha and Balanion, with a negligible importance of picoplanktivory (8-61 bacteria, 0.2-14 APP). With the exception of one prostomatid, >58% of individuals ingested algae >2 mu m. Grazing data for the six species from the first group were converted into organic carbon. Assuming a 35% gross growth efficiency, the calculated potential doubling times were between 29 (Halteria grandinella) and 43 h (an unidentified oligotrich), except for the mixotrophic Pelagohalteria viridis (118 h). The doubling times estimated from changes in ciliate abundance for four out of the six species were very close to the calculated values, indicating that this group of heterotrophic ciliates can meet all of its carbon requirements by feeding exclusively on picoplankton.

The overall facies architecture of Xujiahe Formation implies deposition in a braided delta environment. High resolution sequence stratigraphy was performed based on outcrops, core observations, well logs and seismic interpretations. The Xujiahe Formation is interpreted as a 3rd sequence, comprising a transgressive systems tract (TST) and a regressive systems tract (RST). Within this 3rd sequence, six 4th sequences are recognized. The TST(FS1-FS4) mostly comprises subaqueous distributary channel fills ,distal bars, and shallow-lake facies, capped by the Belt Child mudstone that includes the maximum flooding surface(MFS). The RST(FS5-FS6) mainly contains subaqueous distributary channel deposits. Based on thin-sections, high-pressure mercury-intrusion analyses, the sandstone cements primarily consist of chlorite, calcite , secondary quartz and dolomite, filling pores. This study reveals quality reservoirs are mainly distributed in the lacustrine transgression and retrogradation strata in the base-level rising stage and in the stable period of the transition from base-level decline to base-level rise, but are seldom developed in the lacustrine retrogradation strata in base-level falling stage. The variation of accommodative space and sediment supply controls the vertical sand body assemblage, the distribution of sand body and the distribution characteristics of high-quality reservoirs in the study area.																			1028-334X	1531-8354				FEB	2025	520	2							42	10.1134/S1028334X24604929	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1028334X24604929													WOS:001463205800022

Use of a Restrictive Regulation to Manage Walleyes in a New Glacial Lake in South Dakota	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Above-average precipitation in the 1990s resulted in many new fisheries across northeastern South Dakota and elsewhere in the Upper Midwest. WalleyeSander vitreuspopulations in these new fisheries can be extremely vulnerable to angler harvest. In an attempt to maintain a Walleye fishery in Reetz Lake, South Dakota, a new lake, a restrictive regulation of one Walleye >= 711 mm TL per day was implemented when the lake opened to public fishing (October 2001). To evaluate the regulation, we monitored the estimated number of Walleyes >= 508 mm, Walleye gill-net catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of stock-length fish (>= 250 mm), size structure, condition, length at age at capture (ages 2-5), mortality, recruitment, and angler use during the period 2001-2019. The estimated number of Wall-eyes >= 508 mm, gill-net CPUE, and proportional size distribution of preferred-length fish (PSD-P; >= 510 mm) trended higher across years. Relative weight (Wr) for the quality-preferred (380-509 mm) and preferred-memorable (510-629 mm) length-groups and the length at age at capture for ages 4 and 5 trended lower. Walleyes <510 mm were in better condition than larger fish throughout the study. Estimated total mortality was 62% in 2004 but substantially declined in subsequent years before ranging from 6% to 21% for 2010-2019. The coefficient of variation of age-3 gill-net CPUE by cohort was 93%, indicating variable recruitment. Decreasing trends in Wr and growth were not surprising, as Walleye CPUE increased through time. Lengths at age remained at or above statewide and national averages. The values for number of angler-hours and Walleye catch rates were high during the summer months when most anglers targeted Walleye.

This research aimed to identify flood hazard and risk-prone areas in Ziway Lake watershed, which is situated in the central Main Ethiopian Rift, utilizing geospatial technology such as GIS (geographic information system) and remote sensing techniques. Flood hazard zones have been mapped by analyzing eleven significant indicators: Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), elevation, slope, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), drainage density, rainfall, land-use, soil texture, distance from rivers, distance from roads, and lithology. The weightage of each factor was assigned using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Three main factors, such as population density, flood hazard, and land-use, have been employed to identify flood risk zones. According to the flood hazard map, 60 % of watersheds (4371 km2) fall within the high to very high-risk zones. The rest are classified as moderate (1995 km2 or 27 %) and low (906 km2 or 12 %), while the high and very high categories specifically account for 2328 km2 (32 %) and 2043 km2 (28 %), respectively. According to the flood risk map, 2424 km2 (35 %) of the region is located in areas with high to very high flood risk. Historical flood data verified the model's reliability and accuracy in identifying regions vulnerable to floods. The findings can be valuable tools for decision-makers to guide preventive measures, improve land use planning, and enhance flood risk management.

Taking the grassland of Poyang Lake as a case, and comprehensively considering the ecological processes of water level change and species dispersal, this study firstly identified the range and patch composition of grassland under different water levels. Then, the graph theoretical approach was applied to analyse the dynamics of functional connectivity of grassland with different water levels and dispersal distances. Finally, the delta value for probability of connectivity (dPC) and betweenness connectivity (BC) were respectively used to identify the most important grassland patches and key grassland nodes. The results showed as follows: (1) The grassland presented the characteristics of "expanding when water falls while shrinking when water rises". The grassland patches faced both the segmentation effect and the inundation effect of water. With the increase of water level, the distribution of grassland was gradually shrinking, the distribution of grassland decreased from 1813.61 km2 at the water level of 7.54 m to 182.36 km2 at the water level of 17.17 m, and the fragmentation of large patches and the disappearance of small patches coexisted. (2) From the perspective of water level change, the functional connectivity of grassland has progressively decreased with the increase of water level. From the perspective of species dispersal, the species dispersal distance had an absolutely positive impact on landscape functional connectivity. With the increase of dispersal distance, the functional connectivity of grassland increased dramatically. (3) The 124 important grassland patches were identified and mapped. They were all larger ones in area and primarily distributed in the center of Poyang Lake, especially concentrated in the two national nature reserves. The 16 key grassland nodes were determined and mapped. They were very small in size and mainly scattered in the central and southern margin of Poyang Lake. Giant patches and large patches play an extremely vital role in maintaining the grassland connectivity. However, small patches in pivotal locations can not be ignored as stepping stones or connecting elements. Our study provides a scientific reference for the protection and management of natural habitats in lake areas.

ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION (δ18O, δD, δ13C, δ34S) OF GROUNDWATERS IN THE AREA OF TOREY LAKES (EASTERN TRANSBAIKAL REGION)	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the work is associated with the problem of fresh water resources shortage in arid regions, the solution of which is impossible without understanding the conditions and mechanisms of water's chemical composition formation in the natural environment. The aim of the research is to supplement information on the origin and conditions of groundwater's formation using the basis of new data on water's stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta D) and dissolved carbon and sulfur (delta C-13, delta S-34). Study objects are groundwaters of the upper dynamic zone of the Torey Lakes (eastern Transbaikal region) - springs, boreholes and wells depth (no more than 70 m), partly rivers' and lake's waters. Methods. Isotopic studies of water and dissolved C and S were carried out using an isotope mass spectrometer Finnigan-MAT 252 (Germany) at the FEGI FEB RAS Analytical Centre; water's chemical composition - using modern standard methods: potentiometric titration, atomic absorption, flame emission, potentiometric method, titration method at the INREC SB RAS. Results. New data on the isotopic composition (H and O) of groundwater in the upper dynamic zone of the Torey Lakes area, as well as dissolved C and S are presented. Altitudinal zonality is noted in isotope's distribution The conclusions related to the origin and formation conditions were presented based on the results obtained, as well as the data on partially lake's and meteoric waters: water of infiltration with little influence of evaporation processes (mixing with lake waters). A fairly uniform isotopic composition of groundwater was noted, despite the differences in chemical composition. No relationships were found between isotopic composition and salinity, basic ions and pH within groundwater, however, the general evolution of the composition in the direction of "atmospheric-groundwaters-lake waters" is characterized, in addition to the increase in salinity and pH, by enrichment in isotopes O-18, H-2, C-13.					; Drebot, Valeriia/IST-0631-2023; Lepokurova, Olesya/ABD-1595-2020	Drebot, Valeriia/0000-0003-0458-2864; 													2500-1019	2413-1830					2021	332	9					20	29		10.18799/24131830/2021/9/3350	http://dx.doi.org/10.18799/24131830/2021/9/3350													WOS:000704512200002
J	Liu, J; Wang, RJ; Zhao, Y; Yang, Y				Liu, Jian; Wang, Rujian; Zhao, Yue; Yang, Yi			A 40,000-year record of aridity and dust activity at Lop Nur, Tarim Basin, northwestern China	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Taklamakan Desert is a major dust source area for northwestern China. The history of aridification and sandstorm activity of the desert is recorded in the lacustrine sediments of the Lop Nur paleolake, on the eastern margin of the desert. In this study, we used accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dating, the In (Al/Ca) ratio, and the grain size of the non-biogenic fraction of sediment core KY01 taken from the center of Lop Nur to produce a similar to 40 kyr record of local climate change. During mid-late Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, increases in the In (Al/Ca) ratio, alluvial mud content, and atmospheric dust content, and a decrease in the dust storm content indicate an overall wet climate. During MIS 2, marked decreases in the In (Al/Ca) ratio and alluvial mud content, especially during the Last Glacial Maximum and Heinrich event 1 cold interval, indicate lowered atmospheric temperatures, as also recorded in Greenland ice cores. During MIS 2, fluvial input to the site was reduced and almost ceased, suggesting extreme aridity at Lop Nur, very strong low-altitude winds, and frequent dust storms. During early MIS 1, the contribution of dust storms to the lake sediments fell gradually and was then relatively constant, even during the Younger Dryas cold interval. This result might be ascribed to the increased supply of meltwater from snow and ice to Lop Nur, representing a response to the rise in atmospheric temperatures during the deglacial, accompanied by strong high-level winds. During 9-7 kyr BP there was an increase in the input of sediment from sandstorms, and hence an increase in low-level wind strength, possibly relating to the 8.2 kyr BP cold event. From 7.0 to similar to 1.5 kyr BP there was a decrease in sandstorm input and thus a gradual weakening of the strength of low-level winds. However, after similar to 1.5 kyr BP the sandstorm input increased. Overall, we conclude that dust storm activity in the region of Lop Nur since 40 kyr BP has been controlled mainly by Northern Hemisphere cold events, with atmospheric dust providing a background sedimentary component that was dominant during warm intervals. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of the dynamics of dust transport and to the history of dust activity and the lacustrine sedimentary record in northwestern China.

J	OrtegaGuerrero, A; Cherry, JA; Aravena, R				OrtegaGuerrero, A; Cherry, JA; Aravena, R			Origin of pore water and salinity in the lacustrine aquitard overlying the regional aquifer of Mexico City	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A series of six ancient connected lakes occupied the broad plain of the closed Basin of Mexico. This study pertains to two of these lakes. O-18, H-2 and chemical patterns in the pore water of the broad aquitard formed from sediment in these lakes indicate that the origin of this paleo-lake water was local meteoric water, which entered the ancient lakes as runoff, and groundwater from springs. Evaporation of surface water in the former Chalco Lake caused concentration of dissolved salts and enrichment in the heavy isotopes O-18 and H-2. During high water periods, the south easternmost ancient Lake Chalco fed partially evaporated water to the closed Lake Texcoco, the lowest of the lakes, where further evaporation occurred causing higher concentration of salts and enrichment of heavy isotopes. These major ions and stable isotopes follow the evaporation trends characteristic of closed or nearly closed evaporatic basins elsewhere in the world. Paleo-lake evaporation lines in Lakes Chalco and Texcoco originated from the same starting water and developed as a consequence of the topographic position of the former lakes and local climatological conditions. A modern evaporation line developed after the drainage of the lakes, reflecting evaporation of modern infiltrating meteoric water, The presence of brackish pore water in most of the Chalco aquitard, which has a maximum thickness of 300 m, indicates that upward vertical groundwater flow has not been capable of displacing the paleo-lake water. This suggests that vertical advection was not significant through out the hundreds of thousands of years of existence of the aquitard sediments, One-dimensional numerical simulations of the deeper part of the O-18 profile representing the thicker part of the aquitard sediments, 140 m, showed that this profile was developed by molecular diffusion with a small upward advective flux, where apparently the Chalco aquitard always had enriched brackishwater overlying the fresh water aquifer.

J	Jarochowska, E; Kozowski, W				Jarochowska, Emilia; Kozowski, Wojciech			Facies development and sequence stratigraphy of the Ludfordian (Upper Silurian) deposits in the Zbruch River Valley, Podolia, western Ukraine: local facies overprint on the δ13Ccarb record of a global stable carbon isotope excursion	FACIES												The Ludfordian (Upper Silurian) succession in Podolia, western Ukraine, represents a Silurian carbonate platform developed in an epicontinental sea on the shelf of the paleocontinent of Baltica. Coeval deposits throughout this basin record a positive stable carbon isotope excursion known as the Lau excursion. The record of this excursion in Podolia exhibits an unusual amplitude from highly positive (+6.9 aEuro degrees) to highly negative (-5.0 aEuro degrees) delta C-13(carb) values. In order to link delta C-13(carb) development with facies, five sections in the Zbruch River Valley were examined, providing microfacies characterization and revised definitions of the Isakivtsy, Prygorodok, and Varnytsya Formations. The Isakivtsy Fm. is developed as dolosparite replacing originally bioclastic limestone. The Prygorodok Fm., recording strongly depleted (down to -10.53 aEuro degrees) to near zero (0.12 aEuro degrees) delta C-13(carb) values is developed as laminated, organic-rich dolomicrite with metabentonite and quartz siltstone beds. The Varnytsya Fm. is characterized by peritidal deposition with consistent, slightly negative delta C-13(carb) values (-0.57 to -3.20 aEuro degrees). It is proposed that dolomitization of the Isakivtsy Fm. is associated with a sequence boundary and erosional surface. The overlying Prygorodok Fm. represents the proximal part of a TST deposited in restricted and laterally extremely variable environments dominated by microbial carbonate production. The transition to the overlying Varnytsya Fm. facies is marked by a maximum flooding surface. The SB and MFS are potentially correlative within the basin and support a global rapid sea-level fall previously proposed for this interval. The interpretation of the Prygorodok Fm. as coastal lake deposits may explain the unusual delta C-13(carb) values and constitute one of the few records of this type of environment identified in the early Paleozoic.

J	Welch, EB; Weiher, ER				Welch, EB; Weiher, ER			Improvement in Moses Lake quality from dilution and sewage diversion	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Moses Lake has received dilution water in 9 of 10 years since treatment began in 1977. The average input for those years was 143 Angstrom 79 x 10(6) m(3)/yr over 93 days, which represents flushing rates of about 13 percent/day for Parker Horn where the dilution water enters, and 1 percent/day for the whole take. As a result, lake quality has improved at least 50 percent in terms of chlorophyll a and total phosphorus and by nearly 100 percent in transparency. Pumping diluted lake water from Parker Horn beginning in 1982 and diverting sewage effluent in 1984 markedly improved water quality in a section that received treated effluent and little or no dilution water. Total phosphorus has declined by 90 percent and chlorophyll a by 60 percent, although transparency increased only about 0.2 m because of that section's shallowness. Diluted nitrate concentration in the inflow has been considered the cause for control of algae, but a switch from largely flood to spray irrigation, as well as sewage diversion, has resulted in lower inflow phosphorus concentrations and a gradual change from N to P limitation. Despite favorable improvements in average conditions, however, blooms of bluegreen algae still develop in late summer. The largest bloom in the 10 + year study occurred from late August through September 1985,when the take was well diluted and received no sewage. This is attributed to increased mixing following lower than normal temperature and to a 50 percent increase in internal phosphorus loading. Buoyant bluegreen algae rising from the sediment surface are hypothesized to be the transport mechanism.																			1040-2381					MAR	2004	20	1					76	84		10.1080/07438140409354102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140409354102													WOS:000220790600007

Continental-scale variation in controls of summer CO2 in United States lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Understanding the broad-scale response of lake CO2 dynamics to global change is challenging because the relative importance of different controls of surface water CO2 is not known across broad geographic extents. Using geostatistical analyses of 1080 lakes in the conterminous United States, we found that lake partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) was controlled by different chemical and biological factors related to inputs and losses of CO2 along climate, topography, geomorphology, and land use gradients. Despite weak spatial patterns in pCO(2) across the study extent, there were strong regional patterns in the pCO(2) driver-response relationships, i.e., in pCO(2) regulation. Because relationships between lake CO2 and its predictors varied spatially, global models performed poorly in explaining the variability in CO2 for U.S. lakes. The geographically varying driver-response relationships of lake pCO(2) reflected major landscape gradients across the study extent and pointed to the importance of regional-scale variation in pCO(2) regulation. These results indicate a higher level of organization for these physically disconnected systems than previously thought and suggest that changes in climate and land use could induce shifts in the main pathways that determine the role of lakes as sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2. Plain Language Summary In this study we show that changes in climate and terrestrial landscapes could affect which are the main mechanisms responsible for the widespread emissions of CO2 by lakes. Although mechanisms such as aquatic primary production, respiration by microorganisms, or terrestrial loadings of carbon have been studied extensively, their relative importance across broad geographic extents with different climate or land use remains unknown. Based on an analysis of 1080 lakes distributed across the continental U.S., we show that lake CO2 dynamics depend on the climate and landscape context where these lakes are found, such as precipitation, elevation, percent agriculture, or wetlands in the lakes catchments. We observed a widespread effect of in-lake primary production, while the color of water, which has often been identified as one of the main controls of lake CO2 in northern lakes, was important in only a small fraction of the lakes studied. Our results show that controls on lake CO2 dynamics vary geographically and that considering that variation will be important for creating accurate global carbon models.

However, research on black bloom and its taste and odor (T&O) compounds has been limited by the difficulty of predicting the time and location of black bloom events. Therefore, the determination of T&O compounds in each stage of black bloom are critical. In this study, potential surrogates were assessed using laboratory column experiments. Dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, electric potential (Eh), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total organic carbon (TOC) and so on are selected as initial surrogates. We also tested the validity of these models using an independent data set that was previously collected from Taihu Lake in 2015. Different surrogates contributed different significant to the T&O predictive models. For instance, the concentrations of DMTS were related to cyanobacteria biomass, temperature and other environmental factors. In comparing the concentrations of the T&O compounds observed in 2015 with those concentrations predicted from our models, we found that most of the predicted data points fell within the 90% confidence intervals of the observed values. This result supported the validity of these models in the studied system. These models, basing on laboratory collected environmental data, will be sometime extent for water resource management of eutrophic shallow lake in evaluating the probability of T&O incidence.

Modelling lake levels under climate change conditions: three closed lakes in Western Victoria	18TH WORLD IMACS CONGRESS AND MODSIM09 INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: INTERFACING MODELLING AND SIMULATION WITH MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES					IMACS World Congress/Modelling and Simulation Society-of-Australia-and-New-Zealand (MSSANZ)/18th MODSIM09 Biennial Conference on Modelling and Simulation	JUL 13-17, 2009	Cairns, AUSTRALIA	IMACS, MSSANZ, CSIRO, Australian Math Sci Inst, Griffith Univ, eWater Cooperat Res Ctr, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, HEMA Consulting, Hellenic European Res Comp Math & Applicat, Int Council Ind Appl Math, Int Soc Grid Generat (ISGG), Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing (ISPRS), Japan Soc Simulat Technol, Pacific Rim Math Assoc, Rutgers, State Univ New Jersey				Lakes Keilambete, Gnotuk and Bullenmerri are lakes in Western Victoria that are highly regarded for their ecological, social and scientific values. These are maar lakes (lakes in shallow craters of volcanic tuff) and are recognized as being of National (Gnotuk) and International Significance (Keilambete, Bullenmerri). As closed lakes, they have no streams coming in or out, and are predominantly controlled by rainfall and evaporation at the water's surface. These crater lakes are very sensitive to climate change and have been used to diagnose past changes in climate. Previous research has shown that the lakes have been falling since the mid 1800s and that the likely cause was a decrease in rainfall and increase in evaporation of natural origin. Recent rainfall decreases have increased the rate of lake level decline. With the prospect of future climate change further altering regional rainfall and evaporation, this study assesses the potential impact of climate change due to enhanced greenhouse gas on future lake levels at these lakes. Lake levels (similar to 1880-2100) are constructed using the lake water balance model of Jones et al. (2001). This model is quite robust in modelling historical lake levels, and has been used for simulating climatic conditions reproducing lake levels for the past 16,000 years. Time series of monthly climate data were obtained from 14 global climate model simulations contained in the database used in the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2007). For the future, these GCM simulations were forced by the A1B and A2 greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol emission scenarios. The use of multiple GCMs and different future emission scenarios, result in scenarios that represent the range of likely outcomes of regional climate under enhanced greenhouse conditions to 2100. The results suggest that all lake levels will continue to fall, with the declines for Bullenmerri expected to be larger than those for the other two lakes. The decline was initiated with the historical change in climate from around the mid 19(th) century. Recent reductions in the precipitation/evaporation ratio show that the rate of decline is accelerating. For Bullenmerri, the median model simulation projects a rainfall/evaporation (P/E) ratio of around 0.73, 0.69, and 0.67 in the 2030s, 2050s and 2070s, respectively. These are similar to the median values for Lake Keilambete and Lake Gnotuk (0.71, 0.68 and 0.64, respectively). The median estimates of the rate of change for Keilambete is -7.8, -5.8, and -4.2 cm/year in the 30 year periods centred on 2030, 2050 and 2070, respectively. For Gnotuk these are -14.5, -15 and -10.9 cm/year and for Bullenmerri they are -24.4, -26.1 and -30.4 cm/year respectively. In addition to the drying trend, proposed land subdivision and urbanization within the Gnotuk catchment, for example, threatens the visual amenity of the lake and will add to the nutrient and sediment load to the lake. The deeper crater lakes, particularly Lake Bullenmerri, are becoming increasingly important as a resource for recreation and amenity for the regional community. This is placing added pressure on the scientific and environmental qualities of the lakes. Lakes Keilambete and Gnotuk will become increasingly hypersaline, and Lake Bullenmerri will also become more saline. This may reduce the invertebrate diversity in the lakes. In Bullenmerri, the rising salinity could cause a shift in the algal plankton and so influence the whole food web, recreational fish species included, putting its place as an important recreational fishery at risk. This suggests that a regional plan to manage the quality and amenity of lakes in Western Victoria under a drying climate and other threats is urgently needed.

J	Zhao, Y; Yu, ZC; Zhao, C				Zhao, Yan; Yu, Zicheng; Zhao, Cheng			Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) declines at 9800 and 5300 cal. yr BP caused by Holocene climatic shifts in northeastern North America	HOLOCENE												We present fossil pollen data from a sediment core at Lake Grinnell in northern New Jersey of the northeastern United States. The 12 500-yr chronology of the sediment record was controlled by seven calibrated AMS radiocarbon dates on terrestrial plant macrofossils. Similar to many pollen profiles in the region, our data show that vegetation changed from Picea- and Pinus-dominated woodland/forest at 12.5-11.4 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal. yr BP), through Pinus-dominated mixed forest at 11.4-9.3 ka, to Quercus-dominated forest after 9.3 ka. Some main tree taxa, including Tsuga, Ulmus and Acer, arrived and expanded during the Quercus expansion phase at 11.4-9.3 ka in the early Holocene, while other trees, including Fagus and Carya, established and expanded much later around 9 ka. Pollen data show that major forest shifts were in response to climatic change as independently inferred from oxygen-isotope records in the same core. These responses include major turnovers of tree species at the onset of the Holocene after the Younger Dryas, including the disappearance of Picea, declines of boreal taxa Betula and Alnus, and expansions of most other temperate trees. Our new records show two hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) decline events during the Holocene that were both likely caused by climatic change. The early-Holocene hemlock decline centering around 9.5 ka was marked by >10-fold decrease in hemlock populations, which was probably caused by summer high temperature as inferred from high oxygen isotope values. The mid-Holocene hemlock decline from 5.3 ka to 3.0 ka corresponds with a pronounced shift in oxygen isotopes at Grinnell and with a dry climate interval documented from other records in northeastern North America.

A distributional survey, conducted from Dec. 1978-May 1979 and Jan.-April 1980, found N. lewisi at 32% of 361 sites surveyed. Animals predominantly occurred in streams wider than 15 m, deeper than 100 cm, and with a main channel flow rate greater than 10 cm s, and were found in streams from the headwaters of both drainages to the vicinity of saltwater influence near the coast. None were found in lakes or ponds. N. punctatus was sympatric with N. lewisi at 19 sites along the Fall Line. Capture success was highest at sites where the substrate consisted mostly of clay or hard soil substrate: however, N. lewisi were captured on all common substrate types. Some areas with potential effluent problems yielded no specimens. Activity away from cover was almost strictly nocturnal, and rising water and high turbidity seemed to stimulate activity. No animals were trapped when minimum stream temperatures rose above 18.degree. C. Both larvae and adult N. lewisi apepared to be opportunistic feeders. larvae ate a variety of small aquatic arthropods, while adults expanded their diet to include other aquatic and some terrestrial invertebrates, along with both aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. Sympatic N. punctatus had a similar diet except for the terrestrial components. The wide distribution of N. lewisi in the Neuse and Tar River basins argues against Endangered or Threatened status at this time, but a conservation status of Special Concern may be warranted due to the animal''s need for larger streams with relatively clean, flowing water.																			0193-4406						1985		10					13	35																WOS:A1985AFB9700002

Seven decades of change in the zooplankton (s.l.) of the Nile delta lakes (Egypt), with particular reference to Lake Borullus	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Around the 1930s, the zooplankton (and benthos) of the Nile delta lakes, and Lake Borullus in particular, had a mixed, eutrophic facies, with marine and mesohaline elements dominant for about eight months per year, and freshwater species taking over during the four months of the Nile flood. After the Aswan dam became operational, this regime changed: a steady supply of agricultural drainage water of Nilotic origin consistently freshened the delta. Thus, except in the immediate vicinity of their outlet to the sea, the lakes became almost fresh. Only during the rare and short-lived (one-three weeks) occasions when Aswan closes in winter, marine water is sucked in, and along with it, a saline fauna temporarily becomes re-established in the east and centre of lake Borullus, and presumably of the other delta lakes as well. This marine fauna remained the same over 70+ years of observations. The freshwater component, in contrast, partly nilotic, partly mediterranean, changed deeply over time. First, the fraction of species from temporary waters disappeared, as well as (among copepods and cladocerans) all large-bodied species. Several cladocerans and copepods with a euro-mediterranean range appeared and diluted the pre-existing Afrotropical fauna. The abundance of small cladocerans and, especially, rotifers increased by a factor ten or more. This latter change is believed to reflect two pressures. In a first phase, a re-arrangement of the lake's fish fauna (a top down force) occurred. Freshwater fish replaced marine diadromic species, and their predation pressure on the zooplankton preferentially removed large-bodied prey. In a second phase, increased agricultural drainage caused eutrophication (a bottom-up force) and larger filtrators (cladocerans, some copepods) began to be replaced by small filtrators (rotifers).																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2008	93	1					44	61		10.1002/iroh.200710960	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200710960													WOS:000253459200003

Discharge was also recorded between 1970 and 1999. Solute flux, calculated as the product of electrical conductivity and discharge, was used to assess how the year-to-year variability of discharge influences solute transport. Total May through September discharge of the Gornera was in the range -39.1% (1978) to +38.9% (1994) of the 1970-1999 period mean of 118.75 x 10(6) m(3). The range of variability of July through September electrical conductivity was between - 25.0% and +29.1 % of the mean of 19.6 muS cm(-1) for the four study years. The intra-annual range of total July through September solute flux in the Gornera extended from - 22.4% (in 1987, during which, of the four years, discharge for the three months was greatest) to +12.4% (in 1979, when discharge was the lowest) of the four study year means, which represents an average cationic load of - 25 x 10(6) eq. Variability of total solute flux (c(v) = 0.142) was greater than that of total discharge (c(v) = 0.127) in the three month period over the four years. Considerable intra-annual variability of total discharge over the three decades suggests that the total annual solute flux also fluctuated significantly from year to year.																			0029-1277						2004	35	4-5					359	367																WOS:000226167100008

Eutrophication, recovery and temperature in Lake Mjosa: detecting trends with monitoring data and sediment records	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. How climate warming may interact with other pressures on aquatic ecosystems is an important issue for research and management. We combined lake monitoring data with a palaeolimnological study to explore the combined effects of eutrophication and subsequent oligotrophication with a long-term temperature increase in epilimnetic waters. Our goals were (i) to evaluate how well sediment-based reconstructions reflect the instrumental observations, (ii) to use the palaeo-record to characterise a reference state for the lake and (iii) to explore whether data from the sediment record can aid in separating the effects of nutrient load and temperature in a large and deep lake. 2. Lake Mjosa is a large and deep lake in south-eastern Norway. Eutrophication symptoms peaked in the 1970s, which led to extensive measures to reduce the phosphorus load. A monitoring programme has run continuously from 1972. Monitoring has documented a marked decrease in phosphorus load and algal biomass and also revealed an increase in epilimnetic temperature and extended summer stratification. 3. Records of algal pigments and diatoms were extracted from sediment cores taken from 236 m depth. The pigment record documented dramatic changes in lake production consistent with the monitoring record. The diatom record reflected well the eutrophication history of the lake and also demonstrated that the assemblage of the recent recovery stage differs from that of the pre-eutrophication period. 4. Ordination of diatom assemblages over time constrained by proxies for nutrient load and temperature indicated that the diatom assemblage correlated with both factors, which together accounted for 60% of the variation in diatom composition. No interaction was detected between these factors. The results suggest that the diatom assemblage has responded to varying nutrient loads as well as to changes in temperature and/or factors that correlate with temperature. 5. Reconstructions of algal biomass and total phosphorus content mirrored known changes through the monitoring period, although the absolute phosphorus estimates were too high relative to the instrumental record. The sediment record from Lake Mjosa provides a baseline for lake production in terms of algal pigments and organic contents, and for the diatom assemblage composition in a pristine stage.					; Moe, S./AAC-8121-2020; Bennion, Helen/T-7848-2019; Grung, Merete/ABH-4196-2022	Bennion, Helen/0000-0003-0125-9308; Moe, Jannicke/0000-0002-3681-3551; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2012	57	10					1998	2014		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02832.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02832.x													WOS:000308405300003

Lake Peipsi is one of the largest lake in Europe, its area is 3555 km(2) and mean depth is 7.1 m. The study results for the vegetation seasons (May-October) obtained for the decade 1997-2008 allow to evaluate the long-term changes in the functioning of its ecosystem in terms of dynamics of phyto-and zooplankton and nutrient content in a lake. Lake Peipsi consists of three different parts: the northern, the largest and deepest one is eutrophic L. Peipsi s.s. (sensu stricto), the southernmost part is hypertrophic L. Pihkva, connected with L. Peipsi s.s. by the river-like L. Lammijarv. The decrease in nutrient loading to L. Peipsi observed in the early 1990s was brought about by social changes (collapse of Soviet type agriculture) rather than by the purification of point-pollution sources. In the northern part, Lake Peipsi s.s., the content of both nitrogen and phosphorus was stabilized, while the increase in phosphorus in the water of L. Pihkva was evident. The resistance of the three lake parts to external nutrient loading is different. It seems that the ecosystem of the southern lake part (L. Pihkva) is losing its resilience. The disturbance of the ecosystem is most likely caused by the fact that the slight trend of re-oligotrophication beginning in the early 1990s was reversed in the mid-1990s due to increasing P loading. The resistance of the three lake parts to external nutrient loading is different. It seems that the ecosystem of the southern lake part (L. Pihkva) is losing its resilience. The share of cyanobacteria in phytoplankton biomass increased from 20% to 60% in L. Peipsi s.s., and from 30% to 90% in the southern parts of the lake in the summer months. The lake was characterized by massive cyanobacterial blooms. Potentially toxic genera (Microcystis, Aphanizomenon, Anabaena, Gloeotrichia) dominated, and the quantity of microcystins in the lake was relatively large. The biomass of phytoplankton increased whereas that of all zooplankton groups - cladocerans, copepods and rotifers - decreased. The most essential decline affected rotifers: their abundance was about 60% lower in 2001-2008 than in the 1990s. The biomass of copepods decreased almost 50% and that of cladocerans 34%. In parallel with changes in plankton, the fish composition of L. Peipsi was characterized by sharp decline of planktivorous smelt (Osmerus eperlanus eperlanus m. spirinchus Pallas) and vendace (Coregonus albula (L). The most likely causes of the changes seem to be mainly the anthropogenic P input, decreasing N:P ratio, cyanobacterial toxins, and changes in ichthyo-coenosis. Our data from last decade demonstrate a kind of disturbance in the ecosystem of the lake as compared to the second half of last century. The disturbance of the ecosystem is most likely caused by the fact that the slight trend of re-oligotrophication beginning in the early 1990s was reversed in the mid-1990s due to increasing P loading from southern part of lake watershed.																			1505-2249						2010	58	4					645	662																WOS:000285679100005

Effects of shoreline development on the nearshore environment in large deep oligotrophic lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In large deep oligotrophic lakes, the shallow nearshore waters may provide the most important habitat for animals to feed and breed, and it is this area of the lake where humans are most likely to have initial impacts as the shoreline is developed. Nutrients in fertilizers, sediments and sewage effluents are likely to be rapidly intercepted by nearshore algae at the lake edge, having heterogeneous effects nearshore before offshore effects are noted. 2. Here we examined the spatially explicit effects of residential development on nearshore periphyton communities in three large deep oligotrophic lakes that have all experienced modest residential development in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. We demonstrate that substantial nearshore changes in the basal food web are detectable even with low levels of shoreline development. These changes can potentially affect whole-lake food web dynamics. 3. For our primary study site (Lake Crescent, Washington, USA), we found that algal biomass and accumulation of detritus were higher at developed sites. In addition, both macroinvertebrate and periphyton communities exhibited a shift in composition with more detritivores and filamentous green algae at developed sites. These differences were more pronounced during the spring than at other times of year. 4. A complementary investigation of field patterns in Priest Lake and Lake Pend Oreille (Idaho, USA) suggested that, although spatial and temporal patterns were idiosyncratic, indicators of productivity and the presence of filamentous green algae were generally higher at developed sites across lakes. 5. Stable isotope signatures and water column nutrients were not useful in distinguishing developed and undeveloped sites, increasing the potential usefulness of periphyton monitoring during early stages of lake development. 6. A laboratory investigation suggested that common macroinvertebrate grazers assimilated a much greater proportion of diatoms than the filamentous green algae that are associated with fertilization at developed sites. 7. These findings have at least two clear implications: (i) periphyton may be used to detect human impacts before disturbance is evident in offshore monitoring programmes and (ii) nearshore impacts in response to modest residential development have the potential to disrupt lake food web dynamics.

J	Wihlborg, P; Danielsson, Å; Klingberg, F				Wihlborg, P; Danielsson, Å; Klingberg, F			Mercury in Lake Vanern, Sweden. Distribution in surface sediment and catchment budget	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Lake Vanern is Sweden's largest lake and freshwater reservoir. Large quantities of mercury were released into the lake during a large part of the 20th century, resulting in serious contamination. The main load originated from one single point source - a chlor-alkali industry. Its releases were drastically reduced in the early 1970' s, but nearby sediments displayed alarmingly high concentrations. During summer 2001, fifty-one sediment cores were taken, and analysed for total mercury. It was found that mercury concentrations in surface sediments have decreased significantly between 1974 and 2001, but the influence of the former single point source was still reflected in the concentration patterns. Thirty years ago, sediments around the dominant point source displayed the highest concentrations. Today, the highest concentrations in surface sediments were still found close to it, but also in deep waters in the central part of the lake. Surprisingly, the gradient from the point source is stronger today compared to 1974. A mercury budget, based on the annual sediment accumulation rate, the bulk density, atmospheric load and outflow of mercury, was formed. The surface sediments ( 0 - 1 cm, on average corresponding to similar to 5 yr according to Cs-137 dating) in accumulation bottoms ( water depth > 40m) contained approximately 530 kg Hg ( corresponding value for year 1974 was 4100 kg Hg). A majority of the present additions of mercury to the lake originates from atmospheric deposition. It was also found that the lake acts as a sink for mercury. In fact, approximately 90 - 95% of the incoming mercury was retained within the catchment or in the sediments.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				MAY	2004	154	1-4					85	99		10.1023/B:WATE.0000022930.42758.92	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:WATE.0000022930.42758.92													WOS:000220674700007

The erg deposits preserve depositional environments of eolian dune, interdune, fluvial, playa, lake, and spring. A large range of SSD features, from intact beds showing little deformation to pervasively disturbed beds, exist in many of these deposits. A simplified classification index captures the different scales of SSD in ascending order of deformation intensity: 1) mostly intact bedding with small-scale wavy or undulatory deformation structures within single beds; 2) dish and flame structures; 3) meter-scale, kinked, slumped, rolled, overturned, vertical, and detached contorted crossbedding, and associated centimeter- to meter-scale pipes; and 4) disruptive diapirs and laterally extensive massive sandstone. The SSD features of deformed crossbed sets, diapirs, and massive sandstone beds, are consistently juxtaposed, and are thus genetically linked. Although the Navajo Sandstone has been considered a classic example of an extensive dry eolian system, both individual and combinations of strata bounded SSD features exemplify dynamic deformation, liquefaction, and fluidization that took place at various times after deposition. The lowest degree of deformation, SSD 1, is largely attributed to autogenic-inherent to the eolian system-or local allogenic processes. Larger degrees of deformation, SSD 2-4, were more likely produced by allogenic, external-forcing processes from regional changes in climate and/or near-surface groundwater conditions originating from the Uncompahgre uplift, with the deformation triggered by some event(s). Possible significant ground motion could have led to large-scale disruption in the Navajo sand sea across kilometer-scale intervals. The Navajo example establishes valuable hierarchical relationships of processes and products for recognizing and interpreting SSD in other ancient and modern eolian systems. This has particular relevance to sedimentary discoveries on Mars, where SSD features are visible from remote sensing imagery and rover exploration.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				OCT	2020	90	9					1068	1093		10.2110/jsr.2020.57	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2020.57													WOS:000595068100004

Flood Routing in the Catchment of Urbanized Lakes	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER RESOURCES, COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING (ICWRCOE'15)	Aquatic Procedia				International Conference on Water Resources, Coastal and Ocean Engineering (ICWRCOE)	MAR 11-14, 2015	Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Mangaluru, INDIA		Natl Inst Technol Karnataka			The number of the lakes in Bengaluru has fallen from 262 in 1960 to 81 in 1985 due to the rapid urbanization. As the catchment and command area becomes more urbanized, the impact of more impervious area, decreased potential for infiltration, and loss of natural depression storage has changed the response to runoff due to rainfall and thus the shape (peak and time base) of the resulting runoff hydrograph. For routing peak runoff through the lake, a flood hydrograph is determined. The study area is Hulimavu lake situated in the south east part of Bengaluru of Pennar River Basin, Bellandur/Varthur Series and Madivala sub Series at an average elevation of 922 m above MSL, spread out in area of about 0.566 km(2). The catchment area of 11.11 km(2) is located between Latitude 12 degrees 50'00 '' N and 12 degrees 52'45 '' N and Longitude 77 degrees 34'30 '' E and 77 degrees 37'00 '' E. The lake area is being encroached for urban activities, decreasing the surcharge storage capacity thereby inundating downstream and upstream areas due to backwater effect. Flood routing studies are carried out for existing storage capacity of the reservoir (0.8Mm(3)) and for the revised / enhanced storage capacity of the reservoir (1.023Mm(3)) by de-silting by an amount of 0.2 Mm(3). Flood study shows peak discharge of 148.82 m(3)/s occurs for a return period of 50 years. Flood routing analysis shows peak flood flowing over the surplus weir is 29 m(3)/s and 17.5 m(3)/s for existing and enhanced storage respectively. This enhanced storage will overcome reduction in submerged area and the submergence level from 896.3 m to 895.95 m which is less than the Maximum Water Level (896.00 m) for the peak discharge of 148.82 m(3)/s.

Modelling the spread and growth of Caulerpa taxifolia in closed waterways in southern Australia using cellular automata	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)					20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math				This study presents the mathematical development of a cellular automata model for the species Caulerpa taxifolia for closed or intermittently closed waterways along the Australian coast. The model is used to assess the spatial coverage of C. taxifolia by describing changes in growth, spread and total biomass for the species. Building upon a foundation model developed by the authors, this study was designed to enhance the predictive capabilities of a model based upon a discrete version of Laplace's equation. The improvements relate to several components integrated into the Laplacian coefficients; a periodic function which represents the seasonal variations in growth, the incorporation of the prevailing wind to represent the most likely direction of spread, and growth restrictions based on lake depth. The additional complexity improved the predictive capability of the model. Cellular Automata (CA) have been used to model changing plant distributions over the last 20 years, providing efficient models for complex environmental systems, particularly of exotic species. In this project the discrete CA algorithm is designed to determine the state or biomass B = {-1; 0; 1; 2} of the current cell using the primary rule of the discrete Laplacian system. Biomass of -1 refers to land, and the other values represent the relative quantity of the weed in the cell; none, sparse or dense respectively. Cell interactions are governed by the coefficients of the Laplacian system which is discussed. The foundation model incorporated simple rules, not unlike those of John Conway's Game of Life. The biomass of the surrounding cells at time t determines the state of the central cell at time t + 1. The boundary conditions were catered for by allocating a biomass of negative one to the land cells adjacent to the water. The results indicate that the model is able to predict the total surface coverage and total biomass at levels of accuracy commensurate with the input data, which is important for control measures. Also, high accuracy in the predicted locational data at Lake Conjola indicates that the model is able to identify appropriate growing conditions to aid in the eradication efforts. At successive time steps, the model produces accurate patch location data with a slight overestimation on patch size due to slight error prediction of the decay in the initial winter season. The principle objective of this new study is to improve the predictive capabilities of the model developed by the authors, by taking into account the biological and environmental factors of growth and spread and in doing so, more accurately predict the spatial coverage and colonization locations of C. taxifolia growth and spread in a closed or intermittently closed estuary. This model is designed to inform resource managers and government bodies of the most effective methods of eradication.																					978-0-9872143-3-1				2013							427	433																WOS:000357105900063

Sediment characteristics, absence of diatoms and scarce pollen suggest that before 18,000 cal yr BP, glacier meltwaters were feeding the small basin when local glaciers were at their maximum position. From 18,000 to ca. 14,000 cal yr BP, the site was a shallow productive pond surrounded by a sparse scrub-steppe and accompanied some fire activity. This period was markedly drier, but warmer than before. By 14,000 cal yr BP, the fen developed and a species-rich steppe expanded suggesting a moderate increase in effective moisture and temperature. High fluctuations of terrestrial and aquatic pollen taxa occur between 14,000 and 11,000 cal yr BP, attesting to climate variability at this time. Between 11,000 and 7500 cal yr BP, Nothofagus steppe-woodland developed and fire activity was very high, with several large local events. Precipitation must have increased, but most likely summers were drier than today with high frequency of convective storms. After 7500 cal yr BP present-day closed Nothofagus forest became established, and fire activity decreased, suggesting establishment of present-day equable precipitation regime. The forest was more open between 4000 and 1500 cal yr BP than before and shrubs or trees grew on the fen. Forest clearance and grazing only began in the mid-20th century. Both in terms of timing and character of past changes in vegetation and fire activity, the record from M. Pollux takes an intermediate position between records from high southern latitudes, versus those from mid-latitudes, indicating the different latitudinal expression of the southern westerly storm tracks during the last 18,000 cal yr BP.

Detecting impacts and setting restoration targets in arid-zone rivers: aquatic micro-invertebrate responses to reduced floodplain inundation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Water extraction from arid-zone rivers increases the time between floods across their floodplain wetlands. Less frequent flooding in Australian arid-zone rivers has impaired waterbird and fish breeding, killed riparian vegetation and diminished invertebrate and macrophyte communities. Restoration currently focuses on reinstating floods to rejuvenate floodplain wetlands, yet indicators to measure the success of this are poorly developed. 2. We explored the application of criteria for ecologically successful river restoration to potential restoration of floodplain wetlands on the Darling River, arid-zone Australia. Using emergence of micro-invertebrates from resting eggs as an indicator, we compared responses of taxa richness, densities and community composition in floodplain lakes with different inundation histories. 3. Increased drying of floodplain lakes reduced the number of micro-invertebrate taxa. Several key taxa were absent and faunal densities (particularly cladocerans) were reduced when the duration of drying increased from 6 to 20 years. 4. A conceptual model of the ecological mechanisms by which restoration of flooding regime could achieve the target of preserving micro-invertebrate community resilience predicts that reducing the dry period between floods will minimize losses of viable resting eggs. Protection of this 'egg bank' permits a boom in micro-invertebrates after flooding, promoting successful recruitment by native fish and waterbirds. 5. Synthesis and applications. In arid-zone rivers, micro-invertebrate densities and community composition are useful indicators of the impact of reduced flooding as a result of water extraction. Critical to successful native fish recruitment as their first feed and as prey for waterbirds, micro-invertebrates are a potential early indicator of responses by higher trophic levels. Taxon richness, density and key taxa present after flooding, all indicators of resilience, can be incorporated into targets for arid-zone river restoration. For example, one restoration target may be microcrustacean densities between 100 and 1000 L-1 within 2-3 weeks after spring flooding. These criteria can be applied to measure the ecological success of restoration projects seeking to recover natural flood regimes. Given the high economic cost of water in arid zones, convincing demonstrations of the ecological success of environmental water allocations are crucial.																			0021-8901	1365-2664				AUG	2007	44	4					823	832		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01298.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01298.x													WOS:000247667100012
J	Sano, K; Ueda, J; Hafuka, A; Kimura, K				Sano, Kazuto; Ueda, Jumpei; Hafuka, Akira; Kimura, Katsuki			Development of a novel in-sediment passive sampler for profiling orthophosphate and internal phosphorus release near the sediment-water interface in a eutrophic lake	WATER RESEARCH												Internal phosphorus (P) release from lake sediments is now recognized as an important P supply that maintains eutrophication, especially in lakes where stratification induces hypoxic conditions in the bottom waters. Freshwater lakes are increasingly threatened by eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. Therefore, to manage lakes, it is important to quantify the internal P release. The internal flux of P (i.e., the orthophosphate (PO4) released from the sediments) may be miscalculated by the methods used to date, such as sediment core samples because the concentrations may be affected when the sediment is disturbed, and the spatial resolution of the sampling may be low. In this study, we developed a novel in-sediment passive sampler to determine the PO4 flux from sediment and deployed it in a eutrophic lake, Lake Barato in Sapporo, Japan. We also deployed Chem-catcher passive samplers for PO4 at the same time to investigate the change in the PO4 concentrations in the water column. With these methods, we obtained the vertical and horizontal distributions of the PO4 concentrations in the sediment porewater across approximately 10 x 20 cm close to the sediment-water interface (SWI) and in the water column. We observed relatively large centimeter-scale PO4 hotspots within the shallow sediment layers (-1 to-5 cm below the SWI). These PO4 hotspots were significantly larger during the summer season than in the other seasons, when thermal stratification and hypoxia influenced the P release. The PO4 fluxes calculated with data from the in-sediment passive samplers ranged from 0.05 to 0.37 mg-P/m2/d, and were considerably lower than the estimates from the conventional sediment core sampling methods. In addition, the data from the Chemcatcher passive samplers showed that the temporal patterns in the time-weighted average PO4 concentrations (around 10 mu g-P/L) in the water column were consistent with the patterns from the in-sediment sampler. The results suggest that the in-sediment sampler provided a high-resolution vertical profile of the PO4 concentrations near the SWI with minimal sediment disturbance, and that passive sampling techniques could be used to monitor the fluxes of PO4 released from sediments and the PO4 concentrations in the water column.

J	BROWN, EE; MILLER, HM; BLANKS, NL				BROWN, EE; MILLER, HM; BLANKS, NL			SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF SOUTHERN APPALACHIA HANDICRAFT INDUSTRY	GEORGIA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION RESEARCH REPORT												This paper examines the population dynamics of the bloater (C. hoyi) in Lake Michigan, during a progressive decline in abundance from about the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s, and during a subsequent recovery that is still underway. The study focused on developing a data base and methodology for projecting fishable surpluses, in cooperation with a chub technical committee sponsored by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The Technical Committee was formed in 1974 because of depletion of bloaters and other deepwater ciscoes or chubs, as they are known by Greak Lakes fishermen. Subsequently the Technical Committee recommended a lakewide ban on chub fishing that was fully enacted by the states of Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 1976. With the Committee''s help, commercial fishery statistics and stock assessment data were obtained from state and federal research files and used with various indirect analytical techniques to estimate relevant population parameters. The lakewide fishable stock in fall 1973, before the fishery was affected by several incomplete closures and then by the lakewide ban, was estimated as 48 to 73 million bloaters weighing 20 to 29 million lbs. Exploitation of the estimated stock varied considerably among 11 statistical districts in the several jurisdictions. Yield to the fishery exceeded production by the stock in some districts. Theoretical yields of bloaters totaling 3.59 to 3.72 million lbs. were projected for 1979 from all waters combined. These projected yields were intended as guidelines for experimental quotas that the states might establish, because the population had stabilized and the potential for recruitment had improved in most areas.																									1985		483					1	22																WOS:A1985ARV1300001
J	Coombs, S; Braun, CB; Donovan, B				Coombs, S; Braun, CB; Donovan, B			The orienting response of Lake Michigan mottled sculpin is mediated by canal neuromasts	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Lake Michigan mottled sculpin, Cottus bairdi, exhibit a naturally occurring and unconditioned orienting response that can be triggered by both live prey and chemically inert vibrating spheres, even in blinded animals. CoCl(2)-induced reductions of the orienting response demonstrate that the lateral line is required for this behavior in the absence of non-mechanosensory cues (such as vision), but shed no light on the relative contributions of superficial and canal neuromasts to this behavior, To determine the relative roles of these two subsystems, we measured the frequency with which mottled sculpin oriented towards a small vibrating sphere before and after two treatments: (i) immersion of fish in a solution of gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic that damages hair cells in canal, but not superficial, neuromasts; and (ii) scraping the skin of the fish, which damages the superficial, but not the canal, neuromasts. To ensure that both superficial and canal neuromasts were adequately stimulated, we tested at different vibration frequencies (10 and 50 Hz) near or at the best frequency for each type of neuromast, At both test frequencies, response rates before treatment were greater than 70 % and were significantly greater than 'spontaneous' response frequencies measured in the absence of sphere vibration. Response rates fell to spontaneous levels after 1 day of gentamicin treatment and did not return to pre-treatment levels for 10-15 days. In contrast, response rates stayed approximately the same after superficial neuromasts had been damaged by skin abrasion. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed hair cell damage (loss of apical cilia) in canal, but not superficial, neuromasts of gentamicin-treated animals after as little as 24 h of treatment. The sensory epithelium of canal neuromasts gradually returned to normal, following a time course similar to behavioral loss and recovery of the orienting response, whereas that of superficial neuromasts appeared normal throughout the entire period. This study shows that the orienting response of the mottled sculpin is mediated by canal neuromasts.

J	Chu, C; Jones, NE				Chu, C.; Jones, N. E.			SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF THERMAL REGIMES AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF STREAM FISH COMMUNITIES IN THE GREAT LAKES BASIN, ONTARIO, CANADA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Temperature is one of the most important environmental variables in stream ecosystems because it affects the growth, survival and distribution of stream biota. This study examined if the spatial variability of thermal regimes and 18 other environmental variables were associated with fish communities in watersheds throughout the Great Lakes Basin (GLB), Ontario. The thermal regimes were defined as regimes 1, 2 and 3 and had maximum water temperatures of 26.4, 28.4 and 23.58 degrees C, and spring warming rates of 0.20, 0.12 and 0.10 degrees Cd-1, respectively. The spatial variability of the thermal regimes (VTR) within the watersheds was summarized into four VTR groups: S1, S2, M23 and M123. Stream sites in S1 watersheds had temperatures characteristic of regime 1 whereas stream sites in S2 watersheds followed regime 2. M23 watersheds had sites with a mix of regimes 2 and 3 whereas M123 watersheds had all three thermal regimes at sites throughout watersheds. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that 16% of the variation in fish communities was related to the spatial VTR in the watersheds. Forward selection CCA indicated that elevation, the S1 VTR group, sparse forest cover, wetland area, base flow index (groundwater discharge potential), flow and industrial stress explained 42% of the variance in the fish communities. Simplified indicator species analysis (ISA) showed that different species could be used as indicators for each of the VTR groups. Human activities such as industrial development, deforestation, groundwater withdrawal and flow alteration all may affect the environmental variables related to stream fish communities.

J	Ecke, F				Ecke, Frauke			Drainage ditching at the catchment scale affects water quality and macrophyte occurrence in Swedish lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We have limited knowledge of the effects of land use in general and of drainage ditching in particular on macrophyte communities in lakes. I quantified catchment land use, including drainage ditching, as well as water quality and the number of macrophyte species in 17 Swedish lakes in summer 2005. 2. Land use within 1 km of the studied lakes was analysed in a geographic information system. The following variables were included: areas of forests, mires, agricultural land and urbanization, length of drainage ditches (classified according to the use of the land they drained), and shortest distance from lake to an urban area. To extract and analyse general trends in the data sets, redundancy analysis was used. 3. Water quality was explained mainly by three land-use related variables: the lengths of agricultural, forest and mire ditches. The length of agricultural ditches was positively correlated with lake water conductivity, total dissolved solids, Ca, N and total organic carbon (TOC). The lengths of forest and mire ditches were positively correlated with lake water characteristics, especially TOC. 4. The number of species representing different macrophyte life forms was explained by three environmental variables: conductivity, and lengths of forest and agricultural ditches. The numbers of isoetids, nymphaeids, elodeids and total obligate hydrophytes were negatively correlated with length of forest ditches. In contrast, the number of lemnids and helophytes was positively correlated with conductivity and length of agricultural ditches. Furthermore, the number of isoetids was exponentially related (negatively) to lengths of agricultural and forest ditches, indicating a threshold response to drainage ditch length. 5. The results suggest that effects on water quality and macrophyte communities result from drainage ditching in the lake catchments rather than from land use itself. Given the total area of drainage-ditched land worldwide (millions of ha in Scandinavia alone), drainage ditching should be considered when evaluating environmental impacts on lake water quality and macrophyte occurrence and when determining reference conditions for catchment land use.

J	Sasaki, S; Seto, K; Katsuki, K				Sasaki, Satoshi; Seto, Koji; Katsuki, Kota			Holocene Paleoenvironment Changes Near Lake Funazoko-Ike, East Antarctica, Based on Analyses of Sediments and Microfossils	ISLAND ARC												Lake Funazoko-Ike was formed by a relative sea level fall due to crustal uplift after the melting of the ice sheet. Today, the lake surface lies approximately 25 m below the present sea level. Evidence of these processes is recorded in sediments deposited from the sill to the lake surface around Lake Funazoko-Ike during the middle to late Holocene. A total of 123 sediment samples were collected from outcrops of the Holocene-raised beach around Lake Funazoko-Ike in Skarvsnes, Antarctica, during geomorphological surveys by the 38th and 46th Japanese Antarctic Research Expeditions (JARE38 and JARE46). The samples were analyzed for grain size, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (CNS) contents, as well as microfossil assemblages, including arenaceous foraminifera and siliceous microfossils. Radiocarbon dating of marine fossils yielded ages ranging from approximately 4100 to 800 cal. yr. BP. From six samples, we identified at least 54 species belonging to 29 genera of siliceous microfossils. Arenaceous foraminifera were identified in one additional sample. Three sea-ice indicator diatom taxa were dominant in all six samples. These results suggest that Lake Funazoko-Ike was in an open marine environment from approximately 4100 to 1200 cal. yr. BP. The lake became isolated from the sea sometime between 800 and 1200 cal. yr. BP. This timing aligns with the isolation of the coastal margin in northwest Skarvsnes, providing evidence to understand spatial and temporal variations in ice sheet dynamics during the Holocene.																			1038-4871	1440-1738				JUL 28	2025	34	1							e70026	10.1111/iar.70026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/iar.70026													WOS:001537630600001

This necessitates precise monitoring of sediment-bearing tributary inflows, a crucial requirement for effective governance strategies on the Loess Plateau's current developmental stage. While satellite remote sensing technology has been widely used to estimate suspended particulate matter concentration (CSPM) in open water bodies like oceans and lakes, its application in narrow rivers presents challenges related to hybrid pixel and proximity effects. As a result, the effectiveness and competence of satellite remote sensing in monitoring CSPM in such confined river environments are reduced. This study attempted to use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing with multispectral technology to invert CSPM in the Wuding River, a sediment-bearing Yellow River tributary. A novel CSPM concentration inversion model was introduced for highly turbid river settings. The results showed that the accuracy of the new band ratio model in this study is significantly improved compared with the existing models. The validation dataset had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.83, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.73 g/L, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 44.95% (MAPE is 40.68% at 1-20 g/L, and 12.37% at >20 g/L). On this basis, the UAV also monitored the impacts of heavy rainfall on the CSPM, resulting in a rapid rise and fall in CSPM over a period of ten hours. This study demonstrated the potential of UAV remote sensing for CSPM monitoring in extremely turbid narrow rivers (tens to tens of meters), especially before and after rainfall sediment production events, which can provide technical support for accurate sediment management and source identification in the main tributaries of the Yellow River and help realize the goal of high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin.

The realization of the fish ladder will not influence the flow regime of the surface or groundwater in the neighboring area. The fish ladder is dimensioned so as to allow the migration of the ichthyofauna upstream during the spawning period and the partial transit of the alluviums as well as the downstream provision of a servitude flow Q = 0.059 mc/s. The Sebeel 1 hydroelectric power plant is a hydropower arrangement by shunt without accumulation lake. The plant has two power groups equipped with Pelton turbines. The power delivered by MHC Sebesel 1 is 876.03 kW. The installed flow rate is 0.90 m3/s; gross fall: 131 m; capture rate 814 mdMN. The fish ladders are of the technical ladder type with pools. The objectives of the studies were: to describe the qualitative and quantitative structure of benthic invertebrate and fish macro communities; assessment of the ecological status of the rivers in the areas of hydropower development; highlighting the presence of fish species of conservative interest and assessing the status of their populations. The methodology was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Water Framework Directive, Annex V used took into account the following: Assessment of the status of aquatic communities; description of the structure of fish communities; assessment of the ecological status of the river sectors. The study led to obtaining some essential information for the exploitation and maintenance of the micro-hydroelectric plant as well as the fish ladder.					; Beilicci, Robert/LIF-6593-2024; Beilicci, Erika/AFD-9127-2022	Beilicci, Robert Florin/0009-0003-7065-0834; 													1757-8981						2020	960								032080	10.1088/1757-899X/960/3/032080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/960/3/032080													WOS:000646533100189

Recent Indian studies in Himalayan cryosphere	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY												Cryosphere all over the globe is thawing, be it the Arctic, Antarctic, Greenland or Himalaya. Studies have predicted that loss in the glacier mass over the Upper Indus Basin in Kashmir Himalaya would amount to 47 to 67% (Romshoo in 7th conference of Science and Geopolitics of Arctic and Antarctic, 2023). A similar trend prevails in the Bhaga basin of the Upper Chenab, where glaciers in size classes < 0.5 km(2) and 0.5(-1) km(2) show a higher relative loss of 25% (0.5% year(-1)) and 13% (0.3% year(-1)) respectively (Das et al. in Quat Sci Rev 316:108258; J Mt Sci 20:299-324, 2023). The loss in Eastern Himalaya (Sikkim) has been reported to range from 20 to 30% (Debnath in 7th conference of Science and Geopolitics of Arctic and Antarctic, 2023). On the basis of the compiled records of snout fluctuations of 285 glaciers and two regional means spanning 17 decades from the 1850s, it has been deduced that most of the Himalayan glaciers are retreating, and the retreat rates have accelerated in the past few decades, but the observed tendencies are not regionally uniform (Kulkarni et al. in Water Security 14(6557):100101; J Indian Soc Remote Sensing 49(8):1951-1963, 2021). The excessive ice mass loss has resulted in the formation and/or expansion of glacial melt water lakes posing a threat of Glacial Lake Outburst Flow (GLOF). The results of the studies on the response of climatic variability over the state of cryosphere, the role of debris on the melting of glaciers, changes in the winter precipitation pattern and consequent impact on the hydrological cycle, water availability and state of permafrost over Himalaya have also been a focus of studies, including developing models (Banerjee et al. in Geophys Res Lett 49:096989, 2020), in contemporary publications, enriching the data on the fundamental aspects of glacial processes that are of great societal relevance.

Mud domes are often found in compressional tectonic settings such as the Caucasus orogenic wedge. Dashgil mud volcano, the most prominent of >200 features in Azerbaijan, has erupted vigorously in historic times. For several years, we have observed variations in the activity of Dashgil dome, including transients in methane flux, build-up of extrusive mud cones on the main feature, and flexural polygonal cracks adjacent to the main crater lake and new mud cones. in spring 2007, we carried out in situ CPTU (Cone Penetration Testing with Pore Pressure measurement) experiments in the crestal area of Dashgil. Our data suggest that the central portion of the crater lake, which hosts the conduit for gas (and possible mud) ascent, shows both low sediment shear strength (<5-20 kPa) and excess pore fluid pressures between 15 and 30 kPa supra-hydrostatic at I m sub-bottom depth. In situ cone resistance as a measure for undrained shear strength is as low as 150 kPa in the conduit, whereas the mud is found rather stiff in all other testing locations (300-700 kPa, probably a result of deeply buried shales of the Maikop formation parts of which now liquefy and ascend). Pore pressure is low in the centre of the conduit, probably because of rapidly migrating gas. It increases to 30 kPa at the lake bottom and deep flank, then decreases upslope on the lake flank, and reaches hydrostatic values at the crater rim. From the over-pressured region beneath the fluid-filled crest of Dashgil dome, combined with the other observations, we suspect to currently witness an ongoing period of updoming. The presence of sintered mudstones from explosive eruptions in 1908 and 1928 (and most likely before) suggests that a similar violent activity may occur in the near future. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Herman, J; Mao, JP				Herman, Jay; Mao, Jianping			Seasonal variation of total column formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone over various Pandora spectrometer sites with a comparison of OMI and diurnally varying DSCOVR-EPIC satellite data	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Observations of trace gases, such as O3, HCHO, and NO2, and their seasonal dependence can be made using satellite and ground-based data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite and Pandora ground-based instruments. Both operate with spectrometers that have similar characteristics in wavelength range and spectral resolution that enable them to retrieve total column amounts of formaldehyde (TCHCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (TCNO2) and total column ozone (TCO). The polar orbiting OMI observes at 13:30 +/- 0:25 LST (local solar time) plus an occasional second side-scan point 90 min later at mid-latitudes. The ground-based Pandora spectrometer system observes the direct sun all day, with a temporal resolution of 2 min. At most sites, the Pandora data show a strong seasonal dependence for TCO and TCHCHO and less seasonal dependence for TCNO2. Use of a low-pass filter LOWESS(3-month) can reveal the seasonal dependence of TCNO2 for both OMI and Pandora at mid-latitude sites usually correlated with seasonal heating using natural gas or oil. Compared to Pandora, OMI underestimates the amount of NO2 air pollution that occurs during most days, as the OMI TCNO2 retrieval occurs around 13:30 +/- 0:25 LST, which tends to be near the frequent minimum of the daily TCNO2 time series. Even when the Pandora data are restricted to between 13:00 and 14:00 LST, OMI retrieves less TCNO2 than Pandora over urban sites because of OMI's large field of view. The seasonal behavior of TCHCHO is mostly caused by the release of HCHO precursors from plant growth and emissions from lakes that peak in the summer, as observed by Pandora and OMI. Long-term averages show that OMI TCHCHO usually has the same seasonal dependence but differs in magnitude from the amount measured by Pandora and is frequently larger. Comparisons of OMI total column NO2 and HCHO with Pandora daily time series show both agreement and disagreement at various sites and for different days, with the Pandora results frequently being larger. For ozone, daily time-dependent comparisons of OMI TCO with those retrieved by Pandora show good agreement in most cases. Additional diurnal comparisons are shown of Pandora TCO with hourly retrievals during a day from the EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) spacecraft instrument orbiting the Earth-Sun Lagrange point L1.																			1867-1381	1867-8548				SEP 8	2025	18	17					4165	4182		10.5194/amt-18-4165-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/amt-18-4165-2025													WOS:001565636000001

An Evaluation of Alnus (Alder) Germplasm in Five Diverse Nonagricultural Environments in Minnesota (USA)	II INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON WOODY ORNAMENTALS OF THE TEMPERATE ZONE	Acta Horticulturae				2nd International Symposium on Woody Ornamentals of the Temperate Zone	JUL 01-04, 2012	Ghent, BELGIUM	Int Soc Hort Sci				To reach the goal set by the United States Department of Energy to replace 30% of 2004 gasoline usage with biofuels by 2030, the U. S. will need to consider diverse biomass feedstock sources, such as the plant genus Alnus. This genus contains nitrogen-fixing species that grow in a wide variety of challenging conditions. This study focused on 13 species of Alnus and was designed to determine survival, and above ground biomass production in five diverse environments unsuitable for food production agriculture in Minnesota, USA. Additionally, seven Salix and four Populus selections, that have been tested in short rotation woody biomass systems, were included for comparative analysis. Ten of the 13 Alnus species died from winter injury at all locations or produced above ground biomass at levels well below individual site averages. These ten Alnus species are not well suited for the soils and climate in the upper Great Lakes region. However, three species, A. glutinosa, A. incana, and A. viridis exceeded 90% survival at all five sites and produced significantly more aboveground biomass than the other Alnus species. On a low-nitrogen site with coarse sandy soils, the three species produced an average of 5.35 megagrams per hectare of above ground biomass over a three year period. This exceeded the biomass production of all other materials in the trial including commercially available Populus and Salix selections confirming the a priori expectation that Alnus' potential symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria promotes increased growth on low fertility soils.

Rotenone induces mortality of invasive Lake Trout and Rainbow Trout embryos	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												ObjectiveNonnative fish, including Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush and Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, are actively invading lakes and streams and threatening Cutthroat Trout O. clarkii and other native species in the western United States. Programs have been implemented to suppress invasive trout using netting, trapping, electrofishing, angling, or other traditional capture methods. Because these methods are costly and primarily target older, free-swimming life stages, development of new suppression methods that target embryos on spawning areas is desired to increase suppression efficacy and reduce long-term costs. MethodsWe evaluated the capability of rotenone, N-methylpyrrolidone, diethylene glycol ethyl ether, sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, and gelatin to induce mortality of Lake Trout and Rainbow Trout embryos in controlled laboratory experiments. ResultExposure to liquid and powdered rotenone formulations for 12 h at 4 mg/L caused 98% +/- 0.7 (mean +/- SE) and 99% +/- 0.6 Lake Trout mortality, respectively. Exposure to liquid and powdered rotenone formulations for 12 h at 4 mg/L caused 62% +/- 4.7 and 85% +/- 3.2 Rainbow Trout mortality, respectively. N-methylpyrrolidone, diethylene glycol ethyl ether, sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, and gelatin exposures were not effective at increasing embryo mortality of either species. ConclusionDeveloping embryos represent a vulnerable life history stage that can be exploited by targeted applications of rotenone. Incorporating novel suppression techniques that effectively increase mortality of embryos in an integrated pest management approach may enhance effective suppression of invasive fishes.					; Webb, Molly/KRR-0296-2024; Poole, Alexis/GZL-0570-2022	Koel, Todd/0000-0001-6919-5828; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2023	152	1					3	14		10.1002/tafs.10394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10394		JAN 2023											WOS:000919116200001
J	Lavoie, C; Allard, M; Duhamel, D				Lavoie, Caroline; Allard, Michel; Duhamel, Denis			Deglaciation landforms and C-14 chronology of the Lac Guillaume-Delisle area, eastern Hudson Bay: A report on field evidence	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper presents new field data pertaining to the deglaciation of the Lac Guillaume-Delisle area, aiming to establish its emplacement in time and space between the breaching of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) over Hudson Bay and the final ice disintegration over Northern Quebec and Labrador. The deglaciation of the east coast of Hudson Bay started at 8200 cal BP in the south-western sector of the Lac Guillaume-Delisle estuary, when the marine limit was at 271 m above sea level (asl). By 8000 cal BP, frontal moraines and proximal glacio-marine sediments were deposited in the transverse valleys along the coastal cuesta ridges at a mean elevation of 250 m asl. They are associated with a regional topographic pinning event of the western margin of the Quebec-Labrador Ice Sheet (QLIS) on the high coastal relief. At that time, the coastal relief encouraged a change in deglaciation mode from fast calving in the open and deep Tyrrell Sea to a tidewater ice-sheet controlled by the topography. The ice front thereafter retreated eastward under very large and fast crustal unloading where ice-contact deltas fed by short sandar and eskers were deposited between 7900 and 7400 cal BP (between 240 and 195 m asl), as the ice front was receding inland and lost contact with Tyrrell Sea. A series of deposits and landforms characterize this modification in the sedimentation regime when the ice-sheet margin changed from tidewater to terrestrial. Dating shows that the deglaciation of the western margin of QLIS on land was very fast, i.e. faster than when the front of the ice-sheet was in contact with the Tyrrell Sea. As the fall of the relative sea-level continued, a large volume of paraglacial sediments was deposited in the river valleys making up vast fluvial terraces and deltas between 6500 and 5800 cal BP (between 125 and 100 m asl). Since then, land emergence has continued at a rate of about 1.3 m/century. Downcutting by rivers, post-glacial deltaic sedimentation and shoreline changes still continue today. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is one of the major paths for snow avalanches in the Alps, often triggered by serac falls from the Taconnaz glacier. On 24 November 2018, the basin's multi-risk nature was further accentuated by a new type of hazard with a rockfall triggered at c. 2700 m a.s.l. It travelled down over a distance of 1.85 km and stopped 165 m away from the construction site of a micro-hydroelectric power station. We studied the triggering conditions at the permafrost lower limit, the effects of the supra-glacial path on the flow patterns, and the fate of the scar and the deposit on torrential activity. By comparing a pre-event Structure from Motion model with a post-event LiDAR model, we estimated the volume of the scar to be 42,900 m3 (& PLUSMN;5%). A numerical model was employed to simulate the rapid runout. It revealed the complexity of the flow, attributed to the sequestration of a part of the deposit in crevasses, the incorporation of a significant volume of ice resulting in a transition from a dry granular flow to a mud-like flow, and the presence of numerous deposit zones. Subsequent monitoring of the area after the event allowed for the documentation of the scar's evolution, including a landslide, as well as the progressive degradation and evacuation of the deposit by the torrent without producing debris flow. The study of the triggering factors indicated glacial retreat as the probable main cause, assisted by the melting of ice lenses left by the permafrost disappearance. Finally, we present replicable methods for managing risks at the site following the event. This event improves the understanding of cascading processes that increasingly impact Alpine areas in the context of climate change.					; Bodin, Xavier/H-2677-2018; Deline, Philip/AFR-6521-2022; FAUG, Thierry/M-5877-2013	Ravanel, Ludovic/0000-0002-3680-6669; Bodin, Xavier/0000-0001-6245-4030; Cathala, Maeva/0000-0001-7212-3104; 														2076-3417				SEP	2023	13	17							9716	10.3390/app13179716	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app13179716													WOS:001062619100001

Saprolites, structures and slope angles - Applying site-specific geotechnical and mining knowledge to achieve the final design	6TH LARGE OPEN PIT MINING CONFERENCE 2007	Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Publication Series				6th Large Open Pit Mining Conference	SEP 10-11, 2007	Perth, AUSTRALIA	Datamine, DYNO				Sunrise Dam Gold Mine is a large open pit mine 730 kin NE of Perth, Western Australia. Contract mining commenced in the open pit in September 1996 in lake clays and saprolites with the first fresh rock mined late 1999, and the underground starting the first decline in October 2003. By May 2007, over 150 million cubic metres of material had been mined and the pit was 360 in deep with 80 in remaining before reaching the planned final depth in early 2008. A final cut-back in the northwest will continence in late 2007 with open pit mining in the Mega Pit expected to conclude in late 2010. The challenges of developing the pit can be divided into three phases: Soft materials - mining was in multiple staged pits and cut-backs in lake clays, saprolites, weathered material. The varying characteristics had a significant impact on mining methods and slope stability Structural - mining was gradually exposing more fresh rock and the drive was to understand how major structures and lithological contacts impact on local and large-scale stability. This had a significant influence on mine design and scheduling. Slope angles - achieving the final slope angle is critical. This is done through application of high standards of final wall establishment and proactive geotechnical hazard identification and management. This includes dealing with the rapid rate of descent, interaction with underground excavations and managing rock fall risk. The paper discusses each of these phases, highlighting the geotechnical controls implemented to date, looking at their success and impact on mining.																					978-1-920806-71-2				2007	2007	8					25	+																WOS:000254075100004

Using Lake Sediment Cores to Improve Records of Volcanism at Aluto Volcano in the Main Ethiopian Rift	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Aluto is a silicic volcano in central Ethiopia, flanked by two large population centers and home to an expanding geothermal power plant. Here we present data from two lake sediment cores sampled 12 and 25 km from the volcano, which record at least 24 distinct eruptions in the Holocene. Tephra layers from the two cores are correlated using a variety of techniques, including major and trace element geochemistry as well as textural and morphological features from scanning electron microscopy-backscatter electron imaging. The purpose is to provide a Holocene reference section for further tephrostratigraphic studies of the volcano as well as to provide information on eruption frequency. The lake cores suggest that Aluto has had a variable eruption rate, with three eruption clusters in the Holocene at similar to 3, 6.5, and 11 ka, with small Vulcanian-to sub-Plinian eruptions separated by larger, Plinian eruptions. We infer that the smaller tephras are likely the product of pumice cone- and dome-forming eruptions. In addition, modern wind data suggest that the likely direction of an ash cloud from Aluto is to the west and south west, which is toward population centers and is in agreement with thickness data from the cores. We conclude that current records underestimate the volcano's eruptive history and that hazard assessments should be updated accordingly. Plain Language Summary In this study we explore the history of a populated volcano in central Ethiopia called Aluto. The volcano is close to several large towns and home to an expanding geothermal power plant. Aluto has not erupted in the last few hundred years, and so there are no eye witness accounts of volcanic activity. In lieu of this, we use volcanic material deposited in the surrounding environment during an eruption as a record of the volcano's activity. In this study, we examine the volcanic material deposited in two lakes using lake cores drilled similar to 12 and 27 km from the volcano that record the eruptive history from 2,000 to 12,000years ago. These cores record 24 volcanic eruptions; which indicates an eruption every similar to 250 years. We use features of the volcanic ash particles to match up eruptions in the cores and to establish when the eruptions occurred. We find that the volcano has had three periods of increased activity, each lasting around 1,000 years. As such, we can infer that the volcano has erupted frequently over the last 10,000 years and hazard assessments of the volcano should be updated accordingly.					; Tomlinson, Emma/A-9350-2011; Fontijn, Karen/A-2720-2012	Rust, Alison/0000-0001-5095-7749; Tomlinson, Emma/0000-0002-0646-6640; Fontijn, Karen/0000-0001-7218-4513													1525-2027					SEP	2018	19	9					3164	3188		10.1029/2018GC007686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018GC007686													WOS:000448475100018

Phreatic explosions during basaltic fissure eruptions: Kings Bowl lava field, Snake River Plain, USA	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Physical and compositional measurements are made at the similar to 7 km-long (similar to 2200 years B.P.) Kings Bowl basaltic fissure system and surrounding lava field in order to further understand the interaction of fissure-fed lavas with phreatic explosive events. These assessments are intended to elucidate the cause and potential for hazards associated with phreatic phases that occur during basaltic fissure eruptions. In the present paper we focus on a general understanding of the geological history of the site. We utilize geospatial analysis of lava surfaces, litho logic and geochemical signatures of lava flows and explosively ejected blocks, and surveys via ground observation and remote sensing. Lithologic and geochemical signatures readily distinguish between Kings Bowl and underlying pre-Kings Bowl lava flows, both of which comprise phreatic ejecta from the Kings Bowl fissure. These basalt types, as well as neighboring lava flows from the contemporaneous Wapi lava field and the older Inferno Chasm vent and outflow channel, fall compositionally within the framework of eastern Snake River Plain olivine tholeiites. Total volume of lava in the Kings Bowl field is estimated to be similar to 0.0125 km(3), compared to a previous estimate of 0.005 km(3). The main (central) lava lake lost a total of similar to 0.0018 km(3) of magma by either drain-back into the fissure system or breakout flows from breached levees, Phreatic explosions along the Kings Bowl fissure system occurred after magma supply was cut off, leading to fissure evacuation, and were triggered by magma withdrawal. The fissure system produced multiple phreatic explosions and the main pit is accompanied by others that occur as subordinate pits and linear blast corridors along the fissure. The drop in magma supply and the concomitant influx of groundwater were necessary processes that led to the formation of Kings Bowl and other pits along the fissure. A conceptual model is presented that has relevance to the broader range of low-volume, monogenetic basaltic fissure eruptions on Earth, the Moon and other planetary bodies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The Snow and Ice Mass Balance Apparatus (SIMBA) is used to determine snow and ice temperatures in Arctic, Antarctic, ice-covered seas, and boreal lakes. Snow depth and ice thickness are derived from SIMBA temperature regimes (SIMBA_ET and SIMBA_HT). In warm conditions, SIMBA_ET temperature-based ice thickness may have errors due to the isothermal vertical profile. SIMBA_HT provides a visible ice-bottom interface for manual quantification. We propose an unmanned approach, combining neural networks, wavelet analysis, and Kalman filtering (NWK), to mathematically establish NWK and retrieve ice bottoms from various SIMBA_HT datasets. In the Arctic, NWK-derived total thickness showed a bias range of -5.64 cm to 4.01 cm and a correlation coefficient of 95%-99%. For Baltic Sea ice, values ranged from 1.31 cm to 2.41 cm (88%-98% correlation), and for boreal lake ice, -0.7 cm to 2.6 cm (75%-83% correlation). During ice growth, thermal equilibrium, and melting, the bias varied from -3.93 cm to 2.37 cm, -1.92 cm to 0.04 cm, and -4.90 cm to 3.96 cm, with correlation coefficients of 76%-99%. These results demonstrate NWK's robustness in retrieving ice bottom evolution in different water environments.					; cheng, Yubing/GYR-3104-2022	, Ying/0000-0002-8315-6363; Cheng, Yubing/0000-0002-1341-5913; 													1753-8947	1753-8955				DEC 31	2023	16	1					3085	3104		10.1080/17538947.2023.2242326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2023.2242326													WOS:001046522100001

The relationship between geographic distribution of sites of different periods under subsistence existence of ancient civilizations, climate and environmental change was investigated. The results revealed numerous archaeological sites of the Neolithic Age (10.0-3.6 ka BP). The sites were mainly located in the northern part of the Poyang Lake Basin, a hilly and mountainous area with many river terraces suitable for the development of human civilization. The number of archaeological sites rapidly increased during the Shang and Zhou dynasties (3.6-2.8 ka BP) and spread widely on the floodplains of the middle and lower reaches of Ganjiang River and onto the west, south, and southeast beach areas of the Poyang Lake. Holocene records of climate change suggested that it was possible that climate fluctuations had a great impact on human evolution in the study area. Before 3.6 ka BP, westward and northward expansion of Neolithic cultures in the Poyang Lake watershed occurred under the background of climate amelioration (becoming warmer and wetter). The ancient people lived in the hilly areas with high elevation. The simple mode of a fishing and gathering economy was mostly suited to this area in the early Neolithic Age. The scope of human activities was expanded and cultural diversity developed in the late Neolithic Age. However, with population growth and increasing survival pressure in a dry-cold climatic stage after 3.6 ka BP, this simple living mode had to be abandoned, and various forms of economy, the majority being agriculture, were developed on flood plains of the lower reaches of numerous rivers around Poyang Lake. This promoted flourishing of the Bronze culture of South China.

The controls, however, on precipitation delta O-18 values can be decoupled from precipitation amount at a given site and, thereby, limit local moisture condition reconstructions. Here we use a principal components analysis to assess the coherence of speleothem and lake core Holocene delta O-18 records in tropical and subtropical South America to evaluate the extent to which delta O-18 variability reflects changes in SAMS intensity at different sites across the region. The main mode of variability across Holocene delta O-18 records (PC1) closely tracks austral summertime insolation, consistent with existing work. Sites towards the periphery of the continent are heavily weighted on PC1, whereas interior sites as not. Further delta O-18 variability at interior sites bear little similarity to each other and implicate controls, beyond regional monsoon intensity, on these delta O-18 records. Further, we develop speleothem Sr-87/Sr-86 records spanning the Holocene from Tamboril Cave (Brazilian Highlands), Paraiso Cave (eastern Amazon Basin), Jaragua Cave (Mato Grosso do Sul Plateau), and Botuvera Cave (Atlantic coastal plain) to investigate coupling between reconstructed monsoon variability (reflected by PC1) and local moisture conditions (interpreted from Sr-87/Sr-86 records). We interpret speleothem Sr-87/Sr-86 variability as a proxy of local moisture conditions, reflecting the degree of water-rock interaction with the cave host rock as driven by variations in water residence time. Speleothem Sr-87/Sr-86 records from all the sites, except Botuvera cave, do not co-vary with PC1, suggesting that local moisture conditions do not necessarily follow variations in regional monsoon intensity at these interior sites. These speleothem Sr-87/Sr-86 records generally suggest dry mid-Holocene conditions relative to the early- and late-Holocene, consistent with interpretations of other paleo-moisture records in the region, but timing of wet-dry transitions varies between sites. These results highlight that controls, in addition to SAMS variability, might influence delta O-18 variability. Further, our results suggest spatially variable local moisture conditions at interior sites that do not uniformly respond to regional monsoon intensity, and stress the need for delta O-18-independent reconstructions of moisture conditions.

J	GERKING, SD				GERKING, SD			STABILITY OF A STREAM FISH POPULATION	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The study of fish populations in streams requires that definite information be known about the movement of fish, since the latter is not confined as it is in lakes or ponds. If fish move long distances, long distances in streams will have to be studied in order to include a "natural" population; if fish do not move very much the technical problems are simplified greatly. Fish of 9 spp. in a small creek in s. Indiana were caught by the electric fish shocker and marked by fin-clipping so that fish from adjoining sections could be identified. The area was subdivided into 5 sections. The whole area was 0.25 mile long, was about 30 ft. wide and had a max. depth of 3 ft. A period of 42 days elapsed between the time the fish were marked and the time some of them were recaptured. It was discovered that 75% of all individuals of the 9 spp. marked were found in their original location. Two weeks later a spot check showed 70% living in the same place where they were 1st marked. Longear sunfish, rock bass, and green sunfish definitely seemed to have "homes" during the summer, but none of the spp. strayed great distances. Small longear sunfish displayed the same tendency to remain "home" as large longears. The evidence that these fish do have homes is strengthened by the fact that a flash flood occurred between the time of marking and the time of recapture which subjected the population to a natural physical stress. The movement which did take place was generally upstream.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1950	14	2					193	202		10.2307/3796332	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3796332													WOS:A1950YB64900017

Risk assessment of the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coastal areas of Thailand affected by the 2004 tsunami	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The total concentrations of twelve, likely carcinogenic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (i.e., phenanthrene (Phe), anthracene (An), fluoranthene (Fluo), pyrene (Pyr), benz[a]anthracene (B[a]A), chrysene (Chry), benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F), benzo[k]fluoranthene (B[k]F), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (Ind), dibenz[a,h]anthracene (D[a,h]A), and benzolg,h,i]perylene (B[g,h]P) in backwash deposits of the 2004 Khao Lak tsunami were carefully investigated and compared with the concentrations of world marine sediments (WMS). In general, El2PAHs in this study (i.e., 69.43 70.67 ng g(-1)) were considerably lower than those values observed in marine sediments from Boston (54,253 ng g(-1)), coastal sediments from Barcelona Harbour (15,069 ng g-1), and riverine sediment from Guangzhou Channel (12,525 ng g(-1)), but were greater than values from coastal sediments in Rosas Bay (12 ng g(-1)), Santa Ponsa Bay (26 ng g-1) and Le Planier (34 ng g-1). The total toxic benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (TEe") values calculated for Khao Lak coastal sediments (KCS), Khao Lak terrestrial soils (KTS), and Songkhla Lake sediments (SLS) were 10.3 12.2 ng g-1, 16.0 47.7 ng g-1, and 5.67 5.39 ng g-1, respectively. Concentrations of PAHs at all study sites resulted in risk levels that fell into the "acceptable" range of the US EPA model and were much lower than those of other WMS. The cancer risk levels of PAH content in KCS ranged from 7.44 x 10(-8) to 2.90 x 10(-7), with an average of 1.64 x 10(-7) 8.01 x 10(-8); this value is 119 times lower than that of WMS. In addition, soil cleanup target levels (SCTLs) for both non-carcinogens (i.e., Phe, An, Fluo and Pyr) and carcinogens (i.e., B[a]A, Chry, B[b]F, B[k1F, B[a]P, Ind, D[a,h]A and B[g,h,i1P) in the KTS samples were estimated for all target groups, with an average value of 115,902 197,229 ng g-1.

STUDY OF LAKE BELE AND LAKE ITKUL LANDSCAPES AS RECREATIONAL LOAD ESTIMATION	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												In the article the results of landscape researches on the territory of two clusters of reserve "Khakass" are considered (Lake Bele and Lake Itkul). The uniqueness and originality of the Shira steppe landscapes are designated. This article contains a complex of physical and geographical characteristics of the territory, which includes the protected areas studies: the geological structure, the history of the natural conditions of the northern part of Minusinsk deflection and lake hollows, geomorphology of the area, the climatic conditions of landscape formation, features of soil cover and vegetation are described. The morphological structure of landscapes, types of areas and kinds of natural boundaries are characterized, their mapping is made. In the eastern part of Lake Bele four types of areas including 17 kinds of natural boundaries are allocated. In Lake Itkul vicinities four types of areas including 23 kinds of natural boundaries are defined. The characteristic signs and features of landscapes of both clusters, and also similarity and distinction in landscape structure of clusters "Lake Bele" and "Lake Itkul" are allocated. The comparative study of the recreationally-disturbed landscapes and protected areas is conducted. The main role of steepness and exposition of slopes, humidifying mode in space differentiation of the investigated steppe landscapes is defined. The generalised results of researches of landscapes are given; general recommendations on preservation of the reserved territories in the conditions of the increasing recreational load in the adjoining territories are made. Most often the recreational load is unapproved dumps of household garbage on the territories adjoining to the reserved clusters, infringement of integrity of the vegetative cover and pauperisation of the floristic variety, distribution of commensal kinds of animals, structural change of the soil profile on spontaneously arisen beaches. The dynamics of recreational loads for the non-reserved south-eastern coast of Lake Bele during 2006-2011 is shown. In 2009 the recreational load had the maximum indicators and since then tendencies to its decrease are observed. The paper substantiates the need to maintain the reserve status of the coastal and aquatic areas of Lakes Itkul and Bele. There is also a need to create a geographically and economically organized recreational area on the shores of lakes in order to reduce the harm caused to the surrounding nature reserve by unorganized seasonal summer tent parking and spontaneously arising beaches. The authors recommend using methods of landscape planning and ecological monitoring to create organized recreational areas.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				MAR	2012		356					183	+																WOS:000421495200038

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Silicon stable isotope ratios (expressed as delta Si-30) in biogenic silica have been widely used as a proxy for past and present biogeochemical cycling in both marine and lacustrine settings, in particular for nutrient utilization reconstructions. Yet an analysis of publication trends suggests a significant decline in the application of delta Si-30 to Quaternary science questions in the last five years. At the same time as delta Si-30 proxy applications have decreased, we are learning more about its complexities: an expanding body of work is highlighting biases, caveats or complications involved in the application of delta Si-30 -based approaches to the sediment record. These include the demonstration of species-specific silicon isotope fractionation factors (i.e. 'vital effects') or the potential for Fe or other trace metals to influence silicon isotope fractionation. Others have inferred the potential of biogenic silica dissolution to alter an initial delta Si-30 value, or questioned the preservation of the initial delta 30 Si through early diagenetic processes more generally. Another challenge receiving more attention is centered around deconvolving a delta Si-30 -value into a signal reflecting biological productivity and a signal reflecting changes in the delta 30 Si of dissolved silicon driven by whole-system and/or circulation changes. Finally, a number of studies focus on analytical difficulties, especially during sample preparation related to achieving and demonstrating a contaminant free biogenic silica. These challenges lead us to posit that the Quaternary science community is moving away from silicon isotope proxies because they are losing confidence in their reliability and usefulness. Here, focusing on the diatoms - the dominant biosilicifiers in both lakes and the ocean - we synthesize progress in understanding nuances and caveats of delta Si-30 -based proxies in order to answer whether the fall-off in delta 30 Si-based Quaternary research is warranted. We suggest that with some simple steps that can be readily implemented, and with the closing of key knowledge gaps, there is no reason to believe silicon isotopes do not have a promising future in the Quaternary sciences.					; Frings, Patrick/B-8411-2018	Sutton, Jill/0000-0003-3664-5049; Frings, Patrick/0000-0002-1012-0642; Panizzo, Virginia/0000-0002-3411-9945													0277-3791	1873-457X				NOV 15	2024	344								108966	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108966	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108966		SEP 2024											WOS:001317806200001

Within the Early Triassic Baikouquan Formation in the Mahu Sag of the Junggar Basin, we identified subaerial unconformities (SU), namely SU1 and SU2. SU1 is characterized by regional, irregular valleys, whereas SU2 displays extensive lateral extent with comparatively lower relief. These distinctions stem from detailed analyses involving cores, well data, seismic profiles, and spatial distributions, enriching our understanding of SUs in the Junggar Basin. Key findings from our study include: (1) SU occurrences within the Baikouquan Formation span the falling -stage systems tract (FSST) and expanding system tract (EST), corresponding to relative lake level changes. SU1 emerges during descending lake levels, whereas SU2 develops during rising levels. (2) The extensive uplift of the Junggar Basin 's perimeter, driven by the late Hercynian movement, heightened topographic gradient shapes a steeper lake shoreline profile, fostering SU development. Arid paleoclimatic conditions during the Permian -Triassic interval accelerate SU formation in the FSST. (3) SU typically comprises regional compound scour surfaces (RCS) and river intermittent exposure surfaces (IES). Continuous winnowing at RCS led to relatively high primary porosities, IES can develop better secondary porosity with superposed freshwater leaching. The investigation into the subaerial unconformity in the study area holds broader implications for comprehending depositional processes, reservoir distribution, and petroleum prospects, both locally and within a global lake basin context.																			2949-8929	2949-8910				JUN	2024	237								212838	10.1016/j.geoen.2024.212838	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoen.2024.212838		APR 2024											WOS:001233911400001

Contemporary phenotypic divergence of an introduced predatory freshwater fish, the northern pike (Esox lucius)	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Background: Northern pike (Esox lucius) were introduced to southcentral Alaska in the 1950s and have subsequently colonized multiple lakes and rivers. These populations serve as an opportunistic natural experiment to understand the rate and fonn of phenotypic divergence. Question: How have pike diverged in their native and introduced range and how quickly? Do morphological differences correlate with diet-mediated growth or characteristic lake or river habitat attributes? Hypotheses: Given the known time since colonization, populations that have been separated for longer are likely to have diverged further from their source population than populations that have been separated for less time. Morphology will be at least in part shaped by growth and major (riverine vs. lake) habitat differences. Analytical methods: We studied phenotypic divergence among nine putative populations of northern pike with a principal component analysis of individual measurements of body dimensions as well as counts of pigmentation (i.e. spotting pattern). Size-at-age was used as a proxy for growth rate and tested for associations with morphology. Evolutionary rates (haldanes) for the phenotypic divergence of each population from the putative source population were calculated and compared to a data set of similar to 2700 rates from different taxa to put the observed divergence into context. Results: Morphological differences were detected between native and invasive groups. Invasive populations were significantly deeper bodied and had shorter heads than native populations. Body shape variation could only partially be explained by age, length, and weight (growth proxy), with values of 27% and 24% for PCI and PCII, respectively. Habitat type (river vs. lake) was significantly associated with body shape in native populations, but data limitations preclude a comparison among invasive populations. The detected phenotypic divergence estimates fall near the median of previous evolutionary rate estimates.

Geographical regularities of the permafrost-thermal regime of soils in Transbaikalia	INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL CONFERENCE IN COMMEMORATION OF CORR. MEM., RAS, A.N. ANTIPOV GEOGRAPHICAL FOUNDATIONS AND ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES OF THE REGIONAL POLICY OF NATURE MANAGEMENT	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				International Scientific and Practical Conference on Geographical Foundations and Ecological Principles of the Regional Policy of Nature Management	SEP 23-27, 2019	Irkutsk, RUSSIA					We have estimated the freezing-thermal regime of Transbaikalia soils qualitatively and quantitatively. Perennial permafrost almost throughout the region makes such an estimation of the thermal condition of the soils rather topical in terms of the region's climatic resource. We have attempted to determine and classify thermo-freezing regime of the soils for entire Transbaikalia and show the general geographical characteristics of the thermal regime of winterly Transbaikalia. The studies of the 3.2-m thick soil layer were based on the perennial data of 49 meteorological stations. For the analysis of the thermo-freezing regime of the soils, we used the mean monthly values of the smallest temperature at the standard depth of the soil profile. The entire array of the temperature data was divided into five grades of different widths and represented in the form of vertical profiles. The steps of the scale reflect the progressing increase in winter cooling of the entire soil layer. The weakest soil cooling is observed for the eastern shore of Lake Baikal: these are the moderately cold conditions. In the southern closure of the Barguzin depression, the state of the soil thickness transits smoothly from moderately cold to cold conditions. Very cold soil conditions are propagating from southeast to northwest in the perennial permafrost zone. Severe conditions of soil are present in local regions of the southern part of the territory and its northern part where the sandy-loam soil with pebble admixture allows perennial permafrost to lie at small depths. Extreme severe conditions mainly occupy the races of total perennial permafrost.

The study focused on developing a data base and methodology for projecting fishable surpluses, in cooperation with a chub technical committee sponsored by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The Technical Committee was formed in 1974 because of depletion of bloaters and other deepwater ciscoes or chubs, as they are known by Greak Lakes fishermen. Subsequently the Technical Committee recommended a lakewide ban on chub fishing that was fully enacted by the states of Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 1976. With the Committee''s help, commercial fishery statistics and stock assessment data were obtained from state and federal research files and used with various indirect analytical techniques to estimate relevant population parameters. The lakewide fishable stock in fall 1973, before the fishery was affected by several incomplete closures and then by the lakewide ban, was estimated as 48 to 73 million bloaters weighing 20 to 29 million lbs. Exploitation of the estimated stock varied considerably among 11 statistical districts in the several jurisdictions. Yield to the fishery exceeded production by the stock in some districts. Theoretical yields of bloaters totaling 3.59 to 3.72 million lbs. were projected for 1979 from all waters combined. These projected yields were intended as guidelines for experimental quotas that the states might establish, because the population had stabilized and the potential for recruitment had improved in most areas.

J	AMUNDSON, DC; WRIGHT, HE				AMUNDSON, DC; WRIGHT, HE			FOREST CHANGES IN MINNESOTA AT THE END OF THE PLEISTOCENE	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The Late-Wisconsin spruce forest that characterized most of Minnesota [USA] and the rest of the Middle West [USA] differed from the modern Boreal Forest of Canada not only in the absence of pine but also in the apparent admixture of black ash, oak and elm and in the presence of openings in which Artemisia was abundant. Close-interval pollen analyses at 3 sites in Minnesota show some of the details in the transformation of this spruce forest to pine or hardwood forests. At Kirchner Marsh in southeastern Minnespta, the spruce forest was replaced abruptly about 10,000 yr ago by birch, alder and temperate hardwoods before pine (jack pine ?) entered the region for a short period. At Wolf Creek in central Minnespta, pine arrived from the east virtually at the moment when spruce declined. At Lake of the Clouds in northeastern Minnesota, spruce forest had succeeded tundra about 10,000 yr ago, but simultaneously pine (jack pine ?) and the temperate hardwoods (especially elm) appeared in quantity. The spruce and hardwood components then declined about 9300 yr ago as pine (red pine?) increased to dominance during the next 400 yr. Charcoal counts for the 3 sites provide no support for the hypothesis that increased fire incidence explains the forest transformation from spruce to pine. Climatic change must instead be the primary cause. The apparent openness of the spruce forest can be attributed to the continued presence of the wasting ice sheet just to the north, which favored a dry and windy climate, perhaps with relatively mild winters. As the ice sheet withdrew, its influence decreased. Differential rates of tree immigration as well as progressive leaching of upland soils were possibly additional factors effecting changes in forest composition.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1979	49	1					1	16		10.2307/1942569	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942569													WOS:A1979GZ39500001

Feeding ecology and epizootological value of the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) during the secondary expansion of the Baikal region	SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT												Aim. To research the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo L., 1758) ecology during the secondary expansion of the Baikal region. Material and Methods. The material for studying cormorant nutrition was 28 stomachs of harvested birds, visual observations of feeding cormorants using optical equipment, as well as regurgitated burps of nutrition obtained by a bloodless method when being fed to chicks. 21 examples of cormorants were the subjects of the parasitological research. Results. The number of the species has been growing since the beginning of the XXI century and, starting from 2020/21, is likely to stabilize, remaining at a high level. This indicates the gradual integration of the species into the Baikal Lake ecosystem. The main food item of Cormorants are the non-commercial fish, Sleeper (Percottus glehni Dyb.), Perch (Perca floviatilis L.) and Roach (Rutilus rutilus L.). Parasitological studies have revealed 8 species of helminths from three classes with varying degrees of invasion. Only one of them, Contracaecum osculatum baicalensis (Mosgovoy et Ryjikov, 1950), is endemic and potentially dangerous to human health (its infection rate can reach 80%). Conclusion. The Great Cormorant is an obligate, but not a specialized ichthyophage, focused on the prevailing fish species. Great Cormorants as hosts of ticks, helminths and other ecto- and endoparasites are potentially sources of threat to the occurrence and spread, primarily, of ornithoses and helminthiasis in the Baikal region and possibly of other diseases carried from their wintering places.					; Yelayev, Erdeni/KLY-2027-2024; Elaev (Yelayev), Erdeni (Erdeni)/KLY-2027-2024	Badmaeva, Evgeniya/0000-0002-9940-1191; Elaev (Yelayev), Erdeni (Erdeni)/0000-0002-3961-0055													1992-1098	2413-0958					2021	16	4					47	55		10.18470/1992-1098-2021-4-47-55	http://dx.doi.org/10.18470/1992-1098-2021-4-47-55													WOS:000751641800005
J	Gruberts, D; Paidere, J				Gruberts, Davis; Paidere, Jana			Lagrangian drift experiment on the Middle Daugava River (Latvia) during the filling phase of the spring floods	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The 2nd real-time Lagrangian drift experiment within the river-floodplain system of the Middle Daugava (South-East Latvia) was conducted on April 8, 2010, by applying a drifting sampling platform (a maritime life-raft) and a Lagrangian sampling strategy. Repeated measurements of the water temperature, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen concentration and the chlorophyll-a concentration were performed at a depth of 0.5 m with a 30 min frequency. In addition, a subsurface sampling of the zooplankton was performed hourly by applying standard methods. Repeated measurements of the Secchi depth, the drift speed and the river depth were also performed in-situ. The drift was started at 08:00, 10 km upstream from Daugavpils and finished at 19:00, 62 km further downstream. During the drift, 23 series of in-situ measurements were performed and 11 zooplankton samples were collected. The Spearman's rank correlation and the Multivariate and Partial Mann-Kendall tests were applied to the selected variables to identify statistically significant downstream trends as well as their correlation with the drift speed and river depth. Significant downstream trends were observed for the drift speed, the Secchi depth, turbidity, temperature, pH, conductivity and the dissolved oxygen. Most trends were different from those recorded during the drainage phase of floods (Gruberts et al. 2012). A possible impact of the drift speed on the chlorophyll-a concentration was detected. Downstream trends of other physical, chemical and biological parameters were independent from in-channel hydrological conditions. At 28.5 km downstream from Krauja, an abrupt shift in the Secchi depth indicated lateral interaction between the main channel and the adjacent floodplain area, which resulted in enrichment of the water column with suspended material and rotifers like Synchaeta sp. and Filinia longiseta.					; Paidere, Jana/LLK-6302-2024	Paidere, Jana/0000-0003-0036-5889; 													1863-9135					JUN	2014	184	3			SI		211	230		10.1127/1863-9135/2014/0541	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2014/0541													WOS:000339460400005

Research on the distribution patterns and development trends of glacier hazards is essential for improving the understanding of glacier hazards and mitigating disaster risks in high mountains. This study systematically analyses the types, spatial, and temporal variations of glacier hazards attributed to the impacts of climate change and glacier retreat in the Tianshan, Pamir, Karakoram and Kunlun Mountain ranges in Xinjiang between 1950 and 2020. Climatic conditions and glacier surveys (including glacier fronts and mass balance measurements) are used as drivers to analyse spatial and temporal patterns of glacier hazards. The results indicate that 330 glacial hazards occurred in Xinjiang, the majority of which were in the Tianshan and Karakoram regions. Glacial hazard numbers decelerated, while temperature rise accelerated over the past seven decades. From 1950 to 2000, glacier hazards increased at an average rate of 0.74 each year, whereas, after 2000, they decreased at an average rate of 0.82 per year. Glacier surges have increased since 1990 in the Pamir- Karakoram Mountains and the Kunlun Mountains. Glacier surges in the Pamir-Karakoram Mountains exhibited the highest activity from 1990 to 1999 and 2000 to 2009. The annual occurrence of glacier outburst floods has decreased since the early 2000s, while the flood peak discharges of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) has intensified in Tianshan. Glacier debris flows in the Pamir and Tianshan mountain regions increased after 2010, frequently occurring on the Tianshan Highway and the China-Pakistan Karakoram Highway during the summer months. Glacier debris flows originated above 4,500m above sea level (a.s.l.), but most hazards occurred between 2000 and 3,000m a.s.l. In Xinjiang, glacier debris flows pose the greatest threat in the central and high mountain regions and require close attention. Temperature is the primary influencing factor driving trend changes and spatiotemporal patterns of glacial hazards. The hazard occurrence rates are uncorrelated with rainfall and glacier dynamics. Therefore, in adapting to climate change, it is crucial to consider the spatiotemporal variation of glacial hazards and their influencing factors in high mountain regions to provide a scientific basis for exploring the predictability, prevention, and mitigation of disasters.					; wang, meixia/AAV-3785-2021	Shangguan, Donghui/0000-0001-9975-0722; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				MAR 1	2025	351								109183	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109183		MAR 2025											WOS:001419773600001

Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometric determination of copper, zinc, lead and chromium species after preconcentration on graphene oxide chemically modified with mercapto-groups	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY												A novel derivative of graphene oxide, referred to as GO-S, was used as an effective adsorbent for the preconcentration of heavy metal ions from water samples and chromium for chemical speciation prior to energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometric (EDXRF) determination. Under optimal conditions GO-S quantitatively adsorbs Cr(iii), Cu(ii) Zn(ii) and Pb(ii) ions from aqueous samples. The determined adsorption capacity of GO-S for Cr(iii), Cu(ii), Zn(ii) and Pb(ii) ions is 191.5, 410.7, 265.6, and 487.3 mg g(-1), respectively. The experimental data are fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm model which indicates that the adsorption has a chemical character. The utility of GO-S as a solid adsorbent was confirmed by developing a procedure based on a combination of dispersive micro-solid phase extraction (DMSPE) with EDXRF. Such a strategy allows direct determination of metal ions preconcentrated on the GO-S surface and consequently the elution step with all its drawbacks such as time, efficiency and contamination risk can be omitted. The linear response for the method was obtained in the 1-200 ng mL(-1) range for each of the examined metal ions. The uncertainty of the proposed procedure did not exceed 3.8%. The detection limits are found to be in the 0.06-0.10 ng mL(-1) range and they are much lower than the upper concentration limits for Cr(iii), Cu(ii), Zn(ii) and Pb(ii) in drinking water established by the World Health Organization. This method offers impressive enrichment factors ranging between 520 and 3120 for 50 mL-in-volume samples and it is resistant to high concentration of a large number of anions and alkali and alkaline earth cations. The application of the described procedure to the determination of Cr(iii), Cu(ii), Zn(ii) and Pb(ii) ions in lake, river, spring, mineral and sea waters confirms the usefulness of GO-S as a solid adsorbent. Moreover, the preconcentration of chromium for chemical speciation and EDXRF determination using GO-S is also possible due to the fact that the carrier selectively retains Cr(iii) on its surface while Cr(vi) ions remain in the aqueous sample. The Cr(vi) concentration is calculated as the difference between the total chromium content (after reduction of Cr(vi) to Cr(iii)) and the Cr(iii) content.

J	Robinson, ZP; Fairchild, IJ; Spiro, B				Robinson, Zoe P.; Fairchild, Ian J.; Spiro, Baruch			The sulphur isotope and hydrochemical characteristics of Skeioararsandur, Iceland: identification of solute sources and implications for weathering processes	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					General Assembly of the European-Geosciences-Union	APR 13-18, 2008	Vienna, AUSTRIA	European Geosci Union				The hydrochemistry of sulphur in the active outwash plain of Skeioararsandur, SE Iceland shows considerable variety reflecting differences in sources and processes, and is investigated in this article using delta S-34 values of dissolved sulphate and igneous sulphide minerals, delta O-18(-H2O), and ionic concentrations in waters. Seawater-derived sulphate is a notable component only in the lower sandur (delta S-34(-SO4) = +6-8 parts per thousand VCDT). delta S-34(-SO4) in the Skeioara glacial melt river range from +3.4 to +8.8 parts per thousand delta S-34. The higher values occur during a flood event and reflect geothermal sulphate contributions from the Grimsvotn caldera. 'Kettle-hole lakes' formed since the November 1996 jokulhlaup form important ecological niches and show evidence of coupled sulphide oxidation and carbonate and possibly silicate dissolution and have the lowest delta S-34(-SO4) values (average -0.8 parts per thousand) attributed to higher proportions of sulphide oxidation-derived SO42- and/or bacterially mediated sulphide oxidation. The hydrochemistry of eastern sandur groundwater is influenced by a hydrothermal source of reduced sulphur from the Grimsvotn caldera or a localized area of geothermal springs, and contrasts with the hydrochemistry of the majority of groundwaters and the Sula and Gigjukvisl rivers in western and central Skeioararsandur. These have lower [Ca2+ + mg(2+)], [Na+ + K+] and SO42- concentrations and delta S-34 values consistent with sulphate derived from the oxidation of igneous sulphides. In comparison to catchments dominated by atmospherically transported sulphate, catchments such as this where the sulphur system is dominated by internal sources (rock-derived and geothermal) will not be sensitive to the temporal decreasing trends in contributions from long-range airborne sulphate resulting from reductions of sulphur emissions in North America and Europe.

The weevil reduces the viability of milfoil by mining plant stems. We determined the influence of temperature on the developmental rates of the weevil and damage to Eurasian watermilfoil stems. Single E. lecontei eggs were laid on rooted plants in individual tubes filled with water and 16 such tubes were randomly assigned to each of eight environmental chambers set at constant temperatures of 15, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 31 degrees C with a 16-h daylength. Weevils and plants were monitored daily and development times were recorded for the egg, larval, and pupal stages. Length of watermilfoil stem damaged (cm) was estimated at 21, 25, and 29 degrees C. Developmental rate was linearly related to temperature, up to 29 degrees C; the developmental maximum appeared to be between 29 and 31 degrees C. Average egg hatch occurred in 12.0 days at 15 degrees C and in 4.2 days at 31 degrees C. Average larval development time took 20 days at 15 degrees C and 6.1 days at 31 degrees C. Complete egg to adult development ranged from 16.6 days at 29 degrees C to 61.7 days at 15 degrees C. The lower developmental threshold was between 8.2 and 10.5 degrees C, and egg to adult development required 309 +/- 27.6 (2 SE) degree-days above 9.8 degrees C. Daily stem damage increased with temperature but total damage (by larvae) was equal across temperatures and averaged 15.1 +/- 1.9 cm. Field temperature data indicated that up to five generations could be completed in a typical summer in Minnesota lakes. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

J	Hsu, YW; Shih, SS				Hsu, Yao-Wen; Shih, Shang-Shu			High-accuracy and low-disturbance approach for identifying surface water and groundwater interactions in wetlands	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Comprehending the hydrological conditions in wetlands is a critical aspect of successfully enhancing wetland conservation. The interaction between wetland surface water and groundwater is a complex process, requiring detailed onsite hydrological and soil surveys, laboratory experiments, and modeling to clarify this relationship. However, conventional investigation methods often cause significant disruptions and thus may affect the natural environment and compromise data reliability. In this study, a high-accuracy and low-environmental-disturbance (LED) approach was proposed involving modified falling head permeability and modified seepage meter tests to elucidate the groundwater characteristics in an ecological reserve. A water balance (WB) calculation method was employed to examine the performance of the proposed LED approach. The results revealed that the LED performed better than conventional methods in hydraulic conductivity and seepage velocity exploration, thereby improving the accuracy of quantifying groundwater flow. Moreover, the experimental findings and ecohydrological observations were used to assess the groundwater flow regime, and the data were consistent with the field survey results. The contradiction between conducting research and protecting ecological reserves can pose difficulties in the sustainable and effective management of wetlands. The LED approach can be applied broadly, especially in areas where significant disturbance should be avoided. The water budget model can thus be developed to help deduce the interaction between groundwater and surface water. We suggest that these innovative methods are effective tools and can assist both scientists and authorities in formulating corresponding habitat management strategies.

However, understanding the history of dust storms on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) remains challenging due to the lack of suitable geological archives. Lakes in dust-influenced regions act as dust repositories, offering the opportunity to trace the history of dust emissions and eolian activity. Here we present a synthesis of eolian activity on the eastern TP covering the past 15,000 years. It is based on records of grain size and n-alkanes from a sediment core from Gahai lake, which we combined with published pollen and other records from the same core, to reconstruct variations in surface runoff and eolian activity in this region. Our results indicate a correlation between vegetation conditions and eolian activity during different periods. Increased eolian activity occurred during the transition from the last deglaciation to the early Holocene, due to suboptimal vegetation conditions. Between 7.5 and 3.5 cal ka BP (ka), higher moisture levels resulted in the dominance of arboreal vegetation, which suppressed eolian activity. However, after 3.5 ka a sustained intensification of eolian activity occurred in the Gahai area, which was linked to decreasing vegetation cover, reduced regional humidity, and growing human impacts, especially in the eastern plateau, in southern Gansu. In recent decades, human interventions have suppressed eolian activity. Additionally, a similar to 1435-year cyclicity in our record, and other regional records, suggests a link between increased eolian activity on the eastern TP and ice-rafting events in the North Atlantic. Generally, Holocene eolian dynamics were primarily influenced by the regional vegetation and climatic conditions which were controlled by the atmospheric circulation. However, in the late Holocene, climatic shifts and human influences had a synergistic effect which intensified the eolian activity, highlighting the important role of humans on recent dust dynamics in this region.					hou, xiaohuan/HJB-1484-2022; Chen, Shengqian/ABA-5944-2021; Cao, Xianyong/L-7168-2019; Hou, Juzhi/W-5655-2018														0921-8181	1872-6364				NOV	2024	242								104592	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2024.104592	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2024.104592		SEP 2024											WOS:001328782500001
J	Humayoun, SB; Bano, N; Hollibaugh, JT				Humayoun, SB; Bano, N; Hollibaugh, JT			Depth distribution of microbial diversity in Mono Lake, a meromictic soda lake in California	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												We analyzed the variation with depth in the composition of members of the domain Bacteria in samples from alkaline, hypersaline, and currently meromictic Mono Lake in California. DNA samples were collected from the mixolimnion (2 m), the base of the oxycline (17.5 m), the upper chemocline (23 m), and the monimolimnion (35 m). Composition was assessed by sequencing randomly selected cloned fragments of 16S rRNA genes retrieved from the DNA samples. Most of the 212 sequences retrieved from the samples fell into five major lineages of the domain Bacteria: alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria (6 and 10%, respectively), Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (19%), high-G+C-content gram-positive organisms (Actinobacteria; 25%), and low-G+C-content gram-positive organisms (Bacillus and Clostridium; 19%). Twelve percent were identified as chloroplasts. The remaining 9% represented beta- and delta-Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobiales, and candidate divisions. Mixolimnion and oxycline samples had low microbial diversity, with only 9 and 12 distinct phylotypes, respectively, whereas chemocline and monimolimnion samples were more diverse, containing 27 and 25 phylotypes, respectively. The compositions of microbial assemblages from the mixolimnion and oxycline were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.314 and 0.877), but they were significantly different from those of chemocline and monimolimnion assemblages (P < 0.001), and the compositions of chemocline and monimolimnion assemblages were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.006 and 0.124). The populations of sequences retrieved from the mixolimnion and oxycline samples were dominated by sequences related to high-G+C-content grampositive bacteria (49 and 63%, respectively) distributed in only three distinct phylotypes, while the population of sequences retrieved from the monimolimnion sample was dominated (52%) by sequences related to low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria distributed in 12 distinct phylotypes. Twelve and 28% of the sequences retrieved from the chemocline sample were also found in the mixolimnion and monimolimnion samples, respectively. None of the sequences retrieved from the monimolimnion sample were found in the mixolimnion or oxycline samples. Elevated diversity in anoxic bottom water samples relative to oxic surface water samples suggests a greater opportunity for niche differentiation in bottom versus surface waters of this lake.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				FEB	2003	69	2					1030	1042		10.1128/AEM.69.2.1030-1042.2003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.2.1030-1042.2003								12571026					WOS:000180927100039

EXPERIENCE IN COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE RADIOCARBON DATING RESULTS AND THE PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL STUDIES OF TWO VESSELS OF THE NETWORK POTTERY CULTURE FROM PESOCHNOYE 1	KRATKIE SOOBSHCHENIYA INSTITUTA ARKHEOLOGII												The article is devoted to the analysis of clay paste and burnt crust adhering to the surface of two vessels attributed to the "network" pottery culture (pottery with textile imprints) from the Pesochnoye 1 settlement on Lake Nero. The radiocarbon dating of these samples shows that on average the dates obtained are older than the radiocarbon dates of the samples from the occupation layer where the vessels were found by similar to 500-700 years. The age difference is probably caused by the fresh water reservoir effect related to presence of organic matter in the water and presence of organic matter from water in the composition of clay paste used to make the studied vessels. Sapropel from Lake Nero is the only natural material in the Pesochnoye 1 vicinities which contains organic matter of water origin comparable with the clay used for the vessels making. To determine similarities and differences in the elemental and mineral compositions by the SEM/EDS and the XRD analyses, ceramic samples from each vessel and a gyttja clay sample from the lake were examined. It was found that sapropel tempered with feld spar and quartz sand, sapropel and bone flour were mixed in the clay body. Radiocarbon dates that can be obtained for clay, absence of chemical elements that would demonstrate presence of unreduced organic matter, presence of illite clay imply that the firing temperature fell within similar to 400-800 degrees C.

To assess environmental impact on ancient Lake Ohrid we have taken short sediment cores from two contrasting site locations, comprising a site of urban pollution and an apparently pristine area. Recent impacts on water quality and ecology were assessed using sediment, geochemical, ostracode, and diatom data derived from analysis of two Pb-210-dated sediment cores spanning the period from 1918 to 2009. According to the index of geoaccumulation, sediments were often moderately contaminated with As. Fe and Ni concentrations often exceeded reported maximum limits above which harmful effects on sediment-dwelling organisms are expected. Productivity in the (pristine) south-eastern part of Lake Ohrid (Sveti Naum) is generally lower than in the north, probably due to the strong influence of spring discharge. Low ostracode and diatom concentrations, low abundance of the epilimnetic diatom Cyclotella ocellata, and low values of TOC and TIC indicate a lower productivity from the early 1920s to the late 1980s. Since the mid 1970s, increased relative abundance of C. ocellata and increasing diatom concentration indicate increasing productivity in the south-eastern part. Rising numbers of ostracode valves and higher TIC and TOC contents in both sediment cores indicate an increase in productivity during the late 1980s. A slight increase in productivity near Sveti Naum continued from the early 1990s until 2009, witnessed by rising TC, TIC, and TOC content and a generally high number of ostracode valves and ostracode diversity. The area near the City of Struga (site of urban pollution) is also characterized by rising TOC and TIC contents and, furthermore, by increasing Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn concentrations since the early 1990s. The recent reduction in the number of ostracode valves and ostracode diversity is probably caused by a higher heavy metal load into the lake. This suggests that living conditions for the endemic species in Lake Ohrid have become less favourable in the northern part of the lake, which might threaten the unique flora and fauna of Lake Ohrid.

Southwest Greenland ice-sheet retreat during the 8.2 ka cold event	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The century-long 8.2 ka cold event interrupted early Holocene boreal warmth and may have halted retreat of Greenland ice-sheet margins during the last deglaciation. Here, we synthesize new and existing glacial geological data to assess the behavior of the southwest Greenland ice sheet during the 8.2 ka cold event. In southwest Greenland near the town of Kangerlussuaq, existing and new Be-10 surface exposure ages demonstrate that deposition of the Keglen moraines ended at 8.0 +/- 0.1 ka (n = 10, 1 outlier), with prior studies arguing that these moraines represented an ice-margin stillstand in response to the 8.2 ka cold event. However, new Be-10 ages show that the southwest Greenland ice-sheet margin retreated from the Umivit moraines, which lie 5-10 km outboard of the Keglen moraines, at 8.2 +/- 0.2 ka (n = 11). Accordingly, we suggest that the southwest Greenland ice-sheet margin in the Kangerlussuaq region retreated 5-10 km during the 8.2 ka cold event. Farther south and inland from Nuuk, new Be-10 boulder-on-bedrock ages adjacent to the modern ice-sheet margin demonstrate that the ice-margin was retreating with no moraine deposition at 8.2 +/- 0.1 ka (n = 4, 1 outlier), with this retreat continuing up to at least similar to 7.5 ka according to an existing threshold lake record. Therefore, we propose that the southwest Greenland ice-sheet margin underwent continued retreat during the 8.2 ka cold event in response to elevated early Holocene boreal summer insolation that overwhelmed the impacts from century-scale cooling. Caution should be used in assuming climatic causation for moraine deposition based on temporal correlation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Resilience and regime change in a southern Rocky Mountain ecosystem during the past 17 000 years	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Paleoecological records indicate that subalpine forests in western North America have been resilient in response to multiple influences, including severe droughts, insect outbreaks, and widely varying fire regimes, over many millennia. One hypothesis for explaining this ecosystem resilience centers on the disruption of forest dynamics by frequent disturbance and climatic variability, and the resulting development of non-steady-state regimes dominated by early-successional conifers with broad climatic tolerances, such as lodgepole pine (Plaits contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex Wats.). To evaluate this hypothesis, we independently reconstructed the vegetation, fire, and effective-moisture histories of a small, forested watershed at 2890 in elevation in southeastern Wyoming, USA, using sedimentary pollen and charcoal counts in conjunction with sedimentary lake-level indicators. The data indicate that prominent vegetation shifts (from sagebrush steppe to spruce fir parkland at ca. 10.7 ka and spruce fir parkland to pine-dominated forest at ca. 8.5 ka ika stands for thousands of years before the present, defined as AD 1950]) coincided with changes in effective moisture. However, after lodgepole pine forests established at ca. 8.5 ka, similar hydroclimatic changes did not produce detectable vegetation responses. Fire history data show that other aspects of the ecosystem were responsive to changes in effective moisture at centennial timescales with prolonged fire-free episodes coinciding with periods of low effective moisture ca. 7.2-5.6 and 3.7-1.6 ka. Throughout our record, the ratio of ecosystem perturbation time (i.e., fire frequency and changes in effective moisture) to recovery time (assuming 200-600-year successional processes) falls within estimates of the ratio for non-steady state ecosystems. Frequent perturbations, therefore, may have prevented this ecosystem from reaching compositional equilibrium with the varied climatic conditions over the past 8.5 ka. Equilibrium states could have included more abundant spruce (Picea spp.) and fir (Abies spp.) than presently observed "based on.brief increases in pollen abundances of these taxa during prolonged dry, fire-free intervals. Our results show that, although current climate changes favor widespread disturbance in Rocky Mountain forests, the composition of these ecosystems could be highly resilient and recover through successional dynamics over the next few decades to centuries.

J	Yu, ZC; Walker, KN; Evenson, EB; Hajdas, I				Yu, Zicheng; Walker, Karina N.; Evenson, Edward B.; Hajdas, Irka			Lateglacial and early Holocene climate oscillations in the Matanuska Valley, south-central Alaska	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Here we present multi-proxy data from two cores taken from Hundred Mile Lake in the Matanuska Valley of south-central Alaska to investisiate the climate, vegetation and deglaciation history of the last 14,000 years. The chronology of the cores was controlled by five AMS dates. Sediment lithology changes from clay at similar to 14-13 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal BP), through marl at 13-8 ka, to gyttja at 8-0 ka. The transition from clay to marl probably represents increased productivity of the lake in a stabilizing watershed, induced by initial Allerod climate warming after ice retreat, as calcite precipitation of marl was facilitated by Chara photosynthesis under high water temperature in summer. The delta O-18 record obtained from bivalve Pisidium mollusc shells shows several large shifts between 13 and 8 ka. A negative excursion of similar to 2 parts per thousand in delta O-18 at 12.4-11.5 ka is suggestive of a regional expression of the Younger Dryas (GS-1) cooling event. A 4.5 parts per thousand negative shift from -10.5 parts per thousand at 13-11 ka to -15 parts per thousand at 10.5-8 ka occurred during the peak carbonate interval around 10.5 ka. This surprisingly large negative shift in delta O-18 values during the early Holocene thermal maximum has not been documented elsewhere in the region. This shift suggests a major change in atmospheric circulation patterns, possibly through more frequent easterly flow of warm and dry air masses that are also depleted in O-18. Pollen results from marl sediments indicate vegetation change from a herb tundra, through shrub birch-dominated tundra, to an alder forest, which follows closely with other regional pollen sequences in south-central Alaska. The results from this study suggest that the climatic shift during the early Holocene was of greater magnitude than the Younger Dryas event, implying the importance of regional feedback processes in high latitudes in controlling regional climate response to large-scale forcing.

The results show that pigment concentration is very low in modern sediments with CD generally higher than TC. This is in accordance with the present low productivity of the lakes. Within laminated portions of the cores, collected from Lakes Langano and Shalla, the concentration of pigments is as much as 5 to 40 times higher than in the modem sediments, This is interpreted as resulting from persistent lake stratification due to higher lake levels, This allowed the conservation of both laminae and pigments in a reducing environment. The fact that CD and TC values increased contemporaneously could also imply a high terrestrial organic matter input into the lakes as well as a high nutrient supply, which might have led to enhanced lake productivity, This was more so when pigment concentration was the highest in cores from Shalla and Langano at around 2000 yr BP. The above interpretation is supported by data from lake level variations showing that there was a rising trend at around 2000 yr BP with inference of humid conditions coming from pollen and other proxies in the study area and in the region. Pigment concentration declined after about 1000 YR BP when the CD/TC ratio became high. This could result from a fall in lake productivity shown by a low TC value and a poor conservation condition shown by a more homogeneous sediment.																					1-4020-0772-8				2002	12						471	485																WOS:000179074600019
J	Schmid, M; Dorji, P				Schmid, Martin; Dorji, Pema			Permanent lake stratification caused by a small tributary - the unusual case of Lej da San Murezzan	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Meromixis in temperate 1 freshwater lakes is in most cases caused by (1) a morphometric predisposition combined with a high productivity that leads to anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion, (2) saline subsurface inflows, or (3) turbidity currents. Here we report an unusual case where meromixis is caused by the surface inflow of a small tributary. Le da San Murezzan has been known for several decades to be salinity-stratified during winter, contrary to its neighbouring lakes Lej da Silvaplauna and Lej da Segl. To determine the cause of this stratification, vertical profiles of conductivity were measured on ten occasions between 27 September 2006 and 23 March 2007. An evaluation of these profiles showed that the salinity stratification was continuously built up by a salt source of approximately 51 d(-1). Ovel dal Mulin, a small tributary that contributes only about 1% to the total water inflows of the lake, was identified as the source of this salt. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a lake where such a small unpolluted surface inflow leads to almost permanent salinity stratification. The salinity stratification has important consequences: it causes the take to be meromictic with only occasional complete mixing instead of dimictic as the neighbouring lakes and thus supports the build-up of an anoxic botom layer. Furthermore, it allows restratifying the cold water discharge from a recently installed heat pump within the hypolimnion without the risk of disturbing the ice formation at the lake surface by a rising plume.

This study analyzed the effects of vegetative buffer strips (VBSs) and winter cover crops (CCs) in a land reclamation area of the Catchment of Lake Massaciuccoli (Central Italy) by modelling water and soil dynamics at a very detailed scale, using a novel approach based on high-resolution input data. To this aim, SWAT+ was applied on digital terrain models (DTMs) from close-range photogram-metry, land-cover mapping, real crop rotations and a detailed calendar of farming practices. NBSs behaviour was investigated in two test areas, namely the Studiati and the Gioia areas, with uniform geomorphological settings but different soil types and annual crop rotations. NBS effects were compared with a baseline control scenario (without NBSs) and assessed under future climate conditions (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Specifically, VBSs and CCs showed different capabilities in mitigating runoff and sediment losses, and their combination provided maximum effectiveness. For the current climate scenarios, the implementation of VBSs produced a reduction of runoff depth of about 41% and 64% in the Studiati and Gioia areas, respectively, whereas showing a limited with the CCs implementation. Under the future climate conditions, similar patterns were observed, even if predicting signif-icantly lower runoff depths. The sediment loss reduction was in the order of 79% and 64% in Studiati and Gioia areas, respectively. Concerning soil and water dynamics, the study remarked that slight topographic irregular-ities on flat morphologies can trigger concentrated flows responsible for high runoff and sediment losses. Furthermore, the differences in soil texture and organic matter content affected soil erodability rate on a local scale, driving the consistency of NBS mitigating effects. Future climate changes scenarios, exhibiting higher temperature and rarer but more concentrated rainfall events, emphasize the impact of different soil types. Results observed at a very local scale, with a spatialization of a few square meters -which clearly relates to the types of crop rotations, NBSs and soil distribution -noticed that SWAT+ is a suitable tool to aid farmers in cropping systems management and design.

The WBLP adopted large-scale administration of praziquantel as the main control measure. At the end of the 10-year project in 2001, data from high-, medium-, and low-endemic areas suggested that the infection rates of both humans and domestic animals had fallen to the expected levels. However, major floods in the Yangtze River basin, coupled with reduced funding for schistosomiasis control, resulted in a rebound of the disease in endemic areas. Since 2005, a steady decline in infection rates was observed and it was hypothesized that the experiences and technological advances accumulated during the WBLP played a role. Nonetheless, relatively little is known about the long-term effects of the WBLP on schistosomiasis, particularly management mechanisms, technological innovations, epidemiological changes, and long-term economic impact. To fill these gaps, we systematically searched the literature for articles in English and Chinese on the WBLP on schistosomiasis from 1 January 1992 to 30 July 2022. Relevant studies were analyzed for short-, mid-, and long-term epidemiological and economic effects of the WBLP on schistosomiasis prevention, control, and elimination. Overall, 81 articles met our inclusion criteria, of which 17 were related to management mechanism reform, 20 pertained to technological innovation, and 44 examined epidemiological changes and economic effects. Most papers documented the WBLP as a positive contribution to schistosomiasis prevention and control in the People's Republic of China. Regarding the long-term effects, there was a significant contribution to the national schistosomiasis control and elimination programme in terms of renewed management mechanisms, talent development, and technological innovation. In conclusion, the WBLP contributed to enhanced control of schistosomiasis and shaped the ultimate response towards schistosomiasis elimination in the People's Republic of China. Experiences and lessons learned might guide schistosomiasis control and elimination elsewhere.

Analysis of volcanic threat from Nisyros Island, Greece, with implications for aviation and population exposure	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Nisyros island in the South Aegean volcanic arc, Greece, is a Quaternary composite volcano with a 3.8 km wide caldera that in 1996 entered a volcano-seismic crisis, which heralded the islands' return to a state of unrest. The caldera has been the locus of at least thirteen phreatic eruptions in historical times, the most recent in 1888, and the system is still presently affected by considerable hydrothermal activity. Although the recent unrest waned off without eruption, there are still open questions relating to the current threat of volcanic activity from the island. Here, we perform a detailed and systematic assessment of the volcanic threat of Nisyros using a threat analysis protocol established as part of the USGS National Volcano Early Warning System (NVEWS). The evaluation involves a methodical assessment of fifteen hazard and exposure factors, and is based on a score system, whereby the higher the score, the higher the threat is. Uncertainty in assessment criteria are expressed by allowing for a conservative and an extreme score for each factor. We draw our analysis from published data as well as from results of our research on Nisyros over the past years. Our analysis yields a conservative threat score of 163 and an extreme score of 262. The most adverse exposure factors include significant scores relating to aviation and population exposure to volcanic hazards from Nisyros. When looked at in comparison to US volcanoes both scores place Nisyros in the 'Very High Threat (VHT)' category, grouping it with volcanoes such as Redoubt, Mount Ranier and Crater Lake. We identify a short-fall in recommended surveillance efforts for VHT volcanoes given existing monitoring capabilities on the island. We discuss potential pitfalls of applying the NVEWS scheme to Nisyros and suggest potential adaptation of analysis scheme to match industrial and societal conditions in Europe. At the same time, our findings indicate that that volcanic threat posed by Nisyros volcano may currently be underestimated.																			1561-8633	1684-9981					2010	10	6					1101	1113		10.5194/nhess-10-1101-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-10-1101-2010													WOS:000279390300004

Morphological and Genetic Variability in Radix auricularia (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae) of Lake Baikal, Siberia: The Story of an Unfinished Invasion into the Ancient Deepest Lake	DIVERSITY-BASEL												This article aims to reconstruct the invasion of the ear-shaped pond snail, Radix auricularia (Linnaeus, 1758), to Lake Baikal, East Siberia. This species is widely distributed in the Palaearctic and Northern America, and since the early 20th century has formed abundant and sustained populations in Lake Baikal. The data provided on the morphological and genetic variability of R. auricularia help to better describe and delineate the species. With an integrative approach involving morphological and molecular data, we improved the knowledge of the intraspecific variability of R. auricularia in the most important characteristics used for its determination. Molecular sequences of nuclear spacer fragment ITS-2 and mitochondrial gene fragment cyt-b were obtained from 32 individuals of Radix (including seven outgroup Radix species) collected from various parts of Lake Baikal and adjacent waterbodies and compared with sequences of 32 individuals of R. auricularia from different regions of the Palaearctic as well as with individuals determinated as R. intercisa from Lake Baikal, R. iturupica from the Kurile Islands, R. ussuriensis from the Khabarovsk region, R. narzykulovi from Tajikistan, and R. schubinae from the Amur region. Molecular genetic analyses revealed that all specimens collected from Lake Baikal belong to R. auricularia. There are no genetically distinct groups of snails that would correspond to two morphospecies previously recorded in Lake Baikal (e.g., R. auricularia s. str. and R. intercisa). Variability of the characteristics that are commonly used for species identification (shell morphology, mantle pigmentation, shape and position of the bursa copulatrix, length and position of the bursa duct, length ratio of preputium to penial sheath) were found in individuals analysed with molecular genetics to be broader than recognised in the current literature. Some shells of R. auricularia collected from Lake Baikal resemble shells of another lymnaeid species, R. balthica, and without molecular assessment can be confused with the latter. Geometric morphometric analysis of more than 250 shells revealed no observed hiatus between Baikalian and non-Baikalian R. auricularia. The probable stages and pathways of R. auricularia invasion to Lake Baikal's ecosystem are outlined and discussed. Factors such as global climate warming and human activity stimulated and facilitated the ongoing dispersal of ear pond snails within Lake Baikal.					; Vinarski, Maxim/D-6103-2014; Sitnikova, Tatiana/JBR-8697-2023	Sitnikova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3278-6111; Khanaev, Igor/0000-0001-6431-2765; Hundsdoerfer, Anna/0000-0001-5594-4154; Vinarski, Maxim/0000-0002-7644-4164; 														1424-2818				JUL	2022	14	7							527	10.3390/d14070527	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14070527													WOS:000833681300001
J	Zhu, XZ; Li, Q; Yin, CT; Fang, XT; Xu, XD				Zhu, Xiangzhi; Li, Qiong; Yin, Chuntao; Fang, Xiantao; Xu, Xudong			Role of Spermidine in Overwintering of Cyanobacteria	JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY												Polyamines are found in all groups of cyanobacteria, but their role in environmental adaptation has been barely investigated. In Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, inactivation of spermidine synthesis genes significantly reduced the survivability under chill (5 degrees C)-light stress, and the survivability could be restored by addition of spermidine. To analyze the effects of spermidine on gene expression at 5 degrees C, lacZ was expressed from the promoter of carboxy(nor) spermidine decarboxylase gene (CASDC) in Synechocystis. Synechocystis 6803::P-CASDC-lacZ pretreated at 15 degrees C showed a high level of LacZ activity for a long period of time at 5 degrees C; without the pretreatment or with protein synthesis inhibited at 5 degrees C, the enzyme activity gradually decreased. In a spermidine-minus mutant harboring P-CASDC-lacZ, lacZ showed an expression pattern as if protein synthesis were inhibited at 5 degrees C, even though the stability of its mRNA increased. Four other genes, including rpoA that encodes the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase, showed similar expression patterns. The chill-light stress led to a rapid increase of protein carbonylation in Synechocystis. The protein carbonylation then quickly returned to the background level in the wild type but continued to slowly increase in the spermidine-minus mutant. Our results indicate that spermidine promotes gene expression and replacement of damaged proteins in cyanobacteria under the chill-light stress in winter. IMPORTANCE Outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater lakes is a worldwide environmental problem. In the annual cycle of bloom-forming cyanobacteria, overwintering is the least understood stage. Survival of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 under long-term chill (5 degrees C)-light stress has been established as a model for molecular studies on overwintering of cyanobacteria. Here, we show that spermidine, the most common polyamine in cyanobacteria, promotes the survivability of Synechocystis under long-term chill-light stress and that the physiological function is based on its effects on gene expression and recovery from protein damage. This is the first report on the role of polyamines in survival of overwintering cyanobacteria. We also analyzed spermidine synthesis pathways in cyanobacteria on the basis of bioinformatic and experimental data.																			0021-9193	1098-5530				JUL	2015	197	14					2325	2334		10.1128/JB.00153-15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.00153-15								25917915					WOS:000356526600009

Lake Biwa sediments spanning the last c. 145 ka are characterized by 4 main intervals when the FQF values were significantly greater than 2 g cm(-2) ka(-1), and 5 main periods during which FQF values were lower. Three of the intervals with high FQF values occur from c. 128 to 78 ka BP, with peak values at c. 122, 101 and 82 ka BP; the fourth of two narrow peaks exists between c. 48 and 35 ka BP. Three main periods with lower FQF values intervene between intervals of high FQF values, and two others lie before c. 128 ka BP and after c. 35 ka BP. The data imply that palaeoprecipitation over the lake catchment increased during the intervals of high FQF values, and decreased during the periods of lower FQF values. High FQF values between c. 48 and 35 ka BP are interpreted to reflect an effective runoff of meltwater from the surrounding mountains during the interstade of the last glaciation. Relatively low FQF values during the early Holocene are interpreted to reveal a sluggish northward retreat of the polar front in the North Pacific Ocean that suppressed the northward advance of the summer monsoonal front and regional precipitation. During the last interglaciation, the increasing trend of FQF values is interpreted to indicate a progressive expansion of the Sea of Japan related to the rise in global sea level, which increased moisture advection to, and precipitation within, the Lake Biwa region.																			0300-9483					MAR	2004	33	1					74	81		10.1080/03009480310006989	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03009480310006989													WOS:000220044000006

The seismically well-imaged lacustrine clinothems in the Eocene Dongying Depression provide a good opportunity to bridge the deep-water sediment partitioning with clinothem architecture and shelf-edge trajectories, which have been studied through the integration of 3D seismic data and well-logging data. In the study area, the Eocene delta-complexes are architecturally manifested as alternating aggradation dominated (AC) and progradation dominated clinothems (PC). The Eocene Dongying clinothem architecture has been documented in terms of shelf-edge trajectory angle (theta(sht)), edge-to-toe distance (ETT), aggradation height (Ah), progradation distance (Pd) and maximum foreset angle (gamma(mfa)). Aggradation dominated clinothems are characterized by ascending shelf-edge trajectories with thick and widespread sand-prone bottomsets, suggesting higher efficiency of sediment delivery into the outlying lake floor. Progradation dominated clinothems, in contrast, are characterized by flat to slightly descending trajectories and generally by a lack of bottomsets. Alternations of rising and flat to slightly descending trajectories accompanied with different clinothem types probably indicate frequent relative lake level changes (on time-scales of 100s of kyr). Further analysis of seismic images and extensive well-logs suggest the distal aggradational bottomsets are generally consist of sub-lacustrine channel-lobe systems, whereas sediment slide, slump blocks occur in slope to slope toe areas of progradation dominated clinothems, which indicate varied processes of deep-water sediment transport associated with different clinothem types and shelf-edge trajectories. Lake-level, sediment supply, water salinity and density change induced by humid-arid climate cycle are suggested to be main factors controlling clinothems stacking pattern and sediment dispersal into deep-lacustrine. Humid climate are considered to be related with strongly aggradational clinothems, during which sediment can be directly transported to the distant bottomset areas due to increased sediment concentration and energy in river discharge. Whereas during dry periods, progradation dominated clinothems start to build under stillstand or falling lake level conditions, sediment generally accumulates at river mouth and collapses due to sediment overload or fault activity. Therefore, a relationship between deep-lacustrine depositional process and climatic signature was established which may provide new thoughts in both the study of deep-water sequences and deep water exploration in lacustrine basins.					; Liu, Jianping/AHA-5464-2022; xian, benzhong/HHC-8597-2022; Zhang, Ximeng/Y-6101-2019	Xian, Benzhong/0000-0002-5561-3707; Liu, Jianping/0000-0002-1289-4422; 													0264-8172	1873-4073				APR	2020	114								104197	10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2019.104197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2019.104197													WOS:000514747800006

The local pattern of grain size suggests that aeolian activity is the most important agent for sedimentation in the lake center in this region, as strong northwesterly winds prevail for most of the year and the surface runoff is very weak. Meanwhile, the regional pattern of topsoil grain size and its close association with mean annual precipitation (MAP) allows the establishment of a statistical model for palaeo-moisture reconstruction from sediment grain size. In this study, we reconstructed a humidity time series based on the sediment grain size sequence from Anguli Nuur Lake on the southern Inner Mongolian Plateau in China and found that it coincides very closely with the C/N ratio (carbon to nitrogen ratio) and other humidity indices revealed in previous studies of this temperate steppe region and from the delta O-18 values of stalagmite calcite in southern, monsoon-dominated China. This close relationship suggests that climate change in the semi-arid areas of Asia is strongly influenced by the Pacific summer monsoon and that it is reasonable to use sediment grain size as an indicator of humidity variability in the semi-arid steppe region. The reconstructed humidity increased during the early Holocene, and generally humid conditions lasted from about 10,400 until 7000 yr BP. The period from around 7000 to 5200 yr BP was a transition phase from humid to semi-arid conditions, and the monsoon intensity of that time may have been at the threshold for a semi-arid vegetation ecosystem. Finally, since approximately 5200 yr BP to present, the climate has become more arid, with corresponding vegetation deterioration and strong aeolian activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	KRISTOVICH, DAR; STEVE, RA				KRISTOVICH, DAR; STEVE, RA			A SATELLITE STUDY OF CLOUD-BAND FREQUENCIES OVER THE GREAT-LAKES	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Lake-effect cloud bands over each of the North American Great Lakes were studied, using five winters of visible satellite data (1988-93) in order to better document the frequency of mesoscale boundary layer flows that led to their development. Several cloud-band classifications, based on boundary layer circulations identified by past authors, were used. The two most common cloud features over the Great Lakes were widespread lake-effect clouds, usually exhibiting multiple wind-parallel bands, and single or double bands parallel to the long axis of the lakes. Wind-parallel bands of lake-effect clouds have been shown in previous studies to form in the updraft regions of boundary layer roll vortices. Cloud bands parallel to the long axis of each of the Great Lakes have been shown to be organized primarily by land breezes. October-March frequencies revealed that clouds were more prevalent over the western lakes (Superior, Michigan, and Huron) than over the eastern lakes (Erie, Ontario) due to differences in the frequencies of lake-induced clouds. The frequency of clouds due to larger-scale systems did not vary appreciably from lake to lake. Lake-induced cloudiness ranged from about 16% of the days over Lake Ontario to about 30% of the days over Lake Superior. Widespread cloudiness was the most frequent lake-effect cloud organization over the Great Lakes, with the exception of Lake Ontario where they occurred about as often as shore-parallel bands. However, their frequency decreased from west to east, with wind-parallel bands occurring nearly twice as often over Lake Superior as over Lake Erie. Bands parallel to the long axis of the lakes were much more common over the eastern lakes than the western lakes. Variations in monthly mean convective band frequencies were documented. Observed frequencies were consistent with the annual cycle of air-lake temperature difference and wind direction trends.

In Vitro Assessment of Retinoic Acid and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Activity of Treated Effluent From 39 Wastewater-Treatment Plants in Victoria, Australia	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												This project involved the collection of final effluent samples from 39 wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs) in Victoria, Australia, in late summer (late February to early March 2007). The 39 WWTPs included 15 lagoon-based plants and 24 with activated sludge-based processes. Samples were collected and subjected to measurement of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity of the dissolved phase using yeast-based recombinant receptor-reporter gene bioassays. More than 90% of the effluents examined in this study elicited RAR activity (<0.5-198 ng/l a-t-RA equivalents [EQ]). All of the effluents had AhR activity (16-279 ng/l beta NF EQ). Notwithstanding the paucity of comparative data, on the whole, the levels of RAR and AhR activity observed in this pilot survey of Victorian WWTP effluents were greater than those recently reported internationally. One assumption commonly made is that WWTP discharges will be diluted significantly in the receiving environment, further decreasing the potential risk of the discharges. Making this assumption may not be appropriate for some of Victoria's more ephemeral waterways or where effluent is discharged to an enclosed water body, such as a lake or terminal wetland. However, even where WWTP discharges represent all of the environmental flow in the warmer months, the observed RAR and AhR activity (as all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin [TCDD] EQ, respectively) was still significantly lower than the concentrations of RA, and 2,3,7,8-TCCD known to cause developmental malformations in fish larvae after short-term exposure to these chemicals. Of perhaps greater concern, WWTP effluent can contain significant suspended solids (essentially biosolids), which may be a considerable sink for some hormonally active, hydrophobic compounds, and which may in turn increase the long-term exposure risk for aquatic fauna. Further studies of the nuclear and AhR activity of WWTP effluent suspended soilds are required to address this hypothesis.

Gut content analysis and stable nitrogen isotope measurements (delta N-15) were performed on the same individuals. For comparative purposes, nitrogen isotope ratios of the copepod Calanus simillimis, the hyperid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudi and the fish Ceratoscopelus warmingi were also analysed. The results of the gut content analysis for E. vallentini juveniles showed that there was a high contribution of phytoplankton to the diet. Stable nitrogen isotope analysis supported this and indicated that E. vallentini juveniles occupied a similar trophic position to that of the copepod (mean delta N-15 values of 2.38 and 1.72 parts per thousand respectively). E. vallentini adults were found to be omnivorous, but the contribution of carnivory to the diet was difficult to determine. High phytoplankton and low mesozooplankton contributions to the diet from the gut content analysis suggested a predominantly herbivorous diet, However, the stable nitrogen isotope results showed that E. vallentini adults were closely grouped with T. gaudichaudi (mean delta N-15 values of 3.66 and 4.13 parts per thousand respectively), indicating a high degree of omnivory and a relatively large heterotrophic contribution to the diet. Irrespective of the degree of carnivory, a dietary shift with an increase in size was evident for this species. The gut content analysis of E. longirostris showed that this species consumed large amounts of both phytoplankton and metazoan prey. However, the stable nitrogen isotope analysis indicated a high degree of carnivory (mean delta N-15 = 6.88 parts per thousand). Although the gut content analysis showed that N. megalops had a lower contribution of mesozooplankton to the diet compared to that of E. longirostris, the Stable isotope analysis showed that these 2 species occupied a similar position (N. megalops mean delta N-15 = 6.83 parts per thousand). The findings of this study support findings in the literature and show that E. vallentini juveniles are herbivorous and N. megalops adults are carnivorous. However, adults of E, vallentini and E. longirostris appear to have higher contributions of heterotrophic carbon to their diets than has been assumed and may occupy higher trophic positions than initially predicted.

We examined the relationship between grazing pressure and grassland vegetation using drastically improved information technology such as remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS). The experiment was carried out at Xilingol steppe, where the annual precipitation is around 300 mm, and annual mean air temperature is around 0 degrees C. In the former part of the chapter, we discussed how to evaluate the grazing pressure under free ranging condition utilizing multiple livestock farmers in the extended grassland without fences and borders. Standing against this problem, we put GPS on the shoulder of sheep to trace the daily traveling distance. Sheep herd moved between 11 and 12 km in a day during summer season. GPS also showed us the place and time where the sheep herd spent. Newly developed bite-counter clarified the number of biting during grazing separated from rumination. The time series of biomass and grass quality (in term of crude protein content) changes were successfully monitored by satellite vegetation indices such as Terra MODIS-EVI and NOAA AVHRR-NDVI. In the latter part, we examined the effects of grazing pressure on steppe vegetation in the same district. In 1960's, several pipe lines were buried inside grassland from lake to supply drinking water for animal. Opening mouths were set at 5 or 6 km intervals. Livestock villages were formed around the opening, therefore, surrounding grassland came under the influence of gradation of grazing pressure concentrically. Started from certain opening, we put quadrates on 4 directions at 1 km intervals until 5 km of distance. In addition of botanical composition survey, biomass, soil conditions and spectral reflectance measurements were executed at each plot. Vegetation cover, biomass and plant height increased in accordance with distance from opening. Both NDVIs obtained from radiometer at ground and Landsat image showed similar trend as biomass change. Botanical composition also changed. Land was almost bare around the opening, then some low palatable herbaceous plants are remained near the opening. Three or four km apart from opening, the original vegetation and biodiversity recovered and biomass became constant. Finally, we discussed effects of grazing pressure on steppe vegetation from a comprehensive stand point.

Invasive crayfish and their symbionts in the Greater London area: new data and the fate of Astacus leptodactylus in the Serpentine and Long Water Lakes	ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												The branchial cavities of four non-indigenous crayfish species resident in the Greater London area were examined for crustacean symbionts. Pacifastacus leniusculus from Cripsey Brook, Chipping Ongar, Essex, and the Serpentine Lake, Central London, both carried the symbiotic ostracod Uncinocythere occidentalis, which is indigenous to the western USA. Analysis of covariance showed that crayfish carapace length did have an effect on the abundance of entocytherid associates, whereas intensity did not seem to be dependent on whether the host was female or male. Another invasive entocytherid, Ankylocythere sinuosa, was found on the gills of Procambarus clarkii in Hampstead Heath, representing the first record of the species for northwestern Europe. Contrary to recent model-based predictions, A. sinuosa appears to survive British winters. Examination of the gills of Astacus leptodactylus from the Serpentine revealed the presence of two symbiotic copepods, Nitocra hibernica and Acanthocyclops sp., and a common but accidental association with the cladoceran Bosmina longirostris. The observation of N. hibernica on all three P. leniusculus specimens collected in 2010 suggests that the copepod switched crayfish hosts in the Serpentine following the decimation of the Turkish crayfish population after 2008. This is the first record of an indigenous copepod becoming associated with a non-indigenous crayfish, a case of unusual host switching having previously been reported only for branchiobdellidans. The deliberate introduction of signal crayfish in the Serpentine can probably be attributed to aquarists, 'well intentioned' individuals and/or people who have animal release as part of their religious practice. Serpentine signal crayfish that were tested for Aphanomyces astaci (crayfish plague) produced inconclusive results. The sudden collapse of the Turkish crayfish population in the Serpentine between 2008 and 2010 remains unexplained although a number of potentially causative factors are discussed. No crustacean symbionts were obtained from Orconectes virilis in the River Lee at Enfield, Middlesex.

Understanding the temporal trends in ice cover duration and thickness is of great significance in terms of sustainable lake management in an era of climate change. In this study, lake ice observation data from the past seven decades (1954-2023) for four lakes in Central Europe, Poland, were collected and used for this purpose. The results showed that for all lakes, ice-on was postponed, delayed by 1.8 days per decade, and ice-off tended to be earlier by 3.6 days per decade. In this regard, ice cover duration reduced 6.5 days per decade, on average. Specifically, ice cover duration decreased in 40, 32, 40, and 45% for the four lakes, respectively. Moreover, for all lakes, the maximum thickness of ice cover decreased at an average rate of 3.3 cm per decade. Specifically, the maximum ice cover thickness decreased in 42, 47, 68, and 59% for the four lakes, respectively. Air temperature parameters (e.g., averaged air temperature during the ice cover duration and winter) are important controlling factors on lake ice cover, both for ice cover duration and the maximum thickness, while wind and rainfall play a minor role. With the rise of air temperature, lakes will have less and thinner ice cover. Mitigation measures shall be taken to reduce the impact of climate warming on lake ice.

Assessing the Influence of Tilapia on Sport Fish Species in North Carolina Reservoirs	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Redbelly Tilapia Tilapia zilli and Blue Tilapia Oreochromus aureus are indigenous to Africa and the Middle East, but now occur throughout the southeastern United States. It is fairly well understood that foraging flexibility and wide salinity, oxygen, and temperature tolerances have led to general invasion success for most tilapia species. Conflicting empirical information about the influence of tilapia on native sport fish species, however, leaves natural resource managers unable to anticipate and prevent further introductions and potential associated risks to native sport fishes. This investigation focused on two North Carolina reservoirs with tilapia populations: Hyco Lake, a large reservoir in northcentral North Carolina and Lake Julian, a small impoundment in western North Carolina. These reservoirs receive heated effluent from power generation, which is assumed to provide winter refuge for tilapia at a time when temperatures would otherwise lead to mortality. We assessed relative abundances of the tilapias and native sport species (Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, black basses Micropterus spp., and Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus) in these systems and examined their trophic interactions via diet and stable isotope analyses in both lakes. In Hyco Lake we assessed potential spatial interactions and influences on relative abundance using a priori candidate models and model selection via Akaike's information criterion (AIC). These analyses indicated little evidence of tilapias influencing the relative abundances of the sport species in Hyco Lake. In both lakes, however, we did find substantial diet overlap between the tilapias and Bluegill along with isotopic niche overlap between Blue Tilapia and Bluegill in Lake Julian and Redbelly Tilapia and Bluegill in Hyco Lake. Due to the omnivorous and flexible diet of all three species these interactions were not surprising, but the ultimate influence on Bluegill growth and size structure is unknown. Overall, our results suggest that tilapia are exploiting trophic niches that are not used by the sport fishes of interest in these two very different reservoir systems and that their direct impact on sport species is not substantial.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	2018	147	2					350	362		10.1002/tafs.10031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10031													WOS:000428345700009

Zirconium-hafnium and rare earth element signatures discriminating the effect of atmospheric fallout from hydrothermal input in volcanic lake water	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Geochemical behaviour of rare earth elements (REE), Zr, and Hf was investigated in CO2-rich waters circulating in Pantelleria Island also including 'Specchio di Venere' Lake within a calderic depression. A wide range of total dissolved REE concentrations was found (2.77-12.07 nmol L-1), with the highest contents in the lake. The main REE complexes in the CO2-rich waters are [REE(CO3)(2)](-) and [REECO3](+), showing changeable proportions as a function of pH. The REE normalized to post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) showed similar features with heavy REE (HREE) enrichments in CO2-rich waters collected from springs and wells, whereas a different REE pattern was found in the 'Specchio di Venere' Lake water with middle REE (MREE) enrichments. The PAAS normalized concentration ratios (LREE/HREE)(N) and (MREE/HREE)(N) in waters are <1, except for the lake water in which (MREE/HREE)(N) > 1. Positive Eu anomalies were found in the investigated waters owing to water-rock interactions with less evolved host rocks. Ce anomalies as a function of Eh values were recognized, with the highest Ce anomaly occurring in the lake water with respect to the CO2-rich waters. The Y/Ho and Zr/Hf molar ratios are higher in the investigated waters (except for lake water) than that in the local rocks, with values ranging from 35.4 to 77.9 and from 76.3 to 299, respectively. The precipitation of authigenic phases was considered to be responsible for the increase in the Y/Ho and Zr/Hf ratios owing to enhanced Hf and Ho removal with respect to Zr and Y. The REE patterns in the lake water show a similar shape (MREE-enriched and a positive Ce anomaly) as those found in the settling dust and in the desert varnish coating of the rocks in arid environments, which mainly contain Fe-and Mn-oxyhydroxides and clay minerals. Similarly, Y/Ho and Zr/Hf ratios in the 'Specchio di Venere' Lake (35.4 and 76.3, respectively) show a desert varnish signature. These data, coupled with the presence of iron oxyhydroxides and phyllosilicates in the shallowest water layer of the 'Specchio di Venere' Lake, verify the aeolian input from the Sahara Desert.

J	Weegman, MD; Weegman, MM				Weegman, Mitch D.; Weegman, Matt M.			Chromium and selenium in invertebrate prey of lesser scaup	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The combined lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and greater scaup (A. marila) population in North America has steadily declined from an average of 7.5 million breeding birds in the 1970s to an all-time low of 3.39 million in 2005. Bioaccumulation is widely known as the means of elevated levels of toxins in vertebrates. Our goal was to determine whether chromium and selenium were factors contributing to the continental scaup population decline by identifying wetlands used by scaup that potentially contain dangerous concentrations of chromium and selenium. We hypothesized that zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) would contain the highest concentrations of selenium and chromium because they are filter feeders, whereas amphipods would contain the lowest concentrations because of their short life span. We collected zebra mussels, fingernail clams (Sphaerium transversum), chironomid larvae, snails (Gastropoda), and amphipods on randomly selected traditional lesser scaup staging and breeding wetlands. We found higher chromium concentrations in zebra mussels from Iowa, USA, than in those from Wisconsin, USA (P = 0.0074). In addition, selenium concentrations in zebra mussels from Wisconsin were higher than in those from Iowa (P < 0.0001). Higher selenium concentrations in amphipods were associated with sampled wetlands surrounded by developed land. Invertebrates with > 5 mu g/g selenium and > 1 mu g/g chromium are potentially hazardous for scaup. Chromium concentrations in Iowa were the highest for most species examined, whereas they were the lowest in Minnesota, USA. Based on our results, lesser scaup probably accumulate the highest concentrations of selenium on Lake Onalaska, Wisconsin, whereas they probably accumulate the lowest concentrations in Iowa. Waterfowl biologists are searching for explanations to the scaup decline; we propose chromium and selenium concentrations in amphipods and fingernail clams may be a factor.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				MAY	2007	71	3					778	782		10.2193/2006-196	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2006-196													WOS:000246495300015

Moreover, in the semi-arid region of northern China, it may also provide a scientific basis for addressing ecological problems and achieving sustainable development goals. Based on 5 AMS C-14 dates and 259 fossil pollen samples from the sediments of Lake Gouchi in Shaanxi Province, China, we reconstructed the pattern and process of vegetation succession in the monsoon margin area since the mid-Holocene. Combined with records of regional monsoonal precipitation and archaeological data, we use the results to evaluate changes in the relationship between vegetation, climate change and human activities. The vegetation development during 8-1 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal a BP, BP = before present, where "present" is 1950 AD) was mainly controlled by natural climate change. Optimum vegetation conditions occurred during 7.8-5.3 ka when the monsoon precipitation was the strongest. The vegetation during this interval was mainly grassland with Artemisia. Meanwhile, the percentage of hygrophytes reached its maximum. During 5.3-1 ka, the monsoon precipitation decreased and the proportion of xerophytes increased, while the proportion of hygrophytes decreased. After similar to 1 ka, human activities became the dominant driver of vegetation change. The proportion of xerophytes increased during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP, 1000-1300 AD), while the proportion of hygrophytes increased during the early stage of the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1400-1900 AD). This suggests that the shifts between the humid climate of the MWP and the arid climate of the LIA had relatively little influence on the vegetation. The pollen of anthropochores increased substantially after similar to 1 ka, together with an increase in the sediment accumulation rate at Lake Gouchi. Thus, it is likely that human activity began to significantly affect the evolution of the regional vegetation as early as similar to 1000 years ago. A synthesis of the timing of the transition from natural to anthropogenic forcing of vegetation change in China reveals pronounced spatial differences. In northern China human activity began to dominate vegetation change from similar to 2 to 1 ka (especially since 1 ka), while in southern China, a significant human impact on the vegetation occurred much earlier, during similar to 5-3 ka. In the future, under the combined effects of a drying climate and the further intensification of human activities in northern China, it will become increasingly important to implement science-based environmental planning in order to restore the regional vegetation and promote the sustainable development of the terrestrial ecosystems of the region.

Many of the lakes occur in areas of spectacular landforms located at the base of prominent escarpments. Palaeo-lakes were on average far larger (and deeper) during the Pleistocene. Currently, lakes are mostly relatively small, finger-shaped bodies with a maximum length of a few tens of kilometres. Lake basins have limited catchment and few outlets; rift platforms are tilted outwards so that major rivers flow away from the rift valley. Evaporation exceeds inflow resulting in high levels of alkalinity and salinity. The high sodium content is enhanced due to erosion of the sodium-rich volcanic rocks that characterise the Gregory Rift Valley. Lakes Bogoria, Nakuru, Elmenteita, Manyara and Eyasi are typical in this regard: they are finger-shaped, extremely shallow and markedly alkaline. They have an average pH of 10. Lakes Magadi and Natron are extraordinarily toxic; they contain brines with a pH of 12 that fossilises trees and animals by replacing the wood or bones with sodium carbonate. The alkaline lakes include salt deposits which are a mixture of two naturally occurring compounds of sodium carbonate, trona and natron. The salt deposits of Lake Magadi are quarried for soda ash. Lakes Baringo and Naivasha differ from the alkaline lakes in that they have a more rounded form, occur in basins with larger catchments and are dominated by freshwater. Important vertebrate and hominin fossils have been discovered in the Miocene-Pleistocene sediments of the Tugen Hills, near Lake Baringo. Geysers and hot springs discharge sulphurous brines into some lakes, including Baringo and Manyara. The geysers associated with Lake Bogoria are particularly well known. Many lakes and foreshores sustain significant concentrations of wildlife and they are refuges for more than 400 species of birds. Huge concentrations of flamingoes occur on some of the alkaline lakes.																					978-3-319-73785-0; 978-3-319-73784-3				2018							167	180		10.1007/978-3-319-73785-0_15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73785-0_15	10.1007/978-3-319-73785-0												WOS:000481818600016
J	Bockheim, JG; McLeod, M				Bockheim, James G.; McLeod, Malcolm			Glacial geomorphology of the Victoria Valley System, Ross Sea Region, Antarctica	GEOMORPHOLOGY												During the 2011-2012 austral summer, we had the opportunity to verify a surficial geology map prepared nearly 50 years ago for the Victoria Valley system (VVS), the largest of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. We used high-resolution landsat images and a digital elevation model to identify landforms and prepare detailed maps of each of the five valleys in the VVS, including lateral and end moraines, rock glaciers, gelifluction sheets, gravel ripples, and hummocky and ice-cored drifts. Our mapping suggests that the Bull drift is less extensive than previously thought, attains a maximum elevation of similar to 750 m in Balham and Barwick Valleys and the upper Bull Pass region, and does not occur in McKelvey Valley. We found Insel drift to 850 m elevation in eastern McKelvey Valley and upper Bull Pass and were able to trace Insel drift down Bull Pass where it becomes Peleus drift in Wright Valley. The Victoria Lower Glacier likely responded to grounding of ice in the Ross Embayment and was out-of-phase with alpine glaciers elsewhere in the VVS. We amplified and quantified Calkin's relative chronology and provide here our multiple-parameter relative chronology for the McMurdo Dry Valleys that is based on surface-boulder weathering, soil weathering, salt stage, degree of development of the desert pavement, and form of patterned ground. Except for Victoria Lower Valley, we correlate Packard drift with Taylor II drift (ca., 120 ka), Vida drift with Taylor III drift (ca., 300 ka), Bull drift with Taylor IVb drift (2.7-3.5 Ma, and Jewel drift with Peleus drift (>3.7 Ma, <5.4 Ma). The lack of a strong correlation between soil salt stage and depth of visible salts with elevation leads us to question whether a high-level lake (ca., 200 m deep) existed in the VVS during the early Holocene.

J	Rawson, DS				Rawson, DS			A comparison of some large alpine lakes in western Canada	ECOLOGY												Four lakes on the eastern slope of the Canadian Rockies have been compared among themselves and with 2 lakes in the Central Plateau of British Columbia. They are all oligotrophic, mountain lakes, cold, well oxygenated and with one exception they lie in deep narrow basins. Two of them, Bow and Maligne, are heavily silted in summer. Three lakes have high and 3 low mineral content in their waters. The net plankton and the macroscopic bottom organisms have been measured as an indication of the biol. productivity. The amts. of plankton are low, and the bottom fauna very low, as compared with production in eutrophic lakes. The amt. of plankton shows a high correlation with the mean temp. of the upper 10 m. of water and with the mineral content of the water. The amt. of bottom fauna is proportional to the amt. of plankton except in 2 unusually deep lakes where the bottom fauna is scanty. This series of lakes shows a wide variation in geological surroundings, climate and morphology of the basins. It is thus useful as a demonstration of the relative effects of these conditions on the productivity of the lakes. In each case the favorable effect of one or more of these influences is opposed by the unfavorable effect of the others. Thus none of these factors can be considered as dominant in these lakes. The fact that present fish production bears little relation to the capacity suggested by the supply of plankton and bottom fauna, provides a challenge to fish culturists in the region.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	1942	23	2					143	161		10.2307/1931082	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931082													WOS:000200151500002
J	Selman, W				Selman, Will			River Turtles and One Dam Lake: Two Imperiled Graptemys Species in the Pearl River and Potential Impacts of the Proposed One Lake Project	CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												The impacts of human modifications of rivers and associated riverine fauna are well documented, especially following the construction of impoundments. In the Pearl River system of Mississippi and Louisiana, 2 endemic Graptemys species are found (G. oculifera; G. pearlensis), but little is known of their densities in urban segments near Jackson, Mississippi, even though both are species of conservation concern. I used spotting scopes and binoculars to complete replicated basking surveys for both Graptemys species during the summers of 2017 and 2018 in 5 equidistant segments of the Pearl River and nearby oxbow lakes. Basking densities for both species were generally higher in river segments upstream and downstream of Jackson compared to middle segments. Graptemys oculifera were found in greater densities than G. pearlensis in all segments (14-69-times higher). Graptemys oculifera was found in 4 of the 6 oxbow lakes surveyed, but mean densities decreased 10-fold compared with river segments; G. pearlensis was absent from all oxbow lakes. Densities for a generalist turtle species, Trachemys scripta, increased 35 times in oxbow vs. river habitats. The middle 3 survey segments (similar to 15.9 river kilometers) are inclusive of a proposed river impoundment project-the One Lake Project-for flood control and economic development. Estimates of direct and indirect impacts of this project are sizeable for G. oculifera (direct impact: 1684; indirect: 2129) while estimates for G. pearlensis are lower (direct: 88; indirect: 219). The One Lake Project would surely alter existing riverine processes and will favor generalist turtles such as T. scripta that prefer nonflowing lake settings at the expense of riverine Graptemys species. The One Lake Project would be a major setback to both Graptemys species in and around the project area and would negatively impact the recovery potential of both species.																			1071-8443	1943-3956				DEC	2020	19	2					186	196		10.2744/CCB-1400.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2744/CCB-1400.1													WOS:000606541400004

The parameters were calibration based on monthly observations from May, 1987 to April, 1988. The model results agreed with the observations. Subsequently, the long-term effects of six proposed restoration strategies for Lake Chaohu, such as phosphorus loading reduction and water level management, were predicted by a 25-year simulation. The results showed that Ecological Economy Water Level (EEWL), which makes the water depth lower in the spring than usual, had a significant impact on the phytoplankton (reduced by 90%) and submerged vegetation (recovered by a factor of two). In addition, an idealistic water level management method that decreased the water level by 1 m throughout the year (Del m) provided a better restoration effect than EEWL but with little practicability. Other methods, including phosphorus loading reduction, dredging of sediment and fish releasing, showed less significant effects than EEWL. Therefore, EEWL is recommended as the most practical and effective restoration method. The indicator of exergy generally increased during the restoration processes while De1m and EEWL had the first and second highest exergy values. Afterwards, structural dynamic models (SDMs) were introduced into a 5-year simulation conducted under EEWL or De1 m to account for the rapid structure transition from phytoplankton domination to submerged vegetation domination. Two parameters (growth and phosphorus uptake rate of phytoplankton) are included in SDM1 and two more parameters (mortality rate of phytoplankton and submerged vegetation) are included in SDM2. In conclusion: (1) under both scenarios, the parameters in both SDM1 and SDM2 showed a decreasing trend and some fluctuations; (2) the exergy in SDMs was generally higher than that in non-SDM, indicating a better 'solution' for the ecosystem with a greater possibility to survive; (3) SDMs provided stronger changes in the model structure under Del m than EEWL, since the intensity of the forcing function variations were enhanced; (4) in SDM2 with more changing parameters, the first two parameters had similar variation trends as in SDM1 but more fluctuations and more realistic final values within theoretical ranges. The exergy was also higher than that in SDM1. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Changes in epilithic diatom assemblages in a Mediterranean high mountain lake (Laguna de La Caldera, Sierra Nevada, Spain) after a period of drought	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The epilithic diatom assemblages studied in the high mountain take "La Caldera" (Granada, Spain)from 1996 to 1998 went through two clearly different stages. The initial one, in 1996, corresponded to the reflooding of the basin after a severe drought and was composed mainly of the colonising species Fragilaria rumpens, together with a lesser presence of Nitzschia sublincaris and Hantzschia amphioxys. The predominant presence of F. rumpens at the end of the summer of 2006 coincided with low species diversity (values of Shannon and Wiener Index: 0.3-0.6). During the following two years another assemblage established itself dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum, which is considered to be more stable and widespread among the lakes of the Sierra Nevada. The most notable subdominant species (less than 20% of relative abundance) in this assemblage were: Encyonema minutum, Encyonopsis microcephala and Navicula cryptocephala. The diversity values during this second period were much higher than in the first: 1.0-2.2. Nutrient concentrations were measured separately in the linnetic (epilimnetic) and benthic (epilithic) environments. These abiotic parameters show that the dynamics of ammonia and silica were much the same in both, showing a gradual decrease from the beginning to the end of the study period. Epilimnetic phosphorus followed a similar pattern to ammonia and silica. In the epilithon, nitrates and phosphates increased during the first year, only to descend notably during the second. The effect of other environmental parameters such as temperature and the preceding drought on the dynamics of the diatom assemblage are discussed. Ratio DIN:SRP let its test the different degrees of phosphorus limitation in epilithon and epilimnion environments; our results suggest that phosphorus limitation of primary production in high mountain lakes is much more severe in the limnetic environment that it is in the epilithon.

J	WYNNE, D				WYNNE, D			THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PESTICIDES ON THE KINNERET AND ITS WATERSHED, OVER THE PERIOD 1980-1984	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION SERIES A-ECOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL												Over the period 1980-1984, water and fish samples have been routinely analyzed for pesticide residues as part of a more general lake and watershed monitoring programme. Water samples were taken from 14 sites in the Hula Valley, close to the main farming areas. Initially, concentrations of various pesticides (such as Parathion and Endosulphan) were high, especially at certain sites, but later, only traces of these chemicals were found even though there has been little reduction in the quantities of pesticides used. During the rainy seson some residual pesticides remaining in the soil were washed into the drainage canals at the beginning of the winter floods, but concentrations dropped rapidly, suggesting that either quantities of pesticides in the fields were low, or that they were bound strongly to soil particles. Fish analyses largely comprised cases of deliberate poisoning of Sarotherodon galilaeus (St Peter''s fish), by Endosulphan and/or Lindane, for illegal fishing purposes. In the past few years, however, the numbers of both suspected fish poisonings and poisoned fish have significantly declined, and analyses now mostly involve spot checks of catches. ''Baseline'' studies of fish, zooplankton, algae and benthic mussels, as well as water samples, from the lake were also carried out. Pesticide residues were not found in any of these samples. These results suggest that the potential threat to the Kinneret from pesticide residues is at present relatively low. The Kinneret Limnological Laboratory pesticide monitoring programme has been, at least partially, instrumental in reducing pesticide contamination (accidental or otherwise) of water or fish, in the lake and watershed. In the light of possible changes in agricultural practices and water management policies in the north of Israel, however, this programme will be continually updated to avoid any deterioration in the current situation.																			0143-1471						1986	42	4					373	386		10.1016/0143-1471(86)90020-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0143-1471(86)90020-6													WOS:A1986E576800008
J	Xu, MZ; Wang, ZY; Qi, LJ; Liu, L; Zhang, K				Xu, Mengzhen; Wang, Zhaoyin; Qi, Lijian; Liu, Le; Zhang, Kang			Disaster chains initiated by the Wenchuan earthquake	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Wenchuan earthquake caused numerous landslides and avalanches, which initiated causal chains of geological and ecological disasters. Field investigations and field experiments were performed in the earthquake area in 2008 and 2009 to study the disaster chains. Four types of disaster chains have been identified and seven cases have been studied. In the disaster chains, each episode was caused by the previous episode, or the causal episode. In the first chain, landslide created a quake lake, which was followed by landslide dam failure flood and very intensive fluvial process. The last episode of the chain was loss of habitats and destruction of aquatic biocommunities. The Tangjiashan and Huoshigou landslides initiated such a type of disaster chain. The second chain consisted of landslide, drainage system burying, debris flows, and development of new drainage system and intensive fluvial process. The Wenjiagou landslide initiated such a type of disaster chain. The third chain consisted of avalanches, grain erosion (unusual erosion of bare rocks due to insolation and temperature change), slope debris flows, and flying stones. Many such disaster chain events occurred on the mountains by the Minjiang River section from Yingxiu to Wenchuan. The fourth chain has only two episodes: avalanches during the earthquake occurring on elevation between 100 and 800 m from the riverbed, and rock falls or new avalanches due to increased slope angle of high mountains (400-1,500 m from the riverbed). The Chediguan bridge was broken by such avalanches in July 2009, in which six were killed and more than 20 were injured. For all the disaster chains, the volume of mass movement in each episode was much less than the causal episode (previous episode). In other words, there was an attenuation along the causal chains. The attenuation factor is defined as the ratio of the volume of mass movement or affected area in one episode of a chain to the volume or affected area in the causal episode. The study concluded that the attenuation factor ranges from 0.02 to 0.3. Macro-invertebrates were used as indicator species to evaluate the ecological effect of the disaster chains. The number of species was greatly reduced by the causal chains, although the river section was not directly affected by landslides.

J	Wang, H				Wang, Hui			Regional Ecological Risk Assessment with Respect to Human Disturbance in the Poyang Lake Region (PYLR) Using Production-Living-Ecology Analysis	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												In the regional ecological risk assessment (RERA) research with respect to human disturbance, risk source-receptor identification and corresponding indicators selection are of great importance. In this study, three regional function indexes, i.e., production function index, living function index, and ecology function index, were produced and incorporated into the human-caused RERA research. Among them, the former two indexes can be considered as human disturbance indexes, namely risk source indexes, whereas the last one can be deemed as ecological risk receptor index. Based on related economic statistics and land-use data, which are commonly used approaches for data acquisition, these three spatial function indicators were calculated separately. Incorporated with eco-environmental vulnerability proxies, this RERA framework was realized finally. With the Poyang Lake Region as a case study, the proposed RERA model was practiced to examine its effectiveness in expressing and revealing spatial heterogeneities of regional ecological risk source, risk receptor, eco-environmental vulnerability, and final integrated risk level. The results showed that: (1) the main winter waterbody of Poyang Lake was mainly in the grade of medium risk (grade 2), whereas the north connection part between the lake and the Yangtze River, and the south semi-closed sub-lakes, such as the Junshan Lake, were in high-risk group (grade 3); (2) the west part of the region had a higher human-caused risk level on the whole than that of the east, especially those in Jiujiang and Nanchang cities, in accordance with higher production and living human-disturbance level there; (3) owing to near to the downtown of cities, the wetlands and forestlands within the scope of Nanchang and Jiujiang cities, such as Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve in Nanchang City and Lushan Mountain Forest in Jiujiang City, all had high final risk level (grade 3); (4) in terms of proportion, the low-, medium-, high-, and very-high-risk grades accounted for 47.27%, 33.01%, 13.56%, and 6.16% of the region, respectively. The three regional function indexes adopted in this study, characterizing spatial heterogeneity of regional ecological risk with respect to human activities, will be helpful for related research in the future. Besides, the assessment results could provide scientific basis for regional ecological risk management and then sustainable development of the study area.

J	DeVogel, SB; Magee, JW; Manley, WF; Miller, GH				DeVogel, SB; Magee, JW; Manley, WF; Miller, GH			A GIS-based reconstruction of late Quaternary paleohydrology: Lake Eyre, arid central Australia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Lake Eyre is the terminal playa in a large closed basin which receives the majority of its moisture from the summer monsoon. Modern Lake Eyre receives intermittent floodings at times of increased monsoon intensity, generally associated with the La Nina phase of the ENSO cycle. Lake Eyre was a perennial lake during several phases of increased monsoon activity during the late Quaternary, specifically about 125 ka, 80 ka, 65 ka, and 40 ka [Magee (1997) Late Quaternary Environments and Palaeohydrology of Lake Eyre, Arid Central Australia. Unpubl. Ph.D. Thesis, Australian National University, Canberra]. These lake highstands are reflected by elevated shorelines mapped around Lake Eyre and, to a lesser degree, around the Frome-Gregory system to the southeast of Lake Eyre. Comprehensive research in the Lake Eyre catchment over the last several decades has constrained the ages and elevations of these shoreline deposits, which now enable us to use digital elevation models to map these paleo-lakes. By incrementally filling each lake meter by meter, the areas and volumes of the paleo-lakes are calculated and the paleohydrologic processes, including the flow direction across spillovers, are reconstructed. At the peak 125-ka highstand. Lake Eyre stood at +10 m Australian Height Datum (AHD) and covered nearly 35000 km(2), more than three times the area of the current playa. Together with the Frome-Gregory system, it held 430 km(3) of water. By contrast, the deepest historic filling held 30 km(3). These lake levels represent climatic conditions very different from the modem situation. Due to discontinuous preservation of the shoreline deposits around the lakes and due to the scale of the lake systems, mapping the former levels of Lake Eyre and the Frome-Gregory system has been impossible prior to the availability of a digital elevation model. Paramatizing the area/volume relationships of water required to fill the lake to varying levels will provide data for quantification of climate and precipitation changes over time.

Mercury speciation, reactivity, and bioavailability in a highly contaminated estuary, Berry's Creek, New Jersey Meadowlands	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Speciation and reactivity of mercury were examined in Berry's Creek estuary downstream of a highly mercury-contaminated U.S. EPA Superfund site during the summers of 2002 and 2003. Surface water samples from Berry's Creek estuary, its confluence with the Hackensack River, and upstream of that confluence were analyzed for total (THg), particulate (PHgT), and dissolved (DHg) mercury, total and particulate monomethylmercury (MeHg), dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM), and bacterial merA gene and transcript abundances. Surface water concentrations of THg in Berry's Creek estuary (210 - 6800 pM) are among the highest in North America. A downstream gradient of Hg contamination is a permanent feature of Berry's Creek estuary, and the upper estuary appears to be a perennial source of Hg to the lower estuary and the Hackensack River. MeHg concentrations in Berry's Creek surface waters ranged from 2 to 14 pM, with the highest concentrations occurring at a midestuary site 2 km downstream of the tide gate. The suspended particle phase dominated Hg and MeHg speciation throughout this system, accounting for > 90% of THg in Berry's Creek estuary and 35 - 94% of THg in the Hackensack River. Concentrations of DGM in Berry's Creek estuary (0.1 - 1.0 pM) are similar to levels of DGM in other much less contaminated estuaries (0.04 - 0.75 pM). In addition, expression levels of the bacterial mercuric reductase gene, merA, a gene of the inorganic Hg(II)-regulated, mercury resistance (mer) operon, were low throughout Berry's Creek estuary. Thus, despite very high concentrations of mercury in Berry's Creek estuary, relatively low concentrations of DGM and merA gene expression levels indicate limited bioavailability of inorganic Hg in the estuary's surface waters. A system-wide limitation on the bioavailability of inorganic Hg, together with bacterial demethylation activity, may account for observed MeHg concentrations that, although elevated, are lower than expected given the concentrations of THg in this estuary.

J	Stanosz, GR; Smith, DR; Albers, JS				Stanosz, GR; Smith, DR; Albers, JS			Surveys for asymptomatic persistence of Sphaeropsis sapinea on or in stems of red pine seedlings from seven Great Lakes region nurseries	FOREST PATHOLOGY												The fungus Sphaeropsis sapinea persists on or in stems of asymptomatic red pine (Pinus resinosa) nursery seedlings, and proliferates to cause collar rot and mortality after planting. In the spring of 2002, seven nurseries were surveyed to determine the potential range in frequency of asymptomatic persistence: three operated by Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR), two by Minnesota DNR, one by Michigan DNR, and one by USDA Forest Service (in Michigan). At each nursery five groups of 20 asymptomatic red pine seedlings were collected near an inoculum source (red pine windbreak), if present, and five groups of 20 asymptomatic seedlings were collected away from such a source (1400 seedlings total). A segment of the lower stem/root collar from each seedling was surface disinfested and incubated on tannic acid agar. Transfers were made from resulting colonies and the pathogen identified from pycnidia and conidia produced in culture. The pathogen was identified from asymptomatic seedlings collected in all Wisconsin and Minnesota nurseries, but was never detected from seedlings from the Michigan DNR or USDA Forest Service nurseries. Frequencies of detection were greater (as high as 88%) from asymptomatic seedlings near red pine windbreaks including diseased trees than from seedlings distant from such windbreaks. A subset of isolates from asymptomatic seedlings was characterized using inter-simple sequence repeat-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Most isolates were the A group of S. sapinea, but B group isolates (recently named Diplodia scrobiculata) were also obtained from one nursery. One Minnesota nursery was more extensively sampled in 2003, with 17-44 groups of five asymptomatic red pine seedlings collected in four separate fields (525 seedlings total). The mean frequency of detection of the pathogen in these four fields ranged from 40 to 71%. Persistence of S. sapinea on or in asymptomatic seedlings continues to be problematic, not only because of the potential for subsequent seedling mortality, but also as a means by which a pathogen may be widely distributed.																			1437-4781	1439-0329				AUG	2005	35	4					233	244		10.1111/j.1439-0329.2005.00407.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0329.2005.00407.x													WOS:000230601200001
J	Jones, JG				Jones, JG			Freshwater ecosystems - Structure and response	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY					Workshop on Assessing and Controlling Industrial Impacts on the Aquatic Environment with Reference to Food Processing	MAR 28-30, 2000	BUDAPEST, HUNGARY					Before it is possible to predict the impact of human activities on the natural environment it is necessary to understand the forces that drive and, therefore, control that environment. This paper is concerned with the freshwater component of the aquatic environment. The driving forces involved (some of which are under man's control) can be divided into the physical and the chemical, but the response is, almost entirely, biological. Although most impacts of the food processing industry might be perceived to be on running waters, this is not always the case, but we can apply the same basic rules to both static and running waters. The physical forces that determine how a lake functions are as follows. In early spring, in the temperate zone, the temperature of the surface water in lakes rises and the sunlight input increases. This results in stratification of the water body. The cooler, deeper water is separated, physically, by gravity. This isolated water plays a very different role in the function of the lake and is analogous to how a river works. Man's activities drive these systems by our input of inorganic and organic substances. The inorganic inputs, particularly of phosphorus, stimulate undesirable algal growths, some of which may produce particularly dangerous toxins. We must now accept that climate change, driven by man, will exacerbate these problems. Organic inputs from the food industry, i.e., carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, will all impact lakes and rivers by increasing the biological oxygen demand. The worst case scenario is total loss of oxygen from the water as a result of microbial activity. Lipids create the greatest oxygen demand but carbohydrates (more easily biodegradable) also result in unsightly "sewage fungus." Protein waste can be degraded to produce ammonia and sulfide, both of which produce toxicity problems. Bioremediation processes, particularly phytoremediation, can alleviate these problems in a cost-effective manner and this paper will address these options.

Laguna La Salada Grande (23 degrees S/65 degrees W, 4063 metres above sea-level) is a closed shallow lake located at Cordillera Oriental, North-western Argentina with a unique depositional record, including geomorphic and stratigraphic evidence of palaeoenvironmental changes since the Late Pleistocene. In order to understand the depositional dynamics of this mountain lacustrine system at different timescales, limnogeological multiproxy analyses together with a radiocarbon and Pb-210-based chronology were applied on massive and laminated sediments from La Salada Grande. Laminated deposits were further analyzed using novel sub-centimetric mineralogical, textural and geochemical automated methods (including a combination of micro-X-ray fluorescence and quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN (R)). Thick laminated microfacies at the beginning of the sequence record a deep and organic matter productive palaeolake prior to ca 34 ka (1 ka = 1000 years before 1950), that changed into a highly fluctuating shallower-palaeolake with frequent detrital influxes after ca 34 ka. Microstratigraphy of the coarser-grained detrital laminae between 31 ka and 25 ka reveals irregular and probably sub-centennial high-energy discharge events, pointing to convective atmospheric activity as the main trigger. After ca 21 ka the lake evolved to deeper water-level conditions resulting in fine-grained deposits with limited delivery of coarse-grained sediments, followed by an abrupt lake level drop and incision. The multi-millennial palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of La Salada Grande, and its correlation with other palaeoclimate records, shows a close link between the lacustrine depositional processes and palaeoclimate changes associated with the South American summer monsoon dynamics. This multifocal research in such an understudied environment provides key knowledge about lacustrine functioning and discharge events-climate interactions of mountain lakes of semi-arid climates.					; Vogel, Hendrik/C-6148-2014; Piovano, Eduardo/AAU-7679-2021; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022; Loizeau, Jean-Luc/AAA-1165-2022; Hajdas, Irka/C-6696-2011; Martini, Mateo/ABF-3602-2020	Loizeau, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-0611-0388; Vogel, Hendrik/0000-0002-9902-8120; Moscariello, Andrea/0000-0003-3698-0162; Martini, Mateo/0000-0003-1704-9313; Hajdas, Irka/0000-0003-2373-2725; Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2022	69	6					2585	2614		10.1111/sed.13004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.13004		JUL 2022											WOS:000821590400001

Furthermore, the environmental controls on the loess-soil stratigraphy shown in the thickest deposits in southeast England are still debated. Here we apply the first high sampling resolution quartz optically stimulated luminescence study of dust accumulation and loess formation in Britain at the Pegwell Bay site in east Kent. We couple this to mineral magnetic, particle size and geochemical analyses to understand climate, environment and post depositional modification of the loess. The luminescence ages and Bayesian age modelling results suggest two phases of greatly enhanced dust accumulation at the site. Loess began to accumulate around c. 25-23.5 ka, coinciding with Heinrich event 2, and after subsequent lower accumulation rates, a second enhanced phase of deposition occurred at around 20-19 ka. We propose a model where the dynamics of the British-Irish and Fennoscandian Ice Sheets, associated glacial lake drainage, and linked reorganisations of atmospheric circulation, all controlled loess accumulation in southern Britain. Accumulation in the first phase was triggered by increased sediment supply from initial retreat of the North Sea ice lobe, and drainage of Dogger Lake. Loess accumulation during this phase was enhanced by easterly winds from Atlantic depressions tracking to the south of Britain, caused by the maximum extent of the Irish Sea Ice Stream at c. 25-24 ka. The subsequent retreat of the western part of the British Irish Ice Sheet then allowed storm tracking further north, which reduced effectiveness of dust transporting winds across southern Britain, while sediment supply and availability was reduced in North Sea source areas. A second retreat of the maximum extent of the North Sea Lobe of ice after c. 21-20 ka would have led to another abrupt input of sediment-rich ice dammed lake and meltwater from eastern England and the North Sea into the exposed southern North Sea area. This would have again dramatically increased sediment availability for transport and deposition as loess in SE England, resulting in the second dust accumulation phase. We also propose that the abrupt stratigraphic change from calcareous to non-calcareous loess up section at Pegwell Bay was driven, not by these changes in dust input, but rather deepening of the permafrost active layer after c. 21 ka. This deepening was associated with warmer and wetter conditions driven by Atlantic storms tracking further north following the regression of the Irish Sea Ice Stream and overall ice sheet retreat. As such, last glacial dust dynamics and loess accumulation in Britain is highly influenced by the interaction of the British Irish Ice Sheet the Fennoscandian Ice sheet, Atlantic storm tracks, and the topography and drainage of the exposed North Sea.

Which shows in the alternating appearance of rhythmite composed by mudstone, dolomite, gypsum and rock salt. This kind of rhythmicity is a direct response of constantly changing of lake level rising-falling. The wide development of eury-thermal saline minerals such as calcite and dolomite, indicates that the palaeoclimate was arid to semi-arid in Jianghan Basin during the deposition of Xingouzui Formation in Paleogene. A complete salt rhythm can form a source-reservoir-seal assemblage, which has an important meaning for hydrocarbon generation, accumulation and preservation.																			2352-5401		978-94-6252-164-3				2016	53						984	988																WOS:000378046300178

A field and reactive transport model study of arsenic in a basaltic rock aquifer	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY					Annual Meeting of the Geological-Society-of-America (GSA)	OCT 18-21, 2009	Portland, OR	Geol Soc Amer				The use of geothermal energy as a source for electricity and district heating has increased over recent decades. Dissolved As can be an important constituent of the geothermal fluids brought to the Earth's surface. Here the field application of laboratory measured adsorption coefficients of aqueous As species on basaltic glass surfaces is discussed. The mobility of As species in the basaltic aquifer in the Nesjavellir geothermal system, Iceland was modelled by the one-dimensional (1D) reactive transport model PHREEQC ver. 2, constrained by a long time series of field measurements with the chemical composition of geothermal effluent fluids, pH, Eh and, occasionally, Fe- and As-dissolved species measurements. Di-, tri- and tetrathioarsenic species (As(OH)S-2(2-), AsS33-, AsS33- and As(SH)(4)(-)) were the dominant form of dissolved As in geothermal waters exiting the power plant (2.556 mu M total As) but converted to some extent to arsenite (H3AsO3) and arsenate HAsO42- oxyanions coinciding with rapid oxidation of S-2(-) to S2O32- and finally to SO42- during surface runoff before feeding into a basaltic lava field with a total As concentration of 0.882 mu M following dilution with other surface waters. A continuous 25-a data set monitoring groundwater chemistry along a cross section of warm springs on the Lake Thingvallavatn shoreline allowed calibration of the 1D model. Furthermore, a series of ground water wells located in the basaltic lava field, provided access along the line of flow of the geothermal effluent waters towards the lake. The conservative ion Cl- moved through the basaltic lava field (4100 m) in less than 10 a but As was retarded considerably due to surface reactions and has entered a groundwater well 850 m down the flow path as arsenate in accordance to the prediction of the 1D model. The 1D model predicted a complete breakthrough of arsenate in the year 2100. In a reduced system arsenite should be retained for about 1 ka. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Gill net catchability of walleye (Sander vitreus): Are provincial standards suitable for estimating adult density outside the region?	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Standard gill netting protocols are increasingly used to assess freshwater fish populations. Understanding the catchability (q) of fish following these protocols enables direct estimation of density, which has advantages over relative abundance from analytical and applied research perspectives. However, catchability is complex. The application of q estimated in one region may be inappropriate for another if physical and biological processes driving catchability differ. Cross-region assessments of q are needed to assess the applicability of estimates over a broader geographic and environmental range. In this study, we evaluated whether the global estimate of q (1.044 ha/gang; variance = 0.2268) derived by Giacomini et al. (2020) for walleye Sander vitreus & GE; 350 mm total length (TL) was suitable for application in two Colorado, USA reservoirs supporting recreational fisheries and wild spawn operations. We followed provincial standards in Ontario and Quebec, Canada (i.e., Fall Walleye Index Netting) combined with other corrections for size-dependent catchability to estimate the density of mature, adult walleye & GE; 470 mm TL for comparison to independent estimates from mark-recapture analyses. Following similar methodologies, we found that the global estimate of q combined with size-dependent gill net retention coefficients underestimated the density of adults by nearly 80%, but uncertainty in point estimates can be high. Results highlighted the need to better understand sources of uncertainty, including factors influencing size-dependence in gill net encounter when extending estimates of q to other size classes of fish, systems, and regions. Estimates of catchability for large-bodied adult walleye in our systems were consistent, but relatively low, ranging from 0.203 ha/gang (95% confidence limits = 0.133-0.298) to 0.227 ha/gang (0.091-0.556). We expand the geographic and environmental range of paired mark-recapture and gill net Catch Per Unit Effort information and discuss potential factors contributing variability to estimates of catchability for adult walleye.

In this paleolimnological study, influences of a recently constructed treated waste water discharge pipeline into Lake Nuasjarvi were investigated by analyzing past (pre-disturbance) and present community compositions of key aquatic organism groups, including diatoms, Cladocera and Chironomidae, along spatial (distance, water depth) gradients. In addition to defining ecological changes and impacts of saline mine waters in the lake, chironomids were used to quantitatively reconstruct bottom water oxygen conditions before and after the pipe installation (in 2015). The diatom and cladoceran communities, which reflect more the open-water habitat, showed only relatively minor changes throughout the lake, but a general decrease in diversity was observed within both groups. Chironomids, which live on substrates, showed more significant changes, including complete faunal turnovers and deteriorated benthic quality, especially at the sites close to the pipe outlet, where also chironomid diversity was almost completely lost. Furthermore, the reconstructed hypolimnetic oxygen values indicated a major oxygen decline and even anoxia at the sites near the pipe outlet. The limnoecological influence of the pipe decreased at sites located counter-flow or behind underwater barriers suggesting that the waste waters currently have location-specific impacts. Our study clearly demonstrates that whereas the upper water layers appear to have generally maintained their previous state, the deep-water layers close to the pipe outlet have lost their ecological integrity. Furthermore, the current hypolimnetic anoxia close to the pipe indicates enhanced lake stratification caused by the salinated mine waters. This study clearly exhibits the need to investigate different water bodies at several trophic levels in a spatiotemporal context to be able to reliably assess limnoecological impacts of mining.

Research at these different types of sites yielded different perspectives on the Middle Paleolithic human behavior and evolution. Until recently, open-air Middle Paleolithic sites in the Levant were found in three major sedimentary environments: fluvial, lake-margin and spring. Here we describe a unique depositional environment and formation processes at the recently discovered open-air site of Nesher Ramla (Israel) and discuss their contribution to understanding site formation processes in open-air sites in the Levant. The site is 8-m-thick Middle Paleolithic sequence (OSL dated to 170-80 ka) that is located in a karst sinkhole formed by gravitational deformation and sagging into underground voids. The sedimentary sequence was shaped by gravitational collapse, cyclic colluviation of soil and gravel into the depression, waterlogging, in situ pedogenesis and human occupation. Original bedding and combustion features are well-preserved in the Lower archaeological sequence, a rare occurrence in comparison to other open-air archaeological sites. This phenomenon coincides with episodes of fast sedimentation/burial, which also allowed better preservation of microscopic remains such as ash. The Upper archaeological sequence does not exhibit bedding or preservation of ash, despite presence of heat-affected lithic artifacts, which makes it similar to other open-air sites in the Levant. We suggest that rate of burial is the major factor that caused the difference between the Upper and Lower sequences. The differences in the burial rate may be connected to environmental and vegetation changes at the end of MIS 6. We also identified an interplay between sediment in-wash and density of human activity remains, i.e. during episodes of low natural sediment input the density of artifacts is higher relative to episodes with high rate of sediment in-wash. The detailed analysis of natural and anthropogenic processes at Nesher Ramla suggests a much wider spectrum of processes than previously reported for southern Levantine Paleolithic sites. Nesher Ramla shares certain depositional and post-depositional characteristics with both cave and open-air sites and provides a better insight into processes which control both types of sites.

The present work focuses on the ash fall tuffs levels (bentonites) in order to understand the origin of their sodium composition since classic worldwide natural sodium bentonites link with marine environments as a source of sodium. The mineralogical attributes and relationship with diagenetic alterations have been explored by petrography, X-ray diffraction, and geochemical analysis. The tuff levels, recorded in the Cerro de las Cabras, Potrerillos and Cacheuta formations, provide the most reliable representation of the composition of the original material and diagenetic alterations due to these levels are devoid of detrital input. Accordingly, they represent key elements to explore the origin of huge bentonite deposits in the basin. In the study units, Na-montmorillonite and analcime, found at concentrations of up to or more than 50 vol%, grew at the expense of vitric components and represent authigenic minerals developed under early diagenesis. Following sedimentological and paleogeographic evidence the alteration of volcanic glass occurred in hydrologically open lacustrine systems that reached saline-alkaline conditions. The changes in the (Na + K)/H+ ratio influenced the formation of Na-montmorillonite and analcime through the succession. In addition, kaolinite is an important alteration mineral that fills cavities, replaces the feldspar grains, and probably the early diagenetic minerals. The origin of kaolinite is due to the combined effects of decomposition of organic matter and incursion of meteoric freshwater during late-stage telogenesis which generated the acidification of pore waters. Based on geochemical proxies, geochronological data and the geodynamic context the input of high volumes of pyroclastic material may thus be the result of explosive volcanism from an arc-subduction complex located to the west at these latitudes. The present work suggests that the composition of Na-rich pyroclastic ashes accumulated in hydrologically-open lake systems which conditioned the formation of sodium bentonites in continental settings.

This study documents a massive decline in phytoplankten biomass concurrent with the invasion of an exotic benthic bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), and demonstrates that the zebra mussel actually caused this decline. In the fall of 1992 the zebra mussel became established at high biomass in the Hudson River Estuary, and biomass of mussels remained high during 1993 and 1994. During these 2 yr, grazing pressure on phytoplankton was over 10-fold greater than it had been prior to the zebra mussel invasion. This increased grazing was associated with an 85% decline in phytoplankton biomass. Between 1987 and 1991 (pre-invasion), summertime chlorophyll averaged 30 mg/m(3); during 1993 and 1994 summertime concentrations were <5 mg/m(3). Over this same period, light availability increased, phosphate concentrations doubled, some planktonic grazers declined, and average flow was not different from the pre-invasion period, Thus, changes in these other factors were not responsible for phytoplankton declines. We developed a mechanistic model that reproduces the spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton prior to the invasion of the zebra mussel (1987-1991). The model accurately predicts extreme declines in phytoplankton biomass after the invasion (1993-1994). The model demonstrates that zebra mussel grazing was sufficient to cause the observed phytoplankton decline. The model also allows us to test which features make the Hudson River sensitive to the impact of benthic grazers. The model suggests that the fate of lightscattering inorganic particles (turbidity) is a key feature determining the impact of benthic grazers in aquatic systems.					; Strayer, David/H-3788-2011; Raymond, Peter/C-4087-2009; Cole, Jonathan/G-4566-2011	Raymond, Peter/0000-0002-8564-7860; Strayer, David/0000-0002-6767-4486; Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131													0012-9658					MAR	1997	78	2					588	602		10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[0588:ZMIIAL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[0588:ZMIIAL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1997WN75400022

In previous work, phytoplankton regulation in freshwater lakes has been associated with many factors. Among these, the ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus (TN : TP) has been widely proposed as an index to identify whether phytoplankton are N- or P-limited. From another point of view, it has been suggested that planktivorous fish can be used to control phytoplankton. 2. Large-scale investigations of phytoplankton biomass [measured as chlorophyll a, (chl-a)] were carried out in 45 mid-lower Yangtze shallow lakes to test hypotheses concerning nutrient limitation (assessed with TN : TP ratios) and phytoplankton control by planktivorous fish. 3. Regression analyses indicated that TP was the primary regulating factor and TN the second regulating factor for both annual and summer phytoplankton chl-a. In separate nutrient-chl-a regression analyses for lakes of different TN : TP ratios, TP was also superior to TN in predicting chl-a at all particular TN : TP ranges and over the entire TN : TP spectrum. Further analyses found that chl-a : TP was not influenced by TN : TP, while chl-a : TN was positively and highly correlated to TP : TN. 4. Based on these results, and others in the literature, we argue that the TN : TP ratio is inappropriate as an index to identify limiting nutrients. It is almost impossible to specify a 'cut-off' TN : TP ratio to identify a limiting nutrient for a multi-species community because optimal N : P ratios vary greatly among phytoplankton species. 5. Lakes with yields of planktivorous fish (silver and bighead carp, the species native to China) > 100 kg ha(-1) had significantly higher chl-a and lower Secchi depth than those with yields < 100 kg ha(-1). TP-chl-a and TP-Secchi depth relationships are not significantly different between lakes with yields > 100 kg ha(-1) or < 100 kg ha(-1). These results indicate that the fish failed to decrease chl-a yield or enhance Z(SD). Therefore, silver carp and bighead carp are not recommended as a biotic agent for phytoplankton control in lake management if the goal is to control the entire phytoplankton and to enhance water quality.

The reproductive strategy should induce polygyny, but Isaza males never accept additional females in one breeding cycle. Sampling data of broods indicated that the egg mass areas were much smaller than the nest sizes, suggesting that nest size is not the limiting factor in obtaining further eggs from additional females. The brood size greatly decreased as the duration of care progressed. Few individuals including caring males ate eggs, and heterospecific egg predators were rarely observed. Sixty percent of egg masses at the middle stages of egg development were infected with aquatic fungi, some being covered with a fungus mat that drastically reduced survivorship. Infected egg masses contained more eggs than non-infected ones at the same stage, indicating that large egg masses are prone to be frequently destroyed by fungi. It is likely that the activity of parental males is lowered during the long care periods at low water temperature in early spring. Such lowered activity of caring males might be responsible for infections in large broods that would have needed more care. We propose the hypothesis that male rejection of additional females may be related to optimal brood size, which will be less susceptible to fungus infection and produce more hatching young than otherwise. This hypothesis will explain not only male avoidance of additional females but also some unique reproductive behaviors of this fish such as some females' spawning of a portion of of the mature eggs in one nest.					; Awata, Satoshi/GQR-0411-2022	Takeyama, Tomohiro/0000-0001-5983-3611; Awata, Satoshi/0000-0003-3254-7943													0289-0771	1439-5444					2004	22	2					153	159		10.1007/s10164-004-0116-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-004-0116-4													WOS:000223043600004

The WFD includes a specific category for water bodies which are hydromorphologically substantially altered. Hydro power is one of the most important pressures in many water courses especially in Fennoscandia and in some parts of Austria and Scotland. In the joint study which was carried out together with Austria, Finland, Norway, Scotland and Sweden the need and opportunities for common approaches in regulated and constructed water courses were studied. In the project, the role of the hydro power and water level fluctuation in some regulated lakes were analysed as well as the opportunities to improve regulation policies according to current legislation. In addition, the procedures and criteria for provisional identification of heavily modified water bodies were compared and discussed during the project. The use of same indicators proved to be problematic as there are big differences in availability of required data and lake specific hydro-morphological conditions vary a lot in different countries. However, 3 m regulation amplitude or winter draw-down was used as a provisional identification criterion in Finland, Norway and Sweden. This was the consequence of the information exchange and frequent discussions. The provisional designation is only one phase in the designation process and subsequent phases finally determine the number of heavily modified water bodies and required mitigation measures. Therefore, it is evident that the need for harmonization increases in the whole EU-level in the future.

At present, the lake water has a Mg/Ca ratio > 40 and carbonates precipitated in the lake in the summer are mainly monohydrocalcites. However, X-ray diffraction analysis or core sediments suggests that several carbonate phases, including aragonite and even possibly dolomite, may have precipitated in the past. During the period (before 1620 AD) when there was aragonite precipitation, the Sr/Ca ratios of ostracod shells were at a minimum and showed little variation. When there was no aragonite precipitation (after 1620 AD), the Sr/Ca ratios of ostracods may have reflected salinity changes. The generally low Mg/Ca ratios during most of the past 850 yr may have resulted from decreased Mg partitioning in high-Mg/Ca host water as ostracods physiologically exclude excess Mg. Therefore, the Mg/Ca of ostracods cannot be used as a salinity proxy. The short-lived Mg/Ca maxima after 1300 AD correspond to decreased Sr/Ca and oxygen isotopes, indicating brier periods of freshwater input. The peaks of Mg/Ca ratios showed a similar variation with temperature change during the past 700 yr, indicating possible temperature dependence during times when the Mg/Ca ratio of the water was reduced. Water chemistry, temperature and mineralogical processes may have all affected the trace-element ratios of ostracods. Combined Sr/Ca ratios, carbonate mineralogy and oxygen isotopes allowed the lake's salinity to be reconstructed during the past similar to 850yr. In enclosed lakes in hyper-arid regions, especially in high-Mg/Ca waters, the trace-element chemistry of ostracod shells should be treated with care and the complex controls on trace-element should be examined before paleosalinity or paleotemperature reconstruction is attempted.

DIRECTIONAL-DERIVATIVES-BASED COMPUTATIONAL FILTERS APPLIED TO GEOMAGNETIC DATA AT LAKE CUITZEO, MEXICO	GEOFISICA INTERNACIONAL												For the development of a geothermal field, the understanding of fracture distribution, hydrology and tectonic evolution of the site through structural characterization of the natural system is a prerequisite to the drilling of exploratory wells. In order to image the underground shape of approximately planar, relatively permeable, geologic features (fractured rock-volumes around fault planes) and to detect hot rock volumes, geologic and geophysical surveying is carried out. A strong positive magnetic anomaly, nearly circular in 2D, characterizes the middle of Cuitzeo lake, Michoacan, Mexico, apparently not related with a volcanic structure on the surface. It may instead be associated to the geothermal system in the area which yields at present hot springs at the southern shore of the lake, at boiling temperatures. In this study, we conducted a ground magnetic survey within and around Lake Cuitzeo with the aim of characterizing this anomaly, following one-kilometer-spaced survey-lines and covering an area of approximately 100 km2. To enhance interpretability, we applied computational filters based on directional derivatives (vertical and horizontal) to our reduced-to-pole magnetic-field raw data - illuminating underground faults and other permeable pathways for fluids and delineating contacts between differently magnetized rocks, through maxima and minima on maps. While most filters used were able to define the basic configuration of the system, we found that computational filters working with ratios of derivatives (vertical and horizontal) were able to better account for the depth of a magnetic source. Also, faults were more clearly imaged on maps.

We compared blood lead concentrations in samples from bald eagles ranging in age from 0.5- to 1.5-yr-old at Galloway Bay, Saskatchewan, Canada (n = 97) during October-November. 1992-95 and Hauser Lake, Montana, USA (n = 81) during October-December, 1990-94, within the Great Plains region of North America. Abundant prey are available in the form of hunter-injured waterfowl in Saskatchewan and spawning salmon in Montana; both areas attract large numbers of mid-continent bald eagles during fall migration. Blood lead concentrations suggestive of recent lead exposure (>0.201 mu g/ml) were found in 32% and 8% of eagles at Hauser Lake and Galloway Bay, respectively, when samples from each study area were analyzed independently at two laboratories. To determine if this difference was an artifact of interlaboratory variation, we determined a correction factor by reanalyzing 14 Saskatchewan blood samples at each laboratory and predicted blood lead concentrations from Hauser Lake had the samples been analyzed at the Canadian laboratory. Adjusted blood lead concentrations of samples from Hauser Lake indicated that 21% of eagles were recently exposed to lead, a proportion not significantly different from the proportion of the same exposure category at Galloway Bay. Our data do not support the supposition that a large proportion of bald eagles feeding on waterfowl in areas of high hunting pressure will be exposed to lead via consumption of lead shotshell pellets in waterfowl.																			0090-3558	1943-3700				OCT	1998	34	4					704	714		10.7589/0090-3558-34.4.704	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-34.4.704								9813839					WOS:000076899000004

Use of cover habitat by bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, and lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, in a laboratory environment	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Lacustrine-adfluvial bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, migrate from spawning and rearing streams to lacustrine environments as early as age 0. Within lacustrine environments, cover habitat provides refuge from potential predators and is a resource that is competed for if limiting. Competitive interactions between bull trout and other species could result in bull trout being displaced from cover habitat, and bull trout may lack evolutionary adaptations to compete with introduced species, such as lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush. A laboratory experiment was performed to examine habitat use and interactions for cover by juvenile (i.e., < 80 mm total length) bull trout and lake trout. Differences were observed between bull trout and lake trout in the proportion of time using cover (F (1,22.6) = 20.08, P < 0.001) and bottom (F (1,23.7) = 37.01, P < 0.001) habitat, with bull trout using cover and bottom habitats more than lake trout. Habitat selection ratios indicated that bull trout avoided water column habitat in the presence of lake trout and that lake trout avoided bottom habitat. Intraspecific and interspecific agonistic interactions were infrequent, but approximately 10 times greater for intraspecific interactions between lake trout. Results from this study provide little evidence that juvenile bull trout and lake trout compete for cover, and that species-specific differences in habitat use and selection likely result in habitat partitioning between these species.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	2011	90	4					367	378		10.1007/s10641-010-9747-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-010-9747-1													WOS:000288512600004
J	Zhang, HC; Ma, YZ; Wünnemann, B; Pachur, HJ				Zhang, HC; Ma, YZ; Wünnemann, B; Pachur, HJ			A Holocene climatic record from arid northwestern China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The history of climatic changes during the interval 8500-3000 cal. yr B.P. has been reconstructed from stratigraphical and chronological studies and the results of Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC), element composition, pollen, and stable isotope analyses of a section along the Hongshui River, in the southern Tengger Desert, NW China. The record suggests that from 8450 (bottom of the studied section) to 7500 yr B.P., the climate was characterized by instability. From 7500 to 5070 yr B.P., the climatic conditions improved and can be divided into two parts: a warm-humid sped between 7290 and 6380 yr B.P., during which the average temperature was 3-4 degrees C higher than that of today, and a warm-dry spell lasting from 5950 to 5720 yr B.P. The climate deteriorated between 6380 and 5950 yr B.P. From 5720 to 5070 yr B.P., the temperature decreased, but humidity increased. An abrupt temperature drop occurred between 5340 and 5290 yr B.P. that indicated the decline of the warmer and humid Mid-Holocene climate. From 5070 yr B.P. onward, the climate oscillated significantly and there were three large temperature decreases coinciding with high mountain glacier advances between 5070-4670 yr B.P., 4300-3740 yr B.P. and 3410-3230 yr B.P. (top of the section), respectively. The climatic fluctuations recorded in the southern Tengger Desert appear in-phase with climatic changes recognized in the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that the period between 7290 and 6380 yr B.P. was the most warm-humid spell. One extremely dry event occurred at ca. 3000 yr B.P., and subsequently the fluvial-lacustrine depositional process terminated and wind action prevailed in the area; both of these features can be attributed to the rapid strengthening and weakening of the summer monsoon circulation, which are closely connected with global changes.

In summer, Microcystis formed a high percentage of the total phytoplankton in the water column, but a low percentage in sedimentation traps. The reverse was found during September and October, with a high percentage in the sedimentation traps, but a low percentage in the water column. The decrease in the numbers of Microcystis colonies coincided with a decrease in water temperature. In experiments with a strain of Microcystis, isolated from Lake Nieuwe Meer, the percentage of total colonies that were sinking increased in a few days to 100% after a shift from 20 degrees C to 15.3, 13.0 or 10.5 degrees C. The gas-vesicle volume in the cells remained constant during the incubations. Sinking of the colonies resulted from an increased glycogen content. Calculation of carbon (C) flows during the first 2 days of the incubation at reduced temperature showed that the glycogen accumulation was the result of a much lower rate of protein synthesis during the light period at the lower temperatures. Although the photosynthetic rate itself decreased at reduced temperature, it resulted in more fixed CO2 being stored as glucose. Because the respiratory rate also decreased (with an almost similar decrease to that of photosynthesis), glycogen accumulated at lower temperatures. It was calculated that after an incubation period of similar to 1 week at reduced temperature, the rate of photosynthesis had decreased by 10.1% of the value at 20 degrees C per 1 degrees C, while the rate of respiration had decreased only 1.8%. It is proposed that there is a feedback mechanism in which an increasing concentration of glycogen inhibits photosynthesis and stimulates respiration.

J	Saadoun, IMK; Schrader, KK; Blevins, WT				Saadoun, IMK; Schrader, KK; Blevins, WT			Environmental and nutritional factors affecting geosmin synthesis by Anabaena sp.	WATER RESEARCH												A cyanobacterium isolated from a source-water reservoir during a spring odor and taste episode and identified as Anabaena sp. consistently produced geosmin during laboratory culture on modified BG-11 liquid medium. Maximal geosmin/biomass occurred at 20 degreesC and a light intensity of 17 muE/m(2)/s; geosmin/chl a values directly correlated with increasing light intensity (r(2) = 0.95, P<0.01). It was concluded that at 20<degrees>C, increasing light intensity favors less chl a synthesis and higher geosmin synthesis; at 17 muE/m(2)/s, increasing temperature stimulates chl a production (to 25 degreesC) while repressing geosmin synthesis (above 20 degreesC). Nutritional factors promoting biomass, chl a, and geosmin synthesis by Anabaena sp. were also investigated. For cultures grown at 17 muE/m(2)/s and 20 degreesC for 20 days, both ammonium-N and nitrate-N generally enhanced the growth of Anabaena sp. Nitrate-N promoted more chl a production (r(2) = 0.99) than ammonium-N. Geosmin synthesis was directly correlated with ammonium-N concentrations (r(2) = 0.89), with low nitrate-N (123.5 mug/l) favoring maximal geosmin production (2.8 mug/l). Increasing nitrate-N concentrations promoted a three-fold increase in chin content with geosmin synthesis decreased by two-fold. Geosmin/mg biomass was directly related to ammonium-N concentration; high nitrate-N levels suppressed geosmin production. No geosmin was detected at or below 118 mug phosphate phosphorus/l. Geosmin, dry weight biomass, and chl a production were correlated with increasing phosphorus (P) concentration (r(2) = 0.76, 0.96 and 0.98, respectively). No geosmin was detected when copper was present in growth media at or above 6.92 mug Cu2+ /1 (CuSO4. 5H(2)O). Dry weight biomass and chl a production were negatively correlated with Cu2+ ion concentrations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	VANHUET, HJWJ				VANHUET, HJWJ			PHOSPHORUS LOADS FROM PEATY POLDERS IN THE SW FRISIAN LAKE DISTRICT, THE NETHERLANDS	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The purpose of this study was to quantify discharges and P-loads from peaty polders (total surface area 11560 ha) surrounding lakes in south-western Friesland, and to examine whether processes inside the polders contribute to the P-loads to the lakes. A detailed study in the Echtener Veenpolder (2850 ha), the largest polder in the study area, showed annual gross P-loads of 1.3 to 1.83 kg P ha-1 polder area and net P-loads of 0.63 to 1.48 kg P ha-1. Processes inside this polder, such as leaching, surface runoff, resuspension, spreading manure and fertilizers, can result in high total P concentrations (TP) in discharged polder water (up to 0.9 mg L-1) and therefore contribute to the P-load from the polder to lake Tjeukemeer. During 1984-1987 the averaged TP concentrations in polder water were higher than in lake Tjeukemeer water: 0.37 mg L-1 and 0.28 mg L-1, respectively. The annual gross P-loads from 11 other polders ranged from 1.01 to 4.13 kg P ha-1 polder area, while TP concentrations reached values up to 3.0 mg L-1. The P-loads from five polders to lake Tjeukemeer were high compared with the loads to the other lakes in the district. Particularly, during the winter period (October-April) P-loads were highest: up to 3.13 kg P ha-1. This paper shows that hydrological measures and the reduction of the concentrations are important to combat the eutrophication problem in the lakes. However, for an optimally integrated water management of the polders, further research is needed to develop, for example, dynamical water and P balances in order to gain a better insight into the role of agriculture.																			0049-6979					FEB	1991	55	3-4					321	335		10.1007/BF00211197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00211197													WOS:A1991FZ93900005

However, owing to occurrence of sedimentary hiatuses within aeolian deposits in the deserts, we lack clear knowledge of the history of Holocene aeolian activity and the interaction between aeolian processes and their potential drivers. In this study, we extracted an environmentally sensitive grain-size component from the sediments of a closed interdune lake in the hinterland of the Tengger Desert. Our methodology included the application of End Member Analysis (EMA) of different modern sediment types from catchment to regional scales. We reconstructed aeolian activity over the past 13 cal ka BP and quantified the contributions of environmental factors. The results indicated that the EM 2 fraction of the interdune lake sediments is mainly transported by local winds and reflects changes in the intensity of aeolian activity. Based on EM 2 the strongest aeolian activity occurred during 13.0-7.0 cal ka BP, especially during 8.0-7.0 cal ka BP, and the weakest activity occurred during 7.0-3.5 cal ka BP. Aeolian activity increased after 3.5 cal ka BP, but with a gradually weakening trend. The occurrence of the weakest aeolian activity in the Tengger Desert during the Middle Holocene differs from that on the Asian Summer Monsoonal Boundary and in the area influenced by the Westerlies-dominated climate regime. Thus, there was a clearly defined spatio-temporal differentiation of Holocene aeolian activity across the deserts and dune fields of northern China. Quantitative analysis of the contributions of the potential drivers indicated that wind activity forced by different atmospheric circulation systems, rather than changes in vegetation cover, were the most important driver of regional aeolian activity, although their relative effects varied during the Holocene.

Salinity induced regime shift in shallow brackish lagoons	ECOSYSTEMS												In brackish lagoons, Daphnia is replaced by calanoid copepods (Eurytemora affinis, Acartia spp.) and rotifers when a certain threshold (depending on, for instance, fish density) is reached. We hypothesize that loss of Daphnia induces a regime shift from clear to turbid at high nutrient concentrations. We conducted a factorial designed enclosure experiment with contrasting salinities (0-16 parts per thousand), low fish predation (one three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, m(-2)) and three levels of nutrient loading in a shallow brackish lagoon. A change point analysis suggests a strong regime shift from a clear to a turbid state at 6-8 parts per thousand salinity at low and high loading, but not for the control. From the low to the high salt regime, chlorophyll alpha (Chla), Chla:total phosphorus (TP) and Chla:total nitrogen (TN) ratios shifted highly significantly for all nutrient treatments, and the bacterioplankton production followed the changes in Chla. These changes occurred parallel with a shift from cladoceran and cyclopoid copepod to rotifer dominance. Monitoring data from 60 Danish brackish lagoons show increasing Chla with increasing TP and TN as well as interactive effects of TN and salinity, peaking at intermediate salinity. A relatively weak effect of salinity at low nutrient concentrations and the stronger effect at intermediate high salinity are in accordance with the experimental results. However, these data suggest a lower salinity threshold than in the experiment, which may be explained by a higher fish density. Our results have implications for the management of coastal lagoons both at present and in a future (predicted) warmer climate: (1) improved water quality can be obtained by reducing the nutrient loading or enhancing the freshwater input to a level triggering a shift to Daphnia dominance (typically < 2 parts per thousand), (2) fish manipulation is probably not a useful tool for brackish lagoons, unless the salinity is below the threshold for a potential shift to a clear Daphnia dominated state, and (3) more abrupt changes will expectedly occur in low-saline coastal lagoons at increasing salinity during summer in a future warmer climate.

J	Lal, R				Lal, R			Soil compaction and tillage effects on soil physical properties of a mollic ochraqualf in northwest Ohio	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE												Soil compaction affects crop yields through alterations of soil physical properties and processes. Effects of 3 tillage methods and 3 compaction treatments on the physical properties of a clayey soil were investigated in the lakebed region of northwestern Ohio. Tillage treatments included no-till (NT), chisel plowing (CP), and moldboard plowing (MP). Compaction treatments were imposed for 3 consecutive years followed by 4 years without compaction. Compaction treatments involved control, 10 Mg, and 20 Mg axle load on single axis. Effects of tillage las main plots) and axle load (as sub-plots) treatments were evaluated for 2 crop rotations: a 3-year rotation involving corn (Zea mays)-soybean (Glycine max)-oats (Avena sativa) and a 2-year rotation involving corn-soybean. These experiments were initiated in fall 1987, and measurements of soil physical properties were made in 1992 and 1993. Neither tillage nor compaction treatments had a significant effect on soil bulk density (rho(b)), and mean rho(b) measured in 1993 was 1.34 Mg m(-3) for 0 to 10 cm depth and 1.39 Mg m(-3) for 10 to 20 cm depth. Although not significantly different, trends in rho(b) were NT > MP > CP for 0 to 10 cm depth and NT > CP > MP for 10 to 20 cm depth. The data on saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S) were highly variable and treatments had no effect. Moisture retention characteristics differed significantly among depths but not among treatments. The data highlight the need for development of suitable indices for or to assess management-induced differences in physical properties of clayey soils characterized by high swell-shrink capacity.

J	Eilers, JM; Kann, J; Cornett, J; Moser, K; St Amand, A				Eilers, JM; Kann, J; Cornett, J; Moser, K; St Amand, A			Paleolimnological evidence of change in a shallow, hypereutrophic lake: Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Sediment cores were collected from Upper Klamath Lake in October, 1998 and analyzed for Pb-210, C-14, N-15, N, P, C, Ti, Al, diatoms, Pediastrum, and cyanobacterial akinetes. These results were used to reconstruct changes in water quality in Upper Klamath Lake over the last 150 years. The results showed that there was substantial mixing of the upper 10 cm of sediment, representing the previous 20 to 30 years. However, below that, Pb-210 activity declined monotonically, allowing reasonable dating for the period from about 1850 to 1970. The sediment accumulation rates (SAR) showed a substantial increase in the 20th century. The increase in SAR corresponded with increases in erosional input from the watershed as represented by the increases in sediment concentrations of Ti and Al. The upper 20 cm of sediment, representing the last 150 years, also showed increases in C, N, P, and N-15. The increases in nutrient concentrations may be affected to various degrees by diagenetic reactions within the sediments, although the changes in concentrations also were marked by changes in the N: P ratio and in a qualitative change in the source of N as reflected in increasing delta(15)N. The diatoms showed modest changes in the 20th century, with increases in Asterionella formosa, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, and S. parvus. Pediastrum, a green alga, was well-preserved in the sediments and exhibited a sharp decline in relative abundance in the upper sediments. Total cyanobacteria, as represented by preserved akinetes, exhibited only minor changes in the last 1000 years. However, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, a taxon which was formerly not present in the lake 150 years ago, but that now dominates the summer phytoplankton, has shown major increases over the past 100 years. The changes in sediment composition are consistent with activities including timber harvest, drainage of wetlands, and agricultural activities associated with livestock grazing, irrigated cropland, and hydrologic modifications.

Tripton, trophic state metrics, and near-shore versus pelagic zone responses to external loads in Cayuga Lake, New York, U.S.A.	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												An analysis of limnological and input monitoring data for Cayuga Lake, New York, U. S. A., is presented that addresses differences in trophic state metrics and turbidity between pelagic waters and a shallow (< 6 m) nearshore area (shelf) that receives multiple inputs. The effects of tripton (inanimate particles) on the observed patterns, and the contrasting responses of the shelf to local inputs of tripton versus phosphorus (P), are demonstrated. The analysis is based on a combination of long-term monitoring and shorter-term studies, including: (1) 10 to 20 years of concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl), total P (TP), and other forms of P; (2) 10 years of Secchi disc (SD) and surrogates of the light scattering coefficient, including turbidity (T-n) and the beam attenuation coefficient at 660 nm [c(660)]; (3) loading estimates of T-n and forms of P in point sources and tributaries to the shelf (4 to 10 y) and; (4) longitudinal patterns of thermal stratification, fluorometric Chl, and c(660) from a lake-wide 40 site transect; and (5) 10 years of hourly measurements of near-surface temperature on the shelf. The generally higher TP, particulate P, c(660), and T-n, and lower SD on the shelf compared to pelagic waters, particularly after runoff events, is shown to reflect higher tripton levels in the near-shore area. Tripton was also an important regulator of these attributes in pelagic waters. The effects of tripton compromise TP and SD as trophic state metrics in this lake. The light scattering and clarity impacts of tripton are demonstrated to be primarily attributable to clay mineral particles in the 1-10 mu m size range. Despite the P loads received from local sources, summer average Chl levels on the shelf were not significantly higher than in bounding pelagic waters because the flushing rate associated with mixing processes, particularly from seiche activity, was high compared to phytoplankton growth rates.					; Cowen, Edwin/LXA-2272-2024; Schweitzer, Seth/AAL-7306-2021	Prestigiacomo, Anthony/0000-0002-9792-8600; Gelda, Rakesh/0000-0002-4741-5989; Schweitzer, Seth/0000-0002-9702-4337; Cowen, Edwin/0000-0002-6724-1592; Peng, Feng/0000-0002-3616-1063													1863-9135					SEP	2010	178	1					1	15		10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0178-0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0178-0001													WOS:000285042200001

This simple food chain makes caribou a good species for monitoring changes in arctic terrestrial ecosystem contamination. The defined ranges of herds across the Northwest Territories (NWT) also enables examination of spatial trends in contaminant exposure. Caribou were collected from five locations in the first half of a study designed to examine levels of a broad spectrum of organochlorine, heavy metal, and radionuclide contaminants. A wide range of contaminants were detected, with most compounds found at relatively low levels. In general, organochlorine residues were significantly lower in caribou from the mainland Bathurst and Qamanirjuaq (Arviat) and the Southampton Island herds than in caribou from Cape Dorset and Lake Harbour on southern Baffin Island. Moderate levels of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) were detected at all five study sites. HCB residues ranged from a lipid corrected mean of 32.83 ng/g in fat of Bathurst caribou to 129.41 ng/g in Lake Harbour animals. Alpha-HCH levels ranged from 8.11 ng/g in Bathurst animals to 37.9 ng/g in Cape Dorset caribou. Total polychlorinated biphenyl (Sigma PCB) residues ranged from 6.24 ng/g in fat of Arviat caribou to 31.68 ng/g in Cape Dorset animals. Congeners 153 and 138 were the most dominant of the 43 congeners tested. Metal levels were also relatively low with the exception of cadmium, which had community means of 9.68-33.87 mu g/g in kidney tissue and 1.96-4.39 mu g/g in liver tissue. Moderate levels of cesium-137 were detected, with community means of 33.2-184.1 Bq/kg in muscle tissue. Long-range atmospheric transport appears to be the primary source of the contaminants detected in this study.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 15	1995	160-61						307	321		10.1016/0048-9697(95)04365-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(95)04365-8								7892575					WOS:A1995QD14300028

Landscape structure and local habitat characteristics as correlates of Glaucomys sabrinus and Tamiasciurus hudsonicus occurrence	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Understanding the effects of forest fragmentation on tree-dwelling sciurids is of particular interest given their arboreal habits and the extent of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation inflicted upon North American forest ecosystems over the past 2 centuries. In this study we investigate occurrences of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in forest fragments in southern Ontario, Canada, as a function of local habitat and landscape features. During the summer of 2006 we measured occurrence via livetrapping in 24 forest fragments ranging in size from 4 to 2,881 ha, each adjacent to or surrounded by active row-crop agriculture. In addition to patch area and measurements of local habitat features, we calculated 4 landscape metrics in variously sized circular landscape windows: number of patches, forest cover, mean proximity index, and distance to the nearest neighboring patches. Occurrence of G. sabrinus was positively correlated with patch area (P = 0.016) but not with other features, whereas occurrence of T. hudsonicus was positively associated with basal area of coniferous trees (P = 0.047) but not with other habitat or landscape features. Populations of T. hudsonicus did not show fragmentation effects, likely due to high vagility and high population growth potential. Northern flying squirrels were not found in patches < 29 ha in size and, as estimated from a receiver operating characteristic curve, the ideal minimum fragment size for patch occupancy was 48.25 ha. Our data support conclusions that diverse management schemes may be required to preserve relatively large contiguous tracts of forest for G. sabrinus and appropriate conifer structure for T. hudsonicus in a way that will facilitate the persistence of these 2 species in deciduous Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest ecosystems.

Birka had a strong defence: town rampart, hillfort and a water palisade. Studies of lithology, and micro- and macroremains in a sedimentary sequence accumulated offshore from Birka, outside the water palisade, revealed a stratigraphically distinct refuse stratum, referred to as the Birka Layer. We argue that the bulk material of the Birka Layer emanates from human activities in the town, e.g., latrine cleanings, cuttings of shore vegetation, cleaning of ditches and storage areas, and domestic animal dung. Organic remains from vegetation and animals, deposited during activities on the ice offshore from the town, e.g.. winter markets, may also have contributed to the composition. The material constituting the Birka Layer started to accumulate after the construction of the protecting water palisade. In the Birka Layer and the underlying clay gyttja, there seems to be a succession of five activity phases recorded during the Birka period, After the initial establishment of the town, an expansion took place, followed by a retrogression. The most intense phase with culminating activities is registered prior to abandonment of the site, which approximately coincides with the onset of the extended final isolation process of Lake Malaren (AD 1000-1300). The sailing routes to Birka from the south and east became too shallow and were finally cut off by the emerging thresholds. After the abandonment of Birka. the town area was utilized for cultivation and cattle-breeding.																			0959-6836	1477-0911					2002	12	4					445	458		10.1191/0959683602hl558rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683602hl558rp													WOS:000176583900006
J	FONTANIER, CE				FONTANIER, CE			THE DISTRIBUTION OF CORBICULA (BIVALVIA, CORBICULIDAE) IN THE BRAZOS RIVER SYSTEM, TEXAS, 25 AUGUST-12 NOVEMBER 1980	TEXAS JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Corbicula was probably introduced into the Brazos River system in 1972-1973 and it is now the most common bivalve wherever it is found. Densities as high as 2500-3500 clams/m2 are reported. It was found at 34 of 66 sites. Those sites not containing Corbicula include: Lake Kirby (Taylor Co.), Buffalo Springs Lake (Lubbock Co.), the Navasota River and all of its lakes (except perhaps near its confluence with the Brazos River), Salt Fork and Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River, White River (exclusive of White River Lake), all intermittent or shallow feeder streams and the area below Road 1462 near Rosharon (Fort Bend Brazoria counties) to the Gulf of Mexico. At least 2 forms of Corbicula are reported: the generally northern type has white nacre with purple highlights, a yellow or brown/black exterior and an angular posterior shell shape in the adult; the southern type has deep purple nacre and exterior, is smaller in size, and generally has a thinner, more equilateral shell. Some Corbicula shells in the middle and southern areas have anterior-posterior brown pigment markings. Both forms may be found together in some southern locales but the purple form becomes predominant further downstream. Southern river and stream shells of both types tended to be smaller than northern forms and may indicate a more recent introduction, genetic variation, or environmental stress. Hand collecting, net dredging and skin diving methods were used to collect the samples. Considering the short period of time that Corbicula is thought to have been in the Brazos River system, expansion of its range is probably not complete. Increased use of Lake Limestone may encourage its spread to the Navasota River.																			0040-4403						1982	34	1					5	15																WOS:A1982PB05900001
J	Sáez, A; Anadón, P; Herrero, MJ; Moscariello, A				Saez, Alberto; Anadon, Pere; Herrero, Maria J.; Moscariello, Andrea			Variable style of transition between Palaeogene fluvial fan and lacustrine systems, southern Pyrenean foreland, NE Spain	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Two Palaeogene fluvial fan systems linked to the south-Pyrenean margin are recognized in the eastern Ebro Basin: the Cardona-Suria and Solsona-Sanauja fans. These had radii of 40 and 35 km and were 800 and 600 km(2) in area respectively. During the Priabonian to the Middle Rupelian, the fluvial fans built into a hydrologically closed foreland basin, and shallow lacustrine systems persisted in the basin centre. In the studied area, both fans are part of the same upward-coarsening megasequence (up to 800 m thick), driven by hinterland drainage expansion and foreland propagation of Pyrenean thrusts. Fourteen sedimentary facies have been grouped into seven facies associations corresponding to medial fluvial fan, channelized terminal lobe, non-channelized terminal lobe, mudflat, deltaic, evaporitic playa-lake and carbonate-rich, shallow lacustrine environments. Lateral correlations define two styles of alluvial-lacustrine transition. During low lake-level stages, terminal lobes developed, whereas during lake highstands, fluvial-dominated deltas and interdistributary bays were formed. Terminal lobe deposits are characterized by extensive (100-600 m wide) sheet-like fine sandstone beds formed by sub-aqueous, quasi-steady, hyperpycnal turbidity currents. Sedimentary structures and trace fossils indicate rapid desiccation and sub-aerial exposure of the lobe deposits. These deposits are arranged in coarsening-fining sequences (metres to tens of metres in thickness) controlled by a combination of tectonics, climatic oscillations and autocyclic sedimentary processes. The presence of anomalously deeply incised distributary channels associated with distal terminal lobe or mudflat deposits indicates rapid lake-level falls. Deltaic deposits form progradational coarsening-upward sequences (several metres thick) characterized by channel and friction-dominated mouth-bar facies overlying white-grey offshore lacustrine facies. Deltaic bar deposits are less extensive (50-300 m wide) than the terminal lobes and were also deposited by hyperpycnal currents, although they lack evidence of emergence. Sandy deltaic deposits accumulated locally at the mouths of main feeder distal fan streams and were separated by muddy interdistributary bays; whereas the terminal lobe sheets expand from a series of mid-fan intersection points and coalesced to form a more continuous sandy fan fringe.

J	Sorokin, DY; Lysenko, AM; Mityushina, LL				Sorokin, DY; Lysenko, AM; Mityushina, LL			Isolation and characterization of alkaliphilic chemoorganoheterotrophic bacteria oxidizing reduced inorganic sulfur compounds to tetrathionate	MICROBIOLOGY												The inoculation of 14 samples from alkaline environments - soda soils, lakes, and springs - in medium with acetate yielded 7 enrichment cultures of bacteria capable of oxidizing thiosulfate at pH values above 10.0. Eight strains of chemoorganoheterotrophic thiosulfate-oxidizing bacteria were isolated in pure culture. All strains are obligately alkaliphilic gram-negative eubacteria able to grow in the pH range of 7.5-10.5 with an optimum around 9.5. The strains oxidize sulfide, elemental sulfur, and thiosulfate to tetrathionate. Despite the low pH optimum for thiosulfate oxidation, these bacteria possess considerable thiosulfate-oxidizing activity under alkaline conditions. The optimum for sulfide oxidation is in the alkaline range of pH. Like most neutrophilic heterotrophic bacteria oxidizing thiosulfate to tetrathionate, alkaliphilic strains are able to realize the reverse reaction of tetrathionate reduction to thiosulfate under anaerobic conditions in the presence of an organic electron donor. All the heterotrophic isolates are capable of denitrification. High concentrations of nitrite reductase of the cytochrome cd(1) type were found in their cells grown anaerobically with nitrates or nitrites. Thiosulfate was not oxidized under the conditions of denitrification with any of the accepters tested (nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide). However, strain AG 4, the most active denitrifier, was found to be capable of anaerobic sulfide oxidation in the presence of nitrate and nitrite, but not with nitrous oxide. Polysulfide and elemental sulfur were the intermediate products of sulfide oxidation. The isolated strains comprise two groups of the generic level. A group of six motile strains belongs to the same genus (according to the results of DNA-DNA hybridization) and comprises two subgroups of the species level; by their formal characteristics, they are close to bacteria of the genus Deleya. Two nonmotile strains belong to the same species and are distinguished from the motile isolates at the generic level; they apparently represent a new taxon.																			0026-2617					MAY-JUN	1996	65	3					326	338																WOS:A1996UV38700013

We used line-transect distance sampling and Bayesian methods to estimate the abundance and spatial distribution of newly metamorphosed Western Toads (Anaxyrus boreas) in terrestrial habitat surrounding a montane lake in central Washington, USA. We completed 154 line-transect surveys from the commencement of metamorphosis (15 September 2009) to the date of first snow accumulation in fall (1 October 2009), and located 543 newly metamorphosed toads. After accounting for variable detection probability associated with the extent of barren habitats, estimates of total surface abundance ranged from a posterior median of 3,880 (95% credible intervals from 2,235 to 12,600) in the first week of sampling to 12,150 (5,543 to 51,670) during the second week of sampling. Numbers of newly metamorphosed toads dropped quickly with increasing distance from the lakeshore in a pattern that differed over the three weeks of the study and contradicted our original hypotheses. Though we hypothesized that the spatial distribution of toads would initially be concentrated near the lake shore and then spread outward from the lake over time, we observed the opposite. Ninety-five percent of individuals occurred within 20, 16, and 15 m of shore during weeks one, two, and three respectively, probably reflecting continued emergence of newly metamorphosed toads from the lake and mortality or burrow use of dispersed individuals. Numbers of toads were highest near the inlet stream of the lake. Distance sampling may provide a useful method for estimating the surface abundance of newly metamorphosed toads and relating their space use to landscape variables despite uncertain and variable probability of detection. We discuss means of improving the precision of estimates of total abundance.																			1931-7603					AUG	2011	6	2					175	190																WOS:000300381600002

Physical conditions and fish behavior were monitored in the Fish Springs Lagoon area, a site where the tilapia were particularly abundant. Water Po-2 and temperature fluctuated more or less in parallel in a diurnal cycle from less than 20 Torr and less than 25 degrees C at night to greater than 400 Torr and 38 degrees C during the day, whereas pH remained constant at approximately 9.8. Field laboratory tests demonstrated that routine Mo-2 (under normoxia) increased greatly from 27 degrees C to 36 degrees C (Q(10) = 6.2) but then stabilized at a very high level (similar to 34.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) up to the lethal temperature (similar to 42.5 degrees C), a pattern that was adaptive to the natural diurnal regime. The Po-2 threshold for survival during acute exposure (less than or equal to 1 h) was approximately 16 Torr. Mo-2 from water was well maintained down to a Po-2 of 60 Torr, below which it declined. Under such hypoxic conditions, the fish performed supplementary surface breathing when allowed access to air. Both the better oxygenated surface layer and air bubbles were inspired, resulting in significant uptake of O-2. The Po-2 threshold for surface breathing was 1.8-fold higher at 37.5 degrees C than at 31 degrees C. Surface breathing and voluntary entry of fish into air were observed in the field. The blood O-2 dissociation curve at 30 degrees-32 degrees C was hyperbolic, with a high affinity (P-50 = 6 Torr), low cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 1.18), and no Bohr effect over the extracellular pH range 8.2-8.6.

Employing machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM), stochastic models (e.g., CA-MARKOV), ERA5 reanalysis climate data, and the large-scale hydrological VIC model, we assessed these effects across multiple sub-basins. Our analysis revealed that a 2 degrees C rise in average minimum winter temperature over the past 50 years has reduced frost days by nearly 80 days, diminished mountain snow volume, and shifted precipitation from snow to a mix of snow, rain, and snowmelt. Consequently, peak discharge timing has advanced from May to March and April, amplifying flood intensity and frequency, with some sub-basins showing up to 30% higher peak flows. Furthermore, land-use change assessments indicated that expanding orchards and irrigated and rain-fed agricultural lands will significantly elevate future peak discharge, with differences exceeding 10 m(3)/s in sub-basins like Nazlochay and Barandozchay, driven by reduced infiltration and increased runoff rates. Modeling with these tools confirmed that climate and land-use changes synergistically alter flood dynamics, a pattern consistent with regional studies. These findings underscore the urgent need to integrate these factors into flood management strategies for this flood-prone region, offering a robust framework for sub-basin-scale hydrological planning.

Development of a Riverine Index Netting Protocol: Comparisons of Net Orientation, Height, Panel Order, and Line Diameter	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We developed a gillnetting protocol by sampling 17 nonwadeable rivers across northern Ontario over the course of four summers from 2005 to 2008. The rivers represented a range of habitats; however, all had a coolwater to warmwater fish community characterized by walleyes Sander vitreus, northern pike Esox lucius, white suckers Catostomus commersonii, yellow perch Perca flavescens, and smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu. During the study, three net designs were used. Each net had one to four configurations that varied in height, length, monofilament diameter, and sequence of the mesh sizes. We found that most fish (87%) were captured in the lower half of 1.8-m-high gill nets and that there was no difference in catch between gill nets with serial panels (i.e., sequentially increasing mesh sizes) and those with randomly organized panels. Net that were set perpendicular to shore or angled to shore caught approximately twice as many fish as nets that were set parallel to shore. Contrary to expectations, there were no differences in net durability and catch between thick- and thin-diameter monofilament nets. Based on the results of these experiments, we propose an improved net design that we call the large-mesh riverine index net for use in rivers; it is more versatile, reduces net drag, and fishes more effectively than the traditional gill nets that are used in lakes. The large-mesh riverine index net has eight panels (3.1 m long x 0.9 m high) and totals 24.8 m in length. Panel stretch measures (and the random order used) for this design are 127, 76, 178, 25, 102, 203, 51, and 152 mm. The nets are set perpendicular to shore in rivers from July 1 to October 1 and should be fished in areas where water velocity is less than 0.1 m/s.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2011	31	1					23	31	PII 934650617	10.1080/02755947.2011.557941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2011.557941													WOS:000288279800003

But there are two limitations in the development and application by the traditional system. Firstly, the temperature of surface water (river and lake) in winter is so low in cold districts that heat pump system runs in the poor heating performance and stability. Secondly, the flux of urban sewage in the trunk is often not enough to building's heating load. This paper develops a new technology or system in which plenty of freezing latent heat can be obtained, and above problems in the traditional non-clean water source heat pump system can be well solved. This non-clean water source heat pump system with freezing latent heat collection (WSHPSFLHE) will replace coal-fired boiler heating system for heating in the cold districts gradually since it breaks the bottleneck of the application in the traditional water source heat pump system. According to the application properties, partial Class I and partial Class V in surface water are defined on the basis of different water quality, and then the corresponding water treatment method and WSHPSFLHE with surface water are proposed. Likewise, the water treatment method and WSHPFLHE with urban sewage are also proposed. Then the forms and operating modes of the new system In cooling and heating periods are discussed respectively.																									2009							1604	1609																WOS:000270107401041
J	Bagge, AM; Valtonen, ET				Bagge, AM; Valtonen, ET			Development of monogenean communities on the gills of roach fry (Rutilus rutilus)	PARASITOLOGY												The formation and development of monogenean communities on the gills of roach fry was followed in 1992 from early June to October (size range 9 to 47 mm). Roach fry (n = 291) were sampled weekly from the small, humic River Rutajoki in central Finland. A further 209 roach fry were reared in a fish farm supplied by water from the river. Four Dactylogyrus species were found: D. nanus, D, crucifer, D. micracanthus and D. suecicus. Other species found on the gills were Gyrodactylus sp. and Paradiplozoon homoion. The first Dactylogyrus juvenile occurred on a 12 mm long fish fry in late June and the first adult (D. nanus) 1 week later in Tank 1. D. nanus was also the most common parasite in the river. Young fry had high numbers of Gyrodactylus sp. on the gills compared with adult roach in previous studies. Signs of site preference were found; D. nanus and D. micracanthus preferred the 2nd gill-arch and Dactylogyrus juveniles the outmost one. Abundances of monogenean infracommunities increased until the middle of August when, on average, 1.9 species and 3.7 worms per fry were noted and decreased then as the water temperatures fell. A lack of competition between species is suggested; for example, D. crucifer appeared on the gills at that time when abundance of D. nanus was at its highest. The roach fry hatched and reared in the fish farm revealed that larvae of the most common dactylogyrid species were able to disseminate and colonize over 120 m from the river to the farm, influence of change colonization events was shown by the appearance and development of Gyrodactylus sp. population on roach fry in only 1 of the 2 tanks at the farm.																			0031-1820	1469-8161				MAY	1999	118		5				479	487		10.1017/S0031182099004011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182099004011								10363281					WOS:000080559000006
J	Valerio, G; Pilotti, M				Valerio, Giulia; Pilotti, Marco			Contribution of Chemical Stratification to the Extent of Water Renewal in a Deep Lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Turnover events in deep lakes are crucial for water quality and trophic balance. If on one side there is wide consensus that climate change will strengthen the thermal stability of the epilimnion, on the other a smaller number of studies have investigated the stabilization operated by the chemical stratification, and the conditions under which it may occasionally fail. In this paper we investigate the role of thermal and trophic-induced stratification on the deep mixing of Lake Iseo, a pre-alpine lake that used to be monomictic in the past. The coupling of a site-specific density equation to 9 years of high-resolution temperature and wind data made it possible to compute the time series of the resistance to upwelling of deep waters and to quantify the role of the chemical stability. We show that the presence of calcium, bicarbonate and sulfate ions in the bottom layers, and the related increase in stability of about 103 Jm-2, has hindered the occurrence of a deep overturn, even in presence of a thermally uniform water column. A full upwelling was thus inhibited in 3 of the observed winters, when it would otherwise have occurred. On the other hand, whereas our computations show that a destabilizing effect of possible future stronger winds is unlikely, the progressive deep-water warming that followed the isolation of the monimolimnion has strongly decreased the lake's thermal stability, counteracting the chemical stratification and progressively increasing the probability of a future deep overturn.

Suspended particulate matter, biomass, total chlorophyll a, particulate organic carbon, C and N isotopic ratios, and lipid biomarkers were also determined to help characterizing the size-fractionated plankton and highlight the potential link with the content in AHs and PAHs in these size fractions. Sigma(28)AH concentrations ranged 18-489 ng L-1 for water, 3.9-72 mu g g(-1) dry weight (dw) for the size fraction 0.7-60 mu m, and 3.4-55 mu g g(-1) dw for the fractions 60-200, 200-500 and 500-1000 mu m. AH molecular profiles revealed that they were mainly of biogenic origin. Sigma(14)PAH concentrations were 0.9-16 ng L-1 for water, and Sigma(27)PAH concentrations were 53-220 ng g(-1) dw for the fraction 0.7-60 mu m and 35-255 ng g(-1) dw for the three higher fractions, phenanthrene being the most abundant compound in planktonic compartment. Two processes were evidenced concerning the PAH patterns, the bioreduction, i.e., the decrease in concentrations from the small size fractions (0.7-60 and 60-200 mu m) to the higher ones (200-500 mu m and 500-1000 mu m), and the biodilution, i.e., the decrease in concentrations in plankton at higher suspended matter or biomass, especially for the 0.7-60 and 60-200-mu m size fractions. We estimated the biological pump fluxes of Sigma(27)PAHs below 100-m depth in the Western Mediterranean Sea at 15 +/- 10 ng m(-2) day(-1), which is comparable to those previously reported in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean.

The Onyx River is located in Wright Valley (77-32 S; 161-34 E), one of a group of ancient river and glacier-carved landforms that comprise the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. The river is more than 30 km long and is the largest of the glacial meltwater streams that characterize this relatively ice-free region near the Ross Sea. The complete absence of rainfall in the region and the usually small contributions of glacially derived tributaries to the main channel make this a comparatively simple system for geochemical investigation. Moreover, the lack of human impacts, past or present, provides an increasingly rare window onto a pristine aquatic system. For all major ions and silica, we observe increasing concentrations with distance from Lake Brownworth down to the recording weir near Lake Vanda. Chemical weathering rates are unexpectedly high and may be related to the rapid dissolution of ancient carbonate deposits and to the severe physical weathering associated with the harsh Antarctic winter. Of the nutrients, nitrate and dissolved reactive phosphate appear to have quite different sources. Nitrate is enriched in waters near the Lower Wright Glacier and may ultimately be derived from stratospheric sources; while phosphate is likely to be the product of chemical weathering of valley rocks and soils. We confirm the work of earlier investigations regarding the importance of the Boulder Pavement as a nutrient sink. Dissolved Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Cd are present at nanomolar levels and, in all cases, the concentrations of these metals are lower than in average world river water. We hypothesize that metal uptake and exchange with particulate phases along the course of the river may serve as a buffer for the dissolved load. Concurrent study of these three solute classes points out significant differences in the mechanisms and sites of their removal from the Onyx River. Copyright (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wilson, J; Rocha, C				Wilson, Jean; Rocha, Carlos			A combined remote sensing and multi-tracer approach for localising and assessing groundwater-lake interactions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The combination of thermal imagery and geochemical tracing has been demonstrated as an affordable and effective technique to identify potential groundwater discharge sites in coastal areas on a regional scale. In this paper, a combined multi-tracer approach is evaluated in its applicability to lakes and verified as an appropriate and powerful means to localise and assess groundwater-lake interactions, demonstrated through a case study of Lough Mask in the west of Ireland. Surface water temperature patterns generated from Landsat 7 Thermal Infrared (TIR) images were used to locate groundwater inputs captured as anomalous cold plumes visibly emanating from shallow lake margins during summer months. Radon-222 was used to confirm the presence of groundwater and to detect localised seepage points or groundwater "hotspots". Conductivity was used as a secondary tracer in support of radon to identify areas of active groundwater inflow. Radon results show that groundwater enters the lake through carboniferous limestones adjacent to the north and east of the lake and no groundwater inflows were observed from the west characterised by Ordivician sandstones and mixed volcanics. The observed strong anti-correlation between mapped radon and satellite derived temperature values implies that decreases in surface water temperatures are associated with increases in radon activity and hence groundwater inputs to the lake. Moreover the spatial pattern of mapped temperature anomaly displays a positive correlation to the mapped radon and conductivity anomalies which further suggests that the tracers are inextricably linked and support a common groundwater source. The study demonstrates the suitability of a multi tracer approach as a comprehensive and cost-effective preliminary screening tool for groundwater-lake interactions with the potential for application elsewhere. This information is important and can be used in support of national water policy and legislation by helping to identify for example, lakes at risk of failure to comply with Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) water quality objectives particularly where mapped inputs are linked to groundwater bodies classified as less than good status as per the requirements of the Groundwater Directive (2006/118/EC). Evaluating the potential occurrence and understanding where groundwater discharge occurs is the first step towards more in-depth geochemical surveys that seek to clarify the role played by groundwater in lacustrine biogeochemical budgets.

Geochemistry of Mansar Lake sediments, Jammu, India: Implication for source-area weathering, provenance, and tectonic setting	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												The sediment geochemistry, including REE, of surface and core samples from Mansar Lake, along with mineralogical investigations, have been carried out in order to understand the provenance, source area weathering, hydrolic sorting and tectonic setting of the basin. The geochemical signatures preserved in these sediments have been exploited as proxies in order to delineate these different parameters. The major element log values (Fe2O3/K2O) vs (SiO2/Al2O3) and (Na2O/K2O) vs (SiO2/Al2O3) demarcate a lithology remarkably similar to that exposed in the catchment area. The chondrite normalized REE patterns of lake samples are similar to Post Archaean Australian Shale (PAAS) with LREE enrichment, a negative Eu anomaly and almost flat HREE pattern similar to a felsic and/or cratonic sedimentary source. However, the La-Th-Sc plot of samples fall in a mixed sedimentary domain, close to Upper Continental Crust (UCC) and PAAS, suggesting sedimentary source rocks for the Mansar detritus. It also indicates that these elements remained immobile during weathering and transportation. The mineralogical characteristic, REEs, and high field strength elements (HFSE), together with the high percentage of metamorphic rock fragments in the Siwalik sandstone, support a metamorphic source for lower Siwalik sediments. A very weak positive correlation between Zr and SiO2 poor negative correlation with Al2O3, negative correlation of (La/Yb)(N) and (Gd/Yb)(N) ratios with SiO2 and positive correlation with Al2O3, suggest that Zr does not dominantly control the REE distribution in Mansar sediments. The petrographic character and textural immaturity indicate a short distance transport for the detritus. The distribution of elements in core samples reflect fractionation. The higher Zr/Th and Zr/Yb ratios in coarse sediments and PAAS compared to finer grained detritus indicate sedimentary sorting. Plots of the geochemical data on tectonic discrimination diagrams suggest that the sediments derived from the lower Siwalik were originated within a cratonic interior and later deposited along a passive margin basinal setting. It therefore reveals lower Siwalik depositional history. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This means that the P system could be open to P sources not labelled by the tracer. We tested whether such sources supporting an open system could produce significant changes in phytoplankton biomass in two lakewater communities. Two fractions were concentrated from natural lakewaters ranging from 2 .times. 103 to 104 daltons (fraction I) and 104-105 daltons (fraction II). These were then reintroduced to the natural communities at three concentration levels. During the incubation that followed, we assessed the capacity of the added organic matter to deliver phosphorus to the P cycle by monitoring known keypoints: phosphatase activity. 32PO4-uptake rate constant, and chlorophyll a. These measurements allowed us to estimate respectively the potential for hydrolysis, the actual product of hydrolysis PO4 (which disrupts 32PO4-uptake rates) and the long-term net uptake of P (growth). Although the fractions did cause decreases in growth, and also increased both phosphatase activity and PO4 uptake rate constants, none of these could be attributed to an additional delivery of P to the community. Under all conditions tested, the P systems remained closed to organic P additions. However, the observed effects could be explained by non P organic matter such as dissolved humic materials acting either directly upon the community, or on phosphorus kinetics. The effects appeared to be pH dependent. We suggest that outside Spring P loading or other sporadic P inputs, the natural community tends to operate within a closed P system, where community dynamics are more strongly affected by non P organic matter than by organic phosphate inputs.

However, few studies have addressed whether the aquatic-derived n-alkanes can affect the delta D values of lake sedimentary long-chain n-alkanes, which are usually regarded as a recorder of the terrestrial hydrological signals. Here we systematically investigated delta D values of long-chain n-alkanes from modern aquatic plants, both near-shore and off-shore surface sediments, surrounding terrestrial plant litters, as well as river water and lake water in Lake Qinghai and its satellite lakes on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our data showed that (i) delta D values of long-chain n-alkanes from aquatic plants varied from -184aEuro degrees to -132aEuro degrees for n-C-27, from -183aEuro degrees to -138aEuro degrees for n-C-29, and from -189aEuro degrees to -130aEuro degrees for n-C-31, respectively, with no significant differences among the three n-alkanes homologues; (ii) delta D values of long-chain n-alkanes from aquatic plants were generally more positive than those from surrounding terrestrial plants, possibly because that they recorded the D-enrichment of lake water in this semi-arid region; (iii) delta D values of long-chain n-alkanes from surface sediments showed significant differences among the three n-alkanes homologues, due to the larger aquatic input of n-C-27 to the sedimentary lipid pool than that of n-C-31, and (iv) n-C-27 delta D values of near-shore aquatic plants and near-shore sediments are more negative than those from off-shore as a result of lower delta D values of near-shore lake water. Our findings indicate that in this region (i) the offset between sedimentary n-C-27 and n-C-31 delta D values (Delta delta DC27-C31) could potentially be used to evaluate if sedimentary long-chain n-alkanes are derived from a single source; (ii) while delta D values of n-C-27 may be influenced by lake water hydrological changes, sedimentary n-C-31 is derived predominantly from terrestrial plants and thus its delta D can serve as a relatively reliable indicator for terrestrial paleoclimatic and paleohydrological reconstructions.

The catchment area of the lake corresponds to a former caldera. The aim of the present study is to recognize the conditions of deposition and erosion of swampy and lacustrine sediments of the catchment area deposited in this catchment. The study also allowed us to push back the palaeoenvironmental history until approximately 46,000 cal yr BP. In the lower part of the slopes, we observe the change from a littoral, sometimes laminated lacustrine deposit, towards swampy sediments characterized by hydromorphic soils. The fern spores are always abundant, while the pollen are restricted to some Holocene and Pleistocene deposits where they allowed a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction which correlates well with that of the deep lake. Sections of the upper part of the slope show erosion surfaces indicating the Late Pleistocene passage of a swampy sedimentation towards alluvial and colluvial sedimentary deposition or towards lengthy emersion. This lowering of the lake level occurred in a step-wise manner controlled mainly by seismic activity. Although some short-term lowerings (ca. -6 m) of the lake level in particular during LGM and Younger Dryas were of climatic origin. They are attested by the setting of a swampy, Cyperaceae dominated environment on the lacustrine platform. These stepwise level falls establishes a basis of discussion to study the chronology of soil erosion observed on the slope of the crater above the lake. Pleistocene vivianite concretions, sometimes of centimetre-size, indicate conditions of long diagenesis in the catchment, according to the progress of emersion, the iron underwent fast and total oxidation leading to hardened ferric gravel. During wet Holocene periods and without ash layers, these concretions become rare and are dispersed in the sediment.																					978-1-315-81505-3; 978-1-138-00116-9				2014	32						91	122																WOS:000355935900005

The present studies examine some of the mechanisms that regulate spawning in this animal. In August and September 1990 and in May 1991 injection of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) induced ripe male, but not female, zebra mussels to spawn. During mid-summer 1991, 5-HT induced spawning in both males and females, and 5-HT could produce spawning responses by either injection or external application. External pH over a broad range (6.0 to 9.1) had no effect on spawning, neither inhibiting induction of spawning by 5-HT nor significantly eliciting spawning itself. With external application, 10(-3) M and 10(-4) M 5-HT caused spawning, but 10(-5) M and 10(-6) M did not. Cyproheptadine, a 5-HT receptor antagonist, reduced the response of both males and females by more than half. Spawning in response to 5-HT was blocked at 4-degrees-C, but not at 12-degrees-C, 20-degrees-C, or 27-degrees-C. For male zebra mussels morphological criteria for judging gonadal maturity were well-correlated with probability of spawning in response to 5-HT. For females, the likelihood of spawning in response to 5-HT was not tightly coupled to morphological maturity of the gonad, with many morphologically ripe females failing to spawn and some apparently immature animals releasing oocytes. Prior spawning reduced subsequent responsiveness and intensity of spawning of animals to 5-HT. These experiments support a role for 5-HT in regulating reproduction in zebra mussels and help define conditions by which zebra mussel spawning may be stimulated or inhibited.

Biosignatures Associated with Freshwater Microbialites	LIFE-BASEL												Freshwater microbialites (i.e., lithifying microbial mats) are quite rare in northern latitudes of the North American continent, with two lakes (Pavilion and Kelly Lakes) of southeastern BC containing a morphological variety of such structures. We investigated Kelly Lake microbialites using carbon isotope systematics, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and quantitative PCR to obtain biosignatures associated with microbial metabolism. delta C-13(DIC) values (mean delta C-13(DIC) -4.9 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand, n = 8) were not in isotopic equilibrium with the atmosphere; however, they do indicate C-13-depleted inorganic carbon into Kelly Lake. The values of carbonates on microbialite surfaces (delta C-13) fell within the range predicted for equilibrium precipitation from ambient lake water delta C-13(DIC) (-2.2 to -5.3 parts per thousand). Deep microbialites (26 m) had an enriched delta C-13(carb) value of -0.3 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand, which is a signature of photoautotrophy. The deeper microbialites (>20 m) had higher biomass estimates (via PLFAs), and a greater relative abundance of cyanobacteria (measured by 16S copies via qPCR). The majority of PLFAs constituted monounsaturated and saturated PLFAs, which is consistent with gram-negative bacteria, including cyanobacteria. The central PLFA delta C-13 values were highly depleted (-9.3 to -15.7 parts per thousand) relative to delta C-13 values of bulk organic matter, suggesting a predominance of photoautotrophy. A heterotrophic signature was also detected via the depleted iso- and anteiso-15:0 lipids (-3.2 to -5.2 parts per thousand). Based on our carbonate isotopic biosignatures, PLFA, and qPCR measurements, photoautotrophy is enriched in the microbialites of Kelly Lake. This photoautotrophy enrichment is consistent with the microbialites of neighboring Pavilion Lake. This indication of photoautotrophy within Kelly Lake at its deepest depths raises new insights into the limits of measurable carbonate isotopic biosignatures under light and nutrient limitations.

Laramide (polymetallic) vein, placer gold, carbonate-hosted Ag-Mn and Pb-Zn, and porphyry-copper deposits are found in this district. The Hillsboro district is dominated by Cretaceous andesite flows (75.4 +/- 3.5 Ma), breccias, and volcaniclastic rocks that were erupted from a volcano. The mineralized Copper Flat quartz-monzonite porphyry (CFQM, 74.93 +/- 0.66 Ma) intruded the vent of the volcano. The unmineralized Warm Springs quartz monzonite (74.4 +/- 2.6 Ma) and a third altered, unmineralized quartz monzonite intruded along fracture zones on the flanks of the volcano. Younger latite and quartz-latite dikes intruded the andesite and CFQM and radiate outwards from the CFQM; the polymetallic vein deposits are associated with these dikes. The igneous rocks are part of a differentiated comagmatic suite. Alteration of the igneous rocks consists of locally intense silicification, biotite, potassic, phyllic, and argillic alteration. Large jasperoid bodies have replaced the El Paso Formation, Fusselman Dolomite, Lake Valley Limestone, and Percha Shale in the southern part of the district. Many workers in the district have recognized district zoning. The low-sulfur (<7%) porphyry-copper deposit forms the center. Trending radially from the CFQM are Laramide Au-Ag-Cu veins. Carbonate-hosted replacement deposits (Ag, Pb, Mn, V, Mo, Zn) are located in the southern and northern parts of the district, distal from the center. Collectively, the evidence suggests that the deposits found in the Hillsboro district were formed by multiple convective hydrothermal systems related to the Copper Flat volcanic/intrusive complex.

Since 1997 the Museo Tridentino di Scienze Naturali has been carrying out in situ experiments in order to understand the factors regulating the blooms. Experiments were carried out in different types of enclosures to test the reaction of phytoplankton to phosphorus enrichment and light reduction, with special reference to Glenodinium sanguineum Marchesoni, the dinoflagellate responsible for the reddening. The aim of the present contribution is to study the ecology of other flagellate algae typical of Lake Tovel, by analysing the data from the enclosure experiments. Particular attention is given to competition for resources, the comparison with G. sanguineum and some interesting taxonomic observations. The four flagellate taxa selected for this investigation were Gymnodinium uberrimum (Allman) Kofoid & Swezy, Dinobryon cf. sociale var. americana (Brunnthaler) Bachmann, Campylomonas sp. and Tetraselmis sp. Number of individuals and biovolume calculated for each taxon during the experiments were statistically related to NO(3)-N and TP concentrations, water temperature, pH and oxygen saturation. A prompt and positive response to P-enrichment was found in all experiments for both G. sanguineum and G. uberrimum. However, the first taxon showed a pronounced development only when nutrients were coupled with high light intensities, while the latter appeared to be a better competitor in low light intensities and low water temperature. The behaviour of Tetraselmis sp. was similar to that of G. sanguineum, while the development pattern of Campylomonas sp. was similar to that of G. uberrimum. D. sociale did not show a clear relationship either to nutrient enrichment or weather conditions.					; Cantonati, Marco/G-4278-2018; Tolotti, Monica/D-4441-2018	Cantonati, Marco/0000-0003-0179-3842; Tolotti, Monica/0000-0003-2674-8597													0018-8158					JUL	2003	502	1-3					285	296		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004286.28881.75	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004286.28881.75													WOS:000186636900021
J	DiDonato, GT				DiDonato, GT			Detecting interactions between Elliptio waccamawensis and Leptodea ochracea:: the influence of experimental scale	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Manipulative field experiments are used in ecology to study biotic interactions in populations and communities. In benthic suspension-feeding organisms, these interactions can occur over multiple spatial scales, but this has rarely received experimental attention. A field experiment in Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina, USA, explored scale-dependent interactions in the freshwater mussels Elliptio waccamawensis and Leptodea ochracea (Bivalvia: Unionidae). Mussel density and patch size were manipulated in situ during summer 1996. Density treatments (Low: 32 monospecific individuals m(-2), High: 64 monospecific individuals m(-2), Mixed: 64 individuals m(-2) at a 1:1 ratio of the two species) were maintained in benthic enclosures (0.25 m(2)), and a scale treatment altered mussel patch size (Small-scale: 0.25 m(2), Large-scale: 3 m(2)). Large-scale patches were achieved by supplementing the area around each 0.25 m(2) enclosure with additional mussels. Bivalve shell growth, tissue weight, and shell weight were analyzed. E. waccamawensis did not respond to any of the treatments, including spatial scale. For L. ocbracea, shell growth and weight were not influenced by experimental treatments; however, average tissue weight of mussels in small patches (0.25 m(2)) was significantly higher in the High and Mixed treatments compared to the Low treatment. This positive effect was not observed in larger patches. These data provide evidence for scale-dependent interactions in unionids. In addition, they further an intriguing hypothesis linking spatial aggregation and reproductive success in freshwater mussels.																			1439-1791						2002	3	4					371	379		10.1078/1439-1791-00118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1078/1439-1791-00118													WOS:000179374800009

The Shiotani welded tuff is pervasively welded and foliated concordantly with the contact that dips inward at angles of 70-90 degrees. In contrast, nearby contemporary volcaniclastic deposits are non-welded and gently inclined. Near the contact with the granite, the tuff is plastically deformed and shows lineations that plunge inward at angles of 40-65 degrees. Lithic and crystal clasts in the rheomorphic outer part are rotated in a plane normal to the foliations and parallel to the lineations indicating downward flow of the welded tuff. The geometry and internal structures suggest that the Shiotani welded tuff was emplaced and welded in a funnel-shaped eruption conduit. Upon collapse of a plinian or phreatoplinian eruption column, the majority of the conduit-filling pyroclasts probably fell back en masse into the conduit. Heat and steam from underlying magma and diffusion of interstitial volatiles into the glass perhaps reduced the viscosity of juvenile pyroclasts and facilitated welding in the conduit, especially at deep levels. The hot welded pyroclasts then flowed down the conduit wall during welding compaction and retreat of the magma. These processes resulted in increased welding toward the contacts and welding foliations concordant with the steep wall. Emplacement of nearby correlative volcaniclastic mass-flow deposits in a shelf to upper bathyal environment suggests a possibility that, when active, the Shiotani conduit was under the sea. Welding compaction would occur even under the sea provided that the steam generated in the upper part of the conduit fill prevented water access.																			0258-8900					NOV	1997	59	2					125	135		10.1007/s004450050180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004450050180													WOS:A1997YF31900004
J	Kellett, DK; Alisauskas, RT				Kellett, Dana K.; Alisauskas, Ray T.			Clutch Size and Nest Survival of Cackling Geese in a Lesser Snow and Ross's Goose Colony	WATERBIRDS												Clutch size and nest survival of Cackling Geese (Branta hutchinsii hutchinsii) nesting among light geese (Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens) and Ross's Geese (C. rossii;)) were examined at Karrak Lake, Nunavut, in Canada's central arctic, 1999-2009. Islands of Karrak Lake and adjacent Adventure Lake were selected by Cackling Geese for nesting instead of mainland habitat. Cackling Geese increasingly nested on islands during the study, while light goose nesting declined. Clutch size varied by year (range: 3.4-4.4 eggs), and declined with nest initiation date ((beta) over cap (NID) = -0.177 (95% CI: -0.228, -0.126)). Nest survival during incubation varied among years (range: NW 8.6-88.2%), and was lowest during early and late incubation, although 95% CI of slope estimates with nest age included zero ((beta) over cap (Age) = 0.156 (95% CI -0.072, 0.383), (beta) over cap (2)(Age) = -0.006, (95% Cl -0.027, 0.014)). Nest survival declined with individual nest initiation date ((beta) over cap (NID) = -0.431 (95% Cl: -0.680, -0.182)). There was little support. for nest survival models that included individual covariates of synchrony with light geese or weather during incubation. A posteriori analysis revealed that annual nest survival was greater in warmer years with less wind ((beta) over cap (YearWeather) = 1.738 (95% Cl: 1.272, 2.205)), but spring phenology, intraspecific synchrony, or abundance of Cackling or light geese were not important. Reduced access to island-nesting geese by terrestrial predators, and predator satiation from high densities of nesting light geese on the surrounding mainland may result in islands within light goose colonies that are productive nesting habitats for many avian species, particularly if islands themselves are sparsely inhabited by light geese.

J	Schulz, HK; Smietana, P; Schulz, R				Schulz, Holger K.; Smietana, Przemyslaw; Schulz, Ralf			Estimating the human impact on populations of the endangered noble crayfish (Astacus astacus L.) in north-western Poland	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. The Pomorskie Lakeland close to the town of Miastko shows the highest density of stocks of the noble crayfish Astacus astacus (L.) in the lowlands of north-western Poland. In summer 2002, the present statu's of this highly threatened species was analysed by means of mark and recapture trapping. 2. Nine lakes with known occurrence of A. astacus were investigated. Each lake was surveyed with regard to the crayfish population density, water quality and potential recent and historical impact of fisheries and recreation. The estimated population density was evaluated statistically with respect to a set of potential environmental variables. 3. The estimated densities of A. astacus populations varied from very abundant (6.6 adult individuals per trap per night) to absent. Two lakes were found to contain the non-indigenous crayfish Orconectes limosus (Raf.). The population density was not correlated with conductivity, pH, transparency, alkalinity, the concentration of ammonium, calcium, chloride, nitrate, nitrite, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, or with the trophic status of the lakes. A. astacus occurred in lakes ranging from mesotrophic to eutrophic. 4. The results suggest that both occurrence and density of A. astacus populations depended on criteria associated with human activities that have altered the aquatic environment. Abundance of A. astacus was negatively correlated with eel (Anguilla anguilla) stocking intensity (r = -0.88: p < 0.01) and number of yearly net catches (r = -0.66; p < 0.05) and positively correlated with distance to nearest town (r = 0.72; p < 0.05). 5. It is concluded that the introduction of O. limosus most likely resulted from fishery activities, emphasizing the need for regulations to reduce the negative impact of lake fisheries on native crayfish stocks.

The large MIS 4 and long MIS 2 glacier maxima on the southern tip of South America	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Robust glacial chronologies are needed to address the fundamental questions of when and why Ice Age climates begin and end. Well-preserved glacial deposits left by large ice sheet lobes adjacent to Estrecho de Magallanes (53 degrees S; Chile) in southernmost South America provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct the timing and fine structure of the last two major glaciations, as well as the last termination. We present a new precise Be-10 surface exposure dataset of 34 moraine boulders directly tied to a recently published, high resolution glacial geomorphic map of the deposits left by the Magallanes lobe. We find that the southern section of the Patagonian Ice Sheet was more extensive during Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS 4) than during MIS 2, representing the first direct dating of the MIS 4 glacier culmination in South America. Similar to the MIS 2 glacial maxima, within MIS 4 there were multiple advances that we date (n = 6 samples) to between 67.5 +/- 2.1 and 62.1 +/- 2.0 ka. A similarly timed MIS 4 advance was identified in New Zealand, indicating that this is a hemisphere-wide glacier-climate signal, which is further corroborated by South Atlantic and Pacific temperature proxy records. Inboard of the MIS 4 moraine complex, we date a sequence of geomorphically distinct MIS 2 moraines that represent separate major periods of glacial stability. The MIS 2 maximum extent occurred by 27.4 +/- 0.8 ka (n = 4; arithmetic mean, with the standard error of the mean and 3% propagated production rate error) and was followed by at least four more full glacial culminations at 25.7 +/- 0.8 (n = 3), 23.9 +/- 0.8 (n = 5), 19.1 +/- 0.7 (n = 3), and 18.1 +/- 0.6 ka (n = 3), which represent periods when the glacier was in equilibrium with the climate for long enough to form major moraines. About 18 km inboard, this sequence is followed by smaller-scale recessional moraine crests, deposited on drumlinized terrain rather than a moraine drift, that we date to 18.0 +/- 0.8 ka, indicating the glacier was in net retreat at this time. Tentative results from a 2D ice sheet model suggest that the Magallanes lobe may have reached mapped inner and outer MIS 2 moraines from a climate with approximately 4.5 degrees C and 5.5 degrees C cooler summers, respectively, assuming similar to 25% less annual precipitation, relative to modern climate. We hypothesize that during the last glacial cycle, shifts in the subtropical and subantarctic fronts, and related ocean-atmosphere patterns, explain MIS 4 to 2 glacial behavior in the southern mid-latitudes.

J	James, TS; Clague, JJ; Wang, KL; Hutchinson, I				James, TS; Clague, JJ; Wang, KL; Hutchinson, I			Postglacial rebound at the northern Cascadia subduction zone	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Postglacial rebound is the response of the Earth to the decay of ice-sheets. A postglacial rebound model explains crustal tilting and rapid uplift at the northern Cascadia subduction zone that occurred during retreat of the Cordilleran ice-sheet. Observations explained by the model include the shoreline tilts of two proglacial lakes that formed at 13.5-14 ka (C-14 yr ago) and rapid sea level fall (land uplift) at 12-12.5 ka. Modelled mantle viscosity values range from 5 x 10(18) to 5 x 10(19) Pa s, and are consistent with previous viscosity inferences from observations of crustal deformation following subduction zone earthquakes (10(18)- 0(19) Pa s). No lower limit to subduction zone mantle viscosity is apparent from our model, but viscosity values equal to or larger than 10"0 Pa a are definitely ruled out. Our modelled subduction zone viscosity values are smaller than most upper-mantle viscosity estimates derived from postglacial rebound studies of tectonically less-active regions (10(20)-10(21) pa s). The rapid observed uplift at 12 ka requires, in addition to a low mantle viscosity, rapid unloading from a sudden collapse of remaining coastal portions of the southern Cordilleran ice-sheet. The sudden collapse provides 0.18 m of global eustatic sea level rise, approximately 0.7% of the sea level rise associated with melt-water pulse IA. Predictions of a global postglacial rebound model (ICE-3G) with a 10(21) Pa s upper-mantle viscosity were previously applied to geodetic data from this region to isolate signals associated with the earthquake cycle. Owing to the low-viscosity values, and resulting rapid recovery of glacial deformation, our model predicts present-day postglacial rebound uplift rates at least 10 times smaller than ICE-3G (less than about 0.1mm/yr). As the ICE-3G adjustments were substantial, this indicates the need for re-evaluation of the geodetic data. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

As the first point of contact for patients accessing medical care through emergency services, emergency medical dispatchers (EMDs) represent the earliest potential identification point for AMIs. The objective of the study was to determine how AMI cases were coded and prioritized at the dispatch point, and also to describe the distribution of these cases by patient age and gender. Hypothesis/Problem: No studies currently exist that describe the EMD's ability to correctly triage AMIs into Advanced Life Support (ALS) response tiers. Methods: The retrospective descriptive study utilized data from three sources: emergency medical dispatch, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and emergency departments (EDs)/hospitals. The primary outcome measure was the distributions of AMI cases, as categorized by Chief Complaint Protocol, dispatch priority code and level, and patient age and gender. The EMS and ED/hospital data came from the Utah Department of Health (UDoH), Salt Lake City, Utah. Dispatch data came from two emergency communication centers covering the entirety of Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County, Utah. Results: Overall, 89.9% of all the AMIs (n = 606) were coded in one of the three highest dispatch priority levels, all of which call for ALS response (called CHARLIE, DELTA, and ECHO in the studied system). The percentage of AMIs significantly increased for patients aged 35 years and older, and varied significantly by gender, dispatch level, and chief complaint. A total of 85.7% of all deaths occurred among patients aged 55 years and older, and 88.9% of the deaths were handled in the ALS-recommended priority levels. Conclusion: Acute myocardial infarctions may present as a variety of clinical symptoms, and the study findings demonstrated that more than one-half were identified as having chief complaints of Chest Pain or Breathing Problems at the dispatch point, followed by Sick Person and Unconscious/Fainting. The 35-year age cutoff for assignment to higher priority levels is strongly supported. The Falls and Sick Person Protocols offer opportunities to capture atypical AMI presentations.																			1049-023X	1945-1938				FEB	2018	33	1					29	35		10.1017/S1049023X1700704X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1049023X1700704X								29223194					WOS:000428764900006

Thematic Mapper imagery interpretation, combined with field evidence, has led to the identification of geomorphological features which are mainly composed of light grey calcareous sandstones (formerly calcretes) overlain by dark grey sands. The literature suggests that palaeolake Makgadikgadi I formed and developed intermittently after initial downwarping in the early-mid Pleistocene. The calcareous sandstones were formed when calcium carbonate precipitation took place in pre-existing Kalahari sands along the western shoreline of Makgadikgadi I. Field evidence, supported by X-ray diffraction and SEM analyses, indicates that CaCO3 precipitated mainly in marshy conditions around plant roots and stems and in association with bacteria in embayments along the lakeshore. The sandstones thickened and became partially indurated as a result of increasing palaeolake levels. Deposition was terminated by renewed tectonism which uplifted the shoreline zone relative to the lake basin, leading to falling palaeolake levels. Post-uplift reworking led to case hardening and pedogenic calcrete formation in the upper sections of the calcareous sandstones. Sedimentary conditions altered during the late Pleistocene. Extensive distributaries from the proto-Okavango system incised the shoreline ridge contributing to the filling of Makgadikgadi II. Satellite data suggest that the proto-Okavango rivers formed a series of fan deltas at this time along the western Makgadikgadi basin. Widespread dispersal of fluvial grey sands took place as a result of basin tilting which led to anastomosing channels flowing southward possibly around 18,000 B.P. These results, although preliminary in nature, augment previous geomorphological analyses by adding some detail in terms of depositional environments and by providing a tentative age and origin for the ubiquitous grey sands.

Synergy of Satellite, In Situ and Modelled Data for Addressing the Scarcity of Water Quality Information for Eutrophication Assessment and Monitoring of Swedish Coastal Waters	REMOTE SENSING												Monthly CHL-a and Secchi Depth (SD) data derived from the full mission data of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS; 2002-2012) were analysed along a horizontal transect from the inner Braviken bay and out into the open sea. The CHL-a values were calibrated using an algorithm derived from Swedish lakes. Then, calibrated Chl-a and Secchi Depth (SD) estimates were extracted from MERIS data along the transect and compared to conventional monitoring data as well as to data from the Swedish Coastal zone Model (SCM), providing physico-biogeochemical parameters such as temperature, nutrients, Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) and Secchi depth (SD). A high negative correlation was observed between satellite-derived CHL-a and SD (rho = -0.91), similar to the in situ relationship established for several coastal gradients in the Baltic proper. We also demonstrate that the validated MERIS-based estimates and data from the SCM showed strong correlations for the variables CHL-a, SD and total nitrogen (TOTN), which improved significantly when analysed on a monthly basis across basins. The relationship between satellite-derived CHL-a and modelled TOTN was also evaluated on a monthly basis using least-square linear regression models. The predictive power of the models was strong for the period May-November (R-2: 0.58-0.87), and the regression algorithm for summer was almost identical to the algorithm generated from in situ data in Himmerfjarden bay. The strong correlation between SD and modelled TOTN confirms that SD is a robust and reliable indicator to evaluate changes in eutrophication in the Baltic proper which can be assessed using remote sensing data. Amongst all three assessed methods, only MERIS CHL-a was able to correctly depict the pattern of phytoplankton phenology that is typical for the Baltic proper. The approach of combining satellite data and physio-biogeochemical models could serve as a powerful tool and value-adding complement to the scarcely available in situ data from national monitoring programs. In particular, satellite data will help to reduce uncertainties in long-term monitoring data due to its improved measurement frequency.					; Kratzer, Susanne/ABD-8128-2021; Lyon, Steve/AAL-9358-2021	Kratzer, Susanne/0000-0002-0992-7203; 														2072-4292				SEP 1	2019	11	17							2051	10.3390/rs11172051	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11172051													WOS:000486874300095

U-Pb geochronology of the Wolf River batholith, north-central Wisconsin: Evidence for successive magmatism between 1484 Ma and 1468 Ma	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												Single-grain zircon U-Pb age determinations were completed on individual phases of the Mesoproterozoic, anorogenic Wolf River batholith (WRB) of Wisconsin and the nearby Wausau syenite complex in order to (a) define the age more precisely and accurately, (b) determine whether there is a resolvable age difference within units of the WRB and (c) determine whether the Wausau syenite complex is coeval with any or all parts of the WRB. U-Pb results for many individual zircon grains from the WRB plot near concordia and yield ages ranging from 1468 +/- 4 Ma to 1484 +/- 2 Ma. Plutons of the northeastern lobe of the WRB (Peshtigo monzonite, Hager porphyry, Belongia granite, and High Falls granite) have a weighted average crystallization age of 1470.3 +/- 1.2 Ma, which is younger than the main complex plutons (Wolf River granite, Wiborgite porphyry, Red River granite, and Waupaca granite), which yields a weighted average crystallization age of 1475.6 +/- 1.7 Ma (excluding one sample of Wolf River granite from Hogarty which yields an age of 1484 2 Ma). Two samples from the main complex also contain zircons with younger apparent ages of 1470-1471 Ma; these younger grains may reflect late stage alteration of some zircons coeval with emplacement of the northeastern lobe. The Wausau syenite and the Nine Mile granite of the nearby Wausau syenite complex (1522Ma and 1506 Ma, respectively) are significantly older than the WRB and definitely not coeval or comagmatic. The syenite complex may be a precursor to the larger WRB magmatism. Sm-Nd T-DM ages for most WRB samples indicate crust formation ages from 1.8 Ga to 1.9 Ga, compatible with formation of the magmas from late Paleoproterozoic (Penokean) crust. One unit, which locally intrudes Archean gneiss, has a small component of that older rock involved in its evolution. The two Wausau complex units have younger TDM ages and appear to have incorporated slightly greater amounts of juvenile constituents. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Taravilla lake and tufa deposits (Central Iberian Range, Spain) as palaeohydrological and palaeoclimatic indicators	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					General Assembly of the European-Union-of-Geosciences	APR 24-29, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	European Geosci Union				Lacustrine and tufa deposits from Laguna de Taravilla (Iberian Range, Guadalajara province, Spain, 40 degrees 39' N, 1 degrees 59' W, 1100 m 9 a.s.l.) have been analyzed using sedimentological, mineralogical, geochemical and palynological techniques. A preliminary chronological framework is presented, based on U/Th, C-14 AMS, Pb-210 and Cs-137 analyses. The lacustrine-tufa system developed in a hanging tributary valley of the Upper Tajo River and is composed of a large perched springline tufa build-up, and a barrage tufa dam that impounds Laguna de Taravilla. The Taravilla tufa stable-isotope compositions are similar to other examples in central and southern Spain and they plot in the same field as other lowland European stream tufas. These values are coherent with the range of isotopic compositions measured in the Taravilla spring and lake water. Several sediment cores retrieved from the Laguna de Taravilla have been dated with C AMS and analyzed using a multiproxy approach including magnetic properties, sedimentology, geochemistry, stable isotopes, palynology and ostracode assemblages. Sedimentary facies analyses show the dominance of elastic depositional processes in the lacustrine depositional system and suggest the potential of the sequences as palaeoflood records. Sands and coarse silts reflect periods of increased alluvial activity of the inlet. The dominance of elastic depositional processes and the input of detrital carbonate hinder the use of lake mud stable-isotope compositions as environmental indicators. Phases of increased tufa growth occurred during the Late Pleistocene (Last Glacial to Interglacial transition from oxygen isotopic stage 6 to 5) and during the Late Glacial and Early Holocene. Although the Taravilla chronology does not allow a detailed analysis of flood frequency, the reconstructed evolution is coherent with the palaeoflood history of the Tajo River for the last 2000 years, particularly with an increase during the last 500 years. The increase in flood frequency coincides with other evidence of wetter and colder climate and environmental change in Central Spain and in Europe during the Little Ice Age. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Holocene sea level and environmental change on the west coast of South Africa: evidence from plant biomarkers, stable isotopes and pollen	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We present an 8000-year biomarker and stable carbon isotope record from the Verlorenvlei Estuary, South Africa. We assessed how leaf wax lipids, insoluble macromolecular organic matter, bulk C/N data and compound-specific stable carbon isotopes were linked to the site's palynological record and to evidence for regional sea level and environmental change. Down-core trends in bulk delta C-13 are closely coupled to trends in pollen types from saline-tolerant taxa. These trends are mirrored by variations in the incorporation of reduced sulphur into macromolecular organic matter. This process, quantified with the thiophene ratio, is closely associated with periods of higher sea level 8,000-4,300 cal yr BP. We propose the thiophene ratio is a proxy for relative marine influence within (peri) estuarine sediments. All measured variables indicate differences between early-middle Holocene (8,000-4,300 cal BP) and late Holocene conditions at Verlorenvlei. The former period was more saline and preserves more labile macromolecular organic matter. Marine influence declined after 4,300 cal yr BP, and although the abundance of short-chain-length n-alkanes suggests continued presence of wetland flora until 2,500 cal yr BP, organic matter preservation became poorer and a drying trend was inferred, most notably for the interval 2,500-900 cal BP. Increasing freshwater inundation is apparent during the last 700 cal yr, consistent with several records from this region. Leaf wax n-alkane distributions are largely uncorrelated with bulk organic matter variables, with the exception of the abundance of C-31 and C-33 n-alkanes, which are negatively correlated with delta C-13(TOC). Furthermore, C-31-C-33 n-alkane delta C-13 values are uncorrelated with C-23-C-29 delta C-13 and delta C-13(TOC). They are also higher than our newly measured terrestrial (C-3) vegetation C-29 and C-31 end-member values of -35 +/- A 2 and -34 +/- A 1 aEuro degrees, respectively. These patterns are best explained by a dominant contribution of local riparian vegetation to the C-23-C-29 n-alkanes, but time-varying contributions of non-local leaf waxes to the C-31-C-33 signals. This renders inferences concerning regional environmental change from long-chain leaf waxes potentially challenging in this setting.					; Meadows, Michael/AAH-2461-2020; Chase, Brian/A-1202-2010	Carr, Andrew/0000-0001-5794-6428; Meadows, Michael/0000-0001-8322-3055; Boom, Arnoud/0000-0003-1299-691X; Chase, Brian/0000-0001-6987-1291													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2015	53	4					415	432		10.1007/s10933-015-9833-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-015-9833-7													WOS:000351294300005

Mesoscale survey of western and northwestern Irish lakes - Spatial and aestival patterns in trophic status and phytoplankton community structure	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Inland water bodies are considered as integrated parts of the landscape and the monitoring of water quality and aquatic resources need to be addressed on a regional basis for optimal assessment and management. In this study, a simple stratified sampling scheme was applied to a mesoscale survey of western and northwestern Irish lakes, which was carried out to identify, based on the distribution patterns of phytoplankton biomass, potential associations between lake trophic state and land cover attributes. Phytoplankton community analysis was also performed to determine whether taxa associations reflected meteorology-linked aestival succession or specific spatial distributions. The assessment was based on the typology of hydrogeomorphological and land cover attributes of river catchments through ArcGIS analysis. Sampling was carried out in 50 lakes and during a 15-week period in summer 2009. Results showed a general longitudinal gradient in the trophic status of the lakes sampled, with a greater frequency of mesotrophic lakes in the eastern part of the study area where land cover is dominated by agricultural surfaces. Significant relationships (p < 0.010) were found between chlorophyll-a concentration and the proportion of river catchment surface covered by agriculture land and wetlands, findings which might be considered further as proxies for developing an eutrophication risk index. Multivariate analysis of phytoplankton community data clustered the sampled lakes into three assemblages, with ordination along axis 1 being significantly correlated to time and temperature (p < 0.006). There was greater frequency of occurrence of diatoms in lakes from cluster III (Kruskal -Wallis, p < 0.05, H = 6.34, df = 2, n = 49), concomitant to lower chlorophyll-a concentrations, lake surface temperatures and Secchi depths, reflecting meteorological conditions dominated by precipitations. Those results support the potential of mesoscale surveys to assess water quality variables and detect environmental patterns at regional scales. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hansson, PA; Fredriksson, H				Hansson, PA; Fredriksson, H			Use of summer harvested common reed (Phragmites australis) as nutrient source for organic crop production in Sweden	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Increasing nutrient levels in lakes contribute to environmental problems such as overgrowth and eutrophication. Decreasing soil nutrient levels in organic farming systems result in reduced plant growth. During July and August, nutrient concentration in aboveground parts of the widely distributed aquatic plant common reed (Phragmites australis) is relatively high. The purpose of this work was to identify and analyse technical and logistic systems useful in removing reed biomass from the lake and using it as nutrient supply in organic crop production. The area studied for reed harvest was limited to the "Kallandsundet" drainage basin in Sweden. 160 ha are scheduled for harvesting each year. One strategy studied was to chop the harvested material and spread it directly on farmland. Another was to compost the material before spreading, and a third was to use the harvested biomass as raw material in biogas production and spread the by-product (sludge) on farmland. The energy balances for the three systems were calculated to -0.35, -0.43 and +4.05 MJ kg(-1) harvested dry matter, respectively. The biogas strategy produces both large amounts of energy in the gas and nutrients in a form easily available to agricultural plants. The economics of the system are sensitive to changes in income provided by the gas produced and in the cost of the chopping operation. The alternative of chopping and spreading the reed directly as green manure does not require large investments or complicated processing plants, but produces no useful energy and the risks for nitrogen leakage are higher than for the biogas alternative. The compost alternative has the least favourable characteristics among the three strategies studied. The operations at the compost plant are costly and no useful energy is produced. For all three alternatives, the total economics are highly improved if the positive effects of nutrient removal from the lake are included in the calculations.

These data allow for investigation of the subaqueous slope dynamics of the lake, which partially fills a volcanic depression, and the elucidation of the relationships between subaqueous and subaerial slope processes. Subaerial, submerged and combined subaerial/submerged landslide-related morphologies were detected around the inner slopes of the lake. In the submerged slopes, several gravity-induced landforms were recognized: landslide scar areas, landslide accumulations, erosional chutes and channels, block fields, isolated blocks, scarps and slope breaks. An attempt to evaluate the state of activity of the submerged slopes was carried out by taking into consideration the relative freshness of some selected landforms. Interpretation of bathymetric data, as well as direct surveys of the subaerial slopes, was used to assess the morphometric features and interpret the type of movement of the landslides. We propose a comprehensive classification based on the landslide's size and type of movement. We recognized rock fall/topples, debris flows, rock slides and slump, complex rock slides/channelled flows and debris slide and slump. The volume of the main landslides ranged between 10(1) and 10(3) m(3), while a few rock and debris slides have volumes ranging between 10(3) and 10(5) m(3). Two large palaeo-landslides with volumes on the order of 10(6) m(3) were identified in the southern and northern part of the lake, respectively. Velocities of the recognized landslides range from rapid to extremely rapid. Two main landslide hazard scenarios have been depicted from the results of the integrated analysis of both subaerial and submerged gravity-induced landforms. The most hazardous scenario involves extremely rapid large volume events (>10(6) m(3)) that could, if they interacted with water, induce catastrophic tsunamis.

Postglacial vegetation and climate change in the Lake Onega region of eastern Fennoscandia derived from a radiocarbon-dated pollen record	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												With its numerous environmental archives stored in lake and peat sediments and relatively low human pressure, the Lake Onega region in eastern Fennoscandia is regarded as a particularly promising area for studying past changes in vegetation and climate since the Lateglacial period. The 885-cm-long sediment core RZ19 (62 degrees 27 ' 53 '' N, 34 degrees 26 ' 4 '' E) was collected from Razlomnoe Peat on the northern shore of Lake Onega in 2019, radiocarbon-dated and analysed for pollen and cryptogam spores. The age-depth model suggests continuous sedimentation since ca. 11,800 a BP (all ages given in years (a) or kiloyears (ka) before present (BP) with BP referring to 1950 CE). The results of pollen analysis and pollen-based biome reconstruction show rapid afforestation of the area in the Early Holocene, although the scores of the tundra biome remain relatively high prior to ca. 11,450 a BP, suggesting that the vegetation was likely more open than today. Between 8300 and 8000 a BP, Betula sect. Albae shows a marked increase in pollen percentage, while Pinus sylvestris experiences a marked decrease. These changes coinciding with the 8.2 ka BP cooling event indicate less favourable conditions for Scots pine while being beneficial for fast-growing birch. The transition from the Early to Middle Holocene (i.e. from Greenlandian to Northgrippian) is marked by an increase in pollen productivity, spread of Picea and further afforestation of the area. The decrease in arboreal and Picea pollen percentages and the abrupt increase in landscape openness after ca. 4000 a BP mark the onset of the Late Holocene (i.e. Northgrippian-Meghalayan transition) and likely reflect the combined effect of insolation-induced temperature decrease and associated paludification and forest retreat rather than a decrease in atmospheric precipitation and/or spread of Late Neolithic agriculture.

Here, we report the results of a detailed investigation of eight outcrop sections in the Gonghe Basin, northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Measurements of sediment grain-size and chemical composition indicate that the deposits are primarily of aeolian origin, consisting of inter-bedded, well-sorted sand, silty sand, loess and/or palaeosol; however, their occurrence varies from site to site. Fossil dune sands mainly occur in or close to the currently stabilized or semi-stabilized dune fields, whereas loess is distributed along the downwind marginal areas. This pattern of basin-scale differentiation was controlled mainly by spatial variability of sediment supply due to the antecedent sedimentary patterns within the basin. Together with previously-published optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages, 24 new OSL dates are used to elucidate the history of aeolian activity and its relationship to climatic Changes. There is no apparent relationship between past dune activity and downwind loess deposits. Deposition of silty sand probably occurred during past phases of windy, dry and cold climate in the Late Pleistocene. However, climatic factors alone cannot explain the occurrence of silty sand deposition. This is because the deposition of silty sand was always preceded by episodes of fluvial deposition prior to river incision, thereby indicating the importance of an 'activated' sediment supply associated with fluvial processes. Deposition of well-sorted sand occurred episodically, not only during the Late Pleistocene, but also during the early- to mid-Holocene. Vegetation conditions, controlled either by the occurrence of intervals of moisture deficit during the Late Pleistocene or by changes in the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration at a local scale, played an important role in sand mobility and deposition. The effect of vegetation on sand mobility is also suggested by independent evidence of aeolian activity from Genggahai Lake in the Gonghe Basin. Here, the deposition of aeolian sand in the basin during the early- to mid-Holocene indicates a low level of effective moisture caused by high evaporation induced by higher summer insolation, despite the coeval increased regional precipitation recorded by lacustrine sediments. In contrast, late Holocene palaeosols represent a high level of effective moisture, and their formation did not necessarily require increased regional precipitation. Overall, our results suggest that the relationship between aeolian activity and regional climate change is complex, and that sand accumulations do not represent the consistent action of surface processes that are related to climatic changes.

J	Ozer, E; Leloglu, UM				Ozer, Erdem; Leloglu, Ugur Murat			Wetland spectral unmixing using multispectral satellite images	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Wetlands are of great importance to the diversity of biota and ecology, thereby to humans. Monitoring such valuable areas is essential for sustainable development. When the sizes, geographic distribution, and total coverage of wetlands across the earth are taken into account, remote sensing shines out as the most economically and technically feasible method to realise the monitoring task. Concerning the utilisation of medium resolution satellite images as the input, the pixel-level approach falls short of understanding the wetland dynamics since vast amounts of pixels in such areas have mixed content. This study proposes a framework for determining the extent of wetlands and extracting their ground characteristics at the sub-pixel level. In the extent determination part, Tasselled Cap Water Index (TCWI) values are calculated on time series, and their variations throughout the year are modelled by fitting a double-sided sigmoid function. This information is coupled with Digital Terrain Model (DTM) thresholding to extract the final extent. A sub-pixel analysis is proposed for the latter part, which includes adopting a systematic approach using a three-element (soil, vegetation, water) scheme for establishing wetland ontology and implementing supervised spectral unmixing enhanced by band weight optimisation. Balikdami, one of the most impressive wetlands of Turkey, is chosen as the test area. Open-access optical satellite data acquired by the Sentinel-2 constellation are utilised as the primary data input. Since the abundance values of land cover classes in each Sentinel-2 pixel are estimated, reference abundance data with a 10 m ground sampling distance (GSD) are generated using four-band aerial images having a 30 cm GSD for the verification stage. A new method entitled 'Abundance Confusion Matrix' is introduced for comparison and detailed assessment of fractional land cover. Experimental results demonstrate that the extent determination is addressed with a precision of 99.21% and a miss rate of 5.75%. In addition, the abundance values of land cover classes are identified with an overall accuracy of 66.17% after the optimisation step. The proposed method proves to be a valuable tool for the detailed monitoring of wetlands.					; Leloglu, Ugur/A-9885-2008	Leloglu, Ugur Murat/0000-0002-8584-7301; 													1010-6049	1752-0762				DEC 13	2022	37	27					15754	15777		10.1080/10106049.2022.2102225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2102225		JUL 2022											WOS:000832520200001

Fluctuation in density of ciliates in Bukan Dam Reservoir (Zarrinehrud, Iran)	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												The abundance and species composition of ciliates were analyzed in the Bukan Dam Reservoir (West Azerbaijan, Iran) from January to December 2008. Surface water samples were collected at monthly intervals from the middle (Stations 1 and 3) and shallow (Stations 2 and 4) areas of the lake. Three samples were taken in the water column using a 5-litre sampler. Totally 30 liters water was collected, 200 ml of which was fixed immediately with 8.6 ml of a saturated HgCl2 solution and stained with 0.04% bromophenol blue. Three subsamples were counted in a 5-ml chamber and examined with a microscope (100 x) as well as Chlorophyll a and a few ecological parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, transperancy and water temperature were measured. Totally 50 ciliates species were found in Bukan Dam Reservoir. Regarding the density, a high-density period was detected from January to April with a mean density of 2.86 x 10(3) cells. l(-1) Ciliata at stations 1 and 3 and 4.16 x 10(3) cells. l(-1) at stations 2 and 4. The high density of ciliate in summer may be due to the increase in the density of bacteria and moderate metazooplankton as a result of the appearance of non-edible algae. The ciliata occurring at the highest densities were Coleps tessellates, Didinium nasutum, Paradileptus elephantinus, Stentor polymorphus, Zosterograptus labiatus, Paramecium bursaria, Cyclidium citrullus, Vorticella campanula, Halteria grandinella and Aspidisca costata. The maximum and minimum chlorophyll a values observed at the reservoir water were 10.39 mu g.l(-1) and 1.0 mu g.l(-1) being obtained in May and Octobor respectively.																			1562-2916						2010	9	3					444	453																WOS:000285688800010
J	Anderson, RS; Hasbargen, J; Koehler, PA; Feiler, EJ				Anderson, RS; Hasbargen, J; Koehler, PA; Feiler, EJ			Late Wisconsin and Holocene subalpine forests of the Markagunt Plateau of Utah, southwestern Colorado Plateau, USA	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The vegetation and climatic history of subalpine forests on the Colorado Plateau is documented from Lowder Creek Bog and Alpine Pond on the Markagunt Plateau. Pollen and macrofossil data demonstrate substantial changes at sites above 3150 m elevation during the last ca. 13,000 yr. During and after Late Wisconsin deglaciation, subalpine tree species (Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa) were rare or absent near the Lowder Creek Bog site, but nonarboreal species predominated. P. engelmannii-A. lasiocarpa forest became well-established there between 11,000 and 9800 yr BP and subalpine trees dominated this elevation throughout the Holocene. By ca. 8500 yr BP, however, Picea declined somewhat, with minimal pollen and macrofossil deposition occurring between ca. 8500 and 6400 yr BP. Picea trees may have thinned during this time or Picea may have expanded to higher elevations during this part of the Holocene, while Pinus ponderosa expanded at lower elevations. These changes were probably driven by warmer conditions with variable precipitation. Alternative explanations include hydroseral changes within the bog, or insect infestation on Picea. After ca. 6400 yr BP, more consistent Picea pollen influx suggests renewed importance around the bog, which has been maintained until the present. Abies lasiocarpa became more important after ca. 2700 yr ago. The pollen sequence supports an interpretation of high effective precipitation during the early Holocene, followed by warmer temperatures and somewhat variable precipitation after ca. 8500 yr BP. This sequence is most similar to other sites on and near the western, southern, and northeastern Colorado Plateau, where the maximum influence of monsoon activity may have declined by the end of the early Holocene. Declines in summer insolation probably contributed to Late Holocene cooling, with increasing effective precipitation at most sites, including Lowder Creek Bog.																			1523-0430					NOV	1999	31	4					366	378		10.2307/1552585	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552585													WOS:000084350100004
J	Palmer-Felgate, EJ; Bowes, MJ; Stratford, C; Neal, C; MacKenzie, S				Palmer-Felgate, Elizabeth J.; Bowes, Michael J.; Stratford, Charlie; Neal, Colin; MacKenzie, Sally			Phosphorus release from sediments in a treatment wetland: Contrast between DET and EPC0 methodologies	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetlands are capable of reducing nutrient loadings to receiving water bodies, and hence many artificial wetlands have been constructed for wastewater nutrient removal. In this study, diffusive equilibrium in thin films (DETs) and equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC0) analysis were used to examine the role of sediment as a nutrient source or sink in a constructed treatment wetland in summer. The effect of dredging on sediment-water nutrient exchange was also studied. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), ammonium (NH4+) and sulphate (SO42-) concentration profiles were measured by DET across the sediment-water interface (SWI) in both a settling pond and iris reed bed within the wetland. The SRP concentrations in the sediment pore-waters of the settling pond were extremely high (up to 29,500 mu g l(-1)) near the SWI. This is over an order of magnitude higher than the levels found in the water column, which in turn are over an order of magnitude higher than environmental levels proposed to limit eutrophication in rivers. The profiles demonstrated an average net release of SRP and NH4+ from the settling pond sediment to the overlying water of 58 mg m(-2) d(-1) (+/- 32 mg m(-2) d(-1) (1 sd)) and 16 mg m(-2) d(-1) (+/- 25 mg m(-2) d(-1) (1 sd)), respectively. The DET SO42- concentration profiles revealed that the sediment was anoxic within 2 cm of the SWI. Dredging of the reed bed made no significant difference to the P release characteristics across the SWI. The EPC(0)s were much lower than the SRP concentration of the overlying water, indicating that the sediment had the potential to act as a phosphate sink. The apparent contradiction of the DET and EPC0 results is attributed to the fact that DET measurements are made in situ, where as EPC0 measurements are ex situ. These results show that substantial releases of P can occur from wetland sediments, and also highlight the need for caution when interpreting ex situ EPC0 analytical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study thoroughly explored the spatiotemporal variations in stream nitrogen concentrations in a typical headwater watershed in South China. Spatially distributed measurements were conducted during 2020-2022, and mathematical modeling was implemented based on incorporating these data. More than 4,400 data points were collected for water temperature and concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NOx-N), dissolved total nitrogen (DTN), total nitrogen (TN), and dissolved oxygen. Results showed that NOx-N was the largest component of TN, with average concentrations of 1.20 and 1.66 mg L-1, respectively. The stream N2O concentration could be predicted using NH4-N and NOx-N concentrations via the Michaelis-Menten equation. Significant downstream decreases in NH4-N, NOx-N, DTN, and TN concentrations were identified in the largest river in the watershed, and clear spatial differences in these nitrogen concentrations existed among the three main rivers. Clear seasonal and annual variations in stream nitrogen concentrations were observed. NH4-N, NOx-N, DTN, and TN concentrations correlated with cumulative precipitation from the preceding 8-12 days, while stream N2O concentrations correlated over 13-20 days. Stream N2O concentrations and emissions averaged 12.77 nmol L-1 and 1.12 nmol m-2 s-1, respectively, and were lower in summer than in other seasons. Upstream tea plantations, villages, and adjacent agricultural lands significantly affected nitrogen concentrations, while overflow dams did not. These findings highlight nitrogen cycle's complexity and the need for high-resolution data to guide effective watershed management. Stream nitrogen concentrations directly influence water nitrogen pollution, eutrophication, and greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, increasingly intensified human activities and climate change have further complicated the already complex spatiotemporal distribution of stream nitrogen concentrations, making it even more uncertain. As a result, in-depth investigations into the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of stream nitrogen concentrations are urgently needed. In this study, we thoroughly explored the spatiotemporal distribution of stream nitrogen concentrations in a typical headwater watershed in South China, where water quality is significantly influenced by intense human activities, including residential areas, rice and tea cultivation, and the construction of overflow dams. We combined extensive field measurements with mathematical modeling to illustrate the spatiotemporal variations in stream nitrogen concentrations and the corresponding natural and anthropogenic drivers. Our findings revealed that the decreasing trend in stream nitrogen concentrations from upstream to downstream in the largest river could be attributed to upstream human activities, while terrain accounted for the contrasting nitrogen concentrations across different rivers. We also discovered that stream nitrogen concentrations were significantly correlated with cumulative precipitation over the preceding approximately 10 days. Overall, the data and findings from this study have important implications for the management of water environments in headwater watersheds.

Knife Point Glacier contained the first intact, glacially preserved grasshopper specimens found in the past 40 yr. These specimens were found below a crevassed region, and available evidence indicates that they may have been concentrated and preserved within a crevasse 140 +/- 50 yr ago. Morphological assessments of these bodies and cluster analyses of mandible and tibia measurements established that all but one or two of the exposed deposits were comprised of the extinct Rocky Mountain locust, Melanoplus spretus Walsh. Examination of distinct summer-melt strata indicates that this species was deposited at random intervals over a period of 300 yr. The floating section of strata also contained the first known glacial remains of swarms of the extant migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes (F.), and the first record of an insect other than grasshoppers (a parasitic wasp, Copidosoma sp.) having been periodically deposited. A total of six insect orders was found on this glacier. Aerial and runoff samples indicated that the rate of accidental insect deposition on the glacier is very low, and the rate of loss of material from the surficial runoff may exceed a million specimens per year. Bull Lake Glacier also contains at least one very rich deposit of well-preserved M. spretus, but other grasshopper remains appear to be widely scattered across the surface. Grasshopper remains from ice cores of Upper Fremont Glacier were dated from as early as 840 +/- 85 yr before the present, making this the oldest known glacially preserved insect deposit.																			0046-225X					APR	1994	23	2					220	235		10.1093/ee/23.2.220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.220													WOS:A1994NM71200002
J	Feliks, Y				Feliks, Y			Nonlinear dynamics and chaos in the sea and land breeze	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												In this work the evolution of the sea and land breeze is studied using a nonlinear model under calm synoptic conditions and diurnal periodic forcing of ground temperature. The breeze is examined as a function of the strength of the heating amplitude of ground temperature theta(0). For theta(0) less than or equal to 6degreesC, the solution is quasi-periodic with two incommensurate oscillations of 24 and 22.6 h; the last is the inertial oscillation at latitude 32degreesN. A very low frequency oscillation (VLFO) of 16 days, which is the linear combination of the two incommensurate oscillations, is also obtained. For theta(0) = 7degreesC, the solution becomes nonperiodic. For theta(0) greater than or equal to 10degreesC, chaotic solutions are obtained. In the chaotic regime the prominent oscillations can be divided into two classes. One class includes short-time-scale oscillations, such as the 24-h oscillation, the 22.4-h slightly modified inertial oscillation, and their harmonics. The second class incorporates time scales that are larger than a week, such as 15 days, which is a linear combination of the 24- and 22.4-h oscillations. The flow in the second class is in geostrophic balance. The kinetic energy, which manifests spells of very large energy fluctuations, is examined. During these spells the amplitude of the VLFO is large, and the amplitude of the 24- h oscillation is small compared to the spells where the fluctuations in the kinetic energy are small. Analyses of the wind observations in the central coast of Israel in the summer months show great similarity to the model simulation in the chaotic regime. A VLFO of 10 days, which is prominent in its parallel to the shore component, is interpreted to be the result of the nonlinear interaction between the inertial oscillation at the central latitude of the eastern Mediterranean, 33.5degreesN, and the 24-h oscillation as obtained in the present model.																			0022-4928	1520-0469				SEP	2004	61	17					2169	2187		10.1175/1520-0469(2004)061<2169:NDACIT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(2004)061<2169:NDACIT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000223605700004

Recruitment bottlenecks may be present at a number of stages of the reproduction process. To study eggs and fry, it is necessary to identify spawning locations, which is difficult in deep water. Acoustic sampling can be used to rapidly locate aggregations of fish (like spawning lake trout), describe their distribution, and estimate their abundance. To assess these capabilities for application to lake trout, we conducted an acoustic survey covering 22 km(2) at Sheboygan Reef, a deep reef (<40 m summit) in southern Lake Michigan during fall 2005. Data collected with remotely operated vehicles (ROV) confirmed that fish were large lake trout, that lake trout were 1-2 m above bottom, and that spawning took place over specific habitat. Lake trout density exhibited a high degree of spatial structure (autocorrelation) up to a range of similar to 190 m, and highest lake trout and egg densities occurred over rough substrates (rubble and cobble) at the shallowest depths sampled (36-42 m). Mean lake trout density in the area surveyed (similar to 2190 ha) was 5.8 fish/ha and the area surveyed contained an estimated 9500-16,000 large lake trout. Spatial aggregation in lake trout densities, similarity of depths and substrates at which high lake trout and egg densities occurred, and relatively low uncertainty in the lake trout density estimate indicate that acoustic sampling can be a useful complement to other sampling tools used in lake trout restoration research.

Lake Ontario is the lowermost (downstream) of the Great Lakes and has existed for the past 13000 yrs, yet details of the evolution of this lake during this period remain sketchy. Over the summers of 1992 and 1993, piston cores sampled the late Pleistocene and Holocene sediments within the Niagara and Mississauga basins of Lake Ontario. The history of late Pleistocene and Holocene environments and deposition rates are assessed by palaeomagnetic secular variations and stratigraphical descriptions of the sediment. Pollen samples were taken from the sediment to better constrain the palaeomagnetic ages and to establish the boundary between Pleistocene and Holocene deposition at 10500 yr BP. Secular variation type curves were used to provide estimates of the age of the late Pleistocene and Holocene sediments. A description of the stratigraphical sequence is included. The sediments can be divided into six stratigraphical units for which ages have been derived. The lowermost unit is a diamict (upper contact 12500 yr BP). Next in the sequence is a deformed unit (upper contact 12300 yr BP), followed by a thinly laminated unit (upper contact 12000 yr BP), a massive unit (upper contact 11800 11000 yr BP), and an irregularly laminated unit (upper contact 10500 yr BP). The unit deposited in the deep water of the basin since 10500 yr BP is an iron-banded mud. Sedimentation rates of the basin compiled from pollen and from magnetic data are compared and the post-glacial geological history of the Niagara basin of western Lake Ontario is discussed.																			0267-8179					MAY-JUN	1996	11	3					217	231		10.1002/(SICI)1099-1417(199605/06)11:3<217::AID-JQS226>3.0.CO;2-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1417(199605/06)11:3<217::AID-JQS226>3.0.CO;2-0													WOS:A1996UR68900004
J	Shen, CQ; Testa, JM; Song, Y				Shen, Chunqi; Testa, Jeremy M.; Song, Yang			Potential impacts of invasive mussels on long-term carbonate chemistry changes in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												While oceanic and coastal acidification has gained increased attention, long-term pH trends and their drivers in large freshwater systems remain poorly understood. The Laurentian Great Lakes are the world's largest freshwater system, and in many ways resemble marine ecosystems. However, unlike the open ocean and coastal waters where pH has declined due to rising atmospheric CO2, no significant pH trends have been observed in the Laurentian Great Lakes, despite significant ecosystem changes driven partly by the invasion of dreissenid mussels. This study examined 41 years of field observations from Lake Michigan to investigate the long-term carbonate chemistry dynamics. Observational results revealed substantial declines in both total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) over the four decades. Mussel shell calcification emerged as the primary mechanism behind these declines, accounting for 97% and 47% of the observed changes in TA and DIC, respectively, lowering water column pH by 0.24 units. Elevated carbon accumulation in soft mussel tissues, coupled with long-term changes in the air-water pCO2 gradient during summer, significantly contributed to long-term DIC variations, explaining 18% and 28% of the lake-wide DIC loss. These two mechanisms also resulted in an overall pH increase of 0.09 and 0.12 units, largely offsetting the calcification-driven pH decrease. These findings bridge a gap in acidification research for large freshwater systems and provide valuable insights for comprehensive lake-wide management strategies.

J	Shalamov, VA				Shalamov, V. A.			The American Red Cross Activity in Eastern Siberia during the Russian Civil War (1918-1920)	NOVEISHAYA ISTORIYA ROSSII-MODERN HISTORY OF RUSSIA												In mid-1918, the Siberian Commission of the American Red Cross was formed, headed by an American missionary doctor who worked in Japan, Rudolf Teusler. After Admiral Kolchak came to power, the Siberian Commission concluded an agreement to expand the scope of its activities, supply volumes, and payments. The main focus was on the front, which made the Red Cross akin to a White Army supply service, which was contrary to the principles of this organization. Americans drew attention to Eastern Siberia only in the summer of 1919, when Kolchak's army retreated, and the incidence of typhus was rapidly growing in the rear regions. Two hospitals operated by the staff of the American Red Cross were opened in Irkutsk and Verkhneudinsk; gifts were distributed periodically in the form of first-aid items. At the end of 1919, in connection with the approach of the front line to Eastern Siberia, the Americans left the region, transferring medical facilities and supplies of medicines to local authorities. In early 1920, the Siberian Commission was given the opportunity to establish contacts with the Bolshevik authorities, which controlled territories west of Lake Baikal. Members of the commission began to prepare for a new humanitarian mission that would allow for the settlement of Soviet-American relations, return to the original tasks of the Red Cross, and help thousands of needy Siberians and refugees. However, the headquarters of the American Red Cross refused to authorize this activity and by mid-1920 evacuated the remaining personnel and cargo.

J	Momen, B; Zehr, JP				Momen, B; Zehr, JP			Watershed classification by discriminant analyses of lakewater-chemistry and terrestrial characteristics	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We used canonical discriminant analyses to improve an existing classification scheme by identifying those lakewater-chemistry and terrestrial variables that can jointly differentiate among a set of lakes in the Adirondack region of the northeastern USA. We then used predictive discriminant analysis to examine the ability of the models constructed in predicting class membership for lakes with unknown hydrogeological settings into known classes. We used two sets of data collected during summers of 1984-1987 and 1994. For both periods, two main underlying dimensions were identified reflecting watershed hydrogeology and lake dissolved organic carbon. The hydrogeological construct was defined by lakewater concentrations of Ca, Mg, Na, and Si. This construct provides a continuous index from several previously assigned class variables and can help in data reduction and elimination of multicolinearity in further multivariate studies of ecosystem processes in the study lakes. The importance of Ca in defining the hydrogeological construct decreased from 1984-1987 to 1994, due to differential decrease in Ca concentration in the lake classes. The periodic decrease in Ca concentration of many drainage lakes suggests that they continue to lose buffering capacity to acidic deposition and that the current decreased emission and deposition of acidic S compounds may not be sufficient for chemical recovery of these lakes. The construct reflecting lakewater concentration of dissolved organic carbon was defined by lakewater Fe concentration and the lake-volume-weighted watershed areas covered by wetlands and forest. Our methodology and results should provide useful information for studies conducted in the Adirondack watersheds and may be applicable to other regions with properties and environmental issues comparable to those in the Adirondack region.

J	Ott, RF; Whipple, KX; van Soest, M				Ott, Richard F.; Whipple, Kelin X.; van Soest, Matthijs			Incision history of the Verde Valley region and implications for uplift of the Colorado Plateau (central Arizona)	GEOSPHERE												The record of Tertiary landscape evolution preserved in Arizona's transition zone presents an independent opportunity to constrain the timing of Colorado Plateau uplift and incision. We study this record of landscape evolution by mapping Tertiary sediments, volcanic deposits, and the erosional unconformity at their base, 40Ar/39Ar dating of basaltic lava flows in key locations, and constructing geological cross sections along canyons to restore the paleorelief on the Tertiary erosional unconformity to test whether canyon incision requires young (<10 Ma) Colorado Plateau uplift. Our cross sections and new 40Ar/39Ar ages document that in the Verde Valley, relief across the ancestral Mogollon Rim that marks the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau was up to 1000 m and averaged similar to 700 m in the Early-Middle Miocene, which is close to average modern relief of similar to 800-1000 m. Although Middle-Late Miocene volcanics and sediments in places onlap the ancestral Mogollon Rim, suggesting an erosional origin, northeastward erosional retreat of an earlier tectonic escarpment is both plausible and consistent with displacement histories of the Grand Wash fault to the NW and the Diamond Rim fault to the SE. Interestingly, the coincidence of a rugged, sharply defined Mogollon Rim and a wide bench cut into the Hermit shale below the escarpment today suggests that exposure of the Hermit shale may play an important role in cliff retreat and the morphological expression of the Mogollon Rim in the Verde Valley region. Some modern canyons cut into the retreating escarpment reflect re-excavation, deepening, and headward propagation of Miocene paleochannels largely buried by Middle-Late Miocene basalts. Despite evidence for similar total paleorelief, most canyons show significant (similar to 35%) deepening since 5 Ma with young incision decreasing to the SE. Incision rates during the period of active Miocene volcanism were below 20 m/m.y. but accelerated to 50-80 m/m.y. during the past 5-8 m.y. and were probably 100-160 m/m.y. during the Quaternary. The accelerated incision reflects base-level fall associated with breaching of the Verde Lake basin by ca. 2.5 Ma and integration of the Verde River and thus does not require post-Middle Miocene uplift of the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau.

INTERNAL EVOLUTION OF MIAROLITIC GRANITIC PEGMATITES AT THE LITTLE THREE MINE, RAMONA, CALIFORNIA, USA	CANADIAN MINERALOGIST												Miarolitic granitic pegmatites at the Little Three mine property near Ramona, San Diego County, California, USA, possess a bulk composition that closely matches that of a hydrous peraluminous granitic liquid that is saturated with respect to tourmaline at a temperature of similar to 450 degrees C. As such, the pegmatites appear to represent the compositions of the silicate liquid from which they crystallized, which contained <1 wt% B2O3 and minor amounts of Li and F. They do not appear to have contained phenocrysts upon emplacement, and they are neither partially cumulate nor hydrothermal in nature. The Little Three pegmatites are, however, sharply zoned. Chemical zonation across one small dike matches the patterns expected from crystallization of undercooled granitic liquids, in which the far-field diffusion of alkalis and local constitutional zone refining of fluxing and incompatible elements contribute to the chemical and textural changes from the margins inward. Feldspar thermometry records nearly isothermal crystallization at similar to 420 degrees-430 degrees C for dikes from 1 to 2.5 m in thickness. Temperatures recorded by feldspars fall toward the miarolitic center of the thicker (Main) dike, but increase to similar to 500 degrees C in the thinner (Swamp) dike. Fluid inclusions within quartz and topaz from miarolitic cavities of the Main dike contain cryolite, arsenides, arsenates, pollucite, and borates, including Cs borate, the latter of which indicates a higher degree of chemical fractionation than is present in the minerals that line the cavities. Extrapolation along isochores based on the homogenization (200 degrees-225 degrees C) of the low-salinity aqueous fluid (<1 equivalent wt% NaCl) to the temperature of feldspar equilibration (240 degrees-270 degrees C) with the miarolitic cavity points to hydrostatic entrapment pressures of similar to 50 to 100 MPa, which are unrealistically low. If the isochores are extrapolated to 370 degrees +/- 20 degrees C, the temperatures recorded by feldspars in the pegmatite that surrounds the miarolitic pockets, then the entrapment pressure would be similar to 200-250 MPa. Formation of the miarolitic cavities at similar to 370 degrees C and 200-250 MPa is plausible, as the cavities contain zeolites; therefore, the feldspars within the pockets have recrystallized (re-equilibrated) to an extent that they no longer preserve their original compositions.																			0008-4476	1499-1276				AUG	2012	50	4					1025	1054		10.3749/canmin.50.4.1025	http://dx.doi.org/10.3749/canmin.50.4.1025													WOS:000314174400016
J	Hibbs, BJ				Hibbs, Barry J.			Commentary and Review of Modern Environmental Problems Linked to Historic Flow Capacity in Arid Groundwater Basins	GEOSCIENCES												Environmental problems may develop in groundwater basins when water levels change due to long-term wetter or drier climate or land development. A term related to water-level elevation is flow capacity, which develops in aquifers when the water table is at or very close to land surface. Non-capacity develops in systems where the water table is too deep for capillary water to reach the land surface. Flow capacity is the maximum amount of water that an aquifer can transmit. Sufficient moisture is not available for flow capacity to be established in most aquifers in arid zones and these aquifers are at non-capacity, but many aquifers in today's deserts were at flow capacity when paleoclimates were cooler and moister during the late Pleistocene. Climate change and anthropogenic activities can cause aquifers to move toward flow capacity but in the last 15,000 years, almost always toward non-capacity. This paper reviews environmental and geotechnical problems associated with the transition of groundwater basins from flow capacity to non-capacity, and vice versa. Five relevant topics are discussed and evaluated: (1) The effects of flow capacity and non-capacity on groundwater basins targeted for waste repositories; (2) The salt contamination of groundwater where flow capacity was present in the Late Pleistocene and is no longer present; (3) Trace element enrichment in salt crusts in playa sediments and environmental risks to groundwater when the flow systems transition from flow capacity to non-capacity; (4) The development and retention of environmental tracers in arid groundwater flow systems at flow capacity that cannot be explained under conditions of non-capacity; and (5) The relationship of flow capacity to fossil hydraulic gradients and non-equilibrium conditions where there is little groundwater extraction. A case example is provided with each of these topics to demonstrate relevance and to provide an understanding of topics as they relate to land management.																				2076-3263				MAR	2022	12	3							124	10.3390/geosciences12030124	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences12030124													WOS:000775448100001

Ichnological signatures of shallow freshwater lakes in the glacial Itarare Group (Mafra Formation, Upper Carboniferous-Lower Permian of Parana Basin, S Brazil)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Upper Carboniferous-Lower Permian glacigenic deposits of the ltarare Group (Parand Basin) are widely known and cover an extensive area in the southern Brazil. These deposits consist of different arrangements of massive shales, diamictites, rhythmites, and fine- to medium-grained sandstones with trough cross-stratification. Five genetically distinct thickening-, locally coarsening-upward successions of regular rhythmites can be distinguished in the Mafra/Rio Negro region (Santa Catarina and Parana states, southern Brazil), representing the landward portion of an incised valley filled during deglaciation. A low diversity invertebrate ichnofauna composed of a freshwater, shallow burrow-dominated suite. and trackway-dominated suite occurs in these rhythmites. The freshwater shallow burrow-dominated suite is composed of Cochlichnus anguineus, Cruziana cf. problematica, Gordia arcuata, Gordia marina, Hormosiroidea meandrica, Rusophycus cf. carbonarius, and Treptichnus pollardi, as well as Undichnia consulca and intermittent rusophiciform traces. It represents a Mermia ichnocoenosis and occurs in the rhythmites of the upper sets, commonly overlapped by D. gouldi and D. biformis, in palimpsest preservation. D. gouldi and D. biformis compose the trackway-dominated suite, which occur in all ichnofossiliferous paired mudstone-siltstone of the basal sets of the rhythmite succession, and in almost all of the upper sets. It represents an atypical Scoyenia ichnocoenosis and is generally preserved over microbially induced wrinkle structures. The rhythmic deposition suggests distal underwater gravity-flow deposits, filling shallow lakes or ponds in depressed areas, the siltstones deposited by melting currents and the mudstones by sediment fall-out, after the flux ceased. The abundant wrinkle structures suggest quiet waters. The overlying deposits bearing a brackish-water ichnofauna and marine fossils suggest a coastal setting, connected with the sea. Although atypical, the occurrence of a Scoyenia ichnocoenosis in almost all ichnofassiliferous rhythmite couplets. preserved over wrinkle structures or overlapping Mermia ichnocoenosis, suggests that these shallow lakes were episodically dried up, at least partially. The present data allow interpreting the regular ichnofossiliferous rhythmites of the Mafra Formation as deposited in shallow lakes or ponds developed in outwash plains at the landward side of a fjord embayment during deglaciation.

High latitude lakes in the subarctic and arctic permafrost regions have particularly been vulnerable given the "Arctic amplification " phenomenon and acceleration in warming rate in the northern hemisphere (0.2 -0.8 degrees C/decade). This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the last 30 years of research investigating how subarctic and Arctic lakes respond to climate warming. The review focused on studies where remote sensing technology was used to quantify these responses. The difference between summer lake water temperature and air temperature varied between 1.7 and 5.4 degrees C in subarctic lakes and 2.4 -3.2 degrees C in Arctic lakes. Overall, the freezing date of lake ice is generally delayed and the date of lake thawing occurs earlier. Lake surface area (4 -48.5 %), and abundance in the subarctic and Arctic region have increased significantly due to rising temperature, permafrost thawing, increased precipitation and other localized surface disturbances. However, in recent years, instances of lake shrinkage (between -0.4 % and -40 %) have also been reported, likely due to riparian overflow, groundwater infiltration and lateral drainage. Furthermore, in subarctic and Arctic lakes, climate change and permafrost thawing would release CO 2 and CH 4 , and alter carbon dynamics in impacted lakes through various interconnected processes which could potentially affect the quality of carbon (terrestrial, algae) entering a lake system. The review also highlighted a potential intersection between permafrost melting and public health through human exposure to long -buried viruses. Subarctic and arctic ecosystems' responses to climate change will continue to be an area of intense research interest, and this review has highlighted priority areas for research and how remote sensing technologies can facilitate the pursuit of such a research agenda.

Limnological Characterization and First Data on the Occurrence of Toxigenic Cyanobacteria and Cyanotoxins in the Plankton of Some Lakes in the Permafrost Zone (Yakutia, Russia)	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The first data on the distribution of cyanobacterial toxins have been obtained and a molecular genetic determination of cyanotoxin producers in the plankton of some lakes in the permafrost zone in Yakutia have been performed for the first time. Most of the lakes are characterized by high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and chlorophyll a and by an increased content of organic matter, which could be associated with a high anthropogenic load. Water blooms were visually observed in three of the six studied lakes during the summer period. The abundance and biomass of cyanobacteria in the lakes varied within 13.7-676.3 million cells/L and 0.6-4.8 mg/L, respectively. Eight species of potentially toxigenic cyanobacteria were found in phytoplankton using light microscopy. Regions of the mcyE gene involved in the biosynthesis of microcystin were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction method in environmental DNA isolated from planktonic samples. Cyanobacteria capable of producing neurotoxic anatoxin-a, saxitoxins, and hepatotoxic nodularins were absent in the lakes during the study period. The use of genus-specific primers to the mcyE gene enables us to find that the main producers of microcystins were represented by species of the genus Microcystis in most of the lakes and by species of Dolichospermum only in one of the lakes. Up to eight structural variants of microcystins, in general, arginine-containing isoforms MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-YR, MC-LY, MC-HIlR, [Asp(3)]MC-LR, [Asp(3)]MC-RR, and [Asp(3)]MC-YR, were identified in lake plankton using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The maximal concentration of microcystins in plankton (intracellular fraction 803 ng/L) was recorded in a sample from Ytyk-Kyuyol Lake. The calculated content of microcystins per unit biomass of producing cyanobacteria (toxin quota) was low (0.005-0.069 mu g/mg). In order to assess the potential hazard of toxigenic species of cyanobacteria to human health, the distribution of cyanotoxins and their producers should be further studied in water bodies of the region.

B.; Casazza, Marco			LEAP-WEAP analysis of urban energy-water dynamic nexus in Beijing (China)	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												Based on LEAP and WEAP, this paper establishes the coupled model of energy and water in cities. With Beijing as a case, 26 scenarios are designed to explore the energy saving/water saving of different policies in Beijing in the future and its nexus effect, including the sensitivity analysis of the results. The results show that the total energy consumption in Beijing will grow slowly by year. Carbon emissions will peak in 2020, and fluctuate after 2035 it will slowly increase until 2050. Total water demand is stable between 3.6 and 4.1 billion cubic meters. According to the forecasted water supply capacity, there is no shortage of water supply and demand. The proportion of groundwater from the source of water supply fell to 27%, and the proportion of water in the South-to-North Water Transfer increased to 40%. The total energy saving of the "13th Five-Year Plan" water saving policy is 1.003 million tons of standard coal, which is equivalent to 8.165 billion kWh of electricity. The energy saving policy has reached 276 million cubic meters of water, equivalent to 140 Kunming Lakes. The energy demand of residents' lives, service industry, construction industry and traditional manufacturing industry has a good correlation with water demand value, which proved they are important water-coupled sectors. In terms of energy-saving/water-saving effects in different scenarios and recent/long range periods, the industrial structure optimization policy showed good energy-saving potential in the short-term, but the long-term energy-saving effect was not obvious, while it was accompanied by an increase in water consumption. The irrigation technology innovation and planting structure optimization scenarios in the agricultural sector have better energy saving and water saving effects in the short term. However, with the occurrence and further expansion of water shortage, the medium and long term the water saving effect is sill, while the energy saving effect is not significant. The sensitivity analysis shows that the parameters of the scenario such as economic slowdown, industrial structure optimization, development of public transportation, and planting structure optimization are more sensitive. For the synergistic effect of water and energy conservation, the synergy effect is more obvious in the energy saving scenarios of the service industry and the industrial sector. For the policies of the same department, the synergistic saving effect of the situation of improving energy intensity is obvious. From the perspective of the difficulty in policy implementation process and overview effects, the water saving and energy saving policies of the industrial sector face more difficulties while implementation. The external power regulation policy and the capital rising residents' wareness of water saving policy has good performance both in the difficulty of implementation and overview effects.

Modeling Circulation and Hydrodynamic Connectivity in Bras d'Or Lakes using Nested-Grid Approach	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Bras d'Or Lakes (BdOL) is a land-locked estuarine system in central Cape Breton Island. Nova Scotia, Canada. Recent outbreaks of waterborne diseases at several sites in the BdOL have decimated shellfish populations and threaten its unusual biodiversity. Assessing the potential for spread of invasive pathogens is a priority for management. A nested-grid hydrodynamic modeling system is used to simulate the three-dimensional (3D) circulation and temperature-salinity distributions for summer 1974, when currents and hydrographic measurements suitable for model calibration were made at several locations. The modeled 3D velocity fields are then used in Eulcrian-Lagrangian transform to study the spatial patterns of retention and dispersion of passive particles, as a proxy for the spread of disease by water flow its the estuary. Probabilities of transfers (connectivity) among 10 sub-domains of the BdOL are calculated from the statistics of the 3D particle trajectories and portrayed in a transition matrix. The model results demonstrate that the hydrodynamic connectivity among the several small bays in the western portion of the BdOL (ranging frons 0.1% to 13.5%) is much weaker than those among the main basins (16% to 62.4%) at monthly time scales. Restriction by narrow passages between the small bays and the main basins reduce connectivity among populations and their habitats, but the effect is partially offset by density-driven flows associated with freshwater inputs at the land boundaries. The model can be used to guide epidemiological surveys and generate testable hypotheses of disease spread and species invasions within the ecosystem.																			0749-0208	1551-5036					2008					52		57	70																WOS:000207739600006

Serling Co, which undergoes frequent lake-level changes in central Tibet, is an ideal study area; however, the paleohydrological evolution of this region remains contested. In this study, we analyzed tetraether lipids in Serling Co sediments and successfully reconstructed quantitatively the lake-level history since 25.1 cal kyr BP using its derived lake-level proxies (%OH-GDGTs, %Cren, and Cren/Cren' ratio) and salinity proxies (the relative abundance of archaeol to caldarchaeol (ACE) and archaeol to brGDGTs (ACE')). The results indicate that Serling Co experienced a low lake-level stage during the Last Glacial Maximum, a severe fluctuation stage during the last deglaciation, and a relatively high lake-level stage in the Holocene, corresponding to typical climatic events. The evolution of the lake level in Serling Co is comparable to paleoclimate records from the Tibetan Plateau, sug-gesting consistent Indian summer monsoon (ISM) dynamics. The increase in precipitation caused by the enhanced ISM may be the main cause for the rise of the lake level in Serling Co during the Bolling/Allerod and Early Holocene. From 7.8 to 1.8 cal kyr BP, Serling Co maintained a relatively stable lake level under a moderate monsoon intensity and reduced solar radiation. After 1.8 cal kyr BP, Serling Co shrank rapidly under a series of chain reactions caused by the weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. We emphasize the importance of long-term precipitation-evaporation balance on lake level variation, particularly for some large lakes in arid and semi-arid regions, and that climate events affect the lake level by breaking this balance. Our study provides the first quantitative record of lake-level changes in central Tibet during the Late Quaternary and clarifies the role and mechanism of climate change in the process of hydrological evolution in this region, which may serve as a general reference for the study of hydrological evolution in the transition region between the ISM and the westerlies.					; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023	Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				MAY	2023	224								104113	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2023.104113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2023.104113		APR 2023											WOS:000981156000001

However, there are few highly resolved (subdecadal) paleoclimate records from this area that provide a long-term perspective on recent climatic changes. Here, we investigate a new composite sedimentary sequence from Linnevatnet, western Spitsbergen, spanning the last similar to 2,000 years. The chronology of this new composite laminated sequence is supported by four radiometric dates. Prior to conducting paleoclimate investigations on these lake sediments, we investigated the sediment sources entering Linnevatnet. Sediment samples collected around the lake's watershed indicate that the main sediment sources come from the eastern carbonate valley wall as well as Linneelva, the main river system. Micro-X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) results indicate that calcium is the largest component of sediment delivered to the delta-proximal basin, where the sedimentary record was collected. Percentage organics deduced from loss-on-ignition measurements reveal an antiphased relationship with calcium and magnetic susceptibility, implying that the sediment loading at the core site is largely modulated by the alternation of calcium derived from carbonates of the eastern flanks of the valley and by coal-bearing sandstone from Linneelva, derived from the main river inflow that drains the central valley. Linneelva is mainly fed by snow and glacier meltwaters from Linnebreen, the small valley glacier now located 7 km south of Linnevatnet. Because Linnebreen is underlain by coal-bearing sandstone, organic content in Linnevatnet lake sediments can be used as an indicator of glacier activity. Annually resolved parameters-that is, calcium and grain size-were found to be strongly correlated to temperature inferred from nearby Lomonosovfonna delta O-18 ice record as well as the wider reconstructed Northern Hemisphere winter temperature. The coarsest grain size, highest calcium values, and lowest concentration of organics occurred just in recent years, suggesting that glacier influence on the sedimentary input to Linnevatnet is now at an all-time low in the context of the past millennia.					; Bradley, Raymond/P-9358-2015; Farnsworth, Wesley/AAO-5572-2021	Farnsworth, Wesley/0000-0001-7375-2228; 													1523-0430	1938-4246				DEC 31	2023	55	1							2223403	10.1080/15230430.2023.2223403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2023.2223403													WOS:001023820400001
J	Snyder, GT; Fehn, U				Snyder, GT; Fehn, U			Origin of iodine in volcanic fluids:: 129I results from the Central American Volcanic Arc	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The largest reservoir of crustal iodine is found in marine sediments, where it is closely associated with organic material. This presence, together with the existence of a long-lived, cosmogenic radioisotope I-129 (t(1/2)=15.7 Ma), make this isotopic system well suited for the study of sediment recycling in subduction zones. Reported here are the results of I-129/I ratios in volcanic fluids, collected during a comprehensive study of fluids and gases in the Central American Volcanic Arc. I-129/I ratios, together with I, Br, and Cl concentrations, were determined in 79 samples from four geothermal centers and a number of crater lakes, fumaroles, hot springs, and surface waters in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Geothermal and volcanic fluids were found to have iodine concentrations substantially higher than values in seawater or meteoric waters. I-129/I ratios in most of the geothermal fluids are below the preanthropogenic input ratio of 1500x10(-15), demonstrating that recent anthropogenic additions are largely absent from the volcanic systems. The majority of the I-129/I ratios are between 500 and 800x10(-15). These ratios indicate minimum iodine ages between 25 and 15 Ma, in good agreement with the age of subducted-sediments in this region. In all four geothermal systems, however, a few samples were found with iodine ages older than 40 Ma-that is, considerably below the expected age range for subducted sediments from the Cocos Plate. These samples probably reflect the presence of iodine derived from sediments in older accreted oceanic terraines. The iodine ages indicate that the magmatic end member for the volcanic fluids originates in the deeper parts of the subducted sediment column, with small additions from older iodine mobilized from the overlying crust. The high concentrations of iodine in geothermal fluids, combined with the observed iodine ages, demonstrate that remobilization in the main volcanic zone (and probably also in the forearc area) is an important part in the overall marine cycle of iodine and similar elements.

Thus, it is crucial to prevent new introductions, and the secondary spread of invasive alien species (IAS) already present through a collective effort of all water users. Adopting biosecurity measures is an efficient way to decrease the unintentional transportation of IAS on equipment due to human activities. To inform the development of the first biosecurity campaign for Belgian anglers, a national online survey was conducted during the spring of 2023, generating over 3000 individual responses. This study had two main objectives: 1) to gain a better understanding of the risk of IAS transport by recreational anglers, and 2) to inform the development of a communication campaign by assessing anglers' awareness and perception of the issue of biological invasions. The results revealed a major risk of anglers inadvertently introducing IAS into previously uninvaded ecosystems, either through the unintentional transfer of organisms during a single outing (25% of anglers) or by transporting them from abroad (45% of anglers). This risk is compounded by the fact that only 8% of anglers adhere to the full check-clean-dry routine after each trip, and mobile anglers were not necessarily more proficient at cleaning their equipment. Additionally, some anglers admitted to occasionally releasing bait or translocating undesired species. Despite limited awareness of biological invasions, respondents generally had a negative perception of IAS. As a result, anglers could be considered an ally in the fight against IAS. The results of this baseline survey will inform future action plans to reduce invasion levels and raise awareness among the angling community in Belgium. It will aid in designing adequate messages, efficiently reaching the target audience, and assessing the campaign's influence on angler habits and awareness.																			1989-8649					SEP	2025	16	3					677	698		10.3391/mbi.2025.16.3.06	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2025.16.3.06													WOS:001591529700006

We also checked the possibilities of the occurrence of the edge effect consisting in increased abundance and diversity of the community developing in the transition zone between two habitats, as well as in the presence of taxa specific for only that zone. The study area was the middle part of the Wloclawek Reservoir (the lower Vistula River, central Poland). In 2002-2003, we sampled air-exposed (above the water line, at the water line) and submerged (0.5 m and 1 m depth) sites from a sandy area situated in the flooded part of the reservoir and a small cove overgrown with macrophytes, with sediments rich in organic matter. In the organic-rich sediments, biodiversity and abundance were higher at the exposed sites than at the submerged ones. Furthermore, we found numerous specific taxa, which occurred only in the land-water interface of the organic-rich habitat (semi-terrestrial Diptera, terrestrial and amphibious Oligochaeta, Endochironomus sp. (impar group), Valvata cristata, Anisus contortus and Coleoptera larvae). Thus, all symptoms of the edge effect were observed there. On the other hand, the sandy shore was a simple transition zone. Some symptoms of the edge effect appeared (high biodiversity and the presence of a few amphibious taxa) but the abundance was extremely low compared with that found at the submerged sites. Individuals inhabiting the sandy transition zone formed accidental assemblages, widely differing from one sample to another. The homogeneous unstable land-water interface on the sandy shore is a poor habitat for macroinvertebrates, which are washed out by wave action, have no protection against air exposure and freezing, and their substratum may be totally destroyed in winter by ice drifting downstream. On the other hand, organic-rich sediments are more stable and provide much better protection and food conditions for the fauna living near the water line.

This study investigates the physical properties of the epi- and metalimnion of Lake Biwa (Japan), focusing on the persistent vertical diffusive fluxes due to turbulent mixing in the lower metalimnion and their effects on upward nitrate transport. We conducted 24-h observations at an offshore station in the summer for three consecutive years to examine the temporal and vertical variations of stratification and turbulence. A mooring system provided long-term data on stratification and current velocity, while thermal profiles along two offshore transects were collected to investigate lateral changes. Our findings revealed strong stratification in the upper metalimnion, where vertical diffusive fluxes were essentially suppressed. Distinct turbulent mixing layers were identified near the water surface and within the moderately stratified lower metalimnion. Field data and numerical model suggested that the turbulence in the lower metalimnion was driven by shear instability, straining, and/or wave-wave interactions linked with the persistent internal waves that occur even during weak winds. Vertical eddy diffusivity of > 10(-5) m(2) s(-1) in the lower metalimnion was associated with rather strong turbulence, which has not been reported in other large lakes. The elevated turbulence resulted in an upward nitrate flux of 0.2 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) across the lower metalimnion, indicating that the upward nutrient transport could support primary productivity and play an important ecological role in deep stratified lakes.					; Ostrovsky, Ilia/M-4831-2017	Homma, Hikaru/0000-0002-4125-220X; Ostrovsky, Ilia/0000-0002-0247-7844; Yamazaki, Hidekatsu/0000-0001-8794-2188													0024-3590	1939-5590				FEB	2025	70	2					443	460		10.1002/lno.12769	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12769		DEC 2024											WOS:001385815600001

The primary precipitation process has long been believed to be abiotic due to evaporation, leading to phase supersaturation. However, biotic interactions of microbial metabolism, organic compounds, and dissolved ions leading to mineral precipitation has been shown in laboratory studies using single-organism culture. The increase in pH inducing calcium carbonate precipitation due to oxygenic photosynthesis by Cyanobacteria and the release of ions due to organic matter decomposition by Firmicutes-inducing magnesium carbonate precipitation are recognized examples. As microbes do not live as pure cultures in natural environments but form complex communities, such pure culture lab studies do not reflect natural conditions. In this study, we grew natural complex microbial communities in microcosm conditions using filtered brine as water column and two types of natural gypsum substrates, and we replenished incubations to avoid evaporation. We monitored microbial communities through optical microscopy and analyzed mineral paragenesis in association with and without microbes, using different analytical techniques, such X-ray diffraction, and optical and field emission scanning electron microscopies. To detect changes throughout the experiment, small amounts of water column brine were extracted for physicochemial determinations. We were able to detect mineral paragenesis, avoiding evaporation, including major phases of chemical sedimentary rocks, such as gypsum, calcium carbonate, and some silicates in association to microbes. In addition, we evidenced that the use of natural substrates positively impacts growth of microbial communities, promoting the development of more biomass. This study can be seen as the first attempt and proof of concept of differentiating biotic and abiotic participation in evaporitic deposits, as they can form mineral paragenesis without evaporation. Future studies with microcosm experiments using microbial mats will be needed to establish mineral precipitation induced by micro-organisms and their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), specifically to replicate mineral paragenesis sedimented from natural brines.

Here we present a new method of reconstructing socio-economic shifts in a rural setting from the analysis of the frequency of oribatid mite remains present in a sedimentary lake sequence. Oribatid mites are soil-dwelling microarthropod detritivores, some of which inhabit areas of grassland pasture. One of the primary controls governing their abundance in such habitats is the level of animal dung present. We propose that past fluctuations in mite remains can be related to the density of domestic animals using the area of pasture and, by extension, may provide a proxy for broad-scale social and economic change through time. To test this hypothesis, we analysed a high-resolution (similar to 6 years) mite record from a sequence of well-dated sediments from Marcacocha, a climatically sensitive lake site located close to an important Inca trading route across the Andes. The timing and magnitude of mite fluctuations at Marcacocha since the 1530s show remarkable correspondence with a series of major, well-documented socio-economic shifts in the region relating to political and climatic pressures. This provided the confidence to extend the record back a further 700 years and reconstruct changes in domestic herbivore densities for a period of time that lacks historical documentation and thereby infer changes in human occupation of the basin. In particular, high mite abundances appear to correspond clearly with the rapid rise and fall of the Inca Empire (c. AD 1400-1532). We argue that small lake basins such as Marcacocha may be particularly suitable for obtaining continuous oribatid mite records and providing the possibility of reconstructing large herbivore abundances in the Andes and elsewhere.

J	BRONMARK, C; KLOSIEWSKI, SP; STEIN, RA				BRONMARK, C; KLOSIEWSKI, SP; STEIN, RA			INDIRECT EFFECTS OF PREDATION IN A FRESH-WATER, BENTHIC FOOD-CHAIN	ECOLOGY												Theories of cascading trophic interactions provide specific predictions regarding the forces that regulate populations across trophic levels. Reducing predators in a food chain with three trophic levels should permit herbivores to increase, thus reducing primary producers. In a manipulative experiment involving a molluscivorous fish (pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus), freshwater snails, and periphytic algae, we tested this prediction. With 10 cages (3 x 3 x 2 m) in each of two lakes in northern Wisconsin, we generated three treatments: exclosures (fishless), enclosures (three pumpkinseed sunfish), and cageless controls, both in Mann Lake, which had high natural densities of pumpkinseed sunfish (HDP), and in Round Lake, which had low densities (LDP). During a 16-mo experiment, we quantified snail and periphyton biomass on plastic flagging within treatments during summer at 3- and 6-wk intervals in 1986 and 1987, respectively. Predation by pumpkinseed sunfish reduced snail biomass on flagging, permitting periphyton biomass to increase, as compared to exclosures. As expected, periphyton biomass in cageless controls in Mann Lake (HDP) mirrored periphyton biomass in enclosures, whereas cageless controls in Round Lake (LDP) differed from exclosures. The periphyton assemblage changed dramatically with increasing grazing pressure. In enclosures (low grazing), filamentous algae and large, stalked diatoms dominated the periphyton assemblage, whereas in exclosures (high grazing), assemblages were dominated by small, adnate diatoms and a colonial, filamentous bluegreen alga (Gloeotrichia). In laboratory trials, snails preferentially fed on periphyton from enclosures (where grazing pressure had been low). Predation reduced snail density, but indirectly increased periphyton biomass, dramatically modifying species composition of the assemblage. Thus, in mesotrophic Wisconsin lakes, top-down interactions regulate the benthic, freshwater food chain.																			0012-9658					OCT	1992	73	5					1662	1674		10.2307/1940018	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1940018													WOS:A1992JP74000015

Impact of a Historical Fire Event on Pyrogenic Carbon Stocks and Dissolved Pyrogenic Carbon in Spodosols in Northern Michigan	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Inventories of fire-derived (pyrogenic) C (PyC) stocks in soils remain incomplete for many parts of the world, yet are critical to reduce uncertainties in global PyC estimates. Additionally, PyC dynamics in soils remain poorly understood. For example, dissolved PyC (DPyC) fluxes from soil horizons, as well as the influence of historical fire events on these fluxes and soil PyC stocks remain poorly quantified. In this study, we examined stock and concentration differences in soil PyC and leached DPyC, respectively, between two forest types in the Great Lakes region (USA): (1) a red pine (Pious resinosa) forest planted after the site had experienced post-logging slash burning in the late nineteenth century (100 year-burned site), and (2) a sugar maple Ocer saccharum) forest that showed no evidence of burning in the past 250 years (unburned site). We hypothesized that the 100 year-burned site would have greater PyC stocks and concentrations of DPyC compared to the unburned site. We measured PyC in soil, as well as DPyC in soil water leaching from 0 and F horizons following a spring snowmelt event in both 100 year burned and unburned sites. Additionally, we measured DPyC drained from B horizons in 100 year-burned site. In organic horizons. PyC stocks were 1.8 (0i) and 2.3 (]e) times greater in the 100 year-burned site than in the unburned site. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, DPyC concentrations did not differ between sites. On average, DPyC leached from all sites contributed 3.11 0.27% of the total dissolved organic carbon pool. In the 100 year-burned site, a significant decline in concentrations of DPyC leaving the B horizon was attributed to the immobilization of this C pool in the Al and Fe oxides-rich subsoil. Even though PyC stock in 0 horizons was higher in 100 year-burned than in unburned site, our results did not support our initial hypothesis that the 100 year-burned site would have greater DPyC concentrations than the unburned site, suggesting that any differences in DPyC resulting from a single fire event are either not detectable after >100 years post-burn, and/or that the release of DPyC is a continuous, long-term process resulting from the degradation of historically accumulated PyC.					; Reed, Sasha/ABE-9476-2020	Santos, Fernanda/0000-0001-9155-5623; Miesel, Jessica/0000-0001-7446-464X; Wagner, Sasha/0000-0001-6184-5734; 														2296-6463				OCT 16	2017	5								80	10.3389/feart.2017.00080	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2017.00080													WOS:000419428700001

Plant Pigments in Water of the Volga River Reservoirs: Current Status and Trends in Long-Term Changes	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Data on the composition and content of photosynthetic pigments in plankton of the Volga River reservoirs in the summers of 2015-2023 are under consideration. The determination of pigments was carried out using standard spectrophotometric methods. Chl a concentrations are similar to those obtained in 1989-1991. The distribution of Chl a throughout the water area of reservoirs retains its long-term characteristics. The waters of tributaries, coastal waters, and shallow water areas are characterized by an increased abundance of phytoplankton. A negative relationship between reservoir-average Chl a concentrations and the total inflow volume (R-2 = 0.50) and a direct dependence on water temperature (R-2 = 0.35) are revealed. Based on the average Chl a concentrations over the years of observation, the current trophic status of the Ivankovo, Uglich, and Cheboksary reservoirs is assessed as eutrophic (29.5 +/- 1.9, 22.7 +/- 1.6, and 28.2 +/- 2.7 mu g/L respectively); the Saratov and Volgograd reservoirs are mesotrophic (6.8 +/- 0.6 and 9.6 +/- 0.8 mu g/L); and Kuybyshev and Gorky reservoirs are moderately eutrophic (13.0 +/- 0.7 and 13.1 +/- 1.4 mu g/L). The content of additional chlorophylls b and c, pheopigments, and plant carotenoids and their ratio with chlorophyll a, as well as the composition of green pigments in the Volga River reservoirs, are characterized by significant similarity and have not changed over the 30-year period.

Adding Further Pieces to the Synchronization Puzzle: QBO, Bimodality, and Phase Jumps	SOLAR PHYSICS												This work builds on a recently developed self-consistent synchronization model of the solar dynamo which attempts to explain Rieger-type periods, the Schwabe/Hale cycle, and the Suess-de Vries and Gleissberg cycles in terms of resonances of various wave phenomena with gravitational forces exerted by the orbiting planets. We start again from the basic concept that the spring tides of the three pairs of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter excite magneto-Rossby waves at the solar tachocline. While the quadratic action of the sum of these three waves comprises the secondary beat period of 11.07 years, the main focus is now on the action of the even more pronounced period of 1.723 years. Our dynamo model provides oscillations with exactly that period, which is also typical for the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Most remarkable is its agreement with Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) events which preferentially occur in the positive phase of an oscillation with a period of 1.724 years. While bimodality of the sunspot distribution is shown to be a general feature of synchronization, it becomes most strongly expressed under the influence of the QBO. This may explain the observation that the solar activity is relatively subdued when compared to that of other sun-like stars. We also discuss anomalies of the solar cycle, and subsequent phase jumps by 180 degrees. In this connection it is noted that the very 11.07-year beat period is rather sensitive to the time-averaging of the quadratic functional of the waves and prone to phase jumps of 90 degrees. On this basis, we propose an alternative explanation of the observed 5.5-year phase jumps in algae-related data from the North Atlantic and Lake Holzmaar that were hitherto attributed to optimal growth conditions.

Ultraviolet to near-infrared spectroscopy of the potentially hazardous, low delta-V asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3 Backup target of the sample return mission MarcoPolo-R	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												Context. Primitive near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are important subjects of study for current planetary research. Their investigation can provide crucial information on topics such as the formation of the solar system, the emergence of life, and the mitigation of the risk of asteroid impact. Sample return missions from primitive asteroids have been scheduled or are being studied by space agencies, including the MarcoPolo-R mission selected for the assessment study phase of ESA M3 missions. Aims. We want to improve our knowledge of the surface composition and physical nature of the potentially hazardous, low delta-V asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3, backup target of MarcoPolo-R. This intriguing object shows an as-yet unexplained spectral variability. Methods. We performed spectroscopic observations of 1996 FG3 using the visible spectrograph DOLORES at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG), and the UV-to-NIR X-Shooter instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). Results. We find featureless spectra and we classify 1996 FG3 as a primitive Xc-type in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy. Based on literature comparison, we confirm the spectral variability of this object at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, and find that spectral variations exist also for the visible spectral region. Phase reddening cannot explain such variations. Obtained with the same observational conditions for the whole 0.3-2.2 mu m range, our X-Shooter spectrum allowed a proper comparison with the RELAB meteorite database. A very good fit is obtained with the very primitive C2 Tagish Lake carbonaceous chondrite (pressed powder), confirming 1996 FG3 as a suitable target for a sample return mission from primitive NEAs. Conclusions. We hypothesize a compacted/cemented surface for 1996 FG3, like that observed by the Hayabusa mission on (25143) Itokawa, with the possible presence of regions showing different degrees of surface roughness. This variegation could be related to the binary nature of 1996 FG3, but to check this hypothesis further observations are necessary.

Twenty-five cyanobacterial bloom samples were collected from open and coastal waters of the Baltic Sea during 1985 to 1987, and their toxicity was determined by mouse bioassay. All of 5 bloom samples from the southern Baltic Sea, 6 of 6 from the open northern Baltic Sea (Gulf of Finland), and 7 of 14 Finnish coastal samples were found to contain hepatotoxic cyanobacteria. Nodularia spumigena and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae occurred together in high amounts in blooms from the open-sea areas. In addition, coastal samples contained the species Anabaena lemmermannii, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Oscillatoria agardhii. Eighteen hepatotoxic N. spumigena cultures were isolated from water bloom and open-sea water samples. High-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of both hepatotoxic bloom samples and Nodularia strains showed a single toxic fraction. The toxin concentrations of the blooms were .ltoreq.2.4 mg/g of freeze-dried material, and those of laboratory-grown cultures were 2.5 to 8.0 mg/g of freeze-dried cells. A single toxin was isolated from three N. spumigena-containing bloom samples and three N. spumigena laboratory isolates. Amino acid analysis and low- and high-resolution of fast-atom bombardment mass spectroscopy indicated that the toxin from all of the sources was a cyclic pentapeptide (molecular weight, 824) containing glutamic acid, .beta.-methylaspartic acid, arginine, N-methyldehydrobutyrine, and 3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyl-4,6-decadienoic acid. This indicates that the Baltic Sea toxin is nodularin, the cyclic pentapeptide produced by field and laboratory-cultured N. spumigena previously reported from New Zealand brackish water lakes. The signs of poisoning by the pentapeptide were similar to those reported for the heptapeptide toxins from other cyanobacteria.

J	Qu, FT; Kuyvenhoven, A; Shi, XP; Heerink, N				Qu, Futian; Kuyvenhoven, Arie; Shi, Xiaoping; Heerink, Nico			Sustainable natural resource use in rural China: Recent trends and policies	CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW												In this paper we provide an overview of recent trends in the availability and quality of land and water resources in rural China, and examine the common presumption that rural resources are rapidly degrading in China. Data based on consistent definitions and measurement methods that have recently become available are used to that end. In addition, we analyse the impact of new policy initiatives to introduce market-based instruments and new institutions to address land degradation and water scarcity problems. We find that the decline in cultivated area has accelerated in the beginning of the new century. Ecological recovery programs, not urbanization and industrialization, are the major factors causing this decline. Ecological recovery programs are also a major force behind the increase in forest land area and the reduction of water erosion. Modest successes can be observed in the protection of wetlands and (until the mid-1980s) for the average quality of cultivated land. On the other hand, degradation of natural grassland and wind erosion have become much more severe in recent decades. In northern China, particularly in the 341 (Hai and Luan, Huai and Huang) river basins, the availability of water has tightened. Groundwater tables have fallen considerably in the Hai river basin, because farmers increasingly rely on groundwater for irrigation. Evidence on other parts of northern China is mixed. Pollution of surface water is getting worse since the beginning of the 1990s in two major lakes in southern China and until recently in the rivers in northern China. Water quality problems in the larger rivers in southern China are less severe and getting less. These problems are to a large extent caused by agriculture-based non-point source pollution, especially in the major lakes and reservoirs. The sloping land conversion program, water pricing, and the establishment of water user associations and payments for environmental service projects are used as cases to examine the introduction of market-based instruments and new institutions. We argue that less government interference in the implementation of these instruments and institutions is likely to enhance ecological as well the economic benefits. Moreover, supportive measures to improve the functioning of land and labor markets are usually needed to ensure the sustainability of the impact of interventions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

J	Gates, RR				Gates, RR			Notes on the tundra of Russian Lapland	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The plant breeding station at Khibiny, which lies in latitude 67[degree] 44[image], north of the White Sea, is the most northerly plant-breeding station in the Avorld. The summers are 10-11 weeks. There is very little rain May-Aug. but it is very rainy Aug-Oct. The winds are very strong and almost continuous. The lowest recorded temp. is [long dash] 38[degree]C. and the maximum 30[degree]C. In ascending a 1500 ft. peak different plant associations are found. On the lower slopes are Pinus sylvestris var. lapponica, Picea obovata, Betula pubescens, B. verrucosa, and B. nana. In the undergrowth are Vaccinium uliginosum, V. myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Rubus saxatilis as well as the mosses Hylo-comium splendens, Hypnum schreberi, Polytrichum commune, and P. stricta, and the lichens Cladonia alpestris and C. rangiferina. On the next higher level are scattering Pinus and Picea with V. myrtillus and V. uliginosum. At the 3rd level are found small scattered Picea obovata, Betula pubescens, and Pinus. The Picea are covered with lichens. The open spaces are covered with Vaccinium. Still farther beyond the tree line the typical plants are Arctostaphylos alpinus, Cladonias, Betula nana, Juniperus nana, mats of reduced Vactinium and Andromeda polifolia, and several species of Carex. Still higher on the rocky exposed slopes are found Picea, Betula nana, and Juniperus nana as creepers. At the extreme top are Linnaea borealis, Dryas octopetala, and Juncus. Along the lake shore and in ascending the river a succession of plant associations is noted. Different types of tundra (rock and moor) are discussed.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1928	16						150	160		10.2307/2255847	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2255847													WOS:000200131800007
J	MCKENZIE, JA				MCKENZIE, JA			PLUVIAL CONDITIONS IN THE EASTERN SAHARA FOLLOWING THE PENULTIMATE DEGLACIATION - IMPLICATIONS FOR CHANGES IN ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PATTERNS WITH GLOBAL WARMING	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												During the transition from the penultimate glacial to the last interglacial period (Isotope Stages 6-5e or Terminal II), large freshwater lakes abruptly infilled sandy depressions in arid regions of the eastern Sahara. Geochemical and mineralogical studies of samples from lacustrine sequences in the Western Desert of southern Egypt indicate: (1) The sediments are chalk composed of authigenic chemical precipitates, predominantly low-Mg calcite, with carbonate contents averaging about 80%. The low dilution of the chemical precipitate by detrital input implies that physical erosion and transport of detrital grains were minimized by extensive vegetation cover in the catchment area. The fauna and flora associated with the lake deposits and Middle Paleolithic occupation sites on the paleo-shorelines attest to a more amenable environment. (2) Vastly different rainfall or atmospheric circulation patterns than at present must have existed based on consistently negative deltaO-18PDB values for the chalk, as low as -9.5 parts per thousand, which would require precipitation from lake waters significantly more depleted in O-18 than the modern local spring water (deltaO-18SMOW= -1.8 parts per thousand). (3) The lakes were stable perennial water bodies with relatively long residence times sufficient to produce isotopic covariant signals in the chalks. Apparently, the lakes disappeared as abruptly as they appeared without going through a terminal phase of evaporative enrichment. Extremely arid conditions again prevailed. During the transition from the last glacial to the present interglacial (Terminal 1), a similar change from arid to pluvial conditions occurred. Thus, it is proposed that, during transitions from glacial to interglacial climates, rapid global warming can lead to a temporary alteration of atmospheric circulation with an intensification of the southwest monsoons, bringing large quantities of isotopically light moisture to the Eastern Sahara.																			0031-0182					JUL	1993	103	1-2					95	105		10.1016/0031-0182(93)90054-M	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(93)90054-M													WOS:A1993LU39200008

Methodology and determination of tetradecabromo-1, 4-diphenoxybenzene flame retardant and breakdown by-products in sediments from the Laurentian Great Lakes	CHEMOSPHERE												Tetradecabromo-1,4-diphenoxybenzene (TeDB-DiPhOBz) is a brominated polyphenyl ether flame retardant (FR) that is known to photolytically degrade to produce lower brominated polybrominated-diphenoxybenzenes (PB-DiPhOBzs), which may be precursors to MeO-PB-DiPhOBzs recently reported in the Great Lakes herring gulls eggs. To our knowledge, there are no reports on TeDB-DiPhOBz or other PB-DiPhOBz by-products in any environmental sample. The present study analyzed for the presence of PB-DiPhOBzs (including TeDB-DiPhOBz) and MeO-PB-DiPhOBzs in surficial sediment from sites in Saginaw Bay in western Lake Huron (n = 7), and in comparison to southern Lake Huron (open water) (n = 5) and Lake Erie (n = 3) sediment collected in the summers of 2012 or 2013. To analyze for possible PB-DiPhOBzs (Br14Bro), the first known analytical method was developed for extraction and cleanup of sediment samples, and analysis by HPLC-atmospheric pressure photoionization quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. The overall recovery efficiency was optimized to on average 33-104% progressing from Br14to Br10-PB-DiPhOBzs. Brio- to Br14-PB-DiPhOBz detection and quantification limits ranged from 0.05 to 0.15 ng g dw and 0.17 to 0.49 ng g-1 dw, respectively. Although this is the first report, PB-DiPhOBzs (Br14-Br1o) and MeO-PB-DiPhOBzs were not detectable in any sediment sample. This included a site near the mouth of the highly FR-contaminated Saginaw River, near the confined disposal facility (CDF) located in Saginaw Bay at Channel-Shelter Island, which receives dredged sediment from the Saginaw River. Our findings suggest sediments from the presently studied sites in the Great Lakes ecosystem are not a sink for TeDB-DiPhOBz and PB-DiPhOBz by-product contaminants.

To better assess the future impact of this water crisis, it is essential that we develop continental archives of past hydrological variability. Using four sediment cores from Lake Elsinore in Southern California, we reconstruct late Holocene (similar to3800 calendar years B.P.) hydrological change using a twentieth-century calibrated, proxy methodology. We compared magnetic susceptibility from Lake Elsinore deep basin sediments, lake level from Lake Elsinore, and regional winter precipitation data over the twentieth century to calibrate the late Holocene lake sediment record. The comparison revealed a strong positive, first-order relationship between the three variables. As a working hypothesis, we suggest that periods of greater precipitation produce higher lake levels. Greater precipitation also increases the supply of detritus (i.e., magnetic-rich minerals) from the lake's surrounding drainage basin into the lake environment. As a result, magnetic susceptibility values increase during periods of high lake level. We apply this modern calibration to late Holocene sediments from the lake's littoral zone. As an independent verification of this hypothesis, we analyzed delta(18)O(calcite), interpreted as a proxy for variations in the precipitation: evaporation ratio, which reflect first order hydrological variability. The results of this verification support our hypothesis that magnetic susceptibility records regional hydrological change as related to precipitation and lake level. Using both proxy data, we analyzed the past 3800 calendar years of hydrological variability. Our analyses indicate a long period of dry, less variable climate between 3800 and 2000 calendar years B. P. followed by a wet, more variable climate to the present. These results suggest that droughts of greater magnitude and duration than those observed in the modern record have occurred in the recent geological past. This conclusion presents insight to the potential impact of future droughts on the over-populated, water-poor region of Southern California.

Using input-output budgets, we found that prior to flooding, the wetland complex was a net source of approximately 1.7 mg MeHg ha(-1) yr(-1) to downstream ecosystems. In the first year of flooding, net yields of MeHg from the reservoir increased 40-fold to approximately 70 mg MeHg ha(-1) yr(-1). Subsequently, annual net yields of MeHg from the reservoir declined (10-50 mg MeHg ha(-1) yr(-1)) but have remained well above natural levels. The magnitude and timing of Hg methylation in the flooded peat portion of the wetland reservoir were very different than in the open water region of the reservoir. In terms of magnitude, net Hg methylation rates in the peat in the first 2 years of flooding were 2700 mg ha(-1) yr(-1), constituting over 97% of the MeHg produced at the whole-ecosystem level. But in the following 3 years, there was a large decrease in the mass of MeHg in the flooded peat due to microbial demethylation. In contrast, concentrations of MeHg in the open water region and in zooplankton, and body burdens of Hg in cyprinid fish, remained high for the full 9 years of this study. Microbial activity in the open water region also remained high, as evidenced by continued high concentrations of dissolved CO2 and CH4. Thus, the large short-term accumulation of MeHg mass in the peat appeared to have only a small influence on concentrations of MeHg in the biota; rather MeHg accumulation in biota was sustained by the comparatively small ongoing net methylation of Hg in the flooded pond where microbial activity remained high. In large reservoirs, where the effects of wind and fetch are greater than in the small experimental reservoir we constructed, differences can occur in the timing and extent of peat and soil erosion, effecting either transport of MeHg to the food chain or the fueling of microbial activity in open water sediments, both of which could have important long-term implications for MeHg concentrations in predatory fish.

Human impact on an island ecosystem: pollen data from Sandoy, Faroe Islands	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To investigate the form and dynamics of ecosystems on an isolated island in the North Atlantic before human settlement in the first millennium AD, and the effects of human activities thereafter. Location The island of Sandoy, Faroes (61 degrees 50' N, 6 degrees 45' W). Methods Two sequences of lake sediments and one of peat were studied using pollen analysis and sedimentological techniques. Age models were constructed on the basis of radiocarbon dating and, in one case, tephrochronology. The data were analysed statistically and compared with existing data from the region. Results The pollen data indicate that early Holocene vegetation consisted of fell-field communities probably growing on raw, skeletal soils. These communities gave way to grass- and sedge-dominated communities, which in turn were largely replaced by dwarf shrub-dominated blanket mire communities well before the first arrival of humans. There is evidence for episodic soil erosion, particularly in the uplands. Changes in the records attributable to human impact are minor in comparison with many other situations in the North Atlantic margins, and with certain published sequences from elsewhere in the Faroes. They include: (1) the appearance of cereal pollen and charcoal, (2) an expansion of ruderal taxa, (3) a decline in certain taxa, notably Juniperus communis and Filipendula ulmaria, and (4) a renewed increase in rates of upland soil erosion. The reliability of palaeoecological inferences drawn from these sites, and more generally from sites in similar unforested situations, is discussed. Main conclusions The subdued amplitude of palynological and sedimentological responses to settlement at these sites can be explained partly in terms of their location and partly in terms of the sensitivity of different parts of the ecosystem to human activities. This study is important in establishing that the imposition of people on the pristine environment of Sandoy, while far from negligible, especially in the immediate vicinity of early farms and at high altitudes, had relatively little ecological impact in many parts of the landscape.

J	Albrecht, C; Trajanovski, S; Kuhn, K; Streit, B; Wilke, T				Albrecht, Christian; Trajanovski, Sasho; Kuhn, Kerstin; Streit, Bruno; Wilke, Thomas			Rapid evolution of an ancient lake species flock: Freshwater limpets (Gastropoda: Ancylidae) in the Balkan Lake Ohrid	ORGANISMS DIVERSITY & EVOLUTION												Ancient lakes have long been recognized as evolutionary theatres and hot spots of endemism; the evolution of their morphologically often highly diverse species flocks has received much attention. However, as each ancient lake has its own geological and evolutionary history, modes of speciation may differ from system to system. Ancient lakes can act as evolutionary reservoirs that assure the survival of relict species, but at the same time extant species may evolve through intralacustrine speciation. Other aspects of interest are the actual rates of immigration, diversification or extinction as well as the temporal framework of morphological change. Many of these questions have been addressed in the African (e.g. Lake Tanganyika) and Asian (e.g. Lake Baikal) ancient lakes. For an European ancient lakes (e.g. Lakes Ohrid and Prespa), such studies are largely missing. In the present paper. extraordinarily shaped endemic freshwater limpets of the genus Ancylus from the Balkan Lake Ohrid are used in a phylogeographic and phylogenetic context to test whether they represent an ancient lake species flock, to study the mode of speciation, and to assess the timing of morphological change. Based on DNA data from two mitochondrial genes (COI, LSU rDNA), it has been found that the Lake Ohrid Ancylus species form an endemic monophyletic group. In addition, the lake's feeder springs are inhabited by another, undescribed Ancylus species. All other studied waterbodies within the watershed do not support their own Ancylus lineages but are inhabited by a widespread Mediterranean taxon. The split between the species endemic to the take and its sister taxon is dated to 1.4 +/- 0.6 million years ago. The study presents the first genetic confirmation for the existence of a species flock in a European ancient lake. Contrary to the prevailing opinion it shows that, concerning Ancylus, Lake Ohrid represents a site of intralacustrine speciation rather than an evolutionary reservoir, Moreover, it provides the first evidence for rapid morphological change in an European ancient lake species flock.

Timing of Paleoproterozoic granitoid magmatism along the northwestern Superior Province margin: implications for the tectonic evolution of the Thompson Nickel Belt	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The U-Pb geochronology of three granitoid plutons and three granitic pegmatite dykes, largely from the Thompson Nickel Belt located along the northwestern Superior craton margin, was investigated to place constraints on the timing of felsic magmatism associated with closure of the Manikewan Ocean and final continent-continent collision to form the Trans-Hudson Orogen. These data indicate that 1840-1820 Ma granite magmatism along the Superior margin was more active than previously thought and that some magmatism extended beyond the Thompson Nickel Belt sensu stricto, including the 1836 +/- 3 Ma Mystery Lake granodiorite, 1822 +/- 5 Ma Wintering Lake granodiorite, and the 1825 +/- 8 Ma Fox Lake granite located in the Split Lake Block. Granitic pegmatites within the Thompson Nickel Belt were emplaced late in the collisional history in the period 1.79-1.75 Ga and include a 1770 +/- 2 Ma dyke exposed at the Thompson pit, a 1767 +/- 6 Ma dyke at the Pipe Pit, and a 1786 +/- 2 Ma dyke located at Paint Lake. The final stage of crustal amalgamation in the eastern Trans-Hudson Orogen involved Superior Province crustal thickening and partial melting forming 1.84-1.82 Ga granite magmas and then final collision at similar to 1.8 Ga between the Superior Province and a continental block to the west consisting of the previously amalgamated Sask and Hearne cratons. Heating of the Superior craton margin and granitic magmatism continued past peak metamorphism (1790-1750 Ma); this thermal event is represented by the emplacement of numerous late pegmatite dykes and evidenced by cooling dates recorded by metamorphic minerals (e. g., titanite) in reworked Archean gneisses and Proterozoic intrusions.

Tectonic versus climatic control on the evolution of fluvio-deltaic systems in a lake basin, Eastern Pannonian Basin	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Pannonian Basin is a back-arc lake basin, situated inside the Central European Carpathian loop, surrounded by the orogenic, belts of the Eastern Alps, Carpathians and Dinarides. Integrated stratigraphical and sedimentological research reported here focuses on palaeogeographical evolution, and particularly the response of the fluvio-deltaic systems to climatic and tectonic controls in the Late-Neogene sedimentary succession, in the eastern part of the Pannonian Basin. This work has been carried out using subsurface data including regional composite seismic profiles and well-logs. Dip sections were studied to define the stratigraphical A architecture, depositional environments and sequence stratigraphy, and to interpret the sedimentary evolution of the area. The eastern Pannonian Basin is characterized by sediment input from the north-east which was one of the main routes of the fluvial-deltaic systems entering and progressively filling Lake Pannon from 11.6-2.6 Ma. The formations studied were deposited in environments that ranged from the deep-water basin plain, slope, delta front, and coastal plain to alluvial plain, causing the deposition of characteristic lithofacies associations, and characteristic biofacies. These form laterally continuous lithofacies units that can be correlated through the basin. All depositional facies units have considerable thicknesses (300-1000 m) in the deepest parts of the sub-basins. Sequence stratigraphical interpretation was carried out correlating 3rd and 4th-order sequences (Ma to ky in range) through a regional composite seismic profile network in the dip direction. Stratigraphical architecture and sedimentary facies indicate that the 3rd-order cycles were controlled by tectonic driving forces, while 4th-order cycles were probably driven by large-scale climatic A changes within the Milankovitch band. In the 3rd-order time interval Pa-3 between 9.1 and 6.8 Ma, a major tectonostratigraphic event occurred, highlighting the role of strike-slip faulting-related transtensional subsidence in the Derecske sub-basin, A superimposed on the regional post-rift thermal subsidence of the Eastern Pannonian region. The substantial base level fall at SB Pa-4 at 6.8 Ma (over 200 m, perhaps amplified by subsequent tectonic movements) can be related to the onset of a new compressional phase of structural evolution in the basin.

Royle), on population characteristics of juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides Lacepede) in small coves (<10 ha) in Lake Seminole, Georgia. In addition, we estimated areal coverage and species composition of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) communities in each cove. Fish and plants were sampled in both control (hydrilla infested) and herbicide treated coves in November and March-April each year. Electrofishing catch-per-effort for both number and weight of age-0 and age-1 fish for the 1997 to 2002 year classes was either the same or higher (p < 0.05) in herbicide treated than in control coves. Age-0 fish were larger (p < 0.05) in treated, than in control coves in November, but at age-1 in the following spring, fish were slightly longer (p < 0.05) in the control coves. Higher age-0 catches were associated with greater percent reductions in numeric catch between age-0 and age-1 and reduced lengths of fish in November indicating, density-dependent effects. Age-0 fish lengths were also negatively correlated to percent cover of both total and native SAV Total or native SAV coverages were not associated with catch-per unit effort for number and weight, but nearly all control and herbicide treated coves had total SAV coverage greater than 40%. Applications of both Sonar and Aquathol K reduced total SAV coverage and hydrilla, permitted the establishment of native SAVs, and had either neutral or positive impacts on young largemouth bass in small coves in Lake Seminole.																			0146-6623					JAN	2004	42						5	11																WOS:000222544300002
J	Hingsamer, P; Peeters, F; Hofmann, H				Hingsamer, Peter; Peeters, Frank; Hofmann, Hilmar			The Consequences of Internal Waves for Phytoplankton Focusing on the Distribution and Production of Planktothrix rubescens	PLOS ONE												Consequences of internal wave motion for phytoplankton and in particular for the distribution and production of the harmful and buoyant cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens were investigated based on data from two field campaigns conducted in Lake Ammer during summer 2009 and 2011. In both years, P. rubescens dominated the phytoplankton community and formed a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in the metalimnion. Internal wave motions caused vertical displacement of P. rubescens of up to 6 m and 10 m, respectively. Vertical displacements of isotherms and of isoconcentration lines of P. rubescens from the same depth range coincided, suggesting that P. rubescens did not or could not regulate its buoyancy to prevent wave-induced vertical displacements. Diatoms dominated the phytoplankton community in the epilimnion and were vertically separated from P. rubescens. The thickness of the diatom layer, but not the diatom concentrations within the layer, changed in phase with the changes in the thickness of the epilimnion caused by internal wave motions. Seiche induced vertical displacements of P. rubescens caused fluctuations in the light intensity available at the depth of the P. rubescens layer. The interplay between seiche induced vertical displacements of the P. rubescens layer and the daily cycle of incident light lead to differences in the daily mean available light intensity between lake ends by up to a factor of similar to 3. As a consequence, the daily mean specific oxygen production rate of P. rubescens differed by up to a factor of similar to 7 between lake ends. The horizontal differences in the specific oxygen production rate of P. rubescens were persistent over several days suggesting that the associated production of P. rubescens biomass may lead to phytoplankton patchiness. The effect of internal seiches on the spatial heterogeneity and the persistence of horizontal differences in production, however, depend on the timing and the synchronization between internal wave motion and the daily course of incident light intensity. Vertical displacements caused by internal waves could be distinguished from other factors influencing the distribution of P. rubescens (e. g. active buoyancy control, production, vertical mixing) by a temperature-based data transformation. This technique may be of general use for separating wave-induced transport from other processes (e. g. sedimentation, vertical mixing) that affect the distributions of dissolved substances and suspended particles.

J	Hamrová, E; Mergeay, J; Petrusek, A				Hamrova, Eva; Mergeay, Joachim; Petrusek, Adam			Strong differences in the clonal variation of two Daphnia species from mountain lakes affected by overwintering strategy	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Background: The population structure of cyclical parthenogens such as water fleas is strongly influenced by the frequency of alternations between sexual and asexual (parthenogenetic) reproduction, which may differ among populations and species. We studied genetic variation within six populations of two closely related species of water fleas of the genus Daphnia (Crustacea, Cladocera). D. galeata and D. longispina both occur in lakes in the Tatra Mountains (Central Europe), but their populations show distinct life history strategies in that region. In three studied lakes inhabited by D. galeata, daphnids overwinter under the ice as adult females. In contrast, in lakes inhabited by D. longispina, populations apparently disappear from the water column and overwinter as dormant eggs in lake sediments. We investigated to what extent these different strategies lead to differences in the clonal composition of late summer populations. Results: Analysis of genetic variation at nine microsatellite loci revealed that clonal richness (expressed as the proportion of different multilocus genotypes, MLGs, in the whole analysed sample) consistently differed between the two studied species. In the three D. longispina populations, very high clonal richness was found (MLG/N ranging from 0.97 to 1.00), whereas in D. galeata it was much lower (0.05 to 0.50). The dominant MLGs in all D. galeata populations were heterozygous at five or more loci, suggesting that such individuals all represented the same clonal lineages rather than insufficiently resolved groups of different clones. Conclusions: The low clonal diversities and significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in D. galeata populations were likely a consequence of strong clonal erosion over extended periods of time (several years or even decades) and the limited influence of sexual reproduction. Our data reveal that populations of closely related Daphnia species living in relatively similar habitats (permanent, oligotrophic mountain lakes) within the same region may show strikingly different genetic structures, which most likely depend on their reproductive strategy during unfavourable periods. We assume that similar impacts of life history on population structures are also relevant for other cyclical parthenogen groups. In extreme cases, prolonged clonal erosion may result in the dominance of a single clone within a population, which might limit its microevolutionary potential if selection pressures suddenly change.

Nd-Sr Systematics of Metamagmatic Rocks of the Anginskaya and Talanchanskaya Formations, Middle Part of Lake Baikal	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												The paper presents data on the Nd-Sr systematics of magmatic rocks of the Khaidaiskii Series of the Anginskaya Formation in the Ol'khon region, western Baikal area, and rocks of the Talanchanskaya Formation on the eastern shore of Lake Baikal. Geochemical characteristics of these rocks are identical and testify to their arc provenance. At the same time, the E > (Nd) (t) of rocks of the Khaidaiskii Series in the Ol'khon area has positive values, and the data points of these rocks plot near the mantle succession line in the E > (Nd) (t) -Sr-87/Sr-86 diagram, whereas the E > (Nd) (t) values of rocks of the Talanchanskaya Formation are negative, and the data points of these rocks fall into the fourth quadrant in the E > (Nd) (t) -Sr-87/Sr-86 diagram. This testifies to a mantle genesis of the parental magmas of the Khaidaiskii Series and to the significant involvement of older crustal material in the generation of the melts that produced the orthorocks on the eastern shore of the lake. These conclusions are corroborated by model ages of magmatic rocks in the Ol'khon area (close to 1 Ga) and of rocks of the Talanchanskaya Formation (approximately 2 Ga). The comparison of our data with those obtained by other researchers on the Nd-Sr isotopic age of granulites of the Ol'khon Group and metavolcanics in various structural zones in the northern Baikal area suggests, with regard for the geochemistry of these rocks, the accretion of tectonic nappes that had different isotopic histories: some of them were derived from the mantle wedge and localized in the island arc itself (magmatic rocks of the Anginskaya Formation) or backarc spreading zone (mafic metamagmatic rocks of the Ol'khon Group), while others were partial melts derived, with the participation of crustal material, from sources of various age (metagraywackes in the backarc basin in the Ol'khon Group and the ensialic basement of the island arc in the Talanchanskaya Formation).

Clumped isotope constraints on changes in latest Pleistocene hydroclimate in the northwestern Great Basin: Lake Surprise, California	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation, the Great Basin in the southwestern United States was covered by numerous extensive closed-basin lakes, in stark contrast with the predominately arid climate observed today. This transition from lakes in the Late Pleistocene to modern aridity implies large changes in the regional water balance. Whether these changes were driven by increased precipitation rates due to changes in atmospheric dynamics, decreased evaporation rates resulting from temperature depression and summer insolation changes, or some combination of the two remains uncertain. The factors contributing to these largescale changes in hydroclimate are critical to resolve, given that this region is poised to undergo future anthropogenic-forced climate changes with large uncertainties in model simulations for the 21st century. Furthermore, there are ambiguous constraints on the magnitude and even the sign of changes in key hydroclimate variables between the Last Glacial Maximum and the present day in both proxy reconstructions and climate model analyses of the region. Here we report thermodynamically derived estimates of changes in temperature, precipitation, and evaporation rates, as well as the isotopic composition of lake water, using clumped isotope data from an ancient lake in the northwestern Great Basin, Lake Surprise (California). Compared to modern climate, mean annual air temperature at Lake Surprise was 4.7 degrees C lower during the Last Glacial Maximum, with decreased evaporation rates and similar precipitation rates to modern. During the mid-deglacial period, the growth of Lake Surprise implied that the lake hydrologic budget briefly departed from steady state. Our reconstructions indicate that this growth took place rapidly, while the subsequent lake regression took place over several thousand years. Using models for precipitation and evaporation constrained from clumped isotope results, we determine that the disappearance of Lake Surprise coincided with a moderate increase in lake temperature, along with increasing evaporation rates outpacing increasing precipitation rates. Concomitant analysis of proxy data and climate model simulations for the Last Glacial Maximum are used to provide a robust means to understand past climate change, and by extension, predict how current hydroclimates may respond to expected future climate forcings. We suggest that an expansion of this analysis to more basins across a larger spatial scale could provide valuable insight into proposed climate forcings, and aid in climate model process depiction. Ultimately, our analysis highlights the importance of temperature-driven evaporation as a mechanism for lake growth and retreat in this region.

Bulk release rates for Na, Ca, Mg and Al along the flow path were calculated by use of solute compositions of acid-chloride-sulfate spring waters located in the Rio Agrio watershed on the NW flank of the volcano, tritium-based residence times and geometric estimates of the reactive sur-face areas of aquifer rocks. Petrographic data on the composition of interstitial glass and major-mineral phases were used in the mass-balance model NETPATH to calculate individual contributions of glass, plagioclase and pyroxene to the observed mass transfers of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al and Si. By assuming that no secondary Al phases were precipitated along the flow path, and assuming a plagioclase composition close to An38, we calculate that solution chemistry of the acid-chloride-sulfate waters of the Rio Agrio watershed is due to dissolution of approximately equal amounts of glass and plagioclase, with most of the Mg and Fe coming from pyroxene dissolution. Calculated rates are typically within one order of magnitude of experimentally-derived rates measured at similar pH and temperatures. In addition, the relative order of mineral reactivity was similar between field- and laboratory-based estimates: pyroxene > plag greater-than-or-equal-to andesitic glass. The good agreement between the field- and laboratory-based estimates is attributed to the interaction of relatively fresh andesite and volcano-clastic material with low-pH fluids of the NW flank aquifer. The largest uncertainty in our calculation is estimation of reactive mineral surface area.

J	Perroud, M; Goyette, S				Perroud, Marjorie; Goyette, Stephane			Interfacing a one-dimensional lake model with a single-column atmospheric model: 2. Thermal response of the deep Lake Geneva, Switzerland under a 2 x CO2 global climate change	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In the companion to the present paper, the one-dimensional k-epsilon lake model SIMSTRAT is coupled to a single-column atmospheric model, nicknamed FIZC, and an application of the coupled model to the deep Lake Geneva, Switzerland, is described. In this paper, the response of Lake Geneva to global warming caused by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (i.e., 2 x CO2) is investigated. Coupling the models allowed for feedbacks between the lake surface and the atmosphere and produced changes in atmospheric moisture and cloud cover that further modified the downward radiation fluxes. The time evolution of atmospheric variables as well as those of the lake's thermal profile could be reproduced realistically by devising a set of adjustable parameters. In a "control'' 1 x CO2 climate experiment, the coupled FIZC-SIMSTRAT model demonstrated genuine skills in reproducing epilimnetic and hypolimnetic temperatures, with annual mean errors and standard deviations of 0.25 degrees C +/- 0.25 degrees C and 0.3 degrees C +/- 0.15 degrees C, respectively. Doubling the CO2 concentration induced an atmospheric warming that impacted the lake's thermal structure, increasing the stability of the water column and extending the stratified period by 3 weeks. Epilimnetic temperatures were seen to increase by 2.6 degrees C to 4.2 degrees C, while hypolimnion temperatures increased by 2.2 degrees C. Climate change modified components of the surface energy budget through changes mainly in air temperature, moisture, and cloud cover. During summer, reduced cloud cover resulted in an increase in the annual net solar radiation budget. A larger water vapor deficit at the air-water interface induced a cooling effect in the lake.

The variety of other biological groups that are represented by fossils in the succession provides a basis for making observations on ecological associations and climatic conditions during the period of deposition of the sediments. The cysts do not occur in the alluvial (floodplain) and poorly laminated, early lacustrine facies that underlie the varved unit, nor in the overlying late lacustrine, oxidised, silty clay facies. They are associated only with sediment-couplets considered to reflect accumulation in temperature-stratified water approximately 8-12 m deep that overturned periodically. It is likely that the dinoflagellates inhabited the warm, epilimnic, oxygenated layer above the cool deep water in which oxygen levels were low rendering this environment inhospitable to both animals and plants, but favouring the preservation of organic matter. Their absence from the unlaminated deposits of the early and late lacustrine facies may not mean that the motile dinoflagellates were not present in the shallower waters they represent but simply that the cysts were not preserved. These beds accumulated in oxidising environments and are palynologically barren. The land plant mega- and microfossil records suggest that the vegetation of the surrounding hills consisted of mixed deciduous-coniferous forest of a character that is typical of a moist (summer-wet) warm-temperate climate. This is also implied by some of the fauna (e.g., the salmonid fish and the gastropod Bellamya). These observations add significantly to palaeoecological conclusions drawn from the few records of nonmarine dinoflagellate cysts from Cretaceous and younger successions elsewhere, most of which have been associated with quiet lacustrine or lagoonal habitats.

J	Walker, S; Holbrook, J				Walker, Samuel; Holbrook, John			Structures, architecture, vertical profiles, palaeohydrology and taphonomy of an upper-flow-regime-dominated fluvial system, the Triassic Dockum Group of the Palo Duro Canyon, Texas	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Triassic strata of the Tecovas and Trujillo formations in the Palo Duro Canyon of West Texas record deposition dominated throughout by upper-flow-regime channel flow. These strata provide an opportunity for new insights into the architecture, floodplain/channel processes, vertical profiles, palaeohydrology and taphonomy typical of broader upper-flow-regime-dominated fluvial systems. Thicker channel-fills (ca 2 m, aspect ratio ca 24) host upper-plane-bed, symmetrical antidune, breaking-antidune, chute-and-pool, and cyclic-step structures. The thinner channel-fill population (<1 m, aspect ratio ca 35) comprises upper-plane-bed and some antidune structures. Some of the larger channel fills developed low-angle downstream-accreting bars, with rare examples of laterally accreting side-attached bars. This appears to be the first documentation of an ancient upper-flow-regime side-attached bar. Lamina orientation of structures parallel accretion surfaces because these followed the original bed surface, and structures drop in flow regime down the bar surfaces as formative Froude numbers also declined. A generalized vertical sequence for large upper-flow-regime channel storeys has upper-plane-bed structures above the basal scour, transitioning upward into higher flow regime structures (for example, antidunes, cyclic steps, etc.), then back to a mix of upper-plane-bed and antidunes or lower-flow-regime structures towards the top. The Tecovas Formation and overlying Trujillo Sandstone both bear layers of cross-cutting laterally amalgamated valley fills, multivalleys, and are separated by a regional sequence boundary. Calculated palaeodischarges for Tecovas (ca 90 m(3)/s) and Trujillo (ca 76 m(3)/s) rivers record flow at the stage where symmetrical antidunes were deposited. These discharges occurred at some point on the falling limb of a flood hydrograph of currently unknown shape. Slopes for the rivers were on the order of 10(-4) to 10(-5), consistent with typical continental-interior rivers. Large and flashy discharge was, thus, the likely cause for supercritical-flow conditions instead of excessive slopes. Rivers in both the Tecovas and Trujillo formations record a fluvial system developed in a tropical to subtropical megamonsoonal environment. The tendency for preservation of metre-scale channel-fills and catastrophic inundations of floodplains and lakes in single floods has also made the Dockum Group a prolific preserver of large Triassic vertebrates.

PROPAGATED FISH IN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT	AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY SYMPOSIUM				Symposium on Propagated Fish in Resource Management	JUN 16-18, 2003	Boise, ID					The native fish fauna of the Southwest has become markedly reduced in range and numbers over the past century. Dramatic changes in aquatic habitats and the introduction of normative fishes are related to their demise. Major southwestern river systems such as the Colorado, Rio Grande, Gila, and Verde presently contain normative, primarily sport fish assemblages, in combination with rare, declining, and listed native species. The Arizona Game and Fish Department in collaboration with federal and private agencies is responsible for managing both of these fish groups in a representative state, Arizona. Two questions can be offered: "Is it desirable, and possible, to sustain both Fish groups in the waters of Arizona?" and further, "Is it possible to sustain both fish groups in the same river, stream, lake for spring?" Currently, the Arizona Game and Fish Department (Department) propagates primarily coldwater species; however, a half a dozen species, including the threatened Apache trout Oncorhynchus gilae apache, Colorado pikeminnow Ptychocheilus lucius, razorback sucker Xyrauchen texanus, Gila topminnow Poeciliopsis occidentalis, and desert pupfish Cyprinodon nevadensis, are also reared in hatcheries and refugia habitats. Repatriation programs for these same species are ongoing in Arizona. A critical component for recovery of these rare, native species will be to sustain secure habitats for their repatriation. Cooperative programs with the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation seek available habitats for restoration of native Fishes. The management activities of many agencies over the last century have contributed to the hydrological and biological state of southwestern river systems. Cooperation among these same agencies will be necessary to conserve and enhance native fishes while sportfishing continues. The answer to the above two questions are (1) "Yes, both groups are being managed under department mission statements"; and (2) "No, efforts to do so should in the same habitats are not recommended and should not be attempted."																			0892-2284		1-888569-69-7				2004	44						445	466																WOS:000228130200037

Continuous culture studies have shown that, at constant incident irradiance, the value of c for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species is constant. Culture data for the relevant conditions of incident light may be used for directly estimating the growth rate from daily insolation of.optically deep, fully mixed lakes, when the light absorption by the phytoplankton can be established. In order to examine the influence of vertical light attenuation and daily insolation on c, computations were made on a basis of a photosynthesis-irradiance curve of light-limited Oscillatoria limnetica. For steady state growth, the 'true' growth efficiency is linearly related to the areal quantum efficiency of photosynthesis (phi(a)). The computations showed that phi(a) remains constant at fluctuating vertical light attenuation, no matter whether the concentration of tripton or phytoplankton changes. The effect of insolation is great: phi(a) is 0.108 mol O2/E at very low light, but only 0.014 mol O2/E at 400 W M-2 subsurface downward irradiance. The results imply that a c-value obtained from cultures for summer averaged insolation must be corrected: between cloudy and clear days the value may vary by a factor of 2. The 'true' growth efficiency for cultures will decrease by about 10% when the same daily irradiation is dosed sinusoidally instead of constantly.																			0018-8158					AUG 14	1992	238						169	176		10.1007/BF00048785	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00048785													WOS:A1992JN34700017
J	Hu, FS; Brubaker, LB; Anderson, PM				Hu, FS; Brubaker, LB; Anderson, PM			Boreal ecosystem development in the northwestern Alaska range since 11,000 yr BP	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Analyses of pollen, plant macrofossils, macroscopic charcoal, mollusks, magnetic susceptibility, and geochemical content of a sediment core from Farewell Lake yield a 11,000-yr record of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem changes in the northwestern foothills of the Alaska Range. Between 11,000 and 8500 qr B.P., the regional landscape was dominated by a Betula shrub tundra, in which Populus-Salix communities were common. Abundant charcoal in sediments indicates that fires were common in the lake catchment during this period, and high mineral accumulation rates, allogenic elemental content, and magnetic susceptibility suggest intense soil erosion. In addition, mollusks, pollen and macrofossils of aquatic macrophytes, and biogenic silica provide evidence that the lake was substantially shallower and more productive 11,000-8500 yr B.P. than later. Low lake level and high aquatic productivity might have been caused by warm and dry summers associated with early postglacial insolation maximum in northern high latitudes. About 8000 yr B.P., Picea glauca arrived within the lake catchment, forming a forest tundra association until ca. 6000 yr B.P. Alnus shrub thickets established in the region ca. 6500 yr B.P., and Betula papyrifera arrived ca. 6000 yr B.P. Closed P. glauca forests developed ca. 6000 yr B.P. Picea mariana became important subsequently and replaced P. glauca as the dominant tree species in the region ca. 4000 yr B.P. An increase in authigenic Fe/Mn ratios suggests that the development of waterlogged soils accompanied this vegetation change. Fires increased in importance at this time and might have accelerated soil erosion. The establishment of P. mariana forests probably reflected complex responses of forest ecosystems to the onset of cooler and wetter climate conditions during the late Holocene.

J	Baig, J; Gavin, DG				Baig, Jamila; Gavin, Daniel G.			Postglacial vegetation and fire history with a high-resolution analysis of tephra impacts, high Cascade Range, Oregon, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The postglacial history of vegetation, wildfire, and climate in the Cascade Range (Oregon) is only partly understood. This study uses high-resolution macroscopic charcoal and pollen analysis from a 13-m, 14,500 years sediment record from Gold Lake, located in a montane forest, to reconstruct forest vege-tation and fire history. The occurrence of three tephra layers, including a 78-cm airfall Mazama tephra, as well as highly laminated segments, allows one to study tephra impacts on vegetation at a fine temporal resolution. From the Late Glacial through the Younger Dryas, pollen spectra vary little. The early Holocene is marked by a sudden increase in Pseudotsuga, indicating warmer conditions, while the late Holocene is marked by increasing Tsuga heterophylla and Tsuga mertensiana, indicating the onset of moist conditions in the region. High-resolution charcoal data show periods of large peaks during the Late Glacial, pre-, and post-Mazama eruption and since 4 ka (thousands of years before present). Low fire during the early Holocene is unexpected, given regional evidence of warmer and drier summers, but it may be the result of fuel limitation. After the Mazama tephra deposition (7.63 ka), the non-arboreal pollen composition was changed, with some taxa disappearing or reduced in abundance for 300 years. Arboreal taxa were little affected by the tephra, showing only a 20% increase in Pinus pollen and no discernible impact on the pollen accumulation rate (PAR). In contrast, the Mazama tephra was followed by ca. 70 years of very low charcoal input, followed by a large peak, consistent with the burial of surface fuels and decades of fuel accumulation. There was also increased fire frequency and peak magnitude at 1.5 ka, followed by very little fire after 0.4 ka, consistent with the current old-growth forest surrounding the lake. This detailed and high-resolution record adds significantly to understanding the impacts of climate change and the singular effect of the Mazama eruption, impacting watershed vegetation, and fire for centuries but with minimal impact on the regional forest composition.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Everett; Gawin, Barbara			Holocene glacier and ice cap fluctuations in southwest Greenland inferred from two lake records	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Glaciers and ice caps (GICs) respond rapidly to changes in temperature and precipitation. Thus, records of their past fluctuations yield valuable information on past climate. However, relatively little is known about the long-term, Holocene history of Greenland's local GICs, peripheral to the Greenland Ice Sheet. Here we report sediment records of Holocene glacier activity from two distally fed glacial lakes near Buksefjord, southwest Greenland. The two lakes' watersheds host modern GICs of contrasting size. The Pers Lake (informal name) watershed drains part (3 km(2)) of a single small ice cap. In contrast, nearby Lake T3's (informal name) watershed drains numerous GICs totaling 100 km(2) . At the time it emerged from the sea similar to 8.6 ka BP, Pers Lake was receiving no glacial meltwater input. Sediment physical and geochemical properties indicate persistent meltwater input and regrowth of the ice cap within the Pers Lake catchment beginning at similar to 1.4 ka BP, after almost 3000 years of sporadic meltwater input beginning similar to 4.3 ka BP. The ice cap above Pers Lake reached a maximum late Holocene extent during the final phase of the Little Ice Age (LIA), similar to 0.1 ka BP. The complementary Lake T3 sediment record suggests continued meltwater input from the larger suite of upstream GICs from the time of the lake's isolation from the sea similar to 8.4-7.5 ka BP through to the present. This indicates that some GICs here probably survived the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), although were significantly reduced in size for an extended period (of unknown age and duration). Combined with evidence from Pers Lake and prior studies that show GICs at low and intermediate elevations in this region melted away completely during the HTM, and evidence for GIC presence at Lake T3, we provide lower and upper bounds on regional HTM equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs). We estimate that regional ELAs were between similar to 1370 and 1470 m above sea level in the early-to-middle Holocene. From the middle to late Holocene, our results, along with other regional GIC studies, indicate progressive lowering of regional glacier ELAs in response to Neoglacial summer cooling of similar to 2.7 degrees C, assuming no change in precipitation.

J	Rosenkranz, M; Lagrue, C; Poulin, R; Selbach, C				Rosenkranz, Micha; Lagrue, Clement; Poulin, Robert; Selbach, Christian			Small snails, high productivity? Larval output of parasites from an abundant host	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												How energy is transformed and distributed within ecosystems is a fundamental question in ecology. Parasites have been shown to play an essential role in these processes. In particular, the larval stages of trematodes, that is, cercariae, appear to contribute significantly to biomass and productivity in aquatic systems. Overall, ecosystem-wide studies on parasite productivity remain scarce and have typically investigated systems with large hosts and high parasite infection rates. These studies may thus represent isolated cases of exceptionally high parasite contribution to ecosystem energetics, potentially overestimating the importance of parasite biomass. Here, we quantified the productivity of trematode cercariae from a small but hyper-abundant snail intermediate host with only moderate trematode prevalence (i.e., proportion of infected individuals) in an entire lake ecosystem. We assessed individual larval output from snails and calculated the overall trematode productivity in the ecosystem. Average output of individual trematode species ranged from 3 to 62 cercariae per snail per day and correlated negatively with individual cercarial size. Cercarial productivity was not uniformly distributed across trematode taxa, but dominated by the most common species that accounted for more than 80% of the productivity. Total cercarial productivity amounted to 1.85 g m(-2), which falls within the ranges of previous studies from freshwater systems. Small but abundant snail populations may thus support a considerable productivity of parasites. However, total annual cercarial productivity in the study system amounted to 5.9 kg, which constituted just 1.2% of the standing stock snail biomass, suggesting that intermediate host populations are potentially underexploited by their parasites. Moreover, comparisons with previous studies revealed contrasting patterns of parasite productivity and biomass contribution across different habitats, showing that impacts of parasites on ecosystem energetics can vary widely. Overall, we are still far away from having a complete picture of the dynamics of parasite productivity and biomass in many ecosystems. It therefore remains critical to quantify the contribution of parasites to the flow and distribution of energy and nutrients within and across habitats, to better understand their impacts on fundamental ecological principles, such as food-web structure and ecosystem energetics.

The studied acidic pit lake, LK-61 (pH <3), is also exposed to floods due to its location in the flood hazard area, which may significantly influence the geochemical behavior of elements. The elemental compositions of water and lake sediment samples were measured with ICP-OES and ICP-MS. The sediment profile was also examined for Cs-137 and Po-210 activity concentrations using gamma and alpha spectrometry, respectively. Grain size distribution, mineralogical composition, diatoms, and organic matter content in the collected core were also determined. The key factors responsible for the distribution of selected heavy metals (e.g., Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) and radioisotopes (Cs-137 and Po-210) in the bottom sediments of Lake & Lstrok;K-61 are their coprecipitation/precipitation with Fe and Al secondary minerals and their sorption onto authigenic and allogenic phases. These processes are likely driven by the lake tributary, which is an important source of dissolved elements. The data also showed that the physiochemical parameters of Lake & Lstrok;K-61 water changed during an episodic depositional event, i.e., the flood of the Nysa & Lstrok;u & zdot;ycka River in the summer of 2010. The flood caused an increase in the water pH, as interpreted from the subfossil diatom studies. The down-core profiles of the studied heavy metal and radionuclide (HMRs) contents were probably affected by this depositional event, which prevented a detailed age determination of the collected lake sediments with Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating methods. Geochemical modeling indicates that the flood-related shift in the physicochemical parameters of the lake water could have caused the scavenging of dissolved elements by the precipitation of fresh secondary minerals. Moreover, particles contaminated with HMRs have also possibly been delivered by the river, along with the nutrients (e.g., phosphorus and nitrogen).

Macrophyte loss from Sites of Special Scientific Interest in England has become widespread over the last 20 years. One reason for this may be changing trends in angling, a multimillion pound industry that has an enormous impact on aquatic ecosystems. Stocking with cyprinid fish is a common angling management practice but the particular fish species and distribution of their biomass may be crucial to the ecosystem. 2. Carp (Cyprinus carpio), roach (Rutilus rutilus), bream (Abramis brama) and tench (Tinca tinca) at biomasses ranging from 0 to 800 kg ha(-1) and at various sizes were placed into experimental mesocosms in Little Mere, a shallow, fertile lake in Cheshire, U. K. The effects these treatments had on the aquatic ecosystem were studied over two summers. Specifically the effects of the treatments on macrophyte growth, benthic and macrophytic macro-invertebrate populations, water chemistry, epiphyton production and plankton survival were investigated. 3. Carp had a greater detrimental effect on the macrophytes than bream, tench and in particular roach. A biomass of fish > 200 kg ha(-1) adversely affected the extent of macrophyte growth. 4. The decline in macrophyte growth was most likely as a result of increased epiphyton growth that probably reduced the amount of light and carbon dioxide available to the plant. There were no observed direct fish impacts on macrophytes. 5. The chemical data suggested that inorganic nitrogen levels were low and it is possible that release of nitrogen, from fish excreta, followed by immediate uptake, could have been a major factor stimulating epiphyton growth and subsequently macrophyte loss. Phosphorus concentrations increased even in the controls and substantial amounts were available. Phosphorus stimulation can therefore be discounted. Macrophyte-associated macro-invertebrates were positively correlated with epiphyton load but had no impact on the extent of epiphytic growth. Shading from disturbed sediment or phytoplankton was also unimportant.																			0046-5070					NOV	2002	47	11					2216	2232		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00963.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00963.x													WOS:000178848300015

In order to investigate further, we have completed a retrospective study of SD-implicated category A accidents (where an aircraft is destroyed, declared missing, or damaged beyond economic repair) in the Canadian Forces (CF) during 1982-92. An overview of all SD occurrences (including accidents and incidents) across aircraft types is also presented. information was gathered concerning the genesis and severity of disorientation so that research effort and pilot training could be appropriately implemented. Mishap investigation summaries involving category A accidents where SD was implicated were obtained from the CF Directorate of Flight Safety and reviewed. We also examined in detail the Board of Inquiry Reports of these accidents. The role of disorientation in these accidents was assessed. There were 62 category A accidents between 1982-92 and, in 14, SD had been assigned as a possible cause factor in the accident records. When divided into the categories of Recognized SD (RSD), Unrecognized SD (USD), and Incapacitating SD (ISD), all but two fell into the category of USD (the pilots were unaware of the disorientation). Of the SD accidents, 11 involved a total loss of 24 lives. The majority of the accidents happened during the day, and pilots' cumulative flying experience did not appear to be a significant factor. According to our assessment, there were two episodes of vestibular origin, involving the somatogravic illusion. Three episodes of disorientation occurred over frozen lakes, one over glassy water, and one over ocean. Two accidents occurred during tactical training involving more than one aircraft. The causes of two accidents remain undetermined, with SD listed along with other possible causal factors. The suggestion follows that more research effort and pilot education and training should be placed on somatogravic illusions and visual limitations under adverse flying conditions, and pilots should be made more aware of these 14 accident scenarios.																			0095-6562					JUN	1995	66	6					579	585											7646410					WOS:A1995RB01800011
J	Schmincke, HU; Park, C; Harms, E				Schmincke, HU; Park, C; Harms, E			Evolution and environmental impacts of the eruption of Laacher See Volcano (Germany) 12,900 a BP	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Laacher See Volcano (LSV), 40 km south of Bonn, explosively erupted ca. 6.3 km(3) of chemically strongly zoned phonolite magma probably during spring, 12,900 years ago, the resulting eruption column having reached at least 20 km in height. The bulk of the Laacher See Tephra (LST) was deposited east of the volcano within the Neuwied Basin. LST ashes form the most important stratigraphic marker in Lateglacial deposits over much of Central Europe. A minimum of 2 Mt total S was calculated to have been released during the eruption by comparing pre- and posteruptive volatile concentrations in glass inclusions and pumice matrix glasses. Because a separate S-bearing vapor phase was probably present in the magma prior to eruption as indicated by the high melt-H2O contents close to saturation level, the actual amount of S released during the eruption, could have significantly exceeded 2 Mt. The sulfuric acid aerosol layer resulting from the massive stratospheric S-input probably resided in the stratosphere for years and most likely had a significant impact on climate and thus the environment. Increased precipitation in central Europe and/or impairment of the vegetation cover for several years is suggested by several. proxies, especially increased sediment supply into lakes. Proximal to the eruptive center, major environmental impacts include an initial blast that felled trees up to 4 km away from vent. Fast deposition of huge tephra volumes led to the complete disruption of Rhine River within the lower Neuwied Basin and the damming up of a lake ca. 140 km(2) in areal extent. Sudden collapse of the temporary tephra dam caused a catastrophic flood wave downstream whose deposits are recognized as far north as Bonn. Reworking of unconsolidated tephra deposits over several 100 km(2) was widespread and extensive, generating abundant lahars and flood plain deposits. A braided-river system, established in Neuwied Basin, probably persisted up to several years. Recent reports for a second eruption of LSV are not confirmed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

J	Denisová, N; Piercey, SJ				Denisova, Nikola; Piercey, Stephen J.			Evolution of the Hydrothermal System Associated with the ABM Replacement-Style Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide Deposit, Finlayson Lake District, Yukon, Canada	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY												The ABM deposit, Finlayson Lake district, Yukon, Canada, is a bimodal-felsic, replacement-style volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit (19.1 Mt @ 6.6 wt % Zn, 0.9 wt % Cu, 2.0 wt % Pb, 1.4 g/t Au, and 148 g/t Ag) hosted by Late Devonian continental back-arc-related volcanosedimentary rocks of the Kudz Ze Kayah formation. The VMS-related hydrothermal alteration associated with the deposit extends >1 km beyond the mineralization. Zones of pervasive sericite and chlorite alteration occur proximal to the massive sulfide lenses (<50 m) both in the hanging wall and the footwall, and zones of pervasive sericite and moderate sericite & PLUSMN; chlorite alteration extend laterally from the mineralization and into the hanging wall and footwall for hundreds to thousands of meters. Geochemical data and petrographic observations indicate that feldspar destruction and formation of white mica and chlorite were the main alteration processes. In both the hanging wall and footwall to the mineralization, base (e.g., Zn, Cu, Pb) and trace metals (e.g., Sb, Tl, Mo) form halos with elevated values up to 100 and 200 m, respectively.The paragenesis and the formation conditions of the hydrothermal alteration were determined through petrography of hydrothermal alteration assemblages and their crosscutting relationships, electron microprobe analyses of the compositions of white mica, chlorite, and carbonate, and illite-chlorite geothermometry. These data suggest that the sericite & PLUSMN; chlorite assemblage was the earliest and most extensive phase of the hydrothermal alteration that formed at temperatures around 215 & DEG; & PLUSMN; 30 & DEG;C. Overprinting the sericite-chlorite assemblage is the pervasive sericite assemblage that formed at temperatures around 250 & DEG; & PLUSMN; 15 & DEG;C. The pervasive chlorite assemblage formed at temperatures around 320 & DEG; & PLUSMN; 10 & DEG;C and overprints the preceding sericite-rich assemblages. Microprobe analyses of white mica and chlorite generally show that Mg-rich varieties are more common proximal to mineralization and formed earlier in the deposit paragenesis than Fe-rich varieties. Mineralogy derived from short-wave infrared data for mica and chlorite, however, shows no clear spatial trends across the deposit due to complex overprinting relationships between alteration minerals.																			0361-0128	1554-0774				AUG	2023	118	5					1055	1083		10.5382/econgeo.5004	http://dx.doi.org/10.5382/econgeo.5004													WOS:001028813600001

Role of sedimentation and resuspension of particulate matter in fluctuations of trophic status of the Neva Estuary	2008 IEEE/OES US/EU-Baltic International Symposium					IEEE/OES Us/EU-Baltic International Symposium	MAY 27-29, 2008	Tallinn, ESTONIA	IEEE, OES, US Baltic Fdn, Eu Baltic Fdn				Primary production of phytoplankton, concentrations of chlorophyll a, suspended particulate organic and mineral matters and total phosphorus were measured in the Neva Estuary during the field summer expeditions in 2003-2007. Obtained data were compared with the results of earlier investigations. Impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on the trophic status of the Neva Estuary have been analyzed. Relationships between biotic and abiotic environmental factors of natural and anthropogenic origin, which influence the trophic status of the Neva Estuary, have been analyzed. Analysis of the data shows that fluctuation of trophic status of the inner part of the Neva Estuary closely related with resuspension and sedimentation processes. Resuspension of bottom sediments during engineering works in the Neva Estuary probably lead to return of phosphorus to water column and to involvement of phosphorus into small biological cycle of elements. Moreover, according to our data, maximum rate of photosynthesis and concentration of chlorophyll a in the Neva Estuary were observed in zone of geochemical barrier, where fresh river waters mix with saline marine waters. The main part of suspended matter in the Neva Estuary deposited in the zone of geochemical barrier, which is characterized by the highest rate of photosynthesis. The investigations have shown that primary production of the Neva Estuary affected by sedimentation and resuspension of particulate matter and its transformation in a water column. Combine influence of natural and anthropogenic factors (resuspension and sedimentation of particulate matter) results in considerable fluctuation of the trophic status of the Neva Estuary during the last thirty years.

A detailed diatom analysis, along with chronological and lithological studies, was performed for the sediments of one of these paleoreservoirs, uncovered in the Kulikovo section (Sambian Peninsula, Kaliningrad Region of the Russian Federation) and dated to 14,000-12,500 calBP. As a result of this study, the essential diversity of Late Glacial diatoms was revealed and 204 species were found. Among them, benthic and epiphytic species belonging to the group of oligohalobous indifferents predominate. The most typical species are Pseudostaurosira brevistriata, Staurosirella ovata, Gyrosigma attenuatum, G. acuminatum, Amphora affinis, Epithemia adnata and Cymbopleura inaequalis. A comparison with available regional data showed that the mass development of pioneer epiphytic diatoms of the Fragilariaceae in the Aller & oslash;d is common to most of the paleoaquatic ecosystems. A local feature of the Kulikovo paleoreservoir, along with a wide range of ecological diatom groups, is the episode of massive development of Gyrosigma spp., benthic diatoms capable of living in streaming water, in the first half of the Aller & oslash;d. The Kulikovo diatom assemblages reacted sensitively, not only to the main environmental shifts of the Aller & oslash;d and Younger Dryas, but also to smaller-scale climatic events, such as Herzensee Oscillation (GI-1b) and changes in hydrological regimes (water level fluctuations, flow rate) caused by local environmental transformations.

However, the responses of montane vegetation to glacial-interglacial climate changes have received less attention than those of modern alpine vegetation belts. Here, we present a continuous pollen record from the lake Caohai area of Guizhou Province and a quantitative reconstruction of the region's biome and climate changes over the past 21 ka. Our findings demonstrate that the study area was encompassed by evergreen sclerophyll Quercus forest during the LGM, which subsequently transitioned to deciduous broadleaved forest around 15.8 ka, shortly after the termination of the last glacial period. During the early Holocene, the deciduous forest underwent a transformation and gave way to evergreen broadleaved forest around 10.3 ka. The abundance of evergreen subtropical elements peaked between 9 and 5 ka, coinciding with the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM). This was followed by the return of deciduous taxa after the 4 ka in the late Holocene. However, anthropogenic impacts on local vegetation became apparent only from about 2 ka. The pollen-based biome reconstruction features clear vertical shifts that correspond to the modern vegetation belts at different elevations, with a maximum vertical movement of about 1000 m between the last glacial and the Holocene. Statistical analysis of pollen data reveals that principal components can serve as reliable climate indicators, consistent with climate simulations using the TraCE model. Both proxy and model results demonstrate that forest ecosystems undergo transformation when thermal and moisture conditions exceed bioclimatic thresholds, emphasizing the crucial role of climate boundaries in driving biome succession. Our findings unveil an extended cold and dry period during the LGM, with the lowest precipitation observed during the last glacial termination due to intense North Atlantic cooling and weak overturning circulation. The strong agreement between the transition from sclerophyll to deciduous forests and increasing temperatures suggests that deglacial warming primarily drove vertical biome shifts after the LGM in the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Conversely, forest succession during the Holocene, which align with variations in fire intensity, were predominantly triggered by summer monsoon changes. The quantitative reconstructions of both biomes and climates presented in this study provide novel insights into temporal relationships between climate dynamics and ecosystem changes in SW China.

J	Yao, JP; He, GL				Yao, Junping; He, Guilan			Design of Computational Model for Cyanobacterial Pollutant Diffusion Change in Chaohu Lake of China Based on Large Data	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY												Cyanobacteria in Chaohu Lake multiply rapidly and diffuse in large quantities every summer, which has a serious impact on the normal life of the surrounding residents and the local economic development. Therefore, it is urgent to control the cyanobacterial pollutants in Chaohu Lake. In this context, in order to improve the scientificalness and feasibility of control measures, it is an important prerequisite and condition to grasp the change of cyanobacterial pollutant diffusion in Chaohu Lake. For this reason, a computational model for cyanobacterial pollutant diffusion in Chaohu Lake, China, was designed based on the relevant large data. The design of the model is divided into three parts: the first part builds an area calculation model to analyze the change of cyanobacterial pollutant diffusion area; the second part builds a concentration calculation model to analyze the change of cyanobacterial pollutant concentration; and the third part combines the previous two to build a diffusion change calculation model to analyze the rule of cyanobacterial pollutant diffusion change in Chaohu Lake. In order to verify the feasibility and validity of the model, simulation experiments were carried out. The results show that, under the large data related to cyanobacteria pollution in Chaohu Lake, China, from May to August 2017, the calculation model is used to calculate the cyanobacteria pollutant diffusion change. The data obtained are basically consistent with the actual situation, which proves the feasibility and validity of the model. This provides data support for the cyanobacteria pollution control in Chaohu Lake and improves the efficiency and effect of the control.																			1026-0226	1607-887X				JUL 11	2020	2020								2036349	10.1155/2020/2036349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/2036349													WOS:000553437200001

Insights into the terminal pleistocene climate of Australia from high resolution climate modelling	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Interpretations of the palaeoclimate at the end of the deglaciation over Australia suggest that conditions were becoming warmer, but there is an inconsistent picture of the monsoon and its impacts. This understanding can be improved using Earth System Models, but these are too coarse in resolution to fully interrogate the changes in the monsoon and associated climate experienced by early Aboriginal populations. Here we present the first downscaled climate modelling results at high resolution of Sahul-Australia in the terminal Pleistocene (12,000 years before present). The simulations were performed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model downscaled from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and compared to pre-industrial (1850 CE) simulations. Results show that the monsoon was active during this period, albeit in a less dominant form than the pre-industrial. Temperatures were generally 0.25-2 degrees C cooler than the pre-industrial in the south of Sahul and the eastern tropics, however over the central and western equatorial tropics of Sahul annual temperatures were 0.25-2 degrees C warmer, most notably in the austral spring. Aboriginal populations were generally stable until the onset of the Holocene, with populations retreating to refugia in times of unhospitable climatic conditions. Existing interpretations of these climates have insufficient spatial or temporal resolution to accurately describe the effects on Aboriginal populations. Here we quantify more precisely the changes in climate and identify the meteorological features that caused these changes, for example, the broadening of the monsoon trough, intensification of the Carpentaria heat low, meridional gradient of precipitation over the Lake Eyre Basin, and the zonal gradient of Tasmanian precipitation. These improvements in quantification of the palaeoclimate provides invaluable insight into the climate experienced by early Aboriginal populations in Sahul-Australia.

J	Kuai, X; Sun, WW; Xu, M; Liu, YL; Wang, R; Zhang, EL				Kuai, Xiang; Sun, Weiwei; Xu, Min; Liu, Yilan; Wang, Rong; Zhang, Enlou			Sedimentary black carbon reveals shifting anthropogenic drivers in Lake Erhai Basin, southwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Human activities have profoundly transformed Earth's surface systems, becoming the dominant force driving global environmental change. Black carbon (BC) in lake sediments serves as an effective tracer of anthropogenic influence, enabling the identification and quantification of human impacts on ecosystems. In this study, we present a BC record from Lake Erhai in southwest China to explore its linkages to climatic variability and anthropogenic pressures. The results reveal that char constitutes over 95 % of the sedimentary BC, implicating lower-temperature combustion as the primary source. Between 1555 and 1950 CE, BC deposition fluxes remained low, fluctuating with natural background of 0.7 g/m2/yr. However, the post-1950 rapid population growth and industrial expansion triggered a marked increase in BC emissions, with deposition fluxes surging sharply to the maximum of 5.3 g/m2/yr. This shift underscores the sensitivity of sedimentary BC as an indicator of human activity in the Lake Erhai Basin. Comparative analysis with BC records from other Chinese lakes demonstrates a consistent, century-long rise in deposition fluxes across regions with char persistently dominating the BC composition. These findings provide new insights into human influence during the Great Acceleration. Furthermore, integrating management of biomass and coal combustion and promoting cleaner energy transitions would be critical to mitigating the negative climate-environmental impacts of BC, especially under warming and drying trends.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022														0269-7491	1873-6424				OCT 1	2025	382								126791	10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126791		JUL 2025						40633650					WOS:001532056400001

In this study, we investigated the presence, distribution, and composition of MPs in surface water and sediment of eight high-altitude glacier lakes located in the Ka & ccedil;kar and Ke & scedil;i & scedil; Mountains, the northeastern part of T & uuml;rkiye. For surface water samples, MP abundance ranged from 0.2 to 1.6 MP/L, with the highest concentration observed at Ayg & imath;r Lake (S2). For sediment samples, MP abundance ranged from 13 to 121 MP/kg, with the highest concentration observed at Bal & imath;k Lake (S1). Statistical analysis indicated significant spatial variations in microplastic abundance across the lakes. Five different polymer types were identified: polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), and polystyrene (PS). Fibers were the dominant shape in water samples, comprising up to 70%, and fragments were the most common shape observed in sediment samples. Although the Pollution Load Index (PLI) indicated a low level of microplastic contamination across the sampling stations, the Polymer Risk Index (PRI) revealed a high to dangerous level of ecological risk due to the presence of hazardous polymer types. Our findings indicate that contamination caused by local human activities, such as summer tourism, camping, animal husbandry in nearby grasslands, and mountaineering, serves as a significant source of MPs in the study area. To reduce MP pollution in high-altitude glacier lakes, it is essential to implement long-term monitoring programs that track not only human activities but also airborne contamination and deficiencies in waste management.

Genotype and host microbiome alter competitive interactions between Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella sorokiniana	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) continue to increase in frequency and magnitude, threatening global freshwater ecosystems and services. In north-temperate lakes cyanobacteria appear in early summer, succeeding green algae as the dominant phytoplankton group, a pattern thought to be mediated by changes in temperature and bioavailable nutrients. To understand additional drivers of this successional pattern our study used reciprocal invasion experiments to examine the competitive interaction between Microcystis aeruginosa, a dominant contributor to cyanoHABs, and the green alga Chlorella sorokiniana. We considered two factors that may impact these interactions: (1) strain variation, with a specific emphasis on the presence or absence of the gene for the hepatotoxin microcystin, and (2) host-associated bacteria. We used toxic M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 (microcystin producing strain), a non-toxic mutant of PCC 7806, non-toxic M. aeruginosa PCC 9701 (non-microcystin producing strain), and C. sorokiniana. Each organism was available free of all bacteria (i.e., axenic) and with a re-introduced defined bacterial community to generate their xenic counterparts. Competitive interactions were assessed with reciprocal invasion experiments between paired xenic and paired axenic populations of C. sorokiniana and one of the two Microcystis strains, each assessed separately. Flow cytometry and random forest models were used to rapidly discriminate and quantify phytoplankton population densities with 99% accuracy. We found that M. aeruginosa PCC 7806, but not strain PCC 9701, could proliferate from low abundance in a steady-state population of C. sorokiniana. Further, the presence of bacteria allowed M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 to grow to a higher population density into an established C. sorokiniana population than when grown axenic. Conversely, when M. aeruginosa was dominant, C. sorokiniana was only able to proliferate from low density into the PCC 9701 strain, and only when axenic. The mutant of PCC 7806 lacking the ability to produce microcystin behaved similarly to the toxic wild-type, implying microcystin is not responsible for the difference in competitive abilities observed between the two wild-type strains. Quantification of microcystins (MCs) when PCC 7806 M. aeruginosa was introduced into the C. sorokiniana culture showed two-fold more MCs per cell when host associated bacteria were absent compared to present in both species cultures. Our results show that the ability of M. aeruginosa to compete with C. sorokiniana is determined by genomic differences beyond genes involved in microcystin toxin generation and indicate an important role of host-associated bacteria in mediating phytoplankton interspecies interactions. These results expand our understanding of the key drivers of phytoplankton succession and the establishment and persistence of freshwater harmful cyanobacterial blooms.					; Dick, Gregory/D-8901-2012	Schmidt, Kathryn/0000-0002-8082-5218; Jackrel, Sara/0000-0001-7326-4996; Smith, Derek/0000-0002-0895-5712													1568-9883	1878-1470				NOV	2020	99								101939	10.1016/j.hal.2020.101939	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2020.101939								33218432					WOS:000592393500008

To deepen the comprehension of drowning epidemiology in our retrospective study, we analyzed 263 drowning cases across 12 distinct counties of Hungary in a six-year period. The epidemiological data of our study showed many similarities to other countries worldwide, except for the age distribution among drowning victims. In Hungary, the most susceptible age groups for both sexes were from 51 to 70, and a small number of children died from drowning. Males have a three times higher death rate than women. We can observe most drowning cases during the summer period. Concerning the different waterbody types, most drowning incidents occurred in rivers and lakes. An age-old problem of forensic medicine is the diagnosis of true drowning, respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid. The presence of waterborne microorganisms in the systemic circulation can corroborate this diagnosis. The traditional method is the microscopic identification of diatom shells, but recently, PCR-based techniques have also been employed. Our investigation compares the results of these methods. Combining the two methods improved detection, yielding a 2.6-fold increase in positive results (from 63 to 164 cases). Overall, the diatom test was positive in 23.95 % of systemic organ samples but using both methods together increased positive detection to 62.36 %, significantly reducing cases considered as negative.					; Poór, Viktor/A-2512-2011; Simon, Gábor/IXX-0694-2023	Simon, Gabor/0000-0002-6153-3260; 													1344-6223					JUL	2025	76								102663	10.1016/j.legalmed.2025.102663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.legalmed.2025.102663								40609256					WOS:001525152300001

Despite the advancements in understanding the sedimentary processes of aeolian-fluvial interactions, the sedimentary patterns of these interactions are complex in spatiotemporal scale, and the records of Holocene small-scale aeolian-fluvial interaction sedimentary is insufficient, especially in the Tibetan Plateau region. Therefore, this study focuses on analyzing the sedimentary patterns of aeolian-fluvial interactions and their response to climate change in the Paiku Co basin of the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP). Through the examination of aeolian-fluvial sequences, Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating is utilized to establish a chronological framework. Furthermore, proxy indices are explored to identify potential sediment models and their reactions to climate change. The findings indicate that fluvial activity predominated during a relatively warm and wet period around 5.1-4.6 ka, while thicker aeolian sands accumulated extensively during 4.6-4.1 ka as the climate transitioned to cold and dry conditions. On a millennial scale, the aeolian-fluvial interaction sedimentation is characterized by alternating deposition of clay layers and medium to fine sand. This sedimentation pattern is predominantly influenced by climate change. Overall, the findings shed light on the complex coupling between aeolian and fluvial processes in response to past climate changes, which has important implications for understanding the landscape evolution and environmental changes in this sensitive high-altitude region.

J	Thorley, JL; Andrusak, GF				Thorley, Joseph L.; Andrusak, Greg F.			The fishing and natural mortality of large, piscivorous Bull Trout and Rainbow Trout in Kootenay Lake, British Columbia (2008-2013)	PEERJ												Background. Estimates of fishing and natural mortality are important for understanding, and ultimately managing, commercial and recreational fisheries. High reward tags with fixed station acoustic telemetry provides a promising approach to monitoring mortality rates in large lake recreational fisheries. Kootenay Lake is a large lake which supports an important recreational fishery for large Bull Trout and Rainbow Trout. Methods. Between 2008 and 2013, 88 large (>= 500 mm) Bull Trout and 149 large (>= 500 mm) Rainbow Trout were marked with an acoustic transmitter and/or high reward ($100) anchor tags in Kootenay Lake. The subsequent detections and angler recaptures were analysed using a Bayesian individual state-space Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) survival model with indicator variable selection. Results. The final CJS survival model estimated that the annual interval probability of being recaptured by an angler was 0.17 (95% CRI [0.11-0.23]) for Bull Trout and 0.14. (95% CRI [0.09-0.19]) for Rainbow Trout. The annual interval survival probability for Bull Trout was estimated to have declined from 0.91 (95% CRI [0.76-0.97]) in 2009 to just 0.46 (95% CRI [0.24-0.76]) in 2013. Rainbow Trout survival was most strongly affected by spawning. The annual interval survival probability was 0.77 (95% CRI [0.68-0.85]) for a non-spawning Rainbow Trout compared to 0.41 (95% CRI [0.30-0.53]) for a spawner. The probability of spawning increased with the fork length for both species and decreased over the course of the study for Rainbow Trout. Discussion, Fishing mortality was relatively low and constant while natural mortality was relatively high and variable. The results indicate that angler effort is not the primary driver of short-term population fluctations in the Rainbow Trout abundance, Variation in the probability of Rainbow Trout spawning suggests that the spring escapement at the outflow of Trout Lake may be a less reliable index of abundance than previously assumed. Multi-species stock assessment models need to account for the fact that large Bull Trout are more abundant than large Rainbow Trout in Kootenay Lake.																			2167-8359					JAN 10	2017	5								e2874	10.7717/peerj.2874	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2874								28097071					WOS:000394696700013

Threshold values and management options for nutrients in a catchment of a temperate estuary with poor ecological status	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Intensive farming has severe impacts on the chemical status of groundwater and streams and consequently on the ecological status of dependent ecosystems. Eutrophication is a widespread problem in lakes and marine waters. Common problems are hypoxia, algal blooms, fish kills, and loss of water clarity, underwater vegetation, biodiversity and recreational value. In this paper we evaluate the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations of groundwater and surface water in a coastal catchment, the loadings and sources of N and P, and their effect on the ecological status of an estuary. We calculate the necessary reductions in N and P loadings to the estuary for obtaining a good ecological status, which we define based on the number of days with N and P limitation, and the corresponding stream and groundwater threshold values assuming two different management options. The calculations are performed by the combined use of empirical models and a physically based 3-D integrated hydrological model of the whole catchment. The assessment of the ecological status indicates that the N and P loads to the investigated estuary should be reduced to levels corresponding to 52 and 56% of the current loads, respectively, to restore good ecological status. Model estimates show that threshold total N (TN) concentrations should be in the range of 2.9 to 3.1 mg l(-1) in inlet freshwater (streams) to Horsens estuary and 6.0 to 9.3 mg l(-1) in shallow aerobic groundwater (similar to 27-41 mg l(-1) of nitrate), depending on the management measures implemented in the catchment. The situation for total P (TP) is more complex, but data indicate that groundwater threshold values are not needed. The stream threshold value for TP to Horsens estuary for the selected management options is 0.084 mg l(-1). Regional climate models project increasing winter precipitation and runoff in the investigated region resulting in increasing runoff and nutrient loads to the Horsens estuary and many other coastal waters if present land use and farming practices continue. Hence, lower threshold values are required in many coastal catchments in the future to ensure good status of water bodies and ecosystems.

J	Wu, Y; Wang, YX				Wu, Ya; Wang, Yanxin			Geochemical evolution of groundwater salinity at basin scale: a case study from Datong basin, northern China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												A hydrogeochemical investigation using integrated methods of stable isotopes (O-18, H-2), Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, Cl/Br ratios, chloride-mass balance, mass balance and hydrogeochemical modeling was conducted to interpret the geochemical evolution of groundwater salinity in Datong basin, northern China. The delta H-2, delta O-18 ratios in precipitation exhibited a local meteoric water line of delta H-2 = 6.4 delta O-18 -5 (R-2 = 0.94), while those in groundwater suggested their meteoric origin in a historically colder climatic regime with a speculated recharge rate of less than 20.5 mm overall per year, in addition to recharge from a component of deep residual ancient lake water enriched with Br. According to the Sr isotope binary mixing model, the mixing of recharges from the Shentou karst springs (24%), the western margins (11%) and the eastern margins (65%) accounts for the groundwater from the deep aquifers of the down-gradient parts in the central basin is a possible mixing mechanism. In Datong, hydrolysis of silicate minerals is the most important hydrogeochemical process responsible for groundwater chemistry, in addition to dissolution of carbonate and evaporites. In the recharge areas, silicate chemical weathering is typically at the bisiallitization stage, while that in the central basin is mostly at the monosiallitization stage with limited evidence of being in equilibrium with gibbsite. Na exchange with bound Ca, Mg prevails at basin scale, and intensifies with groundwater salinity, while Ca, Mg exchange with bound Na locally occurs in the east pluvial and alluvial plains. Although groundwater salinity increases with the progress of water-rock/sediment interactions along the flow path, as a result of carbonate solubility control and continuous evapotranspiration, Na-HCO3 and Na-Cl-SO4 types of water are usually characterized respectively in the deep and the shallow aquifers of an inland basin with a silicate terrain in an arid climatic regime.

The effect of boreal jack pine harvest residue retention on soil environment and processes	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Forest residue left on the ground following harvesting (i.e., "slash") plays an important role in moderating the physical and chemical environment of the soil for future forest growth. Leaving too little slash can leave the soil exposed to extreme fluctuations in soil conditions and fewer nutrients that may hinder future forest growth, while leaving too much slash makes it difficult for new trees to establish or increases fire hazard. This study investigated the impacts of blading and different loadings of slash (0, 15, 30 and 60 Mg ha-1 dry mass) on soil physical (temperature and moisture), chemical (soil solution) and biological (soil respiration and net ecosystem exchange) processes over 4 summers at a harvested jack pine stand within the Island Lake Biomass Harvest Experiment in northeastern Ontario. Soil temperature and moisture were highest in the bladed and lowest in the 60 Mg ha-1 slash loading. Soil solution chemistry was generally similar among the 0, 15 and 30 Mg ha-1 slash loadings. However, total organic carbon and potassium had higher concentrations at 60 Mg ha-1 treatment and lower concentrations in the bladed treatment, the opposite trend occurred for pH and nitrate. Over three years the concentrations of cations decreased and nitrogen species increased for bladed to 30 Mg ha-1 treatments. The 60 Mg ha-1 treatment had increases in some solutes over time suggesting there is a lag effect as needles and bark are incorporated into the soil. The soil respiration data showed that lowest rates of CO2 production occurred in the bladed treatment, but increased over time as the forest floor developed. CO2 production was highest in the 60 Mg ha-1 slash loading, with high rates of soil respiration in the first year, as fine debris from slash deposited onto the soil, however little photosynthesis occurred in these treatments. Thus retention of small to moderate amounts of slash seem to be sufficient for maintaining a suitable balance of soil conditions for a regenerating forest over the short term.

Impoundment had a pronounced but transient effect on pike reproductive success. The abundance of young-of-the-year pike in 1977, the 1st yr following impoundment, was 4-10 times higher than in the following 3 yr. Flooded terrestrial vegetation was apparently conducive to pike reproductive success only in the 1st after inundation. A strong 1977 year-class was evident in gillnet catches 4 yr later. This year-class was slower growing and in poorer condition than other year-classes. The impoundment of Wupaw Bay had no discernible effect on the growth, condition or mortality of the adult pike population, with the exception of changes ascribed to the presence of the large 1977 year-class. The growth of the adult pike population appeared to be limited by forage fish abundance, but variations in feeding on fish were largely unexplained and were probably due to natural variation. The year-to-year pattern of forage fish reproductive success could not be related to the timing of lake impoundment, but may have been related to summer water temperatures. Variations in feeding on invertebrates appeared to be due to postimpoundment increases in productivity, but these changes were insufficient to affect population parameters. Wupaw Bay surface area increased by only 9% as a result of lake impoundment, the smallest areal increase in the Southern Indian Lake reservoir. The influx of nutrients and flooded terrestrial vegetation was therefore much smaller than in other temperate reservoirs where increases in pike production were observed.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	4					706	714		10.1139/f84-082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-082													WOS:A1984SU52800015
J	Li, Q; Wang, C; An, L; Ding, MH				Li, Qian; Wang, Che; An, Lu; Ding, Minghu			Influence of Supraglacial Lakes on Accuracy of Inversion of Greenland Ice Sheet Surface Melt Data in Different Passive Microwave Bands	REMOTE SENSING												The occurrence of Supraglacial Lakes (SGLs) may influence the signals acquired with microwave radiometers, which may result in a degree of uncertainty when employing microwave radiometer data for the detection of surface melt. Accurate monitoring of surface melting requires a reasonable assessment of this uncertainty. However, there is a scarcity of research in this field. Therefore, in this study, we computed surface melt in the vicinity of Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs) by employing Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Ka-band data and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite L-band data and extracted SGL pixels by utilizing Sentinel-2 data. A comparison between surface melt results derived from AWS air temperature estimates and those obtained with remote sensing inversion in the two different bands was conducted for sites below the mean snowline elevation during the summers of 2016 to 2020. Compared with sites with no SGLs, the commission error (CO) of DMSP morning and evening data at sites where these water bodies were present increased by 36% and 30%, respectively, and the number of days with CO increased by 12 and 3 days, respectively. The omission error (OM) of SMOS morning and evening data increased by 33% and 32%, respectively, and the number of days with OM increased by 17 and 21 days, respectively. Identifying the source of error is a prerequisite for the improvement of surface melt algorithms, for which this study provides a basis.					; Ding, Minghu/AFU-3600-2022; Li, Qian/NHP-0119-2025	Ding, Minghu/0000-0002-1142-6598; 														2072-4292				MAY	2024	16	10							1673	10.3390/rs16101673	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16101673													WOS:001233216300001

Castaneda lies on the north-eastern border of the Alpine region occupied by the Golasecca culture during the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages, on an important communication route through the Val Mesolcina. This very old interaction zone connected Northern Italy with the Swiss Plateau (Mittelland) and the Alpine Rhine Valley, as far as Lake Constance. In summer 2021, four new graves were uncovered. Grave 1/2021, dating from the end of the Hallstatt period, contained a bronze cauldron with cross-shaped attachments. The entirely preserved vessel belongs to Type C, as defined by Gero v. Merhart. These cauldrons have been discovered in a wide area, stretching from the Balaton region in Hungary to the source of the Seine in France, almost exclusively as part of high-ranking male grave inventories. The Caput Adriae region is suspected to have been the production centre. The discovery of the Castaneda cauldron is an opportunity to reanalyse the distribution of Type C cauldrons. This may shed some new light on Early Iron Age trade routes and trade networks, while also offering new insights into social hierarchies in the Alpine region of the Golasecca culture during the Early Iron Age.

Habitat modulates population-level responses of freshwater salmon growth to a century of change in climate and competition	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The impacts of climate change are widespread and threaten natural systems globally. Yet, within regions, heterogeneous physical landscapes can differentially filter climate, leading to local response diversity. For example, it is possible that while freshwater lakes are sensitive to climate change, they may exhibit a diversity of thermal responses owing to their unique morphology, which in turn can differentially affect the growth and survival of vulnerable biota such as fishes. In particular, salmonids are cold-water fishes with complex life histories shaped by diverse freshwater habitats that are sensitive to warming temperatures. Here we examine the influence of habitat on the growth of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in nursery lakes of Canada's Skeena River watershed over a century of change in regional temperature and intraspecific competition. We found that freshwater growth has generally increased over the last century. While growth tended to be higher in years with relatively higher summer air temperatures (a proxy for lake temperature), long-term increases in growth appear largely influenced by reduced competition. However, habitat played an important role in modulating the effect of high temperature. Specifically, growth was positively associated with rising temperatures in relatively deep (>50 m) nursery lakes, whereas warmer temperatures were not associated with a change in growth for fish among shallow lakes. The influence of temperature on growth also was modulated by glacier extent whereby the growth of fish from lakes situated in watersheds with little (i.e., <5%) glacier cover increased with rising temperatures, but decreased with rising temperatures for fish in lakes within more glaciated watersheds. Maintaining the integrity of an array of freshwater habitats-and the processes that generate and maintain them-will help foster a diverse climate-response portfolio for important fish species, which in turn can ensure that salmon watersheds are resilient to future environmental change.

However, research on the community structure of phytoplankton in the Golmud area is very scarce at present. To explore the composition of phytoplankton in the Golmud area, eukaryotic phytoplankton and environmental parameters were sampled in September 2020. The composition and diversity of the eukaryotic phytoplankton community were determined by microscopic observation and Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that a total of 40 species of eukaryotic phytoplankton from 4 phyla were identified by microscopic observation, and 154 species of eukaryotic phytoplankton from 7 phyla were obtained by high-throughput sequencing, mainly Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta. The dominant species were Dunaliella sp., Teleaulax sp., Parvodinium mixtum, and Lindavia radiosa. The eukaryotic phytoplankton density in summer was 0.09-12.08 x 10(5) cells/L, the total biomass was 0.002-0.55 mg/L, and the concentration of chlorophyll-a was 0.00-0.91 mu g/L. Multiple alpha diversity indices showed that the diversity of water in different salinities was in the order of freshwater > brackish > saline. The beta diversity results showed that the eukaryotic phytoplankton community composition was more similar in water with the same salinity. The redundancy analysis results of water with different salinities showed that environmental factors susc as salinity, total phosphorus concentration, and dissolved oxygen affected the eukaryotic phytoplankton community structure, among which salinity had the greatest influence.					; Xiong, Xiong/GQQ-8712-2022; Liu, Guoxiang/L-7413-2019	XiaoQi, Dong/0000-0003-1573-4229; Liu, Guoxiang/0000-0001-8565-2363														1424-2818				APR	2022	14	4							269	10.3390/d14040269	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14040269													WOS:000786265700001

The results contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between environment and human activities in the late Neolithic Jianghan Plain, discussed in the context of archaeological record and published available data. During the early Shijiahe culture (4.6-4.4 ka BP), a mixed broadleaved evergreen and deciduous forest, mainly consisting of evergreen Quercus, Pinus, Cyclobalanopsis, Liquidambar, and Ulmus, developed at Tanjialing. The high values of TOC, TN, and C/N suggests that the organic matter is mainly from allochthonous terrestrial plants. Combined with delta C-13(org) analysis, C-3 plants occupied the area, and the climate was warm and humid, with less human disturbance during this period. The abrupt rise of TOC, TN and C/N content and decrease of delta C-13(org), combined with the local spread of Typha and Cyperaceae, show that this area witnessed a short-term water regime expansion event during the early period of the Shijiahe culture. In the mid-period of the Shijiahe culture (4.4-42 ka BP), a significant rise in herbs especially Poaceae and a remarkable decline in broadleaved trees imply an increasingly intensified human interference. The continuous decline of TOC, TN and C/N content indicates the reduction of allochthonous organic matter from terrestrial plants. All proxies' responses suggest decreasing effective moisture and temperature during this stage. In the early and middle period of the Shijiahe culture, the warm and wet climate was favorable for agriculture, which promoted the prosperity of the Shijiahe culture, and Shijiahe ancient city played an important role in the defense against flood and invasion. Chronic drought around 4.2 ka BP not only hindered the development of local agriculture, but also hindered the ditch system work, leading to the fall of the Shijiahe culture. The defense function of the ancient city vanished due to dry climate and groundwater decline: therefore, the ancient city was abandoned. The extreme events (flood, extreme drought etc.) related to the climate transformation played an important role in the legendary Yu Zheng Sanmiao War. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Yu			Resonance Generation of Short Internal Waves by the Barotropic Seiches in an Ice-Covered Shallow Lake	PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												Purpose. The observation measurements testify the fact that heat and mass transfer processes in the shallow ice-covered lakes are not limited to the molecular diffusion only. In particular, the effective thermal diffusivity exceeds the molecular one by up to a few orders of magnitude. Now it is widely accepted that the transfer processes, in spite of their low intensity, are controlled by intermittent turbulence. At the same time, its nature and generation mechanism are still studied insufficiently. The paper represents one of such mechanisms associated with resonance generation of short internal waves by the barotropic seiches. Methods and Results. The temperature measurements in a shallow lake in winter were used as an experimental base. Having been analyzed, the temperature profiles' dynamics observed during a few weeks after freezing revealed the anomalous values of thermal diffusivity. At that the temperature pulsations' spectra clearly demonstrate the peak close to the main mode of barotropic seiches. Counterphase oscillations at the different depths and pronounced heterogeneity of the amplitudes of temperature pulsations over depth indicate presence of internal waves. Based on these data, the mechanism of energy transfer from the barotropic seiches to the internal waves similar to the "tidal conversion" (the latter governs resonance generation of internal tides in the ocean), is proposed. The expressions for heat flux, energy dissipation rate and effective thermal diffusivity are derived. Conclusions. Internal waves can play an essential role in the processes of interior mixing and heat transfer in the ice-covered lakes. Though direct wind-induced turbulence production is inhibited, baric perturbations in the atmosphere can give rise to barotropic seiches, which play the role of an intermediate energy reservoir and can generate short resonant internal waves resulted from interaction with the undulate lake floor. The internal wave field parameters strongly depend on the barotropic seiche amplitudes, buoyancy frequency and the bottom topography features.

In this work, we have identified one such palaeo-lake deposit in the Upper Alaknanda Basin, close to Badrinath town. The sediments are of lacustrine origin; however the continuity is broken by intermittent fluvial deposits, which indicate changes in the depositional environment. We used Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating to develop a robust chronology of the palaeo-lake deposit. Grain size analyses of sediments were carried out to understand the depositional environment, and morphometric analysis of the valley was conducted to obtained clues about the neotectonic activities in the region. The OSL ages show that the deposition of the lake sediments occurred between 21.6 +/- 4.7 ka to 10.5 +/- 1.4 ka. Two phases of paleo-lake deposit and subsequent outburst is established from the OSL age, grain size distribution and on the basis of field observations. The high sedimentation rate in the upper part of the deposit indicates an increase in the monsoonal rainfall and glacial retreat post Younger Dryas event. The colder periods are represented by varves and rhythmites, while the warmer periods are represented by thick laminated sand. This study indicates that the glaciers in the Upper Alakanada Basin responded to the fluctuations in the palaeo-climate.					; Pattanaik, Jitendra Kumar/AHD-0074-2022; Singh, Atul/AAE-3213-2020; Jaiswal, Manoj/L-9967-2019	Nayak, Kalyani/0000-0001-6507-4842; 													1367-9120	1878-5786				APR 15	2022	227								105079	10.1016/j.jseaes.2022.105079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2022.105079		JAN 2022											WOS:000788432100002

Evolution of the Hydrobiological Communities of a Coastal Lake in the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago (Southern Island, Arctic Russia) in Relation to Climate Change Following the End of the Little Ice Age	WATER												There are very few data linking recent climatic changes to changes in biological communities in the Russian Arctic, and no palaeoecological data are available from the Novaya Zemlya archipelago (NZ). We studied chironomid, cladoceran, and diatom communities from a 165-year-old sediment core from a lake on Southern Island, NZ. Sixteen diatom and four cladoceran species new to NZ were found in the lake. Significant changes occurred in biological communities; species turnover was highest for diatoms (2.533 SD), followed by chironomids (1.781 SD) and cladocerans (0.614 SD). Biological communities showed a correlation with meteorologically recorded climate parameters. For chironomids, the strongest relationships were found for TJune, TJuly, and Tann. Both planktonic proxies, diatoms, and cladocerans showed a relationship with summer and annual air temperature and precipitation. The largest shifts in communities can be linked to recent climatic events, including the onset of steady warming following the variable conditions at the end of the LIA (ca. 1905), the cooling associated with the highest precipitation on record between 1950 and 1970, and, probably, the anthropogenic influence specific to Novaya Zemlya at this time.

The sonar works in concert with DVL and precision GPS sensors in order to log data that can be used to generate bathymetric maps through the use of the MB System software suite. The boat's physical structure includes pontoons, vertical supports, and a platform housing the vessel's power, sensor, control, and communication systems. Additional systems include a camera and video transmission system for remotely piloted operation, a suite of sensors and controllers for autonomous navigation, and equipment for ballasting the pontoons. An off-board control station aids in navigation computations, provides the pilot/supervisor interface, and links the system to the internet for real-time internet-based piloting and/or monitoring of the mission. An additional winch system has been developed for future operations involving the deployment of a sensor package to various depths. A number of successful test deployments have been completed to date, and operations during the summer of 2008 will include mapping of the Elkhorn Slough, portions of the southern end of San Francisco Bay, portions of Lake Tahoe, and shallow water coastal waters in the San Juan Islands. Ultimately, a more robust model of the boat is planned for deployment at NOAA's Kasitsna Bay Laboratory in Alaska. The system has been developed in partnership with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and NOAA's West Coast and Polar Regions Undersea Research Center. This paper will review the technical design of the system and will present the functional performance achieved to date.																			0197-7385		978-1-4244-2619-5				2008							1616	+																WOS:000265654501069
J	Rogers, DB; Dreiss, SJ				Rogers, DB; Dreiss, SJ			Saline groundwater in Mono basin, California .1. Distribution	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Mono Lake, California is a perennial, closed-basin saline lake. Up to 2 km of sediments have accumulated below the lake, and a well log shows that saline groundwater of concentration >18,000 ppm extends to the bottom of the basin fill. We investigated the groundwater system with the variable-density flow and solute transport code SUTRA to determine if the basin's recharge and inferred groundwater salinity are consistent with observational data. Steady state model predictions of the position and shape of the interface separating saline from fresh groundwater are consistent with the salinity profile derived from the spontaneous-potential (SP) log of a geothermal well on the lake's shoreline. We also inferred the basin-wide saline groundwater distribution and concentration from experiments with a steady state model of the entire basin groundwater system. Hydrologic variations around the lake determine the position of the saline-fresh groundwater interface: Higher recharge rates characteristic of the Sierra Nevada shoreline push the interface far beneath the lake. The interface probably lies below the shoreline around much of the rest of the lake. On the low-recharge northeastern shoreline the interface top may lie outside the lake edge. This positions the saline groundwater discharge zone just below the playa surface and contributes to development of salt flats on the recently exposed former lake bed. Simulations suggest that the basin fill permeability may not have significant anisotropy, possibly owing to extensive faulting which increases vertical permeability. For an anisotropic basin fill, the resultant increased channeling of recharge beneath the lake readily overcomes the opposing force of the saline groundwater density, and it is flushed out of the basin sediments. A simple permeability representation of the basin lithology, with low permeability below the lake and an anisotropic transition to higher permeability outside the lake, reasonably represents the well and spring water salinity observations.																			0043-1397					DEC	1995	31	12					3131	3150		10.1029/95WR02108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95WR02108													WOS:A1995TK64700023

This study investigates the relationship between SLD2 water levels and fluctuations in glacial surface elevation (up to 3.6 m) and delineates subglacial lakes within the study area. We provide a comprehensive analysis based on integrated data from IPR (2018), Sentinel-1 double-differential interferogram synthetic aperture radar (DDInSAR) (2017-2022), ICESat-2 laser altimeter (2019-2022), and KOMPSAT-5 synthetic aperture radar (2021 and 2023). The concave bedrock structure and low hydraulic head areas concentrate subglacial meltwater, facilitating water accumulation and retention, forming a lake. The SLD2 lake complex is identified based on bed topography, hydraulic gradient, and relative bed reflection intensity. Its area is approximately 1/9.2 of the lake area estimated through remote sensing. Our analysis suggests that variations in water supply and discharge along the subglacial channel network influence lake water levels, as evidenced by a surface elevation increase of up to 3.69 m in the SLD2 area from 2019 to 2022. Additionally, the presence of crevasses and incoherence in the DDInSAR imagery suggests that these subglacial lakes impact glacier flow velocity.					; Han, Hyangsun/AAE-7670-2022; Pyun, Sukjoon/AGG-8602-2022	Han, Hyangsun/0000-0002-0414-519X; gim, taeug/0000-0003-0570-9150; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				JUN	2025	130	6							e2024JF008142	10.1029/2024JF008142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JF008142													WOS:001500139600001

Historical drivers of a frequent fire regime in the red pine forests of Voyageurs National Park, MN, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We developed a fire history for Voyageurs National Park (VNP), MN, USA based on 129 fire-scarred cross sections collected at 39 disjunct locations to develop a baseline understanding of the history of fire in the region. We dated 443 scars representing 126 unique fire years with the earliest fire recorded in 1665 and the most recent in 1972. The Weibull Median Fire Interval from individual fire intervals at the 39 sites is about 18 years and two years for the study area as a whole. Site-scale fire intervals were relatively short, with about 75% of the intervals between fires less than 30 years and more than half of the intervals shorter than 20 years. Approximately 61% of the 126 unique fire years were recorded at only 1 site and about 20% of fires were recorded at 2 or more sites. The median interval between fires that were synchronous at 3 or more sites is 7 years, with the earliest synchronous fire occurring in 1718 and the last in 1936. Fires occurring at more than three sites coincided with summers that are significantly drier than average during the fire year. In VNP, several lines of evidence are suggestive of the potential role of people in augmenting the fire regime above that which would have occurred due to lightning alone. The patterns of fire activity in VNP highlight the same issues that have been noted elsewhere, namely that fires have been prominent in the past in shaping the character of Upper Great Lakes forests and that fire activity has been much reduced since the 20th century. The reduction of fire activity observed after the early 20th century could be as much related to the reduction of human ignition and the removal of people from the landscape as it is to active suppression. This research suggests that the appropriate use of planned fire should be employed as an important management tool, likely through the intentional ignition of fires rather than a reliance on lightning starts alone. This research represents another step in better understanding the processes that have shaped the landscape of Voyageurs National Park, while continuing a dialogue around the future of an ecologically, economically, and culturally significant subset of the Border Lakes landscape.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				DEC 1	2017	405						31	43		10.1016/j.foreco.2017.09.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.09.014													WOS:000413878500005

Previous studies indicate that both the local generation and long-range transport from out-of-basin sources are important in contributing to O-3 exceedances, but little is known about the impact of regional meteorology on O-3 source regions. To develop a better understanding of the factors affecting O-3 levels and sources in the Lake Tahoe Basin, a comprehensive field study was performed in the summer of 2010. Included in this effort was a meteorological analysis addressing potential regional meteorological influences leading to periods of elevated levels of O-3. Three approaches were used to conduct the analysis: (1) regional atmospheric pressure difference (i.e., the Washoe Zephyr) to access potential transport, (2) back trajectory modeling using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model to determine where the air masses originated and, (3) composite soundings to evaluate in-Basin atmospheric influences. These analyses indicate the Washoe Zephyr did not strongly impact O-3 levels; however, higher O-3 levels were found to correspond with both a more southerly wind component and a dip in dew point temperature around 400 hPa. The results also indicate that if transport does occur, it is more likely to come from the San Joaquin Valley and move to the southern part of the Basin, rather than originating in the large cities to the west (i.e., Sacramento and San Francisco).																			0177-7971	1436-5065				JUN	2017	129	3					297	308		10.1007/s00703-016-0471-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00703-016-0471-z													WOS:000401736900005
J	Bergeron, M; Vincent, WF				Bergeron, M; Vincent, WF			Microbial food web responses to phosphorus supply and solar UV radiation in a subarctic lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We examined the effects of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and phosphorus enrichment on microbial food web structure in a subarctic oligotrophic lake (Lac l'Eau Claire, Canada; latitude 56 degrees 10' N, longitude 74 degrees 30' W) using replicated, 201 polyethylene containers incubated in situ. The experiments were run for between 6 and 9 d at the surface of the lake at 3 times during the summer open water period. Chlorophyll a (chi a) production of the >2 pm fraction of the phytoplankton community was stimulated by P; this response was reduced on average by 31% in the presence of UV-A, and by an additional 29% in the presence of UV-B. Conversely the <2 mu m chl a fraction declined with P enrichment, but to a lesser extent in the presence of UV-B. Cell counts of picocyanobacteria showed a decrease under P enrichment, with significantly greater declines induced by UV-A and additionally by UV-B. The nanoflagellate community increased in cell concentration in response to P addition, but only in the absence of UV-A. Bacterial cell concentrations in the P enrichments remained close to or slightly above (up to 20 %) the initial values, but sharply declined in the treatments without P addition; the positive effect of enrichment was not influenced by UV-A or by UV-B. This diverse array of responses implies that shifts in underwater UVR caused by chancres in spectral penetration through the atmosphere (ozone depletion) or water column (changes in dissolved organic carbon) will influence microbial trophic structure as well as productivity within subarctic lakes. Such effects, however, will be limited to aquatic environments that are naturally exposed to high UVR such as shallow water columns or surface waters during diurnal stratification.

J	Bird, GA; Schwartz, WJ; Motycka, M; Rosentreter, J				Bird, GA; Schwartz, WJ; Motycka, M; Rosentreter, J			Behavior of 60Co and 134Cs in a Canadian Shield lake over 5 years	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Radionuclides were added to the anoxic hypolimnion of a Canadian Shield lake to simulate the nuclear fuel waste disposal scenario where radionuclides might enter the bottom waters of a lake. The radionuclides remained in the hypolimnion until lake mixing at autumn turnover after which Co-60 was rapidly lost and Cs-134 was slowly lost from the water. Only 0.4% of the Co-60 and 0.6% of the Cs-134 remained in the water at year 5. Highest concentrations occurred in periphyton and filter feeders, Holopedium gibberum and clams (Anodonata grandis grandis). From maximum annual concentrations in clam tissues, it was estimated that the availability of Co-60 for uptake had a half-time (t(1/2)) of 835 days in the lake, whereas that for Cs-134 was 780 days. Loss rate coefficients, k, for the radionuclides from taxa ranged from 0.0008 to 0.0043 day(-1) (t(1/2) = 161-866 days) for Co-60 and from 0.0009 to 0.005 day(-1) (t(1/2) = 139-770 days) for Cs-134. Cobalt-60 concentrations in forage fish were low, whereas Cs-134 concentrations increased over the first year or two, then slowly declined. On the basis of k values measured for forage fish, the biological half-time of Cs-134 in forage fish ranged from 328 to 630 days. Maximum Cs-134 concentrations in forage fish were higher following hypolimnetic addition than epilimnetic addition. Relatively high Cs-134 concentrations in periphyton at year 5 point to the importance of benthic pathways in the recycling of contaminants to higher trophic levels. The presence of Cs-134 in biota 5 years after the addition, long after concentrations were no longer detectable in surface waters, is evidence of the persistence of Cs in aquatic systems. The k values (or t(1/2) values) for the loss of Co-60 and Cs-134 from water and their uptake and loss from biota can be used to establish parameter values for assessment models. The results demonstrate that assessment models should account for the release of radionuclides from sediment and their subsequent recycling in the food chain when modeling over the long term after the end of a radionuclide release to the environment.

Sedimentation in the ephemeral landslide dammed paleolake in Indo-Burmese Range: Late Pleistocene-Holocene climatic variability and surface processes coupling	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Late Pleistocene-Holocene marks a sharp transition in climate perturbation affecting landform patterns and depositional sequence in tectonically active regions. We investigate the fluvial landforms and Holocene fluviallacustrine sedimentary sequences in an ephemeral landslide-dammed intra-montane paleolake, which acts as an archive for reconstructing extreme events driven surface processes and paleo-climatic history along the DailiImphal River in the Indo-Burmese Range. The effect of climate-tectonic coupling on surface processes is explored through quantitative geomorphologic analysis of the landscape and sedimentological proxies, including grain size and shape analysis, geochemistry, and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of the lacustrine sequence. This analysis helps constrain the climatically sensitive hydrodynamics during the Late PleistoceneHolocene period. The lack of grain size, geochemical variations in the sediment column, and geochemical affinity with the substrate, the Disang Shale Formation, point towards the dominance of erosion from a proximal sediment source. We argue that the pre-Holocene B & Oslash;lling-Aller & Oslash;d (12-12.9 ka) climatic extreme caused excessive mass wasting, which blocked the Daili-Imphal River and formed a paleolake, paradoxically resulting in a low sedimentation rate during the early Holocene. The sedimentation rate increased during the Mid-Late Holocene due to local climatic optima. This unique setup highlights the role of local climatic fluctuations on the ephemeral growth of geomorphic and sedimentary archives.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 1	2025	679								113279	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113279													WOS:001573850100001

Hypereutrophication, Hydrogen Sulfide, and Environmental Injustices: Mechanisms and Knowledge Gaps at the Salton Sea	GEOHEALTH												The Salton Sea, California's largest lake, is undergoing significant environmental degradation, which has adverse health effects on nearby rural communities, primarily Latinx and Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indian. Over the past two decades, the lake's water levels have steadily dropped. Water conditions in the Sea, characterized by low oxygen and high nutrient levels, favor the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This study investigates the connection between the Sea's changing conditions, particularly the worsening water quality, and H2S emissions using air quality and water quality data collected since 2013 and 2004, respectively. H2S concentrations often exceed California's air quality standards, particularly in areas near the Sea during summer months. Wind patterns substantially impact detection of H2S. When wind is blowing from the Sea toward communities with sensors, located to the northwest of the Sea, H2S is detected significantly more often. Current monitoring efforts underestimate the frequency and distribution of H2S that exceeds air quality standards. An air sensor deployed in shallow water over the Salton Sea by a community science program detected substantially higher concentrations of H2S, particularly when wind was blowing over exposed sediment and shallow water, suggesting that these are a significant and overlooked H2S source at the Salton Sea. These findings highlight the need for improved air quality monitoring and more effective environmental management policies to protect public health in the region. The study emphasizes the importance of community-led solutions and provides insights relevant to other regions experiencing similar environmental crises.

The interaction of regional and local drivers shapes summer ecosystem metabolism in lakes across Canada	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Assessments of lake gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) and their balance (net ecosystem production, NEP) have been limited to specific watersheds and a limited number of lakes, often along narrow environmental gradients. This is because conventional approaches require either lengthy incubations or the deployment of monitoring equipment, none of which are feasible for large-scale studies. Here we present a macroscale study of lake metabolism and explore the patterns and drivers of GPP, R, and NEP in lakes across Canada as part of the LakePulse network. We measured summertime water column metabolic rates in 742 lakes, using an oxygen isotopic (delta 18O2) approach, which provide an integrative snapshot of mixed-layer metabolism in stratified lakes, or whole-lake metabolism in polymictic lakes. The lakes were distributed across the five major Canadian continental drainage basins, covering a wide range of in-lake, land use, and climatic features. Gross primary production and R varied by four orders of magnitude across lakes and regions, driven by factors such as total phosphorus and nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and chlorophyll. Net ecosystem production had a weak but significant positive linear relationship with water column light and a negative relationship with colored dissolved organic matter. Our results reveal systematic differences in regional baseline GPP and R driven by landscape properties such as altitude, and that lake metabolism in some regions may be more sensitive to eutrophication and browning, mediated by regional hydrology, which is itself linked to climate.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2025	70	7					1962	1980		10.1002/lno.70095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.70095		MAY 2025											WOS:001498612700001

Features of Chemical Composition, Transformation, and Circulation of Matter in the Eutrophic Lake Kroshnozero, Republic of Karelia	WATER RESOURCES												Hydrochemical studies carried out in Lake Kroshnozero in 1953-1954, 1986-1987, and 2021-2023 under different intensities of human economic activity in the catchment area and directly on the reservoir revealed changes in the chemical composition of the water and identified the main limnological processes by which one can judge the restructuring of the lake ecosystem over the past 70 years. In the early 1950s, Lake Kroshnozero was already eutrophic. The average annual concentration of Ptot in the lake water was 32 mu g/L. River runoff plays the main role in the transport of biogenic elements into the lake (primarily phosphorus). Compared to the 1950s, the export of Ptot with river water over a 70-year period changed from 5.17 to 8.45 t/year. The external phosphorus load on the reservoir currently amounts to 0.92 g/m2 year, which is 2.2 times higher than in the 1950s. Currently, during the period of summer temperature stratification in deep-water areas of the lake with an acute O2 deficiency, environmental conditions (Eh, t, pH) are created in the bottom layers of water, under which P-PO4 begins to mobilize from bottom sediments. Additional (internal) phosphorus load promotes an increase in production processes in the reservoir. Kinetic patterns of transformation and turnover of substances in the lake water are considered. It was found that the transformation of organic matter, Norg, Ptot and Si proceeds more slowly than the turnover of mineral forms of nitrogen compounds and phosphorus.

Correlation Between Size and Plumage Color of Migrating Male and Female Long-eared Owls (Asio otus)	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												The Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) is one of few owl species with sexually dimorphic plumage coloration, with males displaying a light phenotype and females displaying a dark phenotype. This dichromatism can be a useful tool for sexing these owls in the field; however, we observed that some individuals display an intermediate phenotype, which is neither distinctly light nor dark and limits confidence in identifying sex. In this study, we used plumage coloration of the underwing, face, and legs to predict the sex of Long-eared Owls banded during spring migration at Whitefish Point, Michigan, USA, from 2016 to 2022 (n 1/4 1967) and summarized differences between measurements of size such as body mass, wing length, and tail length among the three phenotypes. We found that Long-eared Owls with light plumage (classified as male) were the smallest, owls with dark plumage (classified as female) were the largest, and owls with intermediate plumage (classified as unknown sex) were intermediate in size. Using molecular sexing on a subsample of these owls (n 1/4 116), we found that only 1 of 76 (1.3%) owls with light or dark plumage had its sex incorrectly predicted using plumage color, and of the 40 unknown sex individuals with intermediate plumage, 35 (87.5%) were female and 5 ( 12.5%) were male. This study reinforces previous findings that distinctly light or dark plumage is a reliable indicator of sex in Long-eared Owls, and provides new evidence that Long-eared Owls with intermediate plumage are likely small females but may also be large males. We conclude that Long-eared Owls migrating through the Great Lakes region of the United States display significant differences in both size and plumage between the sexes, and that these two measures of dimorphism are correlated.

The influence of carbon cycling on oxygen depletion in north-temperate lakes	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion during summer stratification in lakes can lead to hypoxic and anoxic conditions. Hypolimnetic anoxia is a water quality issue with many consequences, including reduced habitat for cold-water fish species, reduced quality of drinking water, and increased nutrient and organic carbon (OC) release from sediments. Both allochthonous and autochthonous OC loads contribute to oxygen depletion by providing substrate for microbial respiration; however, their relative contributions to oxygen depletion across diverse lake systems remain uncertain. Lake characteristics, such as trophic state, hydrology, and morphometry, are also influential in carbon-cycling processes and may impact oxygen depletion dynamics. To investigate the effects of carbon cycling on hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, we used a two-layer process-based lake model to simulate daily metabolism dynamics for six Wisconsin lakes over 20 years (1995-2014). Physical processes and internal metabolic processes were included in the model and were used to predict dissolved oxygen (DO), particulate OC (POC), and dissolved OC (DOC). In our study of oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic lakes, we found autochthony to be far more important than allochthony to hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. Autochthonous POC respiration in the water column contributed the most towards hypolimnetic oxygen depletion in the eutrophic study lakes. POC water column respiration and sediment respiration had similar contributions in the mesotrophic and oligotrophic study lakes. Differences in terms of source of respiration are discussed with consideration of lake productivity and the processing and fates of organic carbon loads.

EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												A normalised intensity record has been obtained from 2500 sediment samples taken from three cores of length 50 m from Lac du Bouchet, a small maar crater lake in the Massif Central of France. The sediment sequence has been dated by C-14 in the top 40 kyr, by correlation of the pollen-derived climatic stratigraphy with the marine delta(18)O stratigraphy, and by Ar/Ar ages (275 +/- 7 kyr) for a tephra interbedded at 43-m depth. The sediments are mainly detrital, and fall into two broad sediment types: silty clays (83% of the total) deposited under glacial climatic conditions with high titanomagnetite concentrations (0.5-1% by weight); and compacted gyttjas (organic-rich clays) deposited under warmer conditions, with a more variable magnetic mineralogy of lower concentration. Normalisation of the NRM by susceptibility, ARM and SIRM yields palaeointensity records that are similar to each other, but bear little resemblance to the normalisor records. SIRM gives the best results of the three. However, the compacted gyttjas give consistently low palaeointensity values, and high palaeointensities correspond to high SIRM/ARM ratios, which occur during the full glacials of delta(18)O stages 2 and 6 -normalisation has incompletely removed lithological and climatic factors from the NRM. To overcome this; we have attempted a secondary normalisation by weighting the palaeointensity values according to a least-squares fit to the SIRM/ARM, resulting in an improved palaeointensity estimate. The average accumulation rate of. 15 cm/kyr, together with the dose sampling interval, gives a palaeointensity record of much greater resolution than most published palaeointensity records.

To infer the source areas of the lake sediments, characteristic facies units (cover sediments and soils) from the catchment of the lake were studied concerning their clay-mineral compositions and through statistical analyses using the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm. Sediment contributions from the various geological provinces in the catchment of the lake are reflected in a systematic spatial pattern of variable clay-mineral assemblages, which is most pronounced in modern fluvial and lake sediments. Downcore changes in the clay-mineral fingerprints of lake sediments provide information on the spatio-temporal variability of detrital sediment supplies, related to climate-influenced changes in environmental boundary conditions. Since the late Glacial, water-level fluctuations driven by glacier melt appear to have exerted the greatest control over the transport paths of detrital sediments. Probably glacial melt-waters carried mainly illitic rich pre-Cenozoic debris into the lake from the northern and north-western catchment areas. During the Holocene the detrital clay mineral supply was mainly controlled from pre-Cenozoic and Neogene sources. However, because of the increased summer monsoon precipitation the lake level rose dramatically to at least modern levels, resulting in a relative increase in the supply from pedogenic karstic weathering sources mainly from the east, which during the Holocene was possibly flooded more widely than today. During the late Holocene a decreasing input of smectite suggests a relative reduction in the supply of far-traveled aquatic suspensions into the lake. In contrast, during the same interval kaolinite concentrations increased, which suggests a relatively strong sediment supply from the east, possibly triggered by a current flowing from east to west.

Carbonate platforms at low latitudes in the Western Tethys realm drowned or shifted to non-skeletal production during the early Toarcian due to sea level rise, global warming, and ocean acidification. Unlike deep-marine deposits, shallow-marine carbonates present a challenge in defining global geochemical signals due to common diagenetic modifications. An integrated dataset including delta C-13(carb) and delta O-18(carb), TOC, biomicrofacies, SEM, XRD, and palynological study of two stratigraphic successions in the Plitvice Lakes region, Bjelopolje (BJ) and Plitvice Spring (PS), in Croatia, provides an overview of the paleoenvironmental evolution and lateral facies changes in a peritidal setting during the Early Jurassic on the Adriatic Carbonate Platform (AdCP). The investigated stratigraphic succession starts with upper Pliensbachian, peloid-ooid-bioclastic grainstones alternating with fenestral and massive mudstones overlain by lower Toarcian, lagoonal, bioturbated, "spotted" limestones with horizons indicative of short-lived subaerial emergence during the early Toarcian. A negative excursion in delta C-13(carb), foraminifer assemblages, and the predominance of Classopollis pollen within the "spotted" limestones marks the stratigraphic position of the Jenkyns Event. Global-scale events (sea level variation, climate change, C-cycle perturbation, anoxia) operated simultaneously with local to regional synsedimentary tectonics and eustatic movements that preserved the AdCP carbonate factory from collapse or drowning but resulted in pronounced facies differentiation on the shallow-marine carbonate platforms.

Contrasting demographic responses to size-selective harvesting among neighbouring wild fish populations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Sustainable harvesting of wild populations relies on evidence-based knowledge to predict harvesting outcomes for species and the ecosystems they inhabit. Although harvesting may elicit compensatory density-dependence, it is generally size-selective, which induces additional pressures that are challenging to forecast. Furthermore, responses to harvest may be population-specific and whether generalizable patterns exist remains unclear. 2. Taking advantage of Parks Canada's mandate to remove introduced brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis to restore alpine lakes in Canadian parks, we experimentally applied standardized size-selective harvesting rates (the largest similar to 64% annually) for three consecutive summers in five populations with different initial size structures. Four unharvested populations were used as controls. 3. At reduced densities, harvested and control populations exhibited similar density-dependent increases in specific growth, juvenile survival and earlier maturation. However, size-selective harvesting simultaneously induced changes to size and age structure that contrasted among harvested populations. Average body length decreased in three of five harvested populations, whereas it tended to increase in control populations over the 3 years. We also detected contrasting, population-specific changes in body length variability and ultimately in length- and age-at-harvest in harvested populations but not controls. 4. Overall, populations with smaller, more homogeneous body sizes, and living at high densities were most resilient to size-selective harvesting, exhibiting the smallest change in size-at-age. In contrast, large-bodied populations exhibited more substantial size-structure changes following selective harvesting: large-bodied populations experienced either stabilizing or disruptive pressures, when initial length variability was high or low, respectively. 5. Synthesis and application. Our results show that within species, size-selective harvesting inherently leads to more risk and uncertainty when harvesting populations with larger and more varied body sizes than smaller-bodied populations with less range in body size. Our study supports prioritizing regulations that protect harvested populations with larger and more varied body sizes. Such a management strategy would reduce the likelihood of eliciting unpredictable or undesirable demographic changes to fish populations with these attributes.					; Matte, Jean-Michel/AAL-7082-2021; Fraser, Dylan/X-1659-2019	Matte, Jean-Michel/0000-0003-4588-8683; 													0021-8901	1365-2664				JUL	2023	60	7					1302	1313		10.1111/1365-2664.14420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14420		APR 2023											WOS:000976766800001

Although subsequent physical verification is desirable, oral histories may provide the initial evidence of past events. This methodology is most likely to be effective when researchers have some knowledge of the social structure and ethical code of the community. We have obtained information on Late Holocene landslide and flood activity, volcanism and jokulhlaup drainage in northwestern British Columbia, in stories related by both the Tahltan natives and non-native settlers, some of whose ancestors have resided in the area for over 100 years. Landslide activity has occurred sporadically and most often has been associated with spring runoff during high snowpack years. A landslide along the Tuya River blocked the migratory route of salmon to Tuya Lake, altering settlement patterns. A landslide along the Tahltan River (c. 20 years ago) altered river hydraulics and overran a traditional gathering place. The potential exists for future landslide activity and possible blockage of the river at this site, the most important migratory route for sockeye salmon in the Stikine River drainage. A flood caused by the failure of a rock-avalanche-created dam once reversed the flow direction of the Stikine River. Both legends and resident histories indicate that volcanic activity on Mount Edziza may have occurred within the last millennium, indicating that the eruptive history of Mount Edziza should be re-evaluated, especially in light of proposed economic development of the region. Recollections of jokulhlaup drainage on the lower Stikine River further document a major event that is not well understood or documented.																					0-471-96213-9				1996		4					9	28																WOS:A1996BG91N00002
J	Xue, WP; Jin, HL; Shang, W; Zhang, J				Xue, Wenping; Jin, Heling; Shang, Wen; Zhang, Jing			Spatiotemporal Patterns of Hongshan Culture Settlements in Relation to Middle Holocene Climatic Fluctuation in the Horqin Dune Field, Northeast China	ATMOSPHERE												Given the increasing challenges posed by frequent extreme climatic events, understanding the climate-human connection between the climate system and the transitions of ancient civilizations is crucial for addressing future climatic challenges, especially when examining the relationship between the abrupt events of the Holocene and the Neolithic culture development. Compared with the globally recognized "4.2 ka collapse" of ancient cultures, the initial start time and the cultural significance of the 5.5 ka climatic fluctuation are more complex and ambiguous. The Hongshan culture (6.5-5.0 ka) is characterized by a complicated society evident in its grand public architecture and elaborate high-status tombs. However, the driving mechanisms behind cultural changes remain complex and subject to ongoing debate. This paper delves into the role of climatic change in Hongshan cultural shifts, presenting an integrated dataset that combines climatic proxy records with archaeological data from the Hongshan culture period. Based on synthesized aeolian, fluvial-lacustrine, loess, and stalagmite deposits, the study indicates a relatively cold and dry climatic fluctuation occurred during similar to 6.0-5.5 ka, which is widespread in the Horqin dune field and adjacent areas. Combining spatial analysis with ArcGis 10.8 on archaeological sites, we propose that the climatic fluctuation between similar to 6.0-5.5 ka likely triggered the migration of the Hongshan settlements and adjustment of survival strategies.																				2073-4433				JUL 16	2025	16	7							865	10.3390/atmos16070865	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16070865													WOS:001544221400001

These events are an emerging yet understudied hazard in Iceland, including at Fjallsj & ouml;kull, an outlet glacier of the Vatnaj & ouml;kull ice cap in southeast Iceland. The proglacial Fjalls & aacute;rl & oacute;n lake significantly expanded from 1945 to 2021, enabling measurements of lake depth and volume changes with a multibeam sonar scanner. This lake bathymetry, coupled with radio-echo sounding surveys of subglacial topography, makes it possible to estimate future lake development. If recent glacier terminus retreat rates continue, Fjalls & aacute;rl & oacute;n is estimated to reach its maximum extent within the next 1 to 2 centuries, more than doubling in surface area and tripling in volume. The lake will occupy two overdeepened basins with a maximum depth of similar to 210 m, which will likely increase terminus melting and calving rates - and thus glacier retreat - as well as potentially float the glacier tongue. Three zones on the valley walls above Fjallsj & ouml;kull have high topographic potential of sourcing rock falls or avalanches that could enter Fjalls & aacute;rl & oacute;n and generate displacement waves that could exit the lake as GLOFs, impacting visitors and infrastructure at this popular tourism site. This study offers an assessment of mass-movement-triggered GLOF hazard at Fjalls & aacute;rl & oacute;n - the first time this emerging risk has been investigated in Iceland. Results provide high-resolution multibeam sonar measurements of lake bathymetry that can inform additional studies on glacier-lake interactions, GLOF risk mitigation strategies, and selection of priority sites for monitoring and additional mapping at Fjalls & aacute;rl & oacute;n, with potential application to other proglacial regions worldwide.																			1561-8633	1684-9981				JUN 11	2025	25	6					1913	1936		10.5194/nhess-25-1913-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-25-1913-2025													WOS:001508090100001

Lacustrine sediment sequences are considered to be important natural archives that register past climate and environmental signals. Here, we present new multi-proxy data obtained from a palaeolake succession preserved in the inner-alpine terrace of Unterangerberg, Eastern Alps. These sediments formed during the second Early Wurmian Interstadial, equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a, and were used to reconstruct changes in lake conditions and to infer past air temperatures. The sediment geochemical data and subfossil aquatic biota provide evidence of a cyclic lake-fen-lake development during this interstadial. The proxy records reveal stable lacustrine conditions with dense charophyte meadows and abundant aquatic fauna during the early part of the interstadial, a progressive shallowing of the lake resulting in the spreading out of fen vegetation in the middle part, and a transition from wetland to a renewed shallow lake stage towards the end of the interstadial. Chironomids were used to reconstruct mean July air temperatures, employing a combined Norwegian-Swiss chironomid temperature inference model. The reconstruction indicates a temperature close to present-day values of ca. 18 degrees C in the middle part of the record, while temperatures of ca. 13-14 degrees C are recorded for the lower and upper parts. The proxy data from this palaeolake provide evidence of heat and drought in the middle part of MIS 5a, supported by the chironomid-based temperature reconstruction. Our reconstruction shows a climate pattern broadly similar to that found in pollen-based estimates of mean July air temperatures from sites in the northern Alpine foreland and compares well to other European palaeoclimatic reconstructions of MIS 5a climate.

Nutrient enrichments of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited ratios of N:P > 17:1, by atoms, to maintain P limitation. An unmanipulated reference lake, Paul Lake, revealed baseline variability but showed no trends that could confound the interpretation of changes in the nearby manipulated lakes. Herbivorous zooplankton of West Long Lake (piscivorous fishes) were large-bodied Daphnia spp., in contrast to the small-bodied grazers that predominated in Peter Lake (planktivorous fishes). At comparable levels of nutrient enrichment, Peter Lake's areal chlorophyll and areal primary production rates exceeded those of West Long Lake by factors of approximately three and six, respectively. Grazers suppressed pelagic primary producers in West Long Lake, relative to Peter Lake, even when nutrient input rates were so high that soluble reactive phosphorus accumulated in the epilimnions of both lakes during summer. Peter Lake also had higher bacterial production (but not biomass) than West Long Lake. Hydrologic changes that accompanied manipulation of East Long Lake caused concentrations of colored dissolved organic carbon to increase, leading to considerable variability in fish and zooplankton populations. Both trophic cascades and water color appeared to inhibit the response of primary producers to nutrients in East Long Lake. Carbon dioxide was discharged to the atmosphere by Paul Lake in all years and by the other lakes prior to nutrient addition. During nutrient addition, only Peter Lake consistently absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere, due to high rates of carbon fixation by primary producers. In contrast, CO2 concentrations of West Long Lake shifted to near-atmospheric levels, and net fluxes were near zero, while East Long Lake continued to discharge CO2 to the atmosphere.

This study determines the antimicrobial resistance rates of cloacal enterococci and Escherichia coli in DPs. Methods: Fifty-two blood and cloacal swab samples were collected from 31 nestlings (20 DP/11 great white pelicans) hatched after the H5N1 outbreak at the Prespa colony and 21 subadult/adult DPs captured at a spring migration stopover. The swabs were inoculated in non-selective and chromogenic-selective media. Identification was performed using MALDI-TOF, and antimicrobial susceptibility was tested. The genetic content was characterized using PCR and sequencing, and the clonality of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli isolates was characterized using Multilocus Sequence Typing. Results: Twenty-eight non-repetitive E. coli and 45 enterococci isolates were recovered in non-selective media; most of them were susceptible to all antibiotics tested (85.7% E. coli/91.1% enterococci). Three of the fifty-two samples (6%, all adults) contained ESBL-E. coli isolates (detected in chromogenic ESBL plates), all carrying the blaCTX-M-15 gene and belonging to the lineage ST69. Conclusions: Despite the susceptibility of most fecal E. coli and enterococci isolates to all antibiotics tested, the finding that E. coli of lineage ST69 carry blaCTX-M-15 is of concern. This high-risk clone needs further investigation to elucidate its primary sources and address the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance from an integrated "One Health" perspective. Furthermore, it is imperative to study the potential impacts of ESBL-E. coli on the endangered DP further.

Survival under the Gravel: the Effects of Egg Size and Parental Identity on the In Situ Hatching Success of Chinook Salmon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Early-life mortality in salmon is influenced by both extrinsic (i.e., environmental) and intrinsic (i.e., parental) factors; however, the intrinsic factors have rarely been studied in the wild and relatively little is known about how egg mass and parental effects mediate in situ survival. Thus, we addressed four research objectives related to intrinsic factors and the early-life survival of Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha: (1) assess the effect of egg mass and parental effects on in situ hatching success, (2) assess the effect of redd gravel composition and its interaction with egg mass on in situ hatching success, (3) determine whether in situ egg mass-survival relationships have population-level consequences, and (4) determine whether results from hatchery studies translate to the wild. Embryos from three Chinook Salmon populations located in the Laurentian Great Lakes were reared from fertilization to 15 d posthatch, both in the hatchery and in the wild. We found that egg mass influenced in situ hatching success in the Credit (concave down) and Sydenham rivers (positive-linear), whereas there was no relationship between the two variables in the Pine River. Maternal identity explained a significant amount of the variation in hatching success for the Pine (20%) and Sydenham (12%) rivers. Within populations, no interaction was found between egg mass and gravel composition; however, hatching success was negatively related to the sand content of a redd when the data were pooled among the populations. Importantly, egg mass and quantitative genetic parameter estimates were different between samples from the hatchery and those from the wild, indicating that hatchery-based observations cannot be transferred to the wild. Finally, we used both the in situ survival data and previously published data in a simulation analysis, which showed that both linear and nonlinear egg mass-survival relationships can greatly influence the number of alevins produced by a population, depending on where the population egg mass distribution falls along an egg mass selection gradient.					; Morbey, Yolanda/F-9035-2013	Morbey, Yolanda/0000-0003-1719-7842; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2019	148	5					991	1003		10.1002/tafs.10192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10192		AUG 2019											WOS:000485791800001

Isolation and characterization of saprophytic and pathogenic strains of Leptospira from water sources in the Midwestern United States	FRONTIERS IN WATER												The genus Leptospira is a diverse and unique group of bacteria comprising multiple saprophytic and pathogenic species, which survive and persist in suitable moist environments. Pathogenic species cause human and animal leptospirosis, a global and neglected zoonotic disease. Disease transmission occurs by exposure to contaminated water and moist soil environments or by contact with domestic animals and wildlife acting as reservoir hosts that shed Leptospira via urine. Here, we describe the unexpected diversity of saprophytic and pathogenic species of Leptospira isolated from water in the Midwestern United States. Samples were collected by volunteers in 11 counties in Iowa from water sources, including puddles, sewage, creeks, ponds, lakes, and rivers, during the summer of 2021. One hundred and five water samples were tested by culture for the presence of saprophytic and pathogenic species and by lipL32 qPCR specific for the detection of pathogens; 82 (78.1%) were culture positive and five (4.8%) were positive by lipL32 qPCR. Whole genome sequencing of isolates cultured from water samples identified 10 species of saprophytes, namely L. montravelensis, L. kemamanensis, L. bandrabouensis, L. bourretii, L. bouyouniensis, L. chreensis, L. ellinghausenii, L. terpstrae, L. yanagawae, and L. abararensis, as well as three novel saprophytic species. Whole genome sequencing also identified two novel pathogenic species. The remaining cultures comprised mixed populations of saprophytic species and six comprised a mixture of saprophytic and pathogenic species. One of these mixed cultures was enriched to select for a clonal isolate of pathogenic Leptospira, strain WS101.C1, which was classified as L. interrogans serogroup Djasiman serovar Djasiman. Cumulatively, 9.5% (10/105) of water samples were positive for pathogenic Leptospira. This study emphasizes the diversity of Leptospira present in water sources in the Midwestern United States and provides unique opportunities to explore the geographic diversity and evolution of this genus. The identification of known and novel pathogenic species circulating in local water sources highlights their potential usefulness as diagnostic antigens, as well as the role of water in the transmission of infection to human and animal populations. Integrating knowledge on human, animal, and environmental health is essential to control and predict risk for zoonoses.

Increase in lake trout reproduction in Lake Huron following the collapse of alewife: Relief from thiamine deficiency or larval predation?	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												In the Great Lakes there is still uncertainty as to the population level effects of a thiamine deficiency on salmonines caused by high consumption of alewives Alosa pseudoharengus. A resurgence of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush reproduction in Lake Huron following the crash of alewife stocks between 2002 and 2004 provided an opportunity to evaluate the relative effects of this crash on reproduction through relief from either alewife mediated thiamine deficiency or alewife predation on larval lake trout relative to possible changes in the size of the lake trout spawning stock. Changes in mean lake trout egg thiamine concentration post crash at one spawning reef in Parry Sound, where mean thiamine concentration increased by almost two-fold, were consistent with diet switching from alewives to rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, the next most abundant prey fish in Lake Huron. Although thiamine levels for lake trout collected at a second reef in Parry Sound did not change post-crash, levels both pre- and post-crash were consistent with a rainbow smelt diet. A reef specific fry emergence index was found to be positively related to reef specific egg thiamine concentration but negatively related to reef specific occurrence of EMS, a thiamine deficiency related mortality syndrome. We found little evidence for overlap between the timing of spring shoreward migration of alewives and lake trout emergence, suggesting that relief from alewife predation effects had relatively little effect on the observed increase in lake trout recruitment. Numbers of spawners in the north, north-central, and southern zones of the lake increased from 2000 onwards. Overall the abundance post-2003 was higher than from pre-2004, suggesting that spawner abundance may also have contributed to increased lake trout reproduction. However, predicted numbers of spawners and measured abundance of wild recruits in assessment gear were poorly correlated suggesting that the increase in reproduction was not totally spawner dependent and hence relief from thiamine deficiency was also likely involved. We conclude from this that eliminating the effects of an alewife diet mediated thiamine deficiency can have positive effects on lake trout reproduction but more research is required to understand the effect of spawner number and the role of spawning habitat availability.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2010	13	1					73	84		10.1080/14634980903581252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980903581252													WOS:000275518000011
J	Rivers, AR; Lynch, AH				Rivers, AR; Lynch, AH			On the influence of land cover on early Holocene climate in northern latitudes - art. no. D21114	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] This study presents a factorial experimental strategy for assessing the effects of the changing land surface on early Holocene (similar to 11 ka) climate in Beringia. The strategy uses a coupled land-atmosphere single column model in a series of perturbation experiments that vary the vegetation type, lake cover, and soil specification simultaneously. Two sites and eight years of model forcing are chosen to determine the importance of differing terrestrial histories, local climate, and interannual variability. Eastern Beringia is represented by Fairbanks, Alaska, and western Beringia is represented by Elikchan Lake, Siberia. Evaluations of model response are performed using metrics important for vegetation growth, such as growing degree days and moisture availability. For both sites, large-scale interannual variability has a greater impact on the local climate than changes in the land surface specification for temperature-based responses, but not for moisture availability. Of the three land surface parameters tested, vegetation type is most influential. Vegetation transitions from tundra to boreal forest leads to increased precipitation, winter snow depth, and low cloud, leading to a delayed snowmelt in forested regions. This is in contrast to expectations based on albedo arguments alone. In western Beringia, a positive feedback is suggested in warming due to the presence of boreal forest, consistent with some observations that Siberian deciduous forest persisted longer than Alaskan deciduous forest in the context of large-scale cooling of the climate. The reverse was found to be true in eastern Beringia, where deciduous forests exhibited a cooling effect due to increases in albedo. The response to soil variations was relatively small, but the inclusion of inland lakes tends in general to cool the surface, although in some years a warming is evident due to the surface energy balance shifting in favor of downwelling longwave heating over evaporative cooling.

J	Spencer, CN; Gabel, KO; Hauer, FR				Spencer, CN; Gabel, KO; Hauer, FR			Wildfire effects on stream food webs and nutrient dynamics in Glacier National Park, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT					International Symposium on Effects of Wildland Fire on Aquatic Ecosystems on the Western USA	APR 22-24, 2002	BOISE, IDAHO					We documented immediate and mid-term (5 years) impacts on streams from a large (15,500 ha) wildfire in northwestern Montana. Fire-related impacts were ecosystem-wide, extending from water chemistry to fish. During the initial firestorm, phosphorus and nitrogen levels increased 5- to 60-fold above background levels resulting from aerial deposition from smoke and ash. Nutrients returned to background concentrations within several weeks after the fire. During subsequent years, nutrient concentrations periodically increased in fire-impacted sites compared to reference sites, especially during spring run-off. Evidence of post-fire changes was also documented in the aquatic food web via stable isotope analyses. Macroinvertebrates and fish from fire-impacted sites were significantly more enriched in N-15 and depleted in C-13 than consumers from forested reference sites (P < 0.001). The post-fire isotopic shift in consumers was consistent with increased utilization of algae and/or other autochthonous food sources together with decreased reliance on terrestrial leaf litter and other allochthonous food sources. Such a post-fire shift from a detritus based on a periphyton-based food web fits predictions of the river continuum concept following canopy removal and nutrient enrichment. Following decades of active fire suppression, forest managers are now contemplating aggressive efforts to reduce the fuel build-up noted in forests throughout the western US. Such efforts could involve increased use of fire and mechanical thinning and harvest. Results from our work and others suggest that expanded fire activity could mobilize substantial quantities of highly available nutrients to lakes and streams. With significant nutrient delivery mechanisms involving water, as well as airborne transport via smoke and ash, the potential for increased nutrient loadings to surface waters could extend well beyond the catchment of any particular fire. As natural resource managers contemplate expanding the use of fire as a forest restoration tool, they face the dilemma that such efforts could run counter to a decades-long effort to reduce nutrient loadings to lakes and other surface waters threatened by eutrophication.

The effect of mayfly (Hexagenia spp.) burrowing activity on sediment oxygen demand in western Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Previous studies support the hypothesis that large numbers of infaunal burrow-irrigating organisms in the western basin of Lake Erie may increase significantly the sediment oxygen demand, thus enhancing the rate of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. We conducted laboratory experiments to quantify burrow oxygen dynamics and increased oxygen demand resulting from burrow irrigation using two different year classes of Hexagenia spp. nymphs from western Lake Erie during summer, 2006. Using oxygen microelectrodes and hot film anemometry, we simultaneously determined oxygen concentrations and burrow water flow velocities. Burrow oxygen depletion rates ranged from 21.7 mg/nymph/mo for 15 mm nymphs at 23 degrees C to 240.7 mg/nymph/mo for 23 mm nymphs at 13 degrees C. Sealed microcosm experiments demonstrated that mayflies increase the rate of oxygen depletion by 2-5 times that of controls, depending on size of nymph and water temperature, with colder waters having greater impact. At natural population densities, nymph pumping activity increased total sediment oxygen demand 0.3-2.5 times compared to sediments with no mayflies and accounted for 22-71% of the total sediment oxygen demand. Extrapolating laboratory results to the natural system suggest that Hexagenia spp. populations may exert a significant control on oxygen depletion during intermittent stratification. This finding may help explain some of the fluctuations in Hexagenia spp. population densities in western Lake Erie and suggests that mayflies, by causing their own population collapse irrespective of other environmental conditions, may need longer term averages when used as a bio-indicator of the success of pollution-abatement programs in western Lake Erie and possibly throughout the Great Lakes.

J	Shang, ZW; Li, JF; Wang, F; Wang, H				Shang, Zhiwen; Li, Jianfen; Wang, Fu; Wang, Hong			The Middle and Late Holocene climate change in Bohai Bay revealed by diatom proxy	JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												A total of 98 samples from two boreholes in shallow sea area and two oyster reefs in adjacent coastal plain in the northwestern coast of Bohai Bay were collected for diatom analyses and species identification. The ratio of the marine species Thalassionema nitzschioides to the intertidal-coastal species complex Cyclotella striata/stylorum serves as a novel proxy for assessing the strength of marine influence. Chronological data, corrected for the local residence time effect, facilitated the construction of a diatom proxy-based marine influence curve for the study area. This curve delineates the dynamics of marine influence and their correlations with paleo-climate fluctuations and the East Asian monsoon variability, as well as their role in chenier formation. Results include: (1) eight periods of intensified marine influence have been documented since 7 000 a BP in the study area. The peak of each period, as determined by the diatom proxy, corresponds closely to the warm climatic phases and stronger East Asian summer monsoons, suggesting that the peaks marine influence indicate typically the periods of climatic warmth and monsoon activity intensification in the region; (2) a strong correlation exists between the development of cheniers and marine influence, and chenier formation began with the increasing marine influence and terminated at the end of warm periods as marine influence weakens. The climatic changes in the coastal area, as indicated by the diatom proxy, hold significant potential for future related research endeavors.																			2096-5508	2523-3521				SEP	2024	42	5					1493	1506		10.1007/s00343-024-3187-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-024-3187-9		JUL 2024											WOS:001274339800005

The colonial morphology and toxin production ability of Microcystis are important for their population maintenance and life history. However, it is unclear about the influence of the colony morphology and toxic potential of Microcystis colonies on their benthic process. To address this question, we classified field Microcystis samples into three groups based on their size (< 150 mu m, 150-300 mu m, and > 300 mu m) and compared their survivability and toxic potential during culturing in sediment. The results showed that Microcystis colonies in sediments disappeared quickly at 25degree celsius but survived for long periods at 5degree celsius. The survivability of smaller Microcystis colonies (< 300 mu m) was significantly higher than that of larger ones (> 300 mu m). The activities of catalase (CAT) were significantly increased in large colonies compared to small colonies at 15degree celsius and 25degree celsius. Real-time PCR indicated that smaller colonies had higher proportion of potential toxic genotype, and Microcystis colonies cultured at 15degree celsius and 25degree celsius showed higher percentage of microcystin-producing genotype. These results indicate that Microcystis colonies survived longer at low temperature and that larger Microcystis colonies are more susceptible to oxidative stress in sediments. The difference of toxic potential of Microcystis colonies of different sizes in sediments may be related to their survival ability in sediments.

Holocene glacier fluctuations	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A global overview of glacier advances and retreats (grouped by regions and by millennia) for the Holocene is compiled from previous studies. The reconstructions of glacier fluctuations are based on 1) mapping and dating moraines defined by C-14, TCN, OSL, lichenometry and tree rings (discontinuous records/time series), and 2) sediments from proglacial lakes and speleothems (continuous records/time series). Using 189 continuous and discontinuous time series, the long-term trends and centennial fluctuations of glaciers were compared to trends in the recession of Northern and mountain tree lines, and with orbital, solar and volcanic studies to examine the likely forcing factors that drove the changes recorded. A general trend of increasing glacier size from the early-mid Holocene, to the late Holocene in the extra-tropical areas of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is related to overall summer temperature, forced by orbitally-controlled insolation. The glaciers in New Zealand and in the tropical Andes also appear to follow the orbital trend, i.e., they were decreasing from the early Holocene to the present. In contrast, glacier fluctuations in some monsoonal areas of Asia and southern South America generally did not follow the orbital trends, but fluctuated at a higher frequency possibly triggered by distinct teleconnections patterns. During the Neoglacial, advances clustered at 4.4-4.2 ka, 3.8-3.4 ka, 3.3-2.8 ka, 2.6 ka, 2.3-2.1 ka, 1.5-1.4 ka, 12-1.0 ka, 0.7-0.5 ka, corresponding to general cooling periods in the North Atlantic. Some of these episodes coincide with multidecadal periods of low solar activity, but it is unclear what mechanism might link small changes in irradiance to widespread glacier fluctuations. Explosive volcanism may have played a role in some periods of glacier advances, such as around 1.7-1.6 ka (coinciding with the Taupo volcanic eruption at 232 +/- 5 CE) but the record of explosive volcanism is poorly known through the Holocene. The compilation of ages suggests that there is no single mechanism driving glacier fluctuations on a global scale. Multidecadal variations of solar and volcanic activity supported by positive feedbacks in the climate system may have played a critical role in Holocene glaciation, but further research on such linkages is needed. The rate and the global character of glacier retreat in the 20th through early 21st centuries appears unusual in the context of Holocene glaciation, though the retreating glaciers in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere are still larger today than they were in the early and/or mid-Holocene. The current retreat, however, is occurring during an interval of orbital forcing that is favorable for glacier growth and is therefore caused by a combination of factors other than orbital forcing, primarily strong anthropogenic effects. Glacier retreat will continue into future decades due to the delayed response of glaciers. to climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

On land record of the Oligocene-Miocene transition. Climatic insights from a multiproxy study on a lacustrine system in the Ebro Basin (NE Iberia, SW Europe)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Oligocene-Miocene Transition is associated with climatic changes primarily related to Antarctic phenomena (Mi-1 glacial event), the effects of which are not well known on land. This work examines a continuous, well dated distal-alluvial and carbonate lacustrine and palustrine succession (23.56 to 22.1 Ma) in the Ebro Basin, through sedimentological analysis and carbonate 513C and 518O composition, to unveil climate-related variations and compare them with those in other terrestrial and marine Mi-1 records. Results indicate carbonate deposition in freshwater bodies having moderate-to-high plant-derived CO2 supply and being affected by lake-level variations and evaporative processes (causing Mg carbonates precipitation in the Oligocene alluvial and saline mud flats), within a closed-lake environment. A significant decline in temperature and humidity centered around 23.16-23.14 Ma seems to correlate with Mi-1, but with earlier onset and earlier minimum temperature and humidity (minima ca 80-90 ka before) in the lake system. Low temperature and humidity are followed by oscillating but overall increasing humidity, varying Precipitation/Evaporation and slight warming until 23.1 Ma, coinciding with the development of mainly lacustrine and palustrine environments from ca 23.15 Ma onwards. Two falls in 518O that concur with opposed 513C trends, representing dissimilar climatic conditions, appear to match different long-term orbital configurations. The earlier response of the Ebro Basin-lake system to global changes, e.g. the Mi-1 event, is consistent with results from other continental records, and implies the sensitivity of lake systems to record initial stages of ongoing global changes, and the more lagging responses of marine systems to continental 12CO2-input variations.

The hybrid sedimentary rocks samples from the Neogene upper Ganchaigou Formation to lower Youshashan Formation (N1-N21) in the Fengxi area Qaidam Basin, were investigated through core-log and petrology-geochemistry cross-analysis by using the core, casting thin section, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, logging, and carbon/oxygen isotopic data. The hybrid sedimentary rocks in the Fengxi area, including terrigenous clastic rock and lacustrine carbonate rock, were deposited in a shallow lake environment far from the source, or occasionally in a semi-deep lake environment, with 5 lithofacies types and 6 microfacies types recognized. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions reveal that the formation of sedimentary cycles is controlled by a climate-driven compensation-undercompensation cyclic mechanism. A sedimentary cycle model of hybrid sedimentary rocks in an arid and saline setting is proposed. According to this model, in the compensation period, the lake level rises sharply, and microfacies such as mud flat, sand-mud flat and beach are developed, with physical subsidence as the dominant sedimentary mechanism; in the undercompensation period, the lake level falls slowly, and microfacies such as lime-mud flat, lime-dolomite flat and algal mound/mat are developed, with chemical-biological process as the dominant sedimentary mechanism. In the saline lacustrine sedimentary system, lacustrine carbonate rock is mainly formed along with regression, the facies change is not interpreted by the accommodation believed traditionally, but controlled by the temporary fluctuation of lake water chemistry caused by climate change. The research results update the interpreted high-resolution sequence model and genesis of hybrid sedimentary rocks in the saline lacustrine basin and provide a valuable guidance for exploring unconventional hydrocarbons of saline lacustrine facies.

Physiological condition infers habitat choice in juvenile sockeye salmon	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												The amount of time that juvenile salmon remain in an estuary varies among and within populations, with some individuals passing through their estuary in hours while others remain in the estuary for several months. Underlying differences in individual physiological condition, such as body size, stored energy and osmoregulatory function, could drive individual variation in the selection of estuary habitat. Here we investigated the role of variation in physiological condition on the selection of estuarine and ocean habitat by sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolts intercepted at the initiation of their 650-km downstream migration from Chilko Lake, Fraser River, British Columbia (BC). Behavioural salinity preference experiments were conducted on unfed smolts held in fresh water at three time intervals during their downstream migration period, representing the stage of migration at lake-exit, and the expected timing for estuary-entry and ocean-entry (0, 1 and 3 weeks after lake-exit, respectively). In general, salinity preference behaviour varied across the three time periods consistent with expected transition from river to estuary to ocean. Further, individual physiological condition did influence habitat choice. Smolt condition factor (K) and energy density were positively correlated with salinity preference behaviour in the estuary and ocean outmigration stages, but not at lake-exit. Our results suggest that smolt physiological condition upon reaching the estuary could influence migratory behaviour and habitat selection. This provides evidence on the temporally dependent interplay of physiology, behaviour and migration in wild juvenile Pacific salmon, with juvenile rearing conditions influencing smolt energetic status, which in turn influences habitat choice during downstream migration. The implication for the conservation of migratory species is that the relative importance of stopover habitats may vary as a function of initial condition.

Age-depth models for the cores were established by Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating. Tephra deposits in Laguna Gemelas Este were dated to AD 1986-1998, 1943-1968, 1927-1955, and 1849-1892, and the tephra deposits in Laguna Verde were dated to AD 1940-1970, 1888-1934, 1871-1920, and 1536-1669, the latter interval determined by extrapolation. All tephras had similar geochemical composition and originated from volcanoes in the northern Austral Volcanic Zone. Tephra units were attributed to known historical eruptions and all but one, most likely, were from Lautaro Volcano (49 degrees 01 ' S; 73 degrees 33 ' W). The age of the youngest tephra (AD 1986-1998) from Laguna Gemelas Este points to Viedma Volcano (49 degrees 22 ' S; 73 degrees 19 ' W) as a possible source. Volcanic eruptions had a larger impact on Laguna Verde than on Laguna Gemelas Este, as expressed by changes in delta N-15 values and diatom communities during tephra deposition. These shifts are explained by perturbations of the nitrogen cycle in the lake, associated with shifts in lacustrine primary production. Primary producers may have been affected by increased water turbidity caused by the ash fall, and consequently, used less nitrogen. Diatom assemblages in Laguna Verde showed marked reductions in numbers of planktonic/tychoplanktonic taxa, in favour of epiphytic/benthic diatom taxa, when tephra was deposited. This contrasts with Laguna Gemelas Este, in which epiphytic/benthic diatom species were generally more abundant and decreases in abundances of planktonic/tychoplanktonic taxa were not as strongly linked to tephra layers as in Laguna Verde. At Laguna Gemelas Este, flatter relief, greater fetch and/or drier climate may have contributed to generally less ecosystem variability, resulting in seemingly less environmental response to volcanic eruptions than in Laguna Verde.					; Garcia, Maria Lujan/ABE-3783-2021; Zolitschka, Bernd/P-1487-2019	Lucke, Andreas/0000-0003-4199-0808; Meier, Wolfgang Jens-Henrik/0000-0002-3167-7570; Garcia, Maria Lujan/0000-0002-2658-2753; Mayr, Christoph/0000-0001-9002-9963; Smith, Rebecca/0000-0001-8614-5291													0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2019	62	2					205	221		10.1007/s10933-019-00088-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-019-00088-y													WOS:000474473800007

The study sites are mostly small, shallow, bathymetrically simple, oligotrophic lakes, with a pH range from 5.0 to 7.8, a total organic carbon range from 2.5 to 12.6 mg l(-1), a mean July lakewater temperature ranging from 6.1 to 15.4 degrees C, and a mean July air temperature ranging from 8.5 to 14.9 degrees C. A series of redundancy analyses (RDA) identified sediment organic content, maximum lake depth, and lakewater temperature as being the most important explanatory Variables. Variance partitioning by partial RDAs further suggested that each of these Variables accounted for a significant fraction of variance independent from each other. Different call models were assessed on the basis of their statistical performance, with particular reference to prediction errors and the amount of bias along the temperature gradient. Of the eight calibration models, modem analogue techniques, weighted averaging partial least squares, simple weighted averaging with an 'inverse' deshrinking regression, and linear partial least squares consistently performed best. These methods can all be used to develop transfer functions for surface-water and air July temperatures with a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of about 1.5-1.6 degrees C (water temperature) and 0.8-1.1 degrees C (air temperature), as assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation. The resulting models do, however, have relatively high maximum biases (up to 3.9 degrees C) in the lowest segments of the air and water temperature gradients, highlighting the need for enlarging and expanding the calibration data set to include lower temperatures.

The reflectors representing these erosional surfaces, and their conformable equivalents in the deep lake basins, are caused by intervals of coarser grain size in the sediments and are thought to represent lowering of lake levels prior to, and following, the Main Algonquin highstand (about 10.2-11.0 ka). These reflectors are used to define seismic sequences in the postglacial sedimentary fill of the basins. Two additional erosional surfaces, which closely follow the initial fall of the Main Algonquin lake level, are most clearly seen in thicker sections found in the northern part of the basins. The two oldest (pre-Main Algonquin) sequences appear to onlap highs and fill in lows within the basins, whereas the younger sequences (associated with the Main Algonquin through Mattawa times) tend to drape the topography and show Little difference in thickness between the lows and their adjacent highs. The most recent sedimentary sequence represents deposition occurring since about 7.5 ka. It laps out against topographic highs and leaves older sequences exposed at the lake floor in many areas. The most pronounced erosional surfaces are associated with the Light Green and the Light Blue sequence boundaries. The Light Green sequence has a pair of coarser layers at its top, which are dated at 9.6-9.8 ka and 9.05-9.2 ka. The coarser interval at the top of the Light Blue sequence is dated at 7.45-7.80 ka. These layers are thought to mark maximum lake level lowstands and to represent the times of Ottawa-Marquette to latest Mattawa lake level fluctuation.					; Moore, Theodore/N-8848-2014	Mayer, Larry/0000-0003-1846-5140; 													0008-4077	1480-3313				NOV	1994	31	11					1606	1617		10.1139/e94-142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e94-142													WOS:A1994PY65900003

Contaminants in water, sediment and fish biomonitor species from natural and artificial estuarine habitats along the urbanized Gold Coast, Queensland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												Metal and pesticide contaminants were measured in water, sediment and fish species in various Gold Coast waterways, Queensland. With the exception of Cu, metal concentrations in water, measured using the diffuse gradients in a thin film (DGT) technique, complied with relevant Australian guidelines. Cu concentrations in these waterways have been related to recreational vessel activities previously. All sediment metal concentrations measured were below the national guidelines, although Cu, Zn and Pb were found to vary significantly between habitat types. Evidence of spikes in sediment pesticide concentrations (some banned over 50 years ago) was observed in some artificial residential waterways. Heavy metals and pesticides were measured in the tissue (muscle, gills and liver) of three economically important species of fish, with different feeding strategies (partly herbivore Arrhamphus sclerolepis, carnivore Acanthopagrus australis, detritivore Mugil cephalus). We tested the hypothesis that fish accumulate different amounts of contaminants from wetland habitats affected by different intensities of anthropogenic activities (i.e., marinas, artificial residential canals, artificial residential lakes, estuaries and natural, vegetated waterways). Significantly higher concentrations of Cu were found in the gills of each fish species from marinas compared to fish caught in other waterways. Furthermore, fish caught in canals had the second highest Cu and natural waterways the lowest. These results support the stated hypothesis for Cu and furthermore indicate that these fish species are suitable as biomonitors in estuarine waterways. Metal and pesticide concentrations in the edible muscle tissue of all fish complied with the Australian Food Standard Code recommended limits for human consumption, apart from As which is likely to be due to bioconcentration of lower toxicity organo-As species. These results indicate a low health risk for humans consuming fish, in terms of contaminant levels. The accumulated body of evidence on contaminants within Gold Coast waterways generally suggests that there are no major threats of metal or pesticide contamination, except for marina facilities which are a major source of Cu which also accumulates in fish. Water quality threats are also highlighted in residential canals, presumably as a consequence of their hydrological design.

The strains used contained a 2,4-D degradative plasmid, either pJP4 conferring fast-growing property to the host or p712 conferring slow-growing property, and were resistant to antibiotics such that the inoculated strains could be enumerated against the indigenous microbial populations. In sterile environmental samples, these strains were stably maintained at the levels used for inoculation, except in sterile paddy soil where Alcaligenes JMP228 strains died rapidly. In natural soil samples the four strains declined steadily with time, but in natural water samples their populations fell rapidly at the early phase and then remained almost constant. When the environmental samples were treated with 2,4-D, P. cepacia/pJP4 and P. cepacia/p712 maintained significant numbers, while Alcaligenes JMP228/pJP4 and Alcaligenes JMP228/p712 declined significantly in most of the samples. The results indicated that the survivability of genetically modified microorganisms could vary depending on the environments and that their abundance in the environments under 2,4-D selection was markedly influenced by the nature of the 2,4-D degradative plasmid as well as the type of the host strain.																			1225-8873					DEC	1996	34	4					320	326																WOS:A1996WA56700006

Polyurethane foam (PF) substrates were placed in five lentic systems in northern lower Michigan during summer 1983. These lentic habitats represented a range of trophic states and included three lakes, a bog, and a marsh. Triplicate PF substrates were sampled after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 42 days of exposure. During this study, 90 living protist samples were examined for the number and kinds of species. Water samples were analyzed for pH, conductivity, alkalinity, chloride, silica, temperature, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and total and ortho-phosphate concurrent with artificial substrate collections. A total of 546 protist species was recorded. Only seven species were found in over 50% of the samples and 121 species were found in only one sample. The 96 most common species were examined in relation to environmental parameters using several multivariate statistical procedures. Factor analysis (principal components with varimax rotation) performed on the total environmental data set showed that three composite factors explained 85% of the variability of the data set. A reciprocal averaging ordination (RAO) was used to reduce species presence/absence data and to separate samples graphically by their species composition. Significant correlations, with RAO-generated axes from all five systems, were found for pH, oxygen, and a nutrient factor to axis 1. Factor analysis on the physico-chemical parameters of the three lakes showed that three factors explained 71% of the environmental data set variability. The RAO-generated axis (axis 1) was correlated with silica, ortho-phosphate, and Factor 2, which was primarily comprised of loadings from ortho-phosphate. These techniques support the hypothesis that a limited number of environmental parameters strongly affect protist community composition.

J	Unrein, F; Izaguirre, I; Massana, R; Balagué, V; Gasol, JM				Unrein, F; Izaguirre, I; Massana, R; Balagué, V; Gasol, JM			Nanoplankton assemblages in maritime Antarctic lakes: characterisation and molecular fingerprinting comparison	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The composition of planktonic eukaryotes in the size fraction 3-20 mu m of 10 maritime Antarctic lakes was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Microscopic observations were also carried out to compare the results obtained by this molecular fingerprinting technique with morphological data. Six lakes from Hope Bay (Antarctic Peninsula) and 4 from the Potter Peninsula (King George Island) were sampled during the austral summer of 2003. These lakes were of different trophic status and covered a wide range of limnological features. Previous studies of the planktonic communities of these lakes revealed high nanoflagellate abundance and biomass, but their taxonomic identification was usually uncertain due to their similarity in size and shape. Here, the application of DGGE allowed both a comparison of the structure of the nanoplanktonic communities and an identification of the dominant populations through sequencing of the most prominent DGGE bands. The most important organisms in these lakes were the Chrysophyceae, represented in the DGGE gel by 5 different band positions and identified by microscopy in 5 different morphotypes, including uniflagellated and biflagellated naked organisms: 1 sequence belonged to the Chrysosphaerales, 2 closely related bands (likely 2 species from the same genus) belonged probably to the Ochromonadales (unicellular biflagellates), while the other 2 bands could not be assigned to any defined chrysophyte group. Sequences related to Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and probably Cercozoa were also retrieved. A Dictyochophyceae belonging to the order Pedinellales is reported for the first time in freshwater Antarctic ecosystems. Microscopic observations suggest that this phytoplanktonic organism most likely corresponds to Pseudopedinella. Most of the lakes shared several common sequences, such as 2 chrysophyte bands, which suggests the existence of well-adapted nanoplanktonic species dispersed throughout the Antarctic lakes. However, some sequences appeared exclusively in specific lakes, which seems to be related to the trophic status of the water bodies and probably also to the local conditions of the maritime Antarctic regions sampled.

The saturation indexes indicate that the lake waters are saturated with respect to tridymite, cristobalite, chalcedony and quartz, and slightly undersaturated with respect to amorphous silica. Common roughly laminated and poorly lithified stromatolites show scanning electron microscope (SEM) evidence for silicified microbial mat structures, including biofilms, filamentous and coccoid cells, and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The screening of bacterial 16S rRNA libraries indicates that autotrophic and heterotrophic bacterial communities colonize surface and core levels of the stromatolites. Locally the stromatolites show a granular non-porous fabric, where filaments and silica sheets are not apparent. Inhomogeneity in the stromatolite fabric corresponds with varying DNA content and different structures of the colonizing bacterial communities, non-porous stromatolite levels being microbially colonized to a lesser extent. Based on Fourier Transform (FT)-Raman and FT-infrared investigations, the laminated stromatolite contains early diagenetic tridymite in addition to amorphous silica (opal-A), whereas the non-porous stromatolite shows an essentially amorphous character. The laminated stromatolite is thought to form at relatively low rates of silica precipitation and with a possible microbial mediation in terms of microbial cells and their EPS accelerating the onset of amorphous silica nucleation. It is suggested that high porosity probably favoured a consistent flux of silica-rich fluids that triggered the opal-A to tridymite transformation, thus strengthening the preservation of biosignals. Non-porous stromatolite growth could reflect temporal or localised changes in environmental conditions that caused variations in the degree of silica saturation in the lake waters inducing abiotic silica accumulation. Accelerated opal-A deposition could have obscured primary filamentous fabrics and limited the flux of pore fluid needed for sustaining the process of silica maturation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Nutrients, seston, and transparency of Missouri reservoirs and oxbow lakes: An analysis of regional limnology	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A long-term (1978-2007) summer monitoring study of 167 Missouri reservoirs and floodplain lakes shows wide ranges in the trophic state variables total phosphorus (TP; 6-395 mu g/L for reservoir means), total nitrogen (TN; 200-3290 mu g/L), chlorophyll (Chl; 1-223 mu g/L) and Secchi depth (0.15-4.3 m). There are strong regional contrasts between eutrophic-hypereutrophic water bodies in the predominantly agricultural Osage Plains, Glaciated Plains and Big Rivers sections and the mostly oligotrophic-mesotrophic reservoirs in the largely forested Ozark Highlands. The ecotonal Ozark Border was intermediate. Missouri reservoirs had slightly less TN relative to TP than predicted by global models, but TN: TP (median = 18.4) is typical of North American lakes and was about five-fold lower in the most enriched reservoirs compared to the least enriched ones. Concentrations of seston, measured as total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), nonvolatile suspended solids (NVSS), filterable (small) suspended solids (fTSS) and the sum of all fractions (Sigma TSS), were strongly correlated with TP, TN, and Secchi depth. The proportion of mineral seston (NVSS, fTSS) increased with TSS and was the dominant fraction in most reservoirs, especially in the agricultural regions. Phytoplankton was dominated by small forms (<11 mu m), and Cyanophyta were the most common algae comprising a median 46% of phytoplankton biovolume. Chlorophyll-nutrient regressions showed a dominant effect of TP (r(2) = 0.83 for reservoir means) with a lesser, negative effect of mineral seston (NAS or fTSS, partial r(2) similar to 0.05). Secchi depth was more strongly controlled by mineral seston than by phytoplankton such that Secchi was a better predictor of nutrients (especially TP) than algal biomass. Frequency of algal blooms (Chl >10 mu g/L) and Secchi <1 m increased sigmoidally with TP and TN with midrange nutrient concentrations (TP 20-50 mu g/L, TN 400-700 mu g/L) showing the greatest response to change. Trophic state criteria appropriate for Missouri reservoirs are similar to other north temperate lakes except for Secchi depth for which cutpoints are much lower because of nonalgal turbidity.

Firstly, the atmospheric structure over large lakes has some continental features, which makes the calculation of its influence more complicated. Secondly, the vertical temperature structure in the fine surface layer of a lake is more complex than in marine waters. A prominent feature of the thermal structure of spring heating of large lakes (e.g. in Lake Ladoga from May to July) is the existence of a thermal front, which is manifested on the lake surface as a tine strip with steep horizontal temperature gradient. The existence of a thermal front makes it possible to calibrate infra-red space survey data without using in situ surface temperature measurements. The calibration of arbitrary heat brightness values for +4 degrees C can be obtained by plotting a frequency distribution histogram of the heat brightness values obtained for the IR-image pixels. While the thermal front is in existence, the heat brightness frequency distribution appears bimodal, and the brightness value at the minimum between the peaks is assigned the temperature of +4 degrees C. Laboratory and field experiments have enabled us to separate two types of near-surface density structures. Under conditions of density instability in the fine surface layer, microconvection limits the magnitude of vertical temperature difference in this layer to a constant range of 0.6-0.8 degrees C. However, when a stable density structure prevails during calm conditions, much greater vertical temperature differences may exist.

The environmental consequences of rapid urbanization in central Florida reconstructed with high resolution 241Am and 210Pb dating in lake sediments	ANTHROPOCENE												Throughout the 20th century, Florida was one of the fastest growing states in the US, putting unique environmental stress on the region. Accurately dated lake sediments can provide invaluable records of environmental change that extend beyond monitoring records. Here, we analyze profiles of americium-241 (Am-241), cesium-137 (Cs-137), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and uranium-series radionuclides in Lake Bonny in Lakeland, Florida. The Am-241 peak is sharp in the sediment profile, while the Cs-137 peak is broader and spread evenly across two layers. The measured Cs-137 inventory of similar to 413 Bq/m(2) is less than half of the expected inventory from atmospheric deposition (accounting for decay since deposition), indicating significant losses. The reliability of Cs-137 as a chronological tool can be complicated in environments with low quantities of 2:1 clays and low available potassium (K), characteristic of Florida and the U.S. southeast. Using a piecewise constant rate of supply Pb-210 model verified by Am-241, we reconstruct sedimentation and chemical change in this lake. Highest sedimentation rates in the lake occur during decades of peak population growth in the mid-20th century. Uranium (U) and radium-226 (Ra-226) inputs to the lake reach a maximum in the 1960s, consistent with expansion of local phosphate mines and elevated groundwater pumping during that time in response to drought conditions. Total Pb in the sedimentary record captures the rise and fall of the use of leaded gasoline, but Zn inputs to the lake remain nearly two orders of magnitude above background levels in the last decade. Our high-resolution chronology of the lake reveals regional impacts on water and lake quality in central Florida during a period of rapid population growth.					; Volante, Paul/MIT-8815-2025	Volante, Paul/0000-0001-9328-517X; 													2213-3054					DEC	2024	48								100452	10.1016/j.ancene.2024.100452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2024.100452		OCT 2024											WOS:001350733500001

The 11 August 1931 M-s 8.0 Fuyun earthquake resulted in more than 10,000 casualties in the sparsely populated Fuyun area. Cosmogenic Be-10 dating of offset landforms produced by prehistoric M-s >= 8.0 earthquakes yields an average recurrence interval of 9,700 +/- 3,300 years, much longer than previously estimated 2,000-4,500 years, clouding our understanding of the timing and recurrence behavior of past earthquakes originating from the Fuyun Fault. Reflection seismic data reveal widely distributed subaquatic faults in Yileimu Lake, implying high sensitivity of the lake sediments to paleoearthquakes originating from the Fuyun Fault. Two new long sediment cores (Y20A: 267 cm; Y20B: 890 cm) together with previously published two short cores (Y19: 71 cm; Y20: 31.5 cm) from the depocenter and nearshore zone of Yileimu Lake are used for stratigraphic correlations and analyses of sedimentary structures, grain-size distributions, magnetic susceptibility, elemental composition and carbon content. The mass-wasting deposits with underlying soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDS) in the Y20B core indicate six siliciclastic-enriched sandy sediment fluxes from earthquake-triggered landslides of granitic rocks, and isolated SSDS record three additional earthquake-induced in situ deformations. Turbidite-like deposits with sorting indices >3 and Si contents >700 counts per second (cps) are comparable to those of the seismic mass-wasting deposits, and are thus interpreted as seismites from earthquake-induced re-deposition of nearshore sediments. There are a total of 20 seismic events recorded by the Y20B core. Seismic intensity calculation results, combined with historical seismic data, provide potential magnitudes of M-s >= 8.0, M-s >= 7.0, and M-s >= 5.5 for the earthquake-triggered mass-wasting deposits, SSDS, and turbidite-like seismites, respectively, in Yileimu Lake, generally consistent with previously published magnitude thresholds. Radiocarbon dating and stratigraphic correlations constrain the timing of these past earthquakes to similar to 28 cal kyr BP. This unique, long lacustrine paleoseismic record suggests a weakly periodic pattern with recurrence intervals between 2,317 and 7,830 years and an average of 5,303 years for potential M-s >= 8.0 earthquakes, and reveals an unprecedented high frequency of potential M-s >= 7.0 earthquakes originating from the Fuyun Fault in the last 5 kyr, demonstrating the urgent need for an improved assessment of seismic hazards and risks in the Fuyun Fault zone.

The response of sensitivity and extent of the EAM to orbital-timescale climate change remains controversial. The composition of oxygen isotopes of authigenic (pedogenic) carbonate in loess deposits from the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau was measured, which is at the modern northwestern boundary of the present-day EAM, and compared with equivalent data from northeastern China under the influence of the EAM and two selected sites in the zone under the influence of the westerlies (Bayanbulak (Xinjiang) and Kesselt (Belgium)). The data enable discussion of the paleoclimatic implication of delta O-18 of carbonate in loess deposits and extension (changes) of the EAM-affected area during the Last Glacial Maximum and early Holocene. The delta O-18 values of authigenic carbonate at the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau were close to those from the westerly climate zone, but higher than those from regions affected by the Asian monsoon during the Last Glacial Maximum and early Holocene. This indicates that precipitation moisture sources at the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau were likely not directly derived from the EAM during Last Glacial Maximum and early Holocene. In contrast, the westerlies and locally recycled or evaporated moisture were possibly the dominant influencing factors of the relatively delta O-18-enriched soil water and the authigenic carbonate in Northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Further study of loess carbonate records from the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau will reveal the past climate changes in the plateau region and provide valuable clues for the interaction between the Asian monsoon and westerly climate systems.					wang, xianyan/ABO-8369-2022; Lu, Huayu/NKQ-1462-2025; Vandenberghe, Jef/H-5846-2019; GE, Junyi/GRX-5741-2022; Long, Hao/AFT-1009-2022	Long, Hao/0000-0002-2767-5521; Vandenberghe, Jef/0000-0001-9910-1319; wang, xianyan/0000-0002-8281-5734; Meng, Xianqiang/0000-0003-3088-2211; 													0309-1333	1477-0296				DEC	2018	42	6					826	840		10.1177/0309133318803021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309133318803021													WOS:000454140800007

Impact of Gooselike Birds on Phyto- and Zooplankton of Lakes in the Taimyr Peninsula	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The data obtained on the qualitative and quantitative composition of summer phyto- and zooplankton of two lakes of the Taimyr Peninsula indicate a higher trophic status of the water body, which is under pressure from hydrophilic birds. Compared to the background water body, statistically significantly higher phytoplankton abundance (134 600 +/- 16 300 cells/L vs. 60 400 +/- 11 800 cells/L), zooplankton biomass (134 600 +/- 16 300 cells/L vs. 60 400 +/- 11 800 cells/L), zooplankton biomass (349.0 +/- 170.2 mg/L vs. 64.5 +/- 19.5 mg/L), and rotifer biomass (15.6 +/- 3.5 mg/L vs. 1.6 +/- 0.4 mg/L) and their dominance, as well as saprobic index (1.71 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.48 +/- 0.06), are registered. At the same time, specific features of community organization are revealed-higher species richness of phyto- and zooplankton and the absence of Cyanobacteria in phytoplankton composition and statistically a significantly higher abundance of Bacillariophyta (80 700 +/- 11 800 kl./L vs. 31 700 +/- 650 kl./L) and number of species (4 vs. 2) and biomass (326.6 mg/L vs. 60.6 +/- 18.8 mg/L) of copepods, which may be determined by the peculiarities of hydrobionts reaction to the products of bird activity. This allows us to speak about the prospects of guanotrophication to improve the trophic status of water bodies without the significant deterioration of environmental quality and biodiversity of hydrobiont communities.

J	Crossman, J; Elliott, JA				Crossman, J.; Elliott, J. A.			Bridging the gap between terrestrial, riverine and limnological research: Application of a model chain to a mesotrophic lake in North America	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Models remain our best available tool for managing low lake dissolved oxygen concentrations, which pose a serious ecological risk. This study investigated whether process-based catchment models (INCA-N and INCA-P) could accurately drive a lake model (PROTECH), to bridge a gap between terrestrial, riverine and limnological research. INCA was calibrated over all 20 catchments of the Simcoe watershed, Canada. Daily outputs (flow, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations) over the period 2010-2016 were selected for a common "baseline" period, and used as inputs to PROTECH, which was calibrated across the three major basins of lake Simcoe; Kempenfelt (K42), Cooks (C9), and the main basin (E51). Results showed that at catchment outflows INCA models achieved an average flow R-2 of 0.8; a load R-2 of 0.7 (both for TP and N-NO3), a concentration R-2 of 0.4 and 0.5 (for TP and N-NO3 respectively), and an SiO2 R-2 > 0.8. In each basin PROTECH achieved an R-2 for both temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations of >0.9. Performance of N-NO3, TP and Chlorophyll-a concentrations were good (R-2 values of up to 0.98, 0.92 and 0.53 respectively). Multi-stressor analyses established that most occurrences when DO dropped below the desired 7 mg/l threshold (DO7) were attributable to combinations of high temperatures and low tributary inflows. The importance of additional drivers was depth dependent, with photosynthesis being particularly important in shallower C9 and E51 basins during summer, when algae contributed sufficient O-2 to the water column to inhibit DO7 events. Conversely in the deeper more strongly stratified K42 basin, greater algal growth boosted the biochemical oxygen demand, enhancing declines in DO. Lake physics explained a significant number of DO7 events in all three basins. Integrated catchment-lake modelling approaches are important in understanding lake physical and ecological processes, and the impacts of land management and future climate change.

The variation of water level greatly affects the reproduction and growth of snails. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the variations of water level in the Poyang Lake region from 1993 to 2016 combined with satellite imagery to elucidate the evolution of the snail breeding environment.MethodsBy employing remote sensing data from 1993 to 2016 (April-June and September-November), the vegetation area of Poyang Lake and the vegetation area at different elevations were extracted and calculated. Moreover, the average daily water level data from the four hydrological stations (Hukou station, Xingzi station, Tangyin station and Kangshan station) which represent the typical state of Poyang Lake were collected from 1993 to 2016. The variance of the monthly mean water level, inundation time and the average area were analyzed by variance to find a significance level of alpha =0.05.ResultsAccording to hydrological data before and after 2003, the average water level after 2003 is significantly lower than that before 2003 in Poyang Lake. After 2003, the time of inundateing the snail breeding period was later in April to June than that before 2003, while the time of wate-falling stage in September to November moved forward after 2003 than before 2003. Of them, the lowest water level affecting the breeding and growing period of O. hupensis in the northern part of Poyang Lake decreased from 11m to 9m. After 2003, the expansion of meadow area in the north part of Poyang Lake was mainly concentrated in the elevation of 9-11m, and the newly increased infested-meadow in the lake area was mainly concentrated in the north part of Poyang Lake.ConclusionsBy comparing the change of water level characteristics in different parts of the Poyang Lake area as well as changes in meadow area before and after 2003, it is found that the water level changes mainly affect the snail breeding area in the northern part of Poyang Lake. The results are helpful for improving scientific measures for snail control in Jiangxi Province. This approach could also be applicible to Dongting Lake area and other lake areas affected by water level changes and can bring significant guidance for snail control in lake areas.

J	Green, AJ				Green, AJ			Habitat selection by the marbled teal Marmaronetta angustirostris, ferruginous duck Aythya nyroca and other ducks in the Goksu Delta, Turkey, in summer	REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE												Diurnal habitat selection of the Marbled Teal Marmaronetta angustirostris, Ferruginous Duck Aythya nyroca, Garganey Anas querquedula and Mallard A. platyrhynchos were studied in the Goksu Delta, Turkey From 10 July to 6 August 1995. This is the first detailed study of habitat use by the globally threatened Marbled Teal and Ferruginous Duck. All species were concentrated in lakes with dense beds of emergent and submerged vegetation, avoiding open and saline lakes and narrow isolated canals. Garganey and Mallard were concentrated in the "mixed emergent zone" of brackish Lake Akgol, which held a mixture of Phragmites australis, Typha and Scripus litoralis. Marbled Teal made most use of a more central zone containing monospecific stands of S. litoralis, whilst Ferruginous Duck were intermediate. Mallard and particularly Marbled Teal showed a relative preference for small pools around the edge of the lake, which were shallower and probably permitted a higher foraging intake. Marbled Teal. broods were highly concentrated at the influx of a drainage canal into the lake, which provided a safe diurnal refuge adjacent to possible nocturnal feeding habitat. Within Lake Akgol, Marbled Teal used microhabitats dominated by S. litoralis, Garganey were most associated with Typha, whereas Mallard and Ferruginous Duck were evenly associated with these species and with Phragmites. Mallard remained closest to emergent vegetation, and Garganey made most use of open microhabitats away from emergents. Ferruginous Duck used areas farthest away from the lake edge. All species showed strong selection for dense beds of Potamogeton pectinatus, owing to their importance as foraging habitat. Careful management is required to maintain Akgol's high value for waterbirds. The recovery of Marbled Teal and Ferruginous Duck populations in other parts of the Mediterranean requires the conservation and restoration of breeding sites with luxuriant vegetation.					; Green, Andy/A-5189-2008	Green, Andrew John/0000-0002-1268-4951; 													0249-7395					JUL-SEP	1998	53	3					225	243																WOS:000076502700003

River-evolution and tectonic implications of a major Pliocene aggradation on the lower Colorado River: The Bullhead Alluvium	GEOSPHERE												The similar to 200-m-thick riverlaid Bullhead Alluvium along the lower Colorado River downstream of Grand Canyon records massive early Pliocene sediment aggradation following the integration of the upper and lower Colorado River basins. The distribution and extent of the aggraded sediments record (1) evolving longitudinal profiles of the river valley with implications for changing positions of the river's mouth and delta; (2) a pulse of rapid early drainage-basin erosion and sediment supply; and (3) constraints on regional and local deformation. The Bullhead Alluvium is inset into the Hualapai and Bouse Formations along a basal erosional unconformity. Its base defines a longitudinal profile interpreted as the incised end result after the Colorado River integrated through lake basins. Subsequent Bullhead aggradation, at ca. 4.5-3.5 Ma, built up braid plains as wide as 50 km as it raised the Colorado River's grade. We interpret the aggradation to record a spike in sediment supply when river integration and base-level fall destabilized and eroded relict landscapes and Tertiary bedrock in the Colorado River's huge catchment. Longitudinal profiles of the Bullhead Alluvium suggest >= 200 m post-Bullhead relative fault uplifts in the upper Lake Mead area, >100 m local subsidence in the Blythe Basin, and deeper subsidence of correlative deltaic sequences in the Salton Trough along the Pacific-North American plate boundary. However, regionally, for >500 km along the river corridor from Yuma, Arizona, to Lake Mead, Arizona and Nevada, the top of the Bullhead Alluvium appears to be neither uplifted nor tilted, sloping 0.5-0.6 m/km downstream like the gradient of a smaller late Pleistocene aggradation sequence. Perched outcrops tentatively assigned to the Bullhead Alluvium near the San Andreas fault system project toward a Pliocene seashore or bayline twice as distant (300-450 km) as either the modern river's mouth or a tectonically restored 4.25 Ma paleoshore. We conclude that Bullhead aggradation peaked after 4.25 Ma, having lengthened the delta plain seaward by outpacing both 2 mm/yr delta subsidence and 43-45 mm/yr transform-fault offset of the delta. Post-Bullhead degradation started before 3.3 Ma and implies that the river profile lowered and shortened because sediment supply declined, and progradation was unable to keep up with subsidence and plate motion in the delta.					; Dorsey, Rebecca/AAE-6655-2022	House, Peter/0000-0002-0019-8075; Dorsey, Rebecca/0000-0001-8390-052X; Howard, Keith A./0000-0002-6462-2947													1553-040X					FEB	2015	11	1					1	30		10.1130/GES01059.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES01059.1													WOS:000352017500001

However, the understanding of its long-term compositional changes and responses to natural and anthropogenic factors remains limited, and few atmospheric radiative modeling studies have specifically examined the distinct contributions of char-BC and soot-BC components. In this study, we trace the compositional changes of BC over the past similar to 500 years using sediments from Huguangyan Maar Lake, China and separately quantify the impacts of char-BC and soot-BC on the RF of atmospheric BC. Our findings reveal that the proportion of soot-BC in BC has increased by 2.5 times since 1950 CE. In earlier periods, wildfires driven by the East Asian summer monsoon were the primary contributors to the dominance of char-BC in BC. However, the contribution of human activities to the rise in soot-BC has progressively increased from approximately 10% around 1950 CE to 80% by around 2010 CE, significantly altering BC composition and leading to a 5-fold increase in atmospheric BC RF. These results suggest that ongoing human activities will likely continue to alter BC composition and the atmospheric radiative balance, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing BC components in atmospheric models.

Lake Suwa, Japan is surrounded by mountains and farmlands, and nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers used for agriculture and domestic wastewater caused eutrophication of the lake before the construction of a regional sewerage system, resulting in large outbreaks of Microcystis and other environmental degradation. In recent years, the water quality has been improved. As a result, a large amount of phytoplankton has been suppressed, while a large number of aquatic plants have been proliferating, and the ecosystem in the lake itself has been changing. In order to conduct numerical simulations of water environment in such a water body, the model first needs to ensure the reproducibility of water temperature. However, it is challenging to simulate thermal stratification in summer, and the model performance to represent the temperature distribution is very sensitive to boundary and meteorological conditions. We incorporated a bottom heat transfer model into a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model SCHISM-ICM (Zhang et al., 2016). Sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing the bottom boundary conditions and the temperature of inflowing river water. Finally, we examined the impacts of model performance in the thermal stratification on biogeochemical modeling by comparing the distributions of dissolved oxygen. The new diabatic model simulated the bottom temperature better than the conventional adiabatic model, and hypoxia was formed longer and more stably due to the stronger vertical stratification.

J	Yang, QY; Bursik, M; Pouget, S				Yang, Qingyuan; Bursik, Marcus; Pouget, Solene			Stratigraphic and sedimentologic framework for tephras in the Wilson Creek Formation, Mono Basin, California, USA	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Numerous tephra layers occur within the late Pleistocene Wilson Creek Formation, where they are interbedded with lacustrine deposits of Lake Russell, the ancestor of present-day Mono Lake. Most of the tephra layers are rhyolitic in composition, and were produced from the Mono Craters. We present detailed stratigraphy and sedimentology of the tephra layers, sampled at twelve outcrops near the shoreline of Mono Lake and the Mono Craters, and implement grain size, componentry, and surface morphology analysis to characterize their physical properties. Sub-unit correlation is proposed for certain tephra units. Noticeable features of the tephras, such as the occurrence of low-density rounded or highly vesicular pumice within certain subunits, are highlighted. The abundant obsidian, lithics, and ostracods within many sub-units suggest that the associated eruption pulses involved water-magma interaction. Eruptions from the Mono Craters during the late Pleistocene were consistent neither in frequency nor volume. The Mono Craters were most active during the eruption of tephras in Sequences C (similar to 42.5-39.4 ka) and A (similar to 14.1-12.9 ka), and Pleistocene volcanic activity reached its peak during the eruption of tephra layer C11. Detailed interpretation of tephra layer B7 and tephras in Sequence A is given, which includes the number of eruption pulses, vent location, dispersal direction, occurrence of pyroclastic flow and surge, and other features and processes. Tephras in Sequence B (similar to 26.2-23.1 ka) may have had their vents located in the southern half of the Mono Craters, or are smaller in volume (except for B7), compared to the other tephras in the Wilson Creek Formation. Vents for tephra layers A4, A3, and A1 are located near the northern end of the Mono Craters. The stratigraphy of tephra layers B7 and Al suggests an unstable depositional environment, which can be used to help constrain the water-level history of Lake Russell during the late Pleistocene.

J	VERDOUW, H; GONS, HJ; STEENBERGEN, CLM				VERDOUW, H; GONS, HJ; STEENBERGEN, CLM			DISTRIBUTION OF PARTICULATE MATTER IN RELATION TO THE THERMAL CYCLE IN LAKE VECHTEN (THE NETHERLANDS) - THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TRANSPORTATION ALONG THE BOTTOM	WATER RESEARCH												Throughtout the thermal cycle of Lake Vechten (The Netherlands) the concentrations and chemical composition of particulate matter suspended in the water, deposited on the bottom near the shore and collected in sediment traps was measured. With regard to the distribution of particulate matter two significant periods during the thermal cycle could be distinguished. From May till mid-August a temperature gradient was present in the water column. During that period the average rate of increase in dry weight of bottom deposits and the sedimentation rate on that location were similar, i.e. lake wide 1.5 and 1.7 g m-2 d-1 respectively. This indicates a dominating role of settling particles in the building-up of the temporary shallow sediment, which resulted in the typical summer maximum of nearly 145 g m-2. From mid-August onwards the concentration of this sediment zone decreased sharply coinciding with the disappearance of the temperature gradient. This removal was explained by the mechanism of enhanced turbulence, occurring when thermal homogeneity was reached, which initiated resuspension and subsequent transportation of the particles to greater depths. From light profiles it was inferred that the flux of particles was confined largely to the water layer of .apprx. 1 m near the bottom. From comparison of the sedimentation rate in the central part of the lake with that in the shallow zone it could be estimated that compared to the particle flux in the open water towards profundal sediments, the flux along the bottom amounted during the thermal stratification period to an average of at least 42%.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				MAR	1987	21	3					345	351		10.1016/0043-1354(87)90214-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(87)90214-4													WOS:A1987H324600014
J	Winkler, E; Peintinger, M				Winkler, Eckart; Peintinger, Markus			Impact of changing flood regime on a lakeshore plant community: Long-term observations and individual-based simulation	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Disturbance events shape plant communities depending on the disturbance regime as well as on the properties of the species constituting the community. We studied a lakeshore community at Lake Constance, a pre-alpine lake in Central Europe, where disturbance by flooding has a strong impact as the water level is almost not regulated by man. The lakeshore habitats are shaped by annual summer flooding during the vegetation period of plants, with seasonal course and magnitude of water-level fluctuations varying considerably between years. By a combination of field work and modelling we examined (1) whether flooding tolerance and interactions between individuals can explain zonation and species coexistence at lakeshore, (2) how strongly invasive species are affecting habitat specific species, and (3) whether changing flooding regimes due to potential climate changes will affect species composition. The study was based on a long-term monitoring record (23 years; 1988-2005) of presence/absence of six species along two transects in a species-poor community at Lake Constance and on detailed records of annual flooding. We succeeded in parameterizing a spatially explicit individual-based life-cycle model of community dynamics on a pattern-oriented basis. This gave results on species demography, dispersal, and interactions. The parameterized model could be verified along additional data recorded in 2011. The results of model parameterization showed that the habitat specialists (characteristic species for the studied lakeshore community) will be able to coexist with stable zonation over the coming decades, mainly due to a contrast between flood tolerance and strength of competitive interactions forming a variant of the competition-colonization trade-off model of coexistence. As a consequence, long-term shortening of the average flooding period, as predicted for the future, should negatively affect flood-tolerant but weakly competing habitat specialists. Here, an avoiding strategy, a shift of flood-tolerant plant species to lower parts of the lakeshore beyond transect boundary and hence beyond present model range, is to be expected. The modelling results revealed that two native but invasive species will have an increasing impact on the community, and they are predicted to endanger habitat specialists on a long run. This was verified already by the re-examination in 2011. Following the parameter values, invasive species threatening the lakeshore community are both flood-tolerant and competitive. Their expected importance for the fate of the community even exceeds that of possible changes in flood duration. The study demonstrates that an individual-based model can be developed on the basis of nonstationary, temporally and spatially changing local abundance data. Such a model goes beyond conventional matrix modelling by the inclusion of nonlinear features as a consequence of individual interactions, and such features turn out to be decisive factor for dealing with species coexistence and displacement in a plant community.

Hypoxia affects spatial distributions and overlap of pelagic fish, zooplankton, and phytoplankton in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Bottom hypoxia has reemerged as a prominent feature of Lake Erie's central basin during late summer. Similar to coastal and marine systems, the influence of hypoxia on pelagic organisms remains largely enigmatic in Lake Erie. During 2005, we used a plankton survey system (a sensor package consisting of an optical plankton counter, fluorometer, dissolved oxygen sensor, light sensor, and conductivity-temperature-depth sensor), coupled with a fish hydroacoustics system, to explore how the distribution of phytoplankton (chlorophyll), mesozooplankton, and fish varied vertically and horizontally in relation to oxygen concentrations. To do so, we conducted surveys of the entire water column on a continuous basis during mild (August) and severe (September) hypoxia. Our surveys included two sampling designs: 1) basin-wide transects sampled during day and night to define broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap among pelagic organisms; and 2) shorter (5 km) transects sampled every 4 h over a 24-h period to explore how diel vertical migration and hypoxia interact to affect time-specific spatial overlap among fishes, mesozooplankton, and phytoplankton. Our findings indicated that fish avoided regions of the hypolimnion with dissolved oxygen concentrations <3 mg l(-1) by 1) moving horizontally into areas with higher oxygen or 2) moving vertically into the metalimnion, where a sharp thermocline and oxydine existed. A portion of the mesozooplankton continued to use the hypoxic hypolimnion as a refuge from fish predation during daytime at oxygen concentrations between I and 3 mg l(-1); however, there was usually a mesozooplankton maximum in the metalimnion, even when fish were compressed into this region. Prior to development of hypoxia, the metalimnion in some areas may have served as thermal refuge from predation from the epilimnetic planktivore, the emerald shiner, and the hypolimnetic planktivore-benthivore, the rainbow smelt. Overall, the horizontal compression of fish into lesshypoxic regions in the deep area of the central basin followed by vertical compression into the metalimnion as hypoxia developed further may have led to local reduction of mesozooplankton prey in these regions. Herein, we discuss the potential implications of these hypoxia-induced impacts for understanding food web interactions and fisheries management.

This lake (23 km(2) in surface) is located in the eastern side of the northern Ethiopia highlands, at an altitude of around 2000 m above sea level. Along the northern margin of the lake, which is mainly characterized by steep rocky slopes, the studied succession consists of colluvial and stromatolitic deposits. Along the southern margin, which is characterized by a wide coastal plain drained by the main watercourse feeding the lake (the Ankarka River), the study deposits are mainly palustrine, deltaic and fluvial in origin. Geomorphological and sedimentological data, integrated with a radiocarbon chronology, highlighted that during the last 3500 years the lake was affected by three main highstand phases, which occurred at about 3250-3000,2600-950 and 650-160 cal yrs BP, respectively. These highstands are documented by aggradation of siliciclastic systems both along the southern and northern margins, whereas isotope data highlight that most of the stromatolitic deposits developed during phases of intense evaporation. This peculiar feature could be differently explained: i) stromatolite growth was triggered by rapid lacustrine rises, but mainly occurred during the long-lasting lacustrine falls; ii) stromatolite developed during tectonic-induced transgressions, which occurred during phases of intense evaporation. Despite the possible effects of local tectonics, the Lake Hayk record shows a good correlation with those of several late Holocene lakes of East Africa lakes (Naivasha, Tanganyika, Victoria, Turkana, Abhe, Ziway-Shala, Bosumtwi and Abyiata), highlighting that it can be considered as a suitable climatic proxy for late Holocene time span. In particular, by both siliciclastic and stromatolitic deposits occurring in the uppermost part of the sedimentary succession record high-frequency oscillations, which have been ascribed to three main droughts that occurred during the Little Ice Age. These droughts were previously documented only in Lake Naivasha and Lake Victoria. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Rothery, DA; Thomas, RJ; Kerber, L				Rothery, David A.; Thomas, Rebecca J.; Kerber, Laura			Prolonged eruptive history of a compound volcano on Mercury: Volcanic and tectonic implications	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												A 27 x 13 km 'rimless depression' 100 km inside the southwest rim of the Caloris basin is revealed by high resolution orbital imaging under a variety of illuminations to consist of at least nine overlapping volcanic vents, each individually up to 8 km in diameter. It is thus a 'compound' volcano, indicative of localised migration of the site of the active vent. The vent floors are at a least 1 km below their brinks, but lack the flat shape characteristically produced by piston-like subsidence of a caldera floor or by flooding of a crater bottom by a lava lake. They bear a closer resemblance to volcanic craters sculpted by explosive eruptions and/or modified by collapse into void spaces created by magma withdrawal back down into a conduit. This complex of overlapping vents is at the summit of a subtle edifice at least 100 km across, with flank slopes of about only 0.2 degrees, after correction for the regional slope. This is consistent with previous interpretation as a locus of pyroclastic eruptions. Construction of the edifice could have been contributed to by effusion of very low viscosity lava, but high resolution images show that the vent-facing rim of a nearby impact crater is not heavily embayed as previously supposed on the basis of lower resolution flyby imaging. Contrasts in morphology (sharpness versus blurredness of the texture) and different densities of superposed sub-km impact craters inside each vent are consistent with (but do not prove) substantial differences in the age of the most recent activity at each vent. This suggests a long duration of episodic magmagenesis at a restricted locus. The age range cannot be quantified, but could be of the order of a billion years. If each vent was fed from the same point source, geometric considerations suggest a source depth of at least 50 km. However, the migration of the active vent may be partly controlled by a deep-seated fault that is radial to the Caloris basin. Other rimless depressions in this part of the Caloris basin fall on or close to radial lines, suggesting that elements of the Pantheon Fossae radial fracture system that dominates the surface of the central portion of the Caloris basin may continue at depth almost as far as the basin rim.

Therefore, a recognition of time variability of these atmospheric phenomena and the conditions of their occurrence are the main aims of this paper. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of the precipitation-free periods was based on the meteorological data from the years 1951-2009 recorded in the Meteorological Observatory of the Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin. Main hydrological data concerning dynamics of groundwater table and surface water table came from the measurement network of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management. Findings - Very long precipitation-free periods, lasting over 20 days, appeared only seven times Once a year in 1953, 1956, 1959, 1971, 1983, and twice in 2000. Since the 1980s, the number of precipitation-free periods has been decreasing parallel to the higher frequency of downpours and increasing annual precipitation totals. In the years 1981-1994, the following phenomena were observed in the Lublin region: decrease of river mean discharges, groundwater-table lowering, lowering of lake surfaces, disappearance of springs, and the shortening of the upper reaches of rivers. However, replenishment of water resources and more frequent meteorological extreme events have been recorded in the Lublin region since the second half of the 1990s. Therefore, local flood and inundations have occurred, and flood hazard in larger river valleys has increased. Originality/value - Examination of time variability of these atmospheric phenomena and conditions of their occurrence should contribute to the development of effective ways and techniques of management of water resources in the regional economy in order to reduce economic losses.					; Dobek, Mateusz/T-8202-2019; Janicki, Grzegorz/AAQ-2410-2021	Dobek, Mateusz/0000-0001-5614-436X; Janicki, Grzegorz/0000-0003-0731-7898; Kaszewski, Boguslaw/0000-0002-0797-4284													1756-8692						2011	3	3					225	237		10.1108/17568691111153384	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/17568691111153384													WOS:000294698600002
J	Talbot, MR; Lærdal, T				Talbot, MR; Lærdal, T			The Late Pleistocene-Holocene palaeolimnology of Lake Victoria, East Africa, based upon elemental and isotopic analyses of sedimentary organic matter	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Three piston cores from Lake Victoria (East Africa) have been analysed for organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) content, stable isotopes (delta(13)C and delta(15)N), and Hydrogen Index (HI). These data are combined with published biogenic silica and water content analyses to produce a detailed palaeolimnological history of the lake over the past ca. 17.5 ka. Late Pleistocene desiccation produced a lake-wide discontinuity marked by a vertisol. Sediments below the discontinuity are characterised by relatively low TOC and HI values, and high C/N, delta(13)C and delta(15)N, reflecting the combined influence of abundant terrestrial plant material and generally unfavourable conditions for organic matter preservation. A thin muddy interval with lower delta(13)C and higher HI and water content indicates that dry conditions were interrupted by a humid period of a few hundred years duration when the lake was at least 35 m deep. The climate changed to significantly more humid conditions around 15.2 ka when the dry lake floor was rapidly flooded. Abundant macrophytic plant debris and high TOC and delta(13)C values at the upper vertisol surface probably reflect a marginal swamp. delta(13)C values decrease abruptly and HI begins to increase around 15 ka BP, marking a shift to deeper-water conditions and algal-dominated lake production. C/N values are relatively low during this period, suggesting a generally adequate supply of nitrogen, but increasing delta(15)N values reflect intense utilisation of the lake's DIN reservoir, probably due to a dramatic rise in productivity as nutrients were released to the lake from the flooded land surface. An abrupt drop in delta(13)C and delta(15)N values around 13.8-13.6 ka reflects a period of deep mixing. Productivity increased due to more efficient nutrient recycling, and delta(13)C values fell as C-12-rich CO2 released by bacterial decomposition of the organic material was brought into the epilimnion. A weak drop in HI values suggests greater oxygen supply to the hypolimnion at this time. Better mixing was probably due to increased wind intensity and may mark the onset of the Younger Dryas in the region. After the period of deep mixing, the water column became more stable. TOC, C/N, delta(13)C and HI values were at a maximum during the period between 10 and 4 ka, when the lake probably had a stratified water column with anoxic bottom waters. A gradual decrease in values over the last 4000 yrs suggest a change to a more seasonal climate, with periodic mixing of the water column. Rising sediment accumulation rates and a trend to more uniform surface water conditions over the last 2000 yrs are probably a result of increased anthropogenic impact on the lake and its catchment. Following a maximum at the time of the rapid lake-level rise during the terminal Pleistocene, delta(15)N has remained relatively low and displays a gradual but consistent trend to lower values from the end of the Pleistocene to the present. TN values have risen during the same period. The lack of correlation between delta(13)C and delta(15)N, and the absence of any evidence for isotopic reservoir effects despite the rise in TN, suggests that the atmosphere, rather than the lake's dissolved nitrogen pool has been the principal source of nitrogen throughout the Holocene. The importance of atmospheric N fixation to Lake Victoria's nitrogen cycle thus predates by a very considerable margin any possible anthropogenic eutrophication of the lake.																			0921-2728					FEB	2000	23	2					141	164		10.1023/A:1008029400463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008029400463													WOS:000086422700003

The reconstruction of tree cover suggests presence of woody plants through the entire analyzed time interval, although trees played only a minor role in the vegetation around Lake Billyakh prior to 14 ka BP (<5%). This result corroborates low percentages of tree pollen and low scores of the cold deciduous forest biome in the PG1755 record from Lake Billyakh. The reconstructed values of the mean temperature of the warmest month similar to 8-10 degrees C do not support larch forest or woodland around Lake Billyakh during the coldest phase of the last glacial between similar to 32 and similar to 15 ka BP. However, modern cases from northern Siberia, ca. 750 km north of Lake Billyakh, demonstrate that individual larch plants can grow within shrub and grass tundra landscape in very low mean July temperatures of about 8 degrees C. This makes plausible the hypothesis that the western and southern foreland of the Verkhoyansk Mountains could provide enough moist and warm microhabitats and allow individual larch specimens to survive climatic extremes of the last glacial. Reconstructed mean values of annual precipitation are about 270 mm during the last glacial interval. This value is almost 100 mm higher than modern averages reported for the extreme-continental north-eastern Siberia east of Lake Billyakh, where larch-dominated cold deciduous forest grows at present. This suggests that last glacial environments around Lake Billyakh were never too dry for larch to grow and that the insufficient summer warmth was the main factor, which limited tree growth during the last glacial interval. The n-alkane analysis of the Siberian plants presented in this study demonstrates rather complex alkane distribution patterns, which challenge the interpretation of the fossil records. In particular, extremely low n-alkane concentrations in the leaves of local coniferous trees and shrubs suggest that their contribution to the litter and therefore to the fossil lake sediments might be not high enough for tracing the Quaternary history of the needleleaved taxa using the n-alkane biomarker method.

The bacterial community was diverse: 769 clones formed 345 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined at 99% 16S rRNA sequence identity. The bacterial community in both the water and sediments of the lakes was dominated by clones affiliated with the low G + C Gram-type-positive group, alpha-proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, (11-39, 11-30, and 10-37% of OTUs observed, respectively), patterns that have been observed in previously described alkaline, athalassohaline systems. However, a relatively high proportion of Firmicutess-related clones in the water of the lakes and alpha-proteobacteria in the sediments was observed. The bacterial community composition of the water and sediment of the same lake and of different lakes was significantly different (p<0.05). Operational taxonomic units related to the gamma-proteobacteria were more abundant in the sediment of Lake Fazda, whereas the sediment of Lake UmRisha was dominated by members of the delta-proteobacteria. The proportion of gamma-proteobacterial and Bacteroidetes-affiliated OTUs were predominant in the water of Lake UmRisha and differed significantly from other lake waters (chi-squared analysis, p <= 0.01). The more oxygenated and dilute nature of Lake Hamra was reflected in its microbial community composition, with the abundance of Bacillales sequences in the water, the absence of Halanaerobiales, Clostridiales, and Archaea in the water, and the presence of representatives of more phyla such as the Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Verrucomicrobia. The archaeal community composition appeared less diverse: 589 clones resulted in 198 OTUs defined at 99% 16S rRNA sequence identity, and all sequences fell into the phylum Euryarchaeota. Phylogenetic analysis showed that many of the sequences were distantly related (83-90% 16S rRNA sequence identity) to cultured and uncultured archaea, with many clones forming clusters that branched deeply within the Euryarchaeota. Forty-two and 53% of the bacterial and archaeal clones had less than 90% 16S rRNA sequence identity to previously described sequences. This indicates that the water and sediments of the Wadi An Natrun harbor a unique and novel prokaryotic diversity that is different from what has been described among other alkaline, athalassohaline lakes.

Modelling the effects of diving ducks on zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha in lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												An individual-based model describing the growth of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) is presented. The model is spatially explicit and predicts length-frequency distributions of zebra mussels. The parameters and model inputs with the strongest effect on the model outcomes were identified using a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. Using a cluster analysis we could subsequently identify five clusters of parameters with similar multivariate effect on the model outcomes. We applied the model to two shallow lakes in the Netherlands (Lake Veluwemeer and Lake Gooimeer) that differed strongly in densities of diving ducks in winter. The parameters describing predation by diving ducks were estimated from literature based on a detailed study on the diets of the dominant species (tufted duck Aythya fuligula, pochard Aythya ferina and coot Fulica atra). Growth parameters of zebra mussels were also obtained from literature. The only parameters that were calibrated were those describing the densities and timing of larval settlement. The measured length-frequency distributions of larger mussels (> 8 mm) did not differ significantly from the modelled distributions in Lake Veluwemeer (Kolmogorov - Smirnov test p > 0.05, N=1056) and was satisfactory in Lake Gooimeer. However, the smaller size classes (< 8 mm) that strongly depend on the success of the most recent reproduction peaks, were harder to predict. Our study further indicated that the mussels were strongly limited by food in both lakes. Furthermore, it appeared that the effect of diving ducks was very different in both lakes. In Lake Veluwemeer ducks were predicted to reduce the size classes > 8 mm by 90% whereas in Lake Gooimeer this reduction was only about 10%. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial characteristics of early successional habitat across the Upper Great Lakes states	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Creation and management of early successional forest (ESF) is needed to halt and reverse declines of bird species dependent on pioneering plant species or young forests. ESF-dependent bird species require specific structural forest classes and are sensitive to forest age (a surrogate for forest structure), patch size, proximity to patch edges, and the juxtaposition of forest age classes. To date, ESF conservation plans have relied on spatially inexplicit data, lacking patch and landscape metrics, to set habitat goals and to track habitat trends. In a previous study, we used Landsat time series stacks and a vegetation-change tracker algorithm to track forest canopy disturbances and subsequent regrowth from 1990 to 2009 across the Upper Great Lakes Young Forest Initiative region. Based on canopy disturbance histories, we assigned forest age classes to forest classes of the National Land Cover Database of 2011. In the present study, we used this spatial product to assess areas, patch and edge metrics, and land protection statuses of deciduous-mixed forest and woody wetland age classes. We defined ESF using four 5-year-age classes (1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20 years old) and their aggregate (1-20 years old) whereas forest >20 years old was referred to as 'persisting'. Aggregated across 5-year-age classes, ESF of deciduous-mixed forest covered 3.4% and 0.9% of Bird Conservation Regions (BCR) 12 (Boreal Hardwood Transition) and 23 (Prairie Hardwood Transition), respectively, whereas woody wetland ESF constituted 1.0% and 0.2% of the same BCRs. For both deciduous-mixed forest and woody wetlands, ESF often occurred in patches >= 1 ha, but most ESF also occurred near patch edges created by adjacencies with persisting forest. Most ESF tell on lands with an unprotected or unknown protection status regardless of forest class. Regionally, ESF covered less area, occurred in smaller patches and nearer to edges, and more often fell on lands of unprotected or unknown protection status in BCR 23 than in BCR 12. Our results advance ESF conservation by providing insight into spatial characteristics that influence habitat quality and by establishing a baseline for habitat management planning and monitoring.

SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES B-CHEMISTRY												The feasibility of gingko (Gingo Biloba) foliage as a passive bio-monitor for organochlorine pesticides in air was explored. The accumulation patterns of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in gingko foliage were similar; the amounts of HCHs, DDTs and HCB increased with foliage growth in spring and decreased thereafter. This accumulation pattern is likely related to the growing process of the gingko foliage, which was observed for the first time in our work, giving a piece of evidence for the "bud burst effect" in plants. Compared with those in pine needles in 1980's, the residual levels of HCHs and DDTs have declined obviously in Beijing, indicating that the ban on the production and use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in our country is effective; however, the amount of HCB has increased, indicating great progress of chemical industry in Beijing. The analysis for the source of OCPs in the gingko foliage showed that the technical HCHs and DDTs were used largely in history, but were not used in recent years. A little lidane has been used and there was a new input of o,p'-DDT in recent years; dicofol usage may be the main source of o,p'-DDT. Concentrations of HCHs, DDTs and HCB in gingko foliages were similar to those in pine needles in the corresponding period and there is a strong positive correlation between the OCPs concentration data obtained from these two kinds of trees. It presents no difference in the accumulation style between these two kinds of trees. The level of OCPs in the gingko foliage reflects the pollution status of OCP in air. The result of this work shows that the gingko foliage can be used as a bio-monitor of OCPs in air.

Eleven sediment cores were obtained from a dune-impounded wetland at Te Henga, west Auckland, nor-them New Zealand. Sediment stratigraphy and chronology were interpreted by radiocarbon dating, foraminiferal analysis, and provisional tephrochronology. Gradual impoundment of the wetland began c. 6000 cal yr BP, coinciding with the start of a gentle sea-level fall, but complete damming and initial sedimentation did not begin until c. 1000 cal yr BP. After damming, four well-defined sediment pulses occurred and these are preserved in the form of distinct clay layers in most of the sediment cores. For interpreting the sediment pulses, a physically based landslide model was used to determine spatially distributed relative landslide hazard, applicable at the catchment scale. An empirical landslide-soil redistribution component was added and proved able to determine the volumes and spatial pattern of eroded and deposited soil material, sediment delivery ratio and the impact on total catchment sediment yield. Sediment volumes were calculated from the wetland cores and corresponding landslide scenarios are defined through back-analysis of modelled sediment yield output. In general, at least four major high-magnitude landslide events, both natural and intensified by forest clearance activities, occurred in the catchment upstream of Te Henga Wetland during the last c. 1000 years. The spatial distribution of modelled critical rainfall values for the catchment can be interpreted as an expression of shallow landslide hazard. The magnitude of the sediment dpulses represented in the wetland can be back-calculated to critical rainfall thresholds representing a shallow landslide model scenario. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Radioactive fallout from the burning Chernobyl nuclear reactor provided a pulsed release of Cs-137 to Lake Sempach at the beginning of May 1986. The time-dependent removal of Cs-137 from the water column into the sediments has been investigated by analyzing water samples, settling particles, and sediment cores. A flux balance has been established to determine and to quantify the removal processes in the epilimnion and hypolimnion of Lake Sempach. Between May 1986 and March 1988, removal residence times of Cs-137 averaged 150 days in the epilimnion and 280 days in the hypolimnion. Cs-137 accumulated in the hypolimnion during stratification, and its scavenging from the hypolimnion into the sediments was the rate-limiting step of the overall process of removing Cs-137 from the water column. Resuspension of sedimentary Cs-137 occurred during circulation periods in winter. Scavenging by settling particles was the dominant removal process of Cs-137 in epilimnion and hypolimnion. Sediment trap fluxes of Cs-137 and Pb-210 linearly correlated with increasing particle fluxes up to a maximum of about 2.5 g m-2 d-1. Higher particle fluxes, likely due to calcite precipitation, did not enhance removal fluxes and scavenging efficiency for these nuclides. The distribution coefficient for the partition of Cs-137 between lake water and settling particles, K(d), was determined to 7.0 +/- 1.0 x 10(4) cm3 g-1 for epilimnetic particles and to 5.3 +/-1.1 x 10(4) cm3 g-1 for hypolimnetic particles. The distribution coefficient for Pb-210 was estimated to 1.1 X 10(6) cm3 g-1. The possibility of postdepositional mobility of Chernobyl and nuclear weapons Cs-137 and natural Pb-210 in sediments was proved.					; Santschi, Peter/D-5712-2012; Wieland, Erich/K-4241-2019	Santschi, Peter H./0000-0001-8188-7691; Hohener, Patrick/0000-0002-4453-566X; 													0016-7037					JUL	1993	57	13					2959	2979		10.1016/0016-7037(93)90286-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(93)90286-6													WOS:A1993LM78800003

To better understand the limits of life and its chemical and microbiological drivers, highly saline and brine groundwaters of Na-Cl and Na-Ca-Cl types with notably diverse SO4 contents were sampled in water intakes and springs from sedimentary aquifers located in the Outer Carpathians and the Carpathian Foredeep basin and its basement in Poland. Chemical and microbiological methods were used to identify the composition of groundwaters, determine microbial diversity, and indicate processes controlling their distribution using multivariate statistical analyses. DNA sequencing targeting V3-V4 and V4-V5 gene regions revealed a predominance of Proteobacteriota, Methanobacteria, Methanomicrobia, and Nanoarchaea in most of the water samples, irrespective of their geological context. Despite the sample-size constraint, redundancy analysis employing a compositional approach to hydrochemical predictors identified Cl/SO4 and Cl/HCO3 ratios, and specific electrical conductivity, as key gradients shaping microbial communities, depending on the analysed gene regions. Analysis of functional groups revealed that methanogenesis, sulphate oxidation and reduction, and the nitrogen cycle define and distinguish the halotolerant communities in the samples. These communities are characterised by an inverse relationship between methanogens and sulphur-cycling microorganisms. The solute composition differentiates high-salinity groundwaters of southern Poland into three genetic, aquifer-related groups. Sulphate and hydrogen carbonate concentrations relative to chloride, along with total salinity, are the key factors controlling microbial communities. Methanogens dominate in sulphate-poor brines of the Carpathian Foredeep and flysch formations, while sulphur-cycling microorganisms, except for thiosulphate oxidisers, are abundant in high-sulphate waters of the Carpathian Foredeep basement. Total salinity regulates halophiles, and more intricate mechanisms govern methanotroph distribution. image					Wator, Katarzyna/P-9788-2016; Wątor, Katarzyna/P-9788-2016; Slowakiewicz, Miroslaw/S-2637-2016; Goraj, Weronika/AAV-9033-2020; Dobrzynski, Dariusz/C-3702-2018	Wator, Katarzyna/0000-0002-1921-5146; Goraj, Weronika/0000-0003-2234-5133; Slowakiewicz, Miroslaw/0000-0001-6623-8968; Dobrzynski, Dariusz/0000-0002-0128-2201; Segit, Tomasz/0000-0003-2952-6332; 													1758-2229					OCT	2024	16	5							e70030	10.1111/1758-2229.70030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.70030								39440899					WOS:001338392800001

PHOTOGRAMMETRIC MONITORING OF GLACIER MARGIN LAKES	ROLE OF GEOMATICS IN HYDROGEOLOGICAL RISK	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing Workshop on The Role of Geomatics for Hydrogeological Risk	FEB 27-28, 2013	Univ Padua, Padua, ITALY	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing	Univ Padua			The growing number of glacial margin lakes that have developed due to glacier retreat, have caused an increase of dangerous Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in several regions over the last decade. A GLOF can occur when the water from the lake finds a path underneath the bottom of the glacier and the lake is draining rapidly. This causes normally a flood wave downstream the glacier. Typically such an event takes about 24 hours. GLOF scenarios may be a significant hazard to life, property, nature and infrastructure in the affected areas. Together with our partner institute CECS (Valdivia, Chile), a project was initiated on a pilot study for an early warning system for GLOF events in the Northern Patagonian Icefield. A GLOF is normally characterized by a progressive water level drop. By observing the water level of the lake, an imminent GLOF-event can be identified. Common gauging systems are not suitable for the measurement task, as they may be affected by ice fall or landslides in the lake basin. Therefore, in our pilot study the water level is observed by processing images of a terrestrial camera system. The paper presents the basic principle of a single-camera based GLOF early warning system. Challenges and approaches to solve them are discussed. First results from processed image sequences are presented to show the feasibility of the concept. Water level changes can be determined at decimetre precision. In the first stage of the project, the waterline was measured manually in the images. A promising approach for reliable automation of this task is the use of a camera, which is sensitive for near infrared. The difference in the reflection of water, ice, and rock in this wavelength is more better than in RGB. This will be discussed in the outlook in deep.

This uncertainty is closely linked to the dominant pool of dissolved organic matter (DOM), as its biodegradability and stability can significantly influence GHG budgets. For better understanding the potential impact of DOM sources and structure on GHG emissions, this study systematically investigated the primary dissolved GHGs, as well as the sources and distribution of DOM in a boreal steppe lake basin during the ice-covered period. The concentrations of dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O ranged from 27.9 to 33.1, 0.070-0.139, and 0.054-0.056 mu mol L-1, respectively, and exhibited spatial similarities with higher levels observed in the inflowing rivers compared to those in lakes. Three aromatic humus components were identified via the spectral characteristics of DOM, and subsequent molecular composition analysis further revealed that tannin and lignin were the primary components of DOM. The aromatic humus DOM showed a significant positive correlation with GHGs, as did the microbial indicators, suggesting that the trapped terrestrial DOM in the boreal steppe lake basin during the ice-covered period contributed to the storage of dissolved GHGs. Microorganisms isolated under the ice utilized DOM for respiration, degradation, nitrification and denitrification, resulting in the production of a considerable amount of GHGs. Furthermore, the presence of ice cover accelerates the accumulation of dissolved GHGs. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the massive GHG release during the thawing period to accurately evaluate GHG emissions in freshwater bodies.

Increased prespawning mortality threatens an integrated natural- and hatchery-origin sockeye salmon population in the Lake Washington Basin	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The life cycle of diadromous fishes such as salmonids involves natural mortality in a series of distinct life history stages, occurring sequentially in different habitats. Decades of research have emphasized mortality at the embryo, juvenile, and sub-adult stages but it is increasingly clear that some adults that survive and return to freshwater habitats die during the final homeward migration or after they reach the spawning grounds, prior to breeding. These are termed "en route" and "prespawning" mortality, respectively, and can threaten populations depleted by mortality at previous stages. In this study, we present evidence that the sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, population that returns to the Lake Washington Basin, in Washington State, USA, is experiencing both forms of adult mortality. Counts of the salmon entering the basin on their return migration in June and July were compared to counts in the major spawning grounds in September through November for 1995-2018. The disparity has increased markedly in recent years. The counts on the spawning grounds have decreased as a proportion of the number entering the system with an average 49 % of sockeye unaccounted for, consistent with increased en route mortality. In addition, prespawning mortality rates have increased in salmon that reach the Cedar River, the main spawning tributary, both at a hatchery holding adult fish in 1995-2018, and in the naturally spawning populations when monitored in the last five years. Hatchery records indicated < 10 % prespawning mortality for 1995-2010, increasing to an average 43 % for 2014 - 2018. Recent carcass surveys in the Cedar River documented that 33.6% (2014), 22.3% (2015), 30.3% (2016) and 50.0% (2018) of female sockeye died before completing spawning. These recent increases in prespawning mortality have been associated with warm water during entry to freshwater, but comparably warm water in past decades had no such effect. Steady warming of river temperatures around the median run completion date from < 8.0 degrees C to > 13.0 degrees C was correlated with increased prespawning mortality rates at the hatchery from 1995-2018. We conclude that warming conditions during migration and spawning, in concert with other factors such as infections with pathogens, are responsible for the increased prespawning mortality of adult sockeye salmon that are high enough to threaten the population's viability.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				JUL	2020	227								105527	10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105527	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105527													WOS:000525305400001

Taking into account key indicators that reflect the natural, historical, cultural, and socio-economic characteristics of the territory, using GIS technologies, a comprehensive assessment and mapping of the tourism and recreational potential (TRP) of the territory was carried out. The method of multicomponent scoring was used in this work. Consequentially, the study area was divided by means of a regular hexagonal network into many operational territorial cells; for each of those, the sum of scores was calculated according to the conditions and objects that are localized within its boundaries. The set of operational territorial cells filled with visual information made it possible to create an assessment map of the tourism and recreational potential of the Todzhinsky kozhuun territory. This map highlights the areas of the five value ranks, from the highest to the lowest. The areas with the highest scores are obviously the most suitable for the development of tourism industry. In general, the basis of the region's TRP is picturesque virgin natural landscapes with many large lakes, unique traditional ethnocultural landscapes of the mountain-taiga reindeer herders, biological resources for hunting and fishing, and healing mineral springs (arzhany). The key limiting factor in the development of tourism is the underdeveloped transportation system and the insufficiency of special tourism infrastructure facilities. Such an assessment made it possible to identify territories favorable for the creation of three specialized tourist clusters: ethnocultural tourism, "Reindeer herders of Todzhi"; water, ecological, and fishing tourism, "Todzha Lakes"; and mountain and sports tourism, "Big Sayan".					; Kuklina, Maria/AAV-8890-2021; Lysanova, Galina/Z-2990-2019; Istomina, Elena/A-4132-2017; Krasnoshtanova, Natalia/J-9702-2017	Kuklina, Mariia/0000-0002-9571-2144; Krasnoshtanova, Natalia/0000-0001-7643-6693; Trufanov, Andrey/0000-0002-6967-3495														2071-1050				JUL	2023	15	14							11087	10.3390/su151411087	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151411087													WOS:001038749700001

Seismites of the Late Triassic Lockatong Formation, Pennsylvania, USA: implications for Newark Basin border fault movement	JOURNAL OF PALAEOGEOGRAPHY-ENGLISH												Numerous soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDS) within thin-bedded, heterolithic lacustrine shoreline deposits of the Upper Triassic Tumble Falls Member, Lockatong Formation of eastern Pennsylvania, demonstrate liquefaction, fluidization and shearing features processes affecting sediment. This study employs thin-section analysis of SSDS to interpret them as probable seismites from the Triassic-Jurassic Newark Basin. Sedimentary structures include right-lateral offset of desiccation cracks and ichnofossils, thrust, reverse, and normal faults with mm-scale offsets, horsts and grabens, lateral spreads, and single and complex multiple networks of dikes and sills and associated sedimentary volcanoes, thin mudflows on a paleosurface linked to sediment dikes, load and flame structures, ball and pillow structures, recumbent folds, and incipient breccias. Dike fill consists of mudstone, angular sedimentary clasts, sandstone margins with mudstone cores, and plastically deformed sediment fill. The SSDS indicate that Late Triassic lacustrine shoreline sediments were subjected to forces, probably compressive with a minimal shear component reflected in the offset of the dikes and ichnofossils, that induced liquefaction followed by fluidization and vertical movement of fluids. Kinetic forces that altered sediment vertical stability, leading to deformation of the sediment included gravitationally unstable density gradients, vertical shear stress, and gravitational body forces. SSDS can be induced by seismic and aseismic processes. However, this unique combination of forces and resulting sedimentary structures indicate an origin by earthquake activity, likely produced by the nearby, active Newark Basin border fault system. The Lockatong Formation SSDS seismites improve our understanding via thin section analysis of the rheology and preservation potential of SSDS in lacustrine shoreline deposits, critical for the geologic history of Newark Basin, as well as the refinement for paleoseismic reconstruction in general.

A review of their past, present, and possible future	VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY												The western pond turtle (WPT) was formerly considered a single species (Actinemys or Emys marmorata) that ranged from southern British Columbia, Canada to Baja California, Mexico. More recently it was divided into a northern and a southern species. WPTs are found primarily in streams that drain into the Pacific Ocean, although scattered populations exist in endorheic drainages of the Great Basin and Mojave deserts. Populations in the Mojave Desert were long thought to be restricted to the Mojave River, but recently another population was documented in Piute Ponds, a terminal wetland complex associated with Amargosa Creek on Edwards Air Force Base. WPT fossils in the Mojave Desert are known from the Miocene to the Pleistocene. Recently, Pleistocene fossils have been found as far into the desert as Salt Springs, just south of Death Valley. The oldest fossil records suggest that WPTs were present in wetlands and drainages of the geological feature known as the Mojave block prior to the uplift of the Sierra Nevada Range about 8 Ma and prior to the similar to 3 Ma uplift of the Transverse Ranges. Archaeological records document use of turtles by Native Americans for food and cultural purposes 1,000 or more years ago at the Cronese Lakes on the lower Mojave River and Oro Grande on the upper river. The first modern publication documenting their presence in the Mojave River was 1861. Museum specimens were collected as early as 1937. These fossil and early literature records support the indigenous status of WPTs to the Mojave River. However, mtDNA-based genetic evidence shows that Mojave River turtles share an identical haplotype with turtles on the California coast. Limited nuclear data show some minor differences. Overdraft of water from the Mojave River for municipal and agricultural uses, urban development, and saltcedar expansion are threats to the continued survival of WPTs in the Mojave River.

However, research on these basins has been patchy, which limits our understanding of the hydrocarbon source rocks. To address this problem, we selected the relatively understudied Nanxiang Basin as the study area and, more specifically, the third member of the Paleogene Hetaoyuan Formation (Eh(3)), which is the main hydrocarbon-generating layer in the Biyang Sag of this basin. In this paper, we report on the organic petrology and geochemistry of Eh(3), and further analyze both its conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon potential. Our results show that the organic matter (OM) within the shales of Eh(3) had bioprecursors that were mainly phytoplankton, bacteria, and benthic algae, with relatively small contributions from animal and higher plant materials. The shales have an average OM abundance (total organic carbon, or TOC) of 2.96 wt%, thus meeting the criterion of a good-quality source rock. Their organic-matter is mainly type I to type II, and in terms of thermal maturity they range from low maturity to mature, thus displaying the characteristics required to generate oil. The results of our molecular geochemical analyses show that the sediments of Eh(3) in the Biyang Sag belong predominantly to deep or semi-deep lake facies, and they were deposited in a reducing environment and may have been affected by a marine incursion. The evidence for this includes Pr/Ph values of < 1.0, samples falling in the marine and salt lacustrine regions on the Pr/nC(17)-Ph/nC(18) diagram and values of C-26/C-25 for the tricyclic terpanes that are < 1.3, thereby indicating the influence of sea water. Eh(3) in the Biyang Sag has good potential to be a conventional and unconventional petroleum resource, particularly at the depocenter of the sag. Vertically, the third submember of Eh(3) (Eh(3)(3)) is proven to be the most favorable conventional petroleum resource, whereas the second submember (Eh(3)(2)) is the most favorable unconventional petroleum resource. Therefore, the saline lacustrine sequences are good for both conventional and unconventional petroleum resources.					; Xia, Liuwen/HCI-5555-2022	Xia, Liuwen/0000-0003-1096-3954; 													0264-8172	1873-4073				MAR	2019	101						343	354		10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2018.11.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2018.11.032													WOS:000459525300024

This investigation reconnects to a joint-study with Louis Scott on various pans in the Free State and Northern Cape. It expands the original reports with new data, laboratory analyses, fresh attention to micro-stratigraphy and palaeosols, reinforced by diagnostic laboratory analyses. The changing sedimentology and pedogenic imprints were recorded for 5 late Holocene profiles along the pan's windward shores, as well as a core into a 4000 yr old spring seep. Prior to a long hiatus, end-Pleistocene and early Holocene sediments are represented by hardpans of both calcrete and silcrete, related to different geochemical regimes that require more attention. Central to late Holocene environmental history were episodic flood surges across the Deelpan floor with construction of backshore features that included lunettes. Mixed facies indicate two major transgressive phases based on sediment parameters and redox zones that unexpectedly point to extended times with wet soil and lacustrine microenvironments. While some recent pan floods were sporadic, others were bundled in more complex, moister climatic anomalies. Current focus on high-resolution corings should be complemented by geomorphologic and pedogenic study of three-dimensional processes that better illuminate sequential change. Ground-cover deterioration after the youngest transgression led to renewed eolian dispersal of Kalahari-type sands, probably before any European settlement in the western Free State. Given the archival and archaeological record for long-term indigenous pastoralism along the middle Riet River, further research is warranted to examine the dominant view that Boer stock-raisers and British hunters had decimated the ecological resources of the Highveld during the 19th century.																			2372-5907		978-1-315-73830-7; 978-1-138-02704-6				2016	33						35	52																WOS:000379125800003
J	Ejsmont-Karabin, J				Ejsmont-Karabin, Jolanta			THE USEFULNESS OF ZOOPLANKTON AS LAKE ECOSYSTEM INDICATORS: ROTIFER TROPHIC STATE INDEX	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Eutrophication is still one of the most important, world - wide problems of surface waters. During last decades there is the increasing demand for effective methods of monitoring systems based on biotic indices. For practical application, the monitoring tools must satisfy certain requirements: (1) sampling should be quick and easy; (2) indices should be straightforward to calculate. The aim of the study was to test the usefulness of rotifer abundance and species composition as indicators of trophic state of lakes. Data on rotifer densities and taxonomic composition were collected in 41 dimictic and 33 polymictic lakes situated in northeastern Poland. The samples were taken once a year, during the summer stagnation period at 1 m intervals from the surface to the bottom of the epilimnion layer in thermally stratified lakes and from the surface to the bottom of shallow lakes. The data were used to estimate the relationship between the rotifer community structure and the indices of trophic state of lakes (TSI), like concentration of chlorophyll a and Secchi's disc visibility, (as the estimator of suspended particulate material in the water) calculated according to Carlson (1977) and widely used recently. The estimations were made separately for dimictic and polymictic lakes. However, regressions for the relationships between the trophic state of lakes based on mean values for Secchi's disc (TSISD) and chlorophyll a content (TSICHL) and rotifer indices for both groups of lakes, usually were not different. Thus the same regression equations may be used for both dimictic and polymictic lakes. The following formulas for rotifer TSI index (TSIROT) were found: (1) rotifer numbers (N, ind L-1): TSIROT1 = 5.38 Ln(N) + 19.28; (2) total biomass of rotifer community (B, mg w.wt. L-1): TSIROT2 = 5.63 Ln(B) + 64.47; (3) percentage of bacterivores in total rotifer numbers (BAC, %): TSIROT3 = 0.23 BAC+ 44.30; (4) ratio of biomass to numbers (B:N, mg w.wt. ind.(-1)): TSIROT4 = 3.85 (B:N)(-0.318); (5) percentage of the tecta form in the population of Keratella cochlearis (TECTA, %): TSIROT5 = 0.198 TECTA + 48.8 for dimictic lakes and TSIROT5 = 0.144 TECTA + 54.8 for polymictic ones; (6) contribution of species which indicate high trophic state in the indicatory group's numbers (IHT, %): TSIROT6 = 0.203 IHT + 40.0. It was assumed that the lakes with a TSIROT under 45 are mesotrophic, those with a TSIROT value of 45-55 are mcso-eutrophic, 55-65 - eutrophic and those with a TSIROT above 65 - hypertrophic. The formulas may be useful in preparing similar indices for lakes in central and northern Europe.																			1505-2249						2012	60	2					339	350																WOS:000305373600010
J	OLRIK, K; SORENSEN, A				OLRIK, K; SORENSEN, A			ECOLOGY OF PHYTOPLANKTON FROM 2 SHALLOW, ACIDIFIED LAKES, DENMARK, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE GREEN-ALGAE	BIOLOGIA												Lake Holm and Lake Kvie, two acidified, soft-water, shallow lakes in Western Jutland, Denmark, have developed completely different phytoplankton communities. In Lake Holm, the acidification process is more advanced than in Lake Kvie. pH in Lake Holm decreased to 3.9 in 1992, ammonia reached high levels (max. 4 mg 1(-1), total phosphorus concentration was mostly between 0.01 and 0.04 mg 1(-1) and inorganic phosphorus was below the detection limit most of the year. The phytoplankton biovolume was low (0.16-0.90 mm3 1(-1), max. 0.30 - 4.3 mm3 1(-1)) due to phosphorus limitation. During the investigated period 1989-92, the dinoflagellate Peridinium willei and unicellular desmid species were gradually replaced by tychoplanktic/epiphytic, filamentous green algae (Zygnematales and Oedogoniales) and picoplanktic cyanophytes. In the summer of 1992, Lake Holm partly dried-up. In this environment, tychoplanktic/epiphytic, filamentous forms competed well against true plankti forms. In spite of acidification in Lake Kvie (pH min. 4.5), elevated concentrations of nitrate and total phosphorus in this lake (max. 1.21 and 0.15 mg 1(-1) respectively) resulted in irregular mass occurrences of a species-poor, fast growing phytoplankton community of small Chlorococcales and Desmidiaceae (2.2-4.2 mm3 1(-1), max. 16-35 mm3 1(-1). Lake Kvie is deeper than Lake Holm and the phytoplankton of Lake Kvie is therefore less exposed to dessication than that of Lake Holm during hot and dry periods and thus has more euplanktic species than that of Lake Holm.																			0006-3088					AUG	1994	49	4					581	592																WOS:A1994PM35100020

These phenomena were accompanied by falling water levels in lakes and groundwater, low flow conditions in rivers, damage to ecosystems and negative impacts in various economic sectors, leading to a public debate on the current and future availability of water resources. In Germany, this debate has been boosted by media reports on drastically decreasing terrestrial water storage (TWS) based on satellite gravimetry of GRACE and GRACE-FO, in which results based on data of the U.S. analysis center JPL (JPL Mascons data) indicate a TWS decrease of -2.4 Gt/year for Germany from 11/2002 to 10/2021. To provide a more robust scientific basis for the ongoing debatethis paper first introduces the concept of satellite gravimetry, including its potential and limitations. Besides the JPL Mascons data, we then analyze three other GRACE and GRACE-FO data products (COST-G, GFZ and ITSG Graz / University of Bonn), resulting in German-wide TWS trends of -0.7 to -1.3 Gt/year for this period. Due to the measurement and processing principles, satellite gravimetry also captures mass changes beyond the area of interest, so that Alpine glacier mass loss leads to spuriously more negative TWS trends for Germany, which were corrected in the present analysis. The spread of results based on different data products illustrates the uncertainty of GRACE data so that a comparative analysis of different data sets is recommended. The markedly different results of the JPL-Mascons data set may be due to its processing method that differs from the other data sets in several aspects. In view of extreme positive TWS anomalies in 2002 due to high rainfall and very negative anomalies in the drought years 2018 and 2019, the resulting trend values are strongly dependent on the selected time period. A longer TWS time series for Germany simulated with a hydrological model shows a good correspondence to the TWS observations and indicates that the trend values for the period of satellite gravimetry are not representative of the long-term dynamics. Extrapolating future water storage trends from them is thus not recommended.

Survival of tree seedlings on different species of decaying wood maintains tree distribution in Michigan hemlock-hardwood forests	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Seedlings of some tree species are strongly associated with decaying wood in the germination or establishment period. Despite recognition of this pattern in forests around the world, few studies have compared the ability of different species of decaying wood to support seedlings. 2. We measured the abundance, survival, and age distribution of seedlings of Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock), Betula alleghaniensis (yellow birch), and Acer saccharum (sugar maple) among forest floor substrates at field sites in Upper Michigan, USA. Seedlings were censused on decaying wood of the same three species and on soil to determine whether species of decaying wood and soil differ in their ability to support seedlings. We hypothesized that Tsuga and Betula seedling abundance and survival are higher on Tsuga wood than on Acer wood or soil. 3. Independent of seed fall, light and size of wood piece, Tsuga wood generally supported the highest densities of first-year and established (> 1 year-old) seedlings of Betula and Tsuga. Averaged over three sites, established seedlings per metre square on Tsuga wood, Betula wood, Acer wood and soil were 0.42, 0.21, 0.08 and 0.01, respectively, for Tsuga, 0.60, 0.15, 0.10 and 0.01, respectively, for Betula and 0.09, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.98, respectively for Acer. Long-term seedling survival was also greatest on Tsuga wood which supported seedlings as old as 13 years, while on Acer wood seedlings > 3 years-old were rare. Despite a strong general pattern in seedling densities, there were large site differences perhaps related to water availability. 4. Synthesis. We conclude that the strong association of Tsuga and Betula seedlings with Tsuga decaying wood and not with Acer wood or soil, combined with the distribution of Tsuga wood, helps explain (i) the close Tsuga-Betula association, (ii) the maintenance of distinct, temporally stable Tsuga- and Acer-dominated patches; and (iii) the decline of Tsuga in selectively logged forests as mature trees are harvested and decaying Tsuga wood is scarce. Differences between Tsuga and Acer wood may reflect general differences in the suitability of conifer vs. angiosperm wood for seedling establishment.

The Lower Cretaceous rift deposits of the South Atlantic equatorial margin, which are intensively explored by petroleum companies, provide good examples of such silicifications in carbonates, exhibiting a wide diversity of petrographic habit of early to late quartz cements. In order to understand the palaeoenvironmental and diagenetic conditions leading to this diversity, we integrated detailed petrography of diagenetic sequences and quartz habit with delta O-18(quartz) measurements (by SIMS) of individual cements observed in samples from the offshore and onshore basins of the West African margin. The petrographic description highlights the omnipresence of early fibrous microquartz cements exhibiting either length-fast or length-slow habit, in addition to laminated microquartz and micro-or mega-quartz forms. Amongst the isotopic analysis, the delta O-18(quartz) data show that length-slow cements are generally strongly enriched in O-18 (delta O-18(quartz) ranging from 31 to 37 parts per thousand SMOW), whereas length-fast forms show less elevated values (< 32 parts per thousand SMOW). The highest delta O-18(quartz) values for fibrous microquartz are interpreted to reflect precipitation from evaporated meteoric fluids at temperatures > 25 degrees C and < 100 degrees C. The alkalinity required to favor the precipitation of length-slow fibrous microquartz cements is probably related to fluid/rock interactions with underlying mantel-related or basic volcanic rocks. Such interactions would be in agreement with the recent geodynamic models of the South Atlantic passive margin. The length-fast fibrous microquartz associated with delta O-18(quartz) values ranging from 27 to 32 parts per thousand SMOW, probably reflect precipitation from moderately to non evaporated, fairly neutral to acid, fluids. The partial dissolution of carbonate cements prior to quartz cementations represents the signature of those acidic conditions. We therefore suggest that acidic pH was obtained through fluid/rock interactions with the intermediate to acid volcanic rocks encountered along the palaeohydrological pathway. Other quartz phases, such as the megaquartz cement, exhibit highly variable delta O-18(quartz) values ranging from 20 to 40 parts per thousand. This variation may reflect significant variation in temperature conditions (between 100 and 200 degrees C) or changes in fluid delta O-18 at the small scale. For these populations of non-fibrous quartz cement, the very high delta O-18(quartz) values may reflect a contribution of fluids that have either suffered strong evaporation or strong water/rock interaction.					; Teboul, Pierre-Alexandre/H-8508-2019	CAMOIN, Gilbert/0000-0002-7466-4155; Gaucher, Eric C./0000-0002-7976-8455; Teboul, Pierre-Alexandre/0000-0002-7992-7700; 													0883-2927	1872-9134				JAN	2019	100						22	41		10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.10.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.10.019													WOS:000454459100003
J	Smith, DA; Matisoff, G				Smith, Derek A.; Matisoff, Gerald			Sediment Oxygen Demand in the Central Basin of Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Three separate procedures were used to estimate the sediment oxygen demand (SOD) in the central basin of Lake Erie and were compared with other estimates determined previously and with historical data. First, whole core incubations involved sealing sediment cores at 12 degrees C to ensure no interaction between the overlying water and the atmosphere and monitoring continuously to define the linear disappearance of oxygen. Second, sediment plugs were placed inside flow-through reactors and the influent and effluent concentrations were monitored to obtain steady-state reaction rates. Third, an extensive data set for the central basin of Lake Erie was compiled for input into the diagenetic BRNS model, and the SOD was calculated assuming all primary redox reactions, but no secondary reactions. All three procedures produced estimates of SOD that were in reasonable agreement with each other. Whole core incubations yield an average SOD of 7.40 x 10(-12) moles/cm(2)/sec, the flow-through experiments had an average SOD of 4.04 x 10(-12) mole/cm(2)/sec, and the BRNS model predicts an SOD of 7.87 x 10(-12) moles/cm(2)/sec over the top 10 cm of sediment and appears to be calibrated reasonably well to the conditions of the central basin of Lake Erie. These values compare reasonably well with the 8.29 x 10(-12) moles/cm(2)/sec obtained from diffusion modeling of oxygen profiles (Matisoff and Neeson 2005). In contrast, values reported from the 1960s to 1980s ranged from 10.5-32.1 X 10(-12) moles/cm(2)/sec suggesting that the SOD of the central basin has decreased over the last 35 years, presumably, in response to the decrease in phosphorus loadings to Lake Erie. However, since hypoxia in the hypolimnion persists these results suggest that improvement in hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations may log decreases in loadings or that the hypolimnion in the central basin of Lake Erie is simply too thin to avoid summer hypoxia during most years.																			0380-1330					DEC	2008	34	4					731	744																WOS:000262663900013

The Miocene appeared as the last warm episode in earth history, prior to the establishment of large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Furthermore, the Miocene was characterized by both, large-scale marine transgressions and pronounced episodes of regressions, e.g. opening and closure of marine corridors as well as appearance and disappearance of lakes and swamps. The sea-level changes and instability of the climate system strongly influenced not only marine ecosystems but also the terrestrial biota. To throw new light on the Miocene evolution of European ecosystems and climate dynamics, we compared plant assemblages from southeastern Europe. Palaeogeographically this area is a transitional belt between Tethyan and Paratethyan realms, and it thus constitutes a crucial geographical position when one tries to comprehend the exchange pathways of various floristic elements, appearance and evolution of steppe vegetation, interaction between forest and steppe vegetation, and of course the corresponding climates influencing the vegetation dynamics. Both macro- and microfloristic plant associations were considered in our analysis. Large palaeofloristic and palaeocoenotic transformations occurred during the Miocene. The Early to Middle Miocene flora is rich and diverse in thermophilous elements, which formed polydominant mesophytic to hygromesophytic forests. Early Miocene climate was warm and humid with mean annual temperatures mainly above 16 degrees C and annual rainfalls over 1000 mm. The Middle Miocene was the warmest period of the whole Miocene, with annual temperatures ranging from 17 degrees C to 19 degrees C and winter temperatures from 7 degrees C to 12.5 degrees C. Climatic changes after the Miocene climatic optimum caused changes in floristic composition and vegetation structure. The vegetation shows a decreasing trend in abundance of palaeotropic and thermophilous elements, reduction of macrothermic elements, and disappearance of evergreen laurel forests. Together with these changes is a corresponding increase in the role of arctotertiary species in plant communities, and they became dominants in mesophytic forests. The available data indicate that major vegetation changes occur in the late Miocene. This period is characterized by more diverse climatic conditions, which were directed by global climatic changes and probably complicated by regional palaeogeographic reorganizations and tectonic processes. Slight cooling and some drying is recorded for the beginning of the Late Miocene, followed by fluctuations of palaeoclimate parameters observed which display cycling change of humid/dryer and warmer/cooler conditions. Our study provides a new insights on the Miocene vegetation and climate dynamics and evolution in Southeastern Europe. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												To answer the question "Has the recent warming no analogues in the Siberian north?" we analyzed larch tree samples (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) from permafrost zone in the eastern Taimyr (TAY) (72 degrees N, 102 degrees E) using tree-ring and stable isotope analyses for the Climatic Optimum Period (COP) 4111-3806 BC and Medieval Warm Period (MWP) 917-1150 AD, in comparison to the recent period (RP) 1791-2008 AD. We developed a description of the climatic and environmental changes in the eastern Taimyr using tree-ring width and stable isotope (delta C-13, delta O-18) data based on statistical verification of the relationships to climatic parameters (temperature and precipitation). Additionally, we compared our new tree-ring and stable isotope data sets with earlier published July temperature and precipitation reconstructions inferred from pollen data of the Lama Lake, Taimyr Peninsula, delta O-18 ice core data from Akademii Nauk ice cap on Severnaya Zemlya (SZ) and delta O-18 ice core data from Greenland (GISP2), as well as tree-ring width and stable carbon and oxygen isotope data from northeastern Yakutia (YAK). We found that the COP in TAY was warmer and drier compared to the MWP but rather similar to the RP. Our results indicate that the MWP in TAY started earlier and was wetter than in YAK. July precipitation reconstructions obtained from pollen data of the Lama Lake, oxygen isotope data from SZ and our carbon isotopes in tree cellulose agree well and indicate wetter climate conditions during the MWP. Consistent large-scale patterns were reflected in significant links between oxygen isotope data in tree cellulose from TAY and YAK, and oxygen isotope data from SZ and GISP2 during the MWP and the RP. Finally, we showed that the recent warming is not unprecedented in the Siberian north. Similar climate conditions were recorded by tree-rings, stable isotopes, pollen, and ice core data 6000 years ago. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Understanding the decline of water storage across the Ramser-Lake Naivasha using satellite-based methods	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												It has been postulated that Lake Naivasha, Kenya, has experienced a rapid decrease (and fluctuations) in its spatial extent and level between the years 2002 to 2010. Many factors have been advanced to explain this, with horticultural and floricultural activities, as well as climatic change, featuring prominently. This study offers a multi-disciplinary approach based on several different types of space-borne observations to look at the problem bedeviling Lake Naivasha, which is a Ramsar listed wetland of international importance. The data includes: (1) Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) time-variable gravity field products to derive total water storage (TWS) variations within a region covering the Lakes Naivasha and Victoria basins; (2) precipitation records based on Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) products to evaluate the impact of climate change; (3) satellite remote sensing (Landsat) images to map shoreline changes and to correlate these changes over time with possible causes; and (4) satellite altimetry observations to assess fluctuations in the lake's level. In addition, data from an in situ tide gauge and rainfall stations as well as the output from the African Drought Monitor (ADM) model are used to evaluate the results. This study confirms that Lake Naivasha has been steadily declining with the situation being exacerbated from around the year 2000, with water levels falling at a rate of 10.2 cm/year and a shrinkage in area of 1.04 km(2)/year. GRACE indicates that the catchment area of 4 degrees x 4 degrees that includes Lake Naivasha loses water at a rate of 1.6 cm/year for the period from August 2002 to May 2006, and 1.4 cm/year for the longer period of May 2002 to 2010. Examining the ADM outputs also supports our results of GRACE. Between the time periods 2000-2006 and 2006-2010, the lake surface area decreased by 14.43% and 10.85%, respectively, with a corresponding drop in the water level of 192 cm and 138 cm, respectively, over the same periods. Our results show a correlation coefficient value of 0.68 between the quantity of flower production and the lake's level for the period 2002-2010 at 95% confidence level, indicating the probable impact of anthropogenic activities on the lake's level drop.

J	Hospital, A; Miguez, T; Stronach, J				Hospital, Aurelien; Miguez, Travis; Stronach, James			Flammability risk assessment for oil spill response operations	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Immediately following a spill at sea, released oil-ranging from diesel to light crude and diluted bitumen, will initially weather through evaporation, resulting in an elevated concentration of light hydrocarbons in the air. As part of oil spill response operations, first responders use hand-held devices to monitor airborne concentrations when approaching a spill. The feasibility of using numerical modelling as an additional tool to assess potential flammability and plan response operations in the spill area was explored in this study. The Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) is defined as the minimum concentration of a gas in air, in this case a mixture of evaporated hydrocarbons, which can produce a flash fire in the presence of an ignition source. This ignition source could be triggered by the vessel itself or by spill response operations. A framework was put into place, utilizing a threedimensional hydrodynamic model (H3D), an oil spill model (SPILLCALC), and an air dispersion model (CALPUFF) to assess the risk of possible ignition of the hydrocarbon vapour in the event of a spill. The study looked at a hypothetical credible worst case tanker spill (16 500 m(3)) of diluted bitumen (cold lake winter blend) occurring at Arachne Reef in Haro Strait, British Columbia, Canada. SPILLCALC provided one-minute averaged vapour fluxes from the water surface for each of 17 modelled pseudo-components which were used as inputs to CALPUFF. Using the predicted airborne concentrations of each pseudo-component, time-scaled to one-second averages, the flammability potential in the immediate spill area was determined at each grid point using Le Chatelier's mixing equation. The approach describe here was developed as a proof of concept, and could be established as a real-time system, bringing valuable information in addition to hand-held devices during a spill response, or during a response exercise.

In spite of this, our knowledge about the history of land-use and its long-term impact on soil erosion and the local environment remains limited. This study seeks to address this issue by investigating sediments of lake Murten, Switzerland, using a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct the history of land-use and its impacts in the catchment. We analyzed pollen and charcoal to reconstruct past land-use and vegetation dynamics, and used the distributions of terrestrial leaf wax biomarkers, their delta C-13 isotopic composition and their soil retention time (compound-specific C-14) to evaluate long-term effects on past soil carbon dynamics. Arboreal pollen abundances, charcoal influx and cultural indicators match the archaeological evidence and reveal an eventful past around the lake. The first signs of human presence were detected around 5000 BCE, when Neolithic pile dwellers occupied the lake's shores. However, human land-use had no significant effect on the pollen and the sedimentary organic matter (OM) composition during Neolithic times and the Bronze Age. This changed during the late Iron Age and the Early Roman Period (ca. 70 BCE). Coincident with the rise of Aventicum, a Roman city, large-scale deforestation and agriculture began in the region. Severe soil degradation and outwash of soil organic carbon (SOC) at this time is documented by enhanced input of soil-derived and pre-aged leaf waxes, and resulted in cultural eutrophication ca. 2000 years ago. Soil erosion decreased after the fall of the Roman Empire and a short period of renaturation followed. Although the export of SOC returned to pre-Roman values after ca. 200 years, the forest never recovered to its past extent. The last two detected periods of land-use change correlate with the onset of Medieval agriculture (ca. 1000 CE) and the Industrial Period (ca. 1800 CE). Today, the mean transit time of leaf waxes is almost five times longer compared to the Roman Period, suggesting that substantial soil erosion has occurred and that an even longer time period would be necessary for the soil carbon dynamics to recover to their natural state.

Fine Scale Movements and Habitat Use of Black Brant During the Flightless Wing Molt in Arctic Alaska	WATERBIRDS												Thousands of Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) migrate annually to the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA), Alaska, to undergo the flightless wing molt on tundra lakes and wetlands. GPS transmitters were attached to Brant over two summers (2007-2008) to examine patterns of movement and habitat use of molting Brant, including variation by habitat type, year and body mass. Molting Brant were located an average of 31 +/- 1 m (SE) from shore and this distance did not vary across any of the explanatory variables. Brant moved an average of 123 +/- 3 m hr(-1) while flightless. Movement rates varied by year, averaging 22 +/- 12 m hr(-1) faster in 2008, and across habitat types, averaging 22 +/- 13 m hr(-1) faster in inland versus coastal and estuarine habitats. Two kernel home ranges were estimated: entire home range, which encompassed the complete 95% probability contour, and shoreline home range, which included only shoreline areas used by molting Brant. Entire home range (x bar = 15.1 +/- 2.2 km(2)) was negatively correlated with body mass, suggesting that heavier individuals have more body reserves to contribute to feather growth and thereby require less food and smaller home ranges. Conversely, shoreline home range (x bar = 4.3 +/- 0.6 km(2)) did not vary by body mass, but rather by habitat type, being larger in estuarine habitats. The complex shorelines and numerous deltaic islands of estuarine habitats offer more shoreline per area than either coastal or inland habitats. Brant appear to have limited ability to adjust their home range size or forage further from shore in response to variable food resources across years or habitats, instead altering their movement rate. Given this apparent lack of behavioral flexibility, Brant may be sensitive to development-related disturbances or habitat losses at molt sites in the TLSA.

Biofilm growth changes the properties of the sediments, which may further influence the sorption mechanism of emerging contaminants to sediments. This study is focused on the effects of biofilms on the linear and nonlinear sorption of fluoroquinolone antibiotic ofloxacin (OFL) by sediments. Materials and methods The top 5 cm of sediments and the overlying water containing natural microorganisms were collected from a shallow lake in summer. They were cultivated in the laboratory for the development of biofilms on the surface of sediments. Batch sorption experiments of OFL by original sediments and biofilm-coated sediments were conducted, and infrared spectrometry was used to obtain the main functional groups involved in sorption. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were extracted from biofilms to investigate their interaction with OFL through three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopies. Results and discussion The results showed that linear partition and nonlinear adsorption were simultaneously involved in the sorption process. The linear partition coefficients of OFL in sediments decreased by 50% and 60%, whereas the nonlinear adsorption capacities increased by 1.7 and 2.0 times after the biofilms colonized the sediment surface for 30 and 45 days, respectively. The decreased linear partition coefficients of OFL were related to the barrier created by biofilm coatings affecting hydrophobic interaction, whereas the increased nonlinear adsorption capacities were due to the increase in cation exchange capacities and the formation of hydrogen bonds between fluorine atoms in OFL and -OH groups in sediment. In addition, OFL and protein-like substances contained in EPS from biofilms could form complexes that affect the sorption processes. Conclusions The present study reveals that biofilms can inhibit hydrophobic interaction but facilitate cation exchange and hydrogen binding between OFL and sediments. Our work yields new insights into the interaction of aquatic solid sorbents, which is significant to understanding the transport and fate of organic contaminants in natural waters.

J	Tosal, A; Martín-Closas, C				Tosal, Aixa; Martin-Closas, Carles			Taphonomy and palaeoecology of the Oligocene flora from Cervera (Catalonia, Spain) and their implication in palaeoclimatic reconstruction	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The Oligocene flora from Cervera (Eastern Ebro Basin, Catalonia) represents one of the most significant Paleogene palaeobotanical records of the Iberian Peninsula. This flora is studied here from the point of view of taphonomy and palaeoecology. Five plant-bearing beds have been found in the lacustrine facies of the Civit Member (Montmaneu Formation) and Talavera Formation. They contain three different taphonomic and palaeoecological assemblages: (1) an assemblage dominated by small leaves of Rhamnus and leaflets of Rhus and Mimosites, interpreted as wind transported, size-biased remains from open xerophytic woodlands located, away from the lake margins; (2) an assemblage composed of well-preserved whole leaves belonging to the Salicaceae, some species of the Myricaceae and helophytic stem portions without evidence of any selection or traction transport. These were probably supplied to the lake directly from the lakeshores by gravitational fall and would represent elements of a riparian forest; and (3) an assemblage formed by a few leaves belonging to the Lauraceae and some species of the Myricaceae that generally show marked tearing along the veins. These remains reached the lake through transport in river inlets and are assigned to a laurel forest possibly growing beyond the riparian community. This lauracean community would have grown in the lowlands of the Ebro foreland basin rather than at some altitude as suggested by previous authors. The ensemble of remains underwent flotation before being sedimented in the anoxic bottom of the lake centre. The taphonomic biases found in the Cervera leaf assemblages should be taken into account in future palaeoclimatic analyses based on leaf morphology. Specifically, the size-bias of leaves in assemblage 1, which is attributed to wind transport, could provide an exaggerated aridity signal if not corrected appropriately. Also the sampling bias of some previous collections from the same localities has resulted in an over-representation of large well-preserved leaves, mainly belonging to Lauraceae species, which lead to an inflated thermal indication if these were taken into account without determining their taphonomic constraints. This study highlights the need to perform taphonomic studies and define the taphofacies represented in a leaf assemblage before undertaking any palaeoclimatic analysis based on leaf physiognomy, such as CLAMP.

The elements of the ice-wedge structure were identified: young ice wedge, shoulders, selvages, closed-cavity ices, and ice lenses in a peatland. Different genetic types of ice (ice vein, congelation ice, and segregated ice) were revealed by analyzing the elements of the ice-wedge structure under polarized light and analyzing their chemical compositions. Genetic types of the ice indicate the different mechanisms of ice-wedge formation. The ice vein forms due to fast bilateral freezing of primarily meltwater in a thermal contraction crack. The congelation ice forms due to the slow freezing of free water that has accumulated into a thermokarst cavity. The segregated ice forms due to pore water migration to the freezing zone. The elements of the ice-wedge structure have variable stable isotope values (delta O-18 from -13.5 parts per thousand to -21.9 parts per thousand and delta D from -87.7 parts per thousand to -154.6 parts per thousand). The high range of deuterium excess values (13.8 parts per thousand to 32 parts per thousand) indicates fractionation at condensation. The mean winter paleotemperature calculated using Vasil'chuk's equations for the ice-wedge pats formed by the ice veins varied in the range of -18 to -22 degrees C, which is not very different from current values and is consistent with the isotopic data of ice wedges from nearby regions of Northwest Siberia. The paleotemperature average error can equal 4.5 degrees C if we ignore the data on the ice petrographic analysis. The error depends on where and how the ice wedges are sampled, because of varying genetic types within the ground ice. This could lead to different palaeoclimatological interpretations.

However, beef production in well-managed grazing systems can aid in soil carbon sequestration (SCS), which is often ignored when assessing beef production impacts on climate change. To estimate the carbon footprint and climate change mitigation potential of upper Midwest grass-finished beef production systems, we conducted a partial life cycle assessment (LCA) comparing two grazing management strategies: 1) a non-irrigated, lightly-stocked (1.0 AU/ha), high-density (100,000 kg LW/ha) system (MOB) and 2) an irrigated, heavily-stocked (2.5 AU/ha), low-density (30,000 kg LW/ha) system (IRG). In each system, April-born steers were weaned in November, winter-backgrounded for 6 months and grazed until their endpoint the following November, with average slaughter age of 19 months and a 295 kg hot carcass weight. As the basis for the LCA, we used two years of data from Lake City Research Center, Lake City, MI. We included greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with enteric CH4, soil N2O and CH4 fluxes, alfalfa and mineral supplementation, and farm energy use. We also generated results from the LCA using the enteric emissions equations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We evaluated a range of potential rates of soil carbon (C) loss or gain of up to 3 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Enteric CH4 had the largest impact on total emissions, but this varied by grazing system. Enteric CH4 composed 62 and 66% of emissions for IRG and MOB, respectively, on a land basis. Both MOB and IRG were net GHG sources when SCS was not considered. Our partial LCA indicated that when SCS potential was included, each grazing strategy could be an overall sink. Sensitivity analyses indicated that soil in the MOB and IRG systems would need to sequester 1 and 2 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for a net zero GHG footprint, respectively. IPCC model estimates for enteric CH4 were similar to field estimates for the MOB system, but were higher for the IRG system, suggesting that 0.62 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) greater SCS would be needed to offset the animal emissions in this case.

Characterization of groundwater types and residence times in the Verlorenvlei catchment, South Africa to constrain recharge dynamics and hydrological resilience	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Verlorenvlei catchment on the west coast of South Africa is a semi-arid region that is growing progressively more reliant on groundwater due to increased variability in precipitation and increasing agricultural produc-tivity. The groundwater systems have been put under additional stress given the recent 2015-2017 El Nino similar to system that led to drought conditions along the west coast of South Africa. This increased reliance puts the natural environment and human dependence on groundwater into direct conflict. Groundwater was sampled for delta 18O, delta 2H, delta 13C, 14C, 3H and 3H/3He ratios in addition to cation and anion concentrations from seventeen production boreholes and two springs in the catchment. Residence times were estimated using tritium and radiocarbon, and in the case of the latter, the Pearson Model has been used to correct for possible carbonate dissolution. Hydrochemistry and residence times of groundwater in the Verlorenvlei catchment have successfully been used to distinguish between the primary-porosity alluvial aquifer, the secondary-porosity Malmesbury shale aquifer (MG) and the fractured rock aquifers associated with the Table Mountain Group (TMG). Ground-water mixing has been identified within the catchment and this plays an important role in the variation in groundwater chemistry and residence time between the aquifer systems. The discrepancy between the calculated radiocarbon and 3H/3He ages in the TMG and alluvial aquifers has been evaluated using a lumped parameter model that confirms that the TMG is strongly dominated by young groundwaters. Young 3H/3He residence times calculated for groundwater in the TMG (34-57 years) and alluvial aquifers (34-47 years) implies that these systems are most susceptible to reduced groundwater recharge. Given the interconnected nature of the aquifer systems, reduced recharge rates into the TMG aquifer will decrease groundwater flow to both the alluvial and MG aquifer and this will impact the long-term sustainability of the RAMSAR listed Verlorenvlei estuarine lake and wetlands at the catchment outlet. Future residence time studies should consider using a lumped parameter model (LPM) to calculate the age distribution of groundwater in these aquifers as this would provide additional insight into the sustainability of the groundwater systems.					; Watson, Andrew/ABE-3580-2020	Watson, Andrew/0000-0001-5998-6933; van Rooyen, Jared/0000-0002-0898-4791													0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2022	613		A						128280	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128280		SEP 2022											WOS:000862505600003

Intraspecific growth and functional leaf trait responses to natural soil resource gradients for conifer species with contrasting leaf habit	TREE PHYSIOLOGY												Interspecific relationships among species mean leaf traits, performance and species resource/climate distributions help provide the foundation for a predictive, functionally based plant ecology. Intraspecific responses of leaf traits and performance to resource gradients and how these vary among species may be equally important but have received less attention. Here, we examine relationships between proxies of soil resource availability, leaf traits and growth (height at 25 years, SI25) for winter deciduous Larix decidua Mill. and evergreen Pinus resinosa Ait. trees distributed over soil resource gradients in the Great Lakes region of North America. We predicted that (i) leaf trait responses to soil resources within species will be similar to reported distributions of mean leaf traits over soil resource gradients among species; (ii) soil resource-related variation in leaf traits can help explain SI25; and (iii) SI25 will be greater for Larix than Pinus at higher soil resources and greater for Pinus than Larix at lower soil resources and this pattern will be associated with species differences in leaf trait responses to soil resources. Among the measured leaf traits (live N, Mg, Ca, K, P, and Mn, litter N, N resorption, carbon isotope discrimination, specific leaf area, lifespan), soil resources only impacted live and litter N for both species and K for Pinus. In turn, only the leaf traits responsive to soil resources affected SI25 in the expected manner. Larix had greater SI25 than Pinus across soil resource gradients and both species had similar growth and leaf trait sensitivities to resources. In summary: (i) several leaf traits reported to be associated with performance and edaphic distributions across species were, within species, unresponsive to nitrogen and water availability and unrelated to growth; (ii) leaf N showed high plasticity to soil resources and this plasticity was functionally relevant to growth over its entire range of response; (iii) large species-level differences in leaf traits between Larix and Pinus did not translate into different leaf trait and growth responses to soil resources.																			0829-318X	1758-4469				MAR	2013	33	3					297	310		10.1093/treephys/tps134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tps134								23370548					WOS:000316751900008

The column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO (XCO) was observed to be similar to 150 ppb from 11:15 to 13:50 JST on 19 May, and peak aerosol optical depths (AODs) of 1.41 and 1.28 were observed at 15:40 JST 18 May and 11:20 JST 19 May, respectively. We used the HYSPLIT model to calculate five-day backward trajectories from Rikubetsu on May 18, 2016 at 2, 3 and 5 km altitude. The results show that the air parcels passed over the Siberian wildfires during 16-17 May. It was found that the high CO concentrations originated from forest fires were transported to the upper layers of Hokkaido. This will contribute to the understanding of the regional effects of air pollution in northern Japan due to air masses originating from forest fires. By combining these independent datasets such as AERONET aerosol optical thickness (AOT), MODIS fire data, and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) total CO columns, we confirmed that the lidar measurements of enhanced aerosol concentrations and FTS measurements of maximum XCO over Rikubetsu resulted from a persistent smoke plume transported from Siberian wildfires. Relatively large-scale forest fires have been frequently occurring in Siberia recently. However, the effects of CO and other gases released from them over northern Japan are not well known. We observed high concentrations of CO over the TCCON station in Rikubetsu, Japan, which we believe to be of forest fire origin. Therefore, we analyzed it as a case study to confirm its origin and impact on the upper atmosphere over northern Japan.					; Sakai, Tetsu/E-6014-2012; Morino, Isamu/K-1033-2014; Ohyama, Hirofumi/H-7333-2018	Ohyama, Hirofumi/0000-0003-2109-9874; Nagahama, Tomoo/0000-0001-7707-978X; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				APR 1	2023	322								121129	10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121129		FEB 2023						36682620					WOS:000935170100001

Estimating ethanol correction factors for δ13C and δ15N isotopic signatures of freshwater zooplankton from multiple lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												In freshwater systems, delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes can be used to differentiate between pelagic and littoral energy sources and to quantify trophic position. In these ecosystems, crustacean zooplankton are frequently used to characterize the pelagic baseline. Zooplankton samples are often preserved prior to processing and analysis, which can affect isotopic signatures. Variability in preservation effects across studies make it difficult to determine if and how to correct for preservation effects. Here, we develop a correction factor for ethanol preservation and present a flexible statistical method that can be updated with additional data to increase its applicability. We collected zooplankton from five lakes in Minnesota, USA encompassing wide isotopic ranges (delta C-13 from -37.23 parts per thousand to -23.96 parts per thousand; delta N-15 from 3.07 parts per thousand to 14.44 parts per thousand). Changes in zooplankton delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures were quantified using a Bayesian hierarchical model predicting fresh values from ethanol-preserved values. Ethanol preservation increased delta C-13 by a factor of 1.158 (95% CI 0.866-1.441) and had a negligible effect on delta N-15 (slope = 1.077; 95% CI 0.833-1.359). Lake-specific values did not differ from the overall relationship. K-fold and leave-one-out cross validation tests verified that both models were accurate; RMSE of predicted delta C-13 = 0.701 and RMSE of predicted delta N-15 = 0.590. Our correction factors could be applied to other systems in which baseline delta C-13 and delta N-15 values fall within the range of our study, and this approach also enables the inclusion of data from additional lakes to estimate new corrections.					; Hansen, Gretchen/ABE-3860-2022	Hansen, Gretchen/0000-0003-0241-7048; 													1541-5856					JUL	2024	22	7					464	472		10.1002/lom3.10623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10623		MAY 2024											WOS:001233346600001

These analyses, temporally synchronized with five radiocarbon ages, revealed environmental changes from marine to continental over the last similar to 7550 years. The studied sedimentary succession recorded the upward transition from estuarine channel (until similar to 7550 cal yr BP) to estuarine central basin (>similar to 7550 to similar to 5250 cal yr BP) deposits, the latter containing increased mangrove vegetation, marine and marine/brackish water diatoms. The range of geochemical values (delta C-13 = -30- -10 parts per thousand, delta N-15 = 2 - 8 parts per thousand, and C/N = 4-40) also indicate marine/ estuarine organic matter and C-3 terrestrial plants to that time interval. A following period recorded two phases: lake/ria (similar to 5250 to similar to 400 cal yr BP) and fluvial channel (similar to 400 cal yr BP until modern age). During this stage, mangroves were replaced by trees/shrubs and herbs/grasses due to the disconnection with the marine realm. As a result, the corresponding sediments contain only organic matter sourced from freshwater and C-3 terrestrial plants (delta C-13 = -29- -26%., delta N-15 = 0 - 8%. and C/N = 10-45). The equilibrium between fluvial sediment supply and relative sea-level changes during the Holocene controlled the morphologic and vegetation changes in the studied littoral. The estuary became established during the early Holocene as a resulted of a eustatic sea-level rise, when the fluvial sediment supply to the coast was relatively lower due to a dry period. However, during the late Holocene, the climatic force was more significant to the development of coastal morphology due to a wet period that caused an increase in sandy sediment supply to coastal system. Then, the increase of fluvial discharge associated to a relative sea-level fall caused a marine regression and shrinkage of Mangroves during the late Holocene. The evaluation of mangrove dynamics according to climatic and sea-level changes mainly during the late Holocene is essential for the understanding of their survival ability under future scenarios, with a probable accelerated sea-level rise and intensification of extreme climatic events in southeastern Brazil for the next century.

Therefore, studying the relationship between the eco-hydrological processes of this basin and its land cover changes is important for sustainability and environmental protection. In this research, trend analysis was used to determine water and climate changes, and satellite data and statistical analysis were used to calculate spatial and temporal changes in land cover. Based on the research findings, the flow of the Selenge River has exhibited fluctuations ranging from 125.2 to 576.3 m3/s over the past three decades, with a discernible downward trend observed in the basin area or at the Zuunburen hydrological station. This decline can be attributed to the combined effects of climate change and human activity. During the last 30 years of climate change in the Selenge River basin, the average annual air temperature has increased by 2.4 degrees C. The average total annual precipitation of the basin ranges from 200 to 400 mm, and the precipitation fluctuation is relatively small, and in recent years, less than average precipitation has fallen. In the basin, the air temperature has experienced an annual increase of 0.09 degrees C, attributable to natural climatic factors. Additionally, there has been a reduction in both precipitation levels and river flow within the basin, while significant alterations have occurred in the extent of water bodies and wetlands within the land cover. In this region, studies show that changes in eco-hydrological processes significantly impact changes in land cover.

Secular variations in magmatism during a continental arc to post-arc transition: Plio-Pleistocene volcanism in the Lake Tahoe/Truckee area, Northern Sierra Nevada, California	LITHOS												In the Lake Tahoe-Truckee River area of northeastern California, a suite of latest Pliocene to Pleistocene volcanic rocks, termed the Tahoe-Truckee volcanic field (TTVF), overlies Miocene to Pliocene volcanic rocks of the Ancestral Cascades arc. The lavas post-date the passage of the south edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate, and represent a secular transition from continental arc to post-arc volcanism associated with a slab window. Compared to the older arc volcanic rocks, TTVF lavas are small in volume, non-porphyritic, and mildly alkaline. TTVF lavas have a subduction signature in primitive mantle-normalized plots but, compared to the older arc rocks, are enriched in the light rare earth elements. Nb, and Ta, and depleted in the large ion lithophile elements. Isotopically. TTVF rocks overlap with Ancestral Cascade arc lavas, although most TTVF rocks fall at the high Sr-87/Sr-86-low Nd-143/Nd-144 end of the range of Ancestral Cascade compositions. Pb and oxygen isotope ratios overlap completely. Although the incompatible element systematics are consistent with increased importance of a within-plate mantle source component in the TTVF, the more radiogenic Sr and less radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions are not and require a source that is old. We propose that, like the Ancestral Cascades arc in this region, the post-arc lavas are primarily tapping a lithospheric mantle source, but for the TTVF, melting is triggered by asthenospheric upwelling around the south edge of the Juan de Fuca slab. TTVF lavas include a much lower proportion of melts from the (now, ex-) mantle wedge, since slab fluids are no longer supplied to the mantle beneath this region. The lithospheric mantle source in the TTVF may be similar chemically and mineralogically to that of the Big Pine volcanic field and Long Valley caldera in the Western Great Basin. This example of slab window volcanism is unusual in that the lavas are not melts of a mantle source that is more depleted in incompatible elements than the arc source. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	DeMoranville, C				DeMoranville, Carolyn			Cranberry Nutrient Management in Southeastern Massachusetts: Balancing Crop Production Needs and Water Quality	HORTTECHNOLOGY												The american cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) is a wetland plant native to North America. The plant is adapted to sandy, nutrient-poor, low pH soils and thus, like blueberry (Vaccinium sp.), its nutritional requirements are low compared with many other perennial fruit crops. Research conducted over the past 30 years has defined the annual requirements for nitrogen [N (20-60 lb/acre)], phosphorus [P (<20 lb/acre)], and potassium (40-120 lb/acre) based on tissue testing, plant growth demands, potential for remobilization, and determination of removal in the crop. These three nutrient elements are those most commonly applied to the crop in fertilizers. However, much of the work on nutrient rate requirements was conducted on native cultivars and there is an expectation that requirements of newer hybrid cultivars are greater. In Massachusetts, cranberries are grown in coastal watersheds and often depend on small lakes as their water source for irrigation, harvest, and winter flooding. Since cranberry production is heavily dependent on water use, the interaction of nutrient management and water management has become a primary focus area for research and extension, particularly for N and P, the nutrient elements most frequently associated with environmental pollution. Recent preliminary research examining cranberry farms with varied configurations (e.g., water passes through the bog and exits via a long channel, water recirculates back into the supply water body) has indicated that the cranberry bogs may act as either a source or sink for N depending on configuration and management activities. In a study of cranberry farms where P use was reduced to an average of <10 lb/acre, P concentration in harvest flood water declined by as much as 85% while crop production was sustained. Site variation in output of N and P in cranberry drainage and flood waters indicates the need for further research into the variables that control these processes, including soil types, site hydrology, nutrient application rates and forms, and water-management activities.																			1063-0198	1943-7714				AUG	2015	25	4					471	476		10.21273/HORTTECH.25.4.471	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.25.4.471													WOS:000361422100007

Nest-site selection by cinnamon teal and other ground-nesting ducks in Great Salt Lake wetlands	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Ground-nesting ducks can reduce nest depredation by selecting nest sites where local physical structures or vegetation provide olfactory or visual concealment. We evaluated nest-site selection by comparing duck nests to random sites during 2019 and 2020 in the impounded wetlands of Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, USA. During wet springs, most of the wetlands are underwater, leaving only the dams available as nesting substrate. We located the nests of 399 cinnamon teal (Spatula cyanoptera), 137 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and 162 gadwalls (Mareca strepera) on the dams. At nest and random sites, we measured overhead concealment, lateral concealment, average height of vegetation in the nest patch, standard deviation of vegetation height in the nest patch, tallest vegetation within 1 m of nest, dam width, and distance from the nest to the road along the center of the dam. We found that mallards and gadwalls did not select for any of these characteristics. Cinnamon teal selected for nest sites that had more overhead concealment. We also found mixed evidence that cinnamon teal selected nest sites where dams were wider. All species also favored heterogeneous patches of vegetation for nesting over homogenous ones. Duck nests had a clumped distribution in wetlands that contained colonies of American avocets (Recurvirostra americana), black-necked stilts (Himantopus mexicanus), and common terns (Sterna hirundo), with nests located inside the colonies, but showed a random distribution in other wetlands. Prior to 1980, approximately half of the world's population of cinnamon teal nested in GSL wetlands, but since that time the nesting population has declined greatly. Given this decline, management actions should be conducted that will improve overhead cover and widen dikes within the species' nesting habitat.

Processes ranging from melt generation to final crystallization have been invoked to play a key role in the enrichment of HFSEs in magmatic-hydrothermal systems, yet the importance of crystal-liquid fractionation, liquid immiscibility, and/or fluid unmixing remains debated. Here, we present results of a study of granites and HFSE-mineralized glimmerites from the granitic Suzhou pluton, eastern China. We provide whole-rock major and trace element compositions, a description of mineral assemblages, and a detailed description of zircon textures, zircon Raman spectra, zircon major and trace element and delta O-18 compositions, and U-Pb ages. The granites and glimmerites have been dated at similar to 126 to 124 Ma and are thus coeval. The granites range from biotite and zircon poor to biotite and zircon rich and are in contact with glimmerites. The glimmerites form lenses and layers close to and along the margin of the Suzhou granite, comprising up to similar to 37 vol % biotite and up to similar to 2 vol % zircon and other HFSE-rich accessory minerals. The biotite-poor granites contain a single type of zircon (type-A: single crystals, oscillatory zoned, fully crystallized structure, relatively poor in trace elements, and relatively high delta O-18), whereas the biotite-rich granites and the glimmerites contain two zircon types (type-A crystals: same features as in the biotite-poor granites; type-B crystals: clustered, unzoned, partially metamict structure, rich in trace elements, and relatively low d18O). Both granite types are Si, Al, and Na rich, whereas the glimmerites are Fe, Ti, Mn, Mg, Ca, P, F, and HFSE rich and, compositionally, fall off simple fractionation trends. We interpret the textural, mineralogical, and compositional relationships to indicate that the glimmer-ites are the products of Fe-, F-, and HFSE-rich immiscible melts that unmixed from an alkali-rich, moderately reducing (similar to QFM + 0.5 and similar to QFM + 1.0; QFM = quartz-fayalite-magnetite buffer) Suzhou magma system at low crustal pressure. In addition, we note that the zircon textures and compositions are important recorders of the processes and conditions that led to the HFSE mineralization.					wang, ru/NRZ-0827-2025														0361-0128	1554-0774				JAN	2023	118	1					157	176		10.5382/econgeo.4965	http://dx.doi.org/10.5382/econgeo.4965													WOS:000936153300007
J	Abuduwaili, J; Zhang, ZY; Jiang, FQ				Abuduwaili, Jilili; Zhang, Zhao Yong; Jiang, Feng Qing			Assessment of the Distribution, Sources and Potential Ecological Risk of Heavy Metals in the Dry Surface Sediment of Aibi Lake in Northwest China	PLOS ONE												The distribution, sources and potential ecological risk of heavy metals in the sediment of lakes in eastern China and other areas of the world that have undergone rapid economic development have been widely researched by scholars. However, this is not true for heavy metals in the sediment of rump lakes in the arid regions of China and world-wide. Because of this, we chose Aibi Lake to serve as a typical rump lake in an oasis in an arid area in northwest China for our study. Sediment samples were collected from the lake and then the quantities of the heavy metals Pb, Ni, Cd, Cu, Zn, Hg and Cr were measured. Then using a variety of statistical methods, we analyzed the distribution, sources, pollution status and the potential ecological risk of these metals. The results show that: (1) The amounts of the seven heavy metals all fell within the Second Soil National Standard, but the average and maximum values were all higher than the background values of Xinjiang in northwest China. (2) Multivariate statistical analysis determined that the Cd, Pb, Hg and Zn in the sediment were mainly derived from man-sources, and Cu, Ni, and Cr were mainly from the natural geological background. (3) Enrichment factor analysis and the geo-accumulation index evaluation method show that Cd, Hg and Pb in the surface sediment of the Aibi Lake were at low and partial pollution levels, while Zn, Cr, Ni and Cu were at no and low pollution levels. (4) Calculation of the potential ecological hazards index found that, among the seven tested heavy metals, Cd, Hg and Pb were the main potential ecological risk factors, and the contribution of each was 42.6%, 28.6%, and 24.0%, respectively. Cd is the main potential ecological risk factor, followed by Hg and Pb. This work revealed that recent economic development of the Aibi Lake Basin has negatively influenced the accumulation of heavy metals in the sediments of the lake, and, therefore, we should pay increasing attention to this problem and take effective measures to protect the ecology of the Aibi Lake Basin. This work can provide a scientific basis for an early warning of heavy metal pollution and for protection of the environment. Furthermore, it can serve as a reference when creating policies for the economic development in Aibi Lake Basin and environmental protection of rump lakes in arid regions of northwest China and other areas of the world.						ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554													1932-6203					MAR 17	2015	10	3							e0120001	10.1371/journal.pone.0120001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0120001								25781032					WOS:000351284600117
J	Petrin, Z; Laudon, H; Malmquist, B				Petrin, Zlatko; Laudon, Hjalmar; Malmquist, Bjoern			Diverging effects of anthropogenic acidification and natural acidity on community structure in Swedish streams	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenic acidification caused by aerial deposition of acidifying substances is known to have detrimental effects on freshwater biota, including reductions in species diversity and ecosystem functioning. However, such impairment is not found in systems acidified to a similar extent by natural processes. A proposed explanation for this difference is that freshwater organisms have had far more time to evolve and adapt to natural than anthropogenic acidification. Thus, where acidity is natural, adaptation may account for diverse and functional communities. Here, we investigated whether adaptations-that were previously implied to occur on small spatial scales-may explain the species richness patterns on a much larger geographical scale, apply to ecological functioning, and are relevant in Sweden, where natural acidity is geologically relatively recent. Therefore, we compared differences in species diversity and ecosystem process rates between 24 acidic and circumneutral streams in northern Sweden, where acidity is natural, and southern Sweden, where acidity is largely anthropogenic. In agreement with our predictions, the difference in macroinvertebrate species richness between acidic and circumneutral streams was threefold larger in the region where acidity was anthropogenic than where it was natural, albeit marginally non-significantly. In contrast, no such trend was found for the rates of decomposition by microbes and leaf-feeding macroinvertebrates, possibly due to functional redundancy. The structure of species assemblages differed between acidic and circumneutral sites and between the regions. Our results agree with the notion that freshwater biota are adapted to natural acidity, but competing explanations including other differences in water chemistry and differences in the biogeographical colonization histories may also account for part of the observed patterns. Since naturally acidic environments similar to those in northern Sweden are widespread, we predict that diverse and functionally efficient freshwater communities that are well adapted to such conditions are more common than currently recognized.

J	Wolin, JA; Stoermer, EF				Wolin, JA; Stoermer, EF			Response of a Lake Michigan coastal lake to anthropogenic catchment disturbance	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A paleolimnological investigation of post-European sediments in a Lake Michigan coastal lake was used to examine the response of Lower Herring Lake to anthropogenic impacts and its role as a processor of watershed inputs. We also compare the timing of this response with that of Lake Michigan to examine the role of marginal lakes as 'early warning' indicators of potential changes in the larger connected system and their role in buffering Lake Michigan against anthropogenic changes through biotic interactions and material trapping. Sediment geochemistry, siliceous microfossils and nutrient-related morphological changes in diatoms, identified three major trophic periods in the recent history of the lake. During deforestation and early settlement (pre-1845-1920), lake response to catchment disturbances results in localized increases in diatom abundances with minor changes in existing communities. In this early phase of disturbance, Lower Herring Lake acts as a sediment sink and a biological processor of nutrient inputs. During low-lake levels of the 1930s, the lake goes through a transitional period characterized by increased primary productivity and a major shift in diatom communities. Post-World War II (late 1940s-1989) anthropogenic disturbances push Lower Herring Lake to a new state and a permanent change in diatom community structure dominated by Cyclotella comensis. The dominance of planktonic summer diatom species associated with the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) is attributed to epilimnetic nutrient depletion. Declining Si:P ratios are inferred from increased sediment storage of biogenic silica and morphological changes in the silica content of Aidacoseira ambigua and Stephanodiscus niagarae. Beginning in the late 1940s, Lower Herring Lake functions as a biogeochemical processor of catchment inputs and a carbon, nutrient and silica sink. Microfossil response to increased nutrients and increased storage of biogenic silica in Lower Herring Lake and other regional embayments occur approximately 20-25 years earlier than in a nearby Lake Michigan site. Results from this study provide evidence for the role of marginal lakes and bays as nutrient buffering systems, delaying the impact of anthropogenic activities on the larger Lake Michigan system.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2005	33	1					73	94		10.1007/s10933-004-1688-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-004-1688-2													WOS:000227474400005

Samples were collected from just below the surface at mid-river or in the tailraces below hydro-electric dams. Parameters measured included bacterial numbers (direct counts), heterotrophic potential (Vmax), ATP, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and concentrations of N and P compounds. Bacterial populations per milliliter fluctuated 3-fold (6.4-19.4 .times. 105) along the Waikato River and were lower and more consistent in the 2 South Island rivers (1.46-2.55 .times. 105). In contrast, Vmax varied 5000-fold in the Waikato River, from a characteristically oligotrophic value of 0.0035 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1 .cntdot. h-1 (Lake Taupo outlet) to a eutrophic value of 18.4 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1 .cntdot. h-1 at the Mihi bridge. Vmax for the 2 South Island rivers ranged from 0.0091-0.189 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1 .cntdot. h-1. ATP, Chl a, Kjeldahl N, nitrate N, and total P concentrations for the 20 sites on the Waikato River varied in a similar way to the Vmax and bacterial data. There were large peaks at the Mihi bridge, lower values for the dam tailraces and significant increases for the sites below Hamilton. Concentrations for these parameters were lower and more consistent along the lengths of the 2 South Island rivers. Most parameters were significantly correlated with each other for the Waikato River samples. The strongest correlations were between Vmax and bacterial numbers and between Vmax and nitrate N. In the Maitai and Wakapuaka River series these correlations were also significant, but the only other significant correlations recorded there were between ATP and nitrate N, and between ATP and bacterial numbers.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1978	12	4					415	427		10.1080/00288330.1978.9515769	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1978.9515769													WOS:A1978GV95100013

Water quality and wetland vegetation responses to water level variations in a university stormwater reuse reservoir: Nature-based approaches to campus water sustainability	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In response to climate-driven water shortages, Duke University in 2014 constructed a water reuse reservoir and wetland complex (Pond) to capture urban stormwater and recycle water to provide campus cooling and reduce downstream loading of nutrients and sediment into Jordan Lake, a regional water supply. We postulated that even with significant water level changes due to withdrawals, the Pond would function to reduce downstream nutrients and sediment once wetland plants became established in the littoral zone. Throughout the project (2015-2021), baseflow nutrient concentrations downstream decreased, with Unfiltered Total Nitrogen (UTN) falling by 44 % and Unfiltered Total Phosphorus (UTP) by 50 %. Storm mean concentrations decreased by 31 % for UTN, 54 % for UTP, and 72 % for Total Suspended Solids (TSS). The annual reductions in mass fluxes (UTN, UTP, and TSS) were between 58 and 85 % across a range of storm intensities. Regardless of water level, temperature, pH, and oxygen concentrations downstream were not significantly changed. Between 2015 and 2020, a littoral survey of planted and naturally introduced species showed that wetter years resulted in a greater number of species across a gradient of three inundation zones (i.e., moist, wet, and aquatic). Conversely, dryer years resulted in fewer species across overlapping zones. The dominant plants that successfully colonized the Pond are all obligate wetland species despite the Pond's highly variable water depths and periods of inundation. The final plant populations were dominated by invasive native species supporting the self-design theory of plant succession as nearly half of the original planted species died. The reuse Pond design (pond-wetland complex) showed the capability of using stormwater runoff for campus cooling while improving water quality services and providing habitat for wetland plants. Thus, campuses with watershed runoff capture capability should consider a nature-based recycling approach as part of their water sustainability program.

Rapid melting began in the late 1960s in a few isolated melt ponds in the centre and in a small elongated lakelet at the eastern lateral moraine. These ponds and lakes grew rapidly in size during the 1970s and coalesced to form a large melt lake by about 1990. This melting has led to a disintegration of the entire terminus region, and now occurs as far as 3 km upstream from the old terminus. The main front of the glacier has retreated c. 1.5 km since 1982. The breaking up of the glacier has been accelerated by the onset of iceberg calving-a process which probably started in 1991. The icebergs can have volumes of several millions of cubic metres before they break up into smaller ice masses that melt slowly during the summer. A temperature survey has shown that the melt lake is almost isothermal (0.3-0.5 degrees C). A poorly understood convection mechanism prevents suspended silt from settling and causes the uniform grey colour of the lake (here called ''Tasman Lake''). Gravity surveys in 1971/72 and in 1982 revealed that the average thickness of the glacier was between 150 and 200 m over the large (almost 2 km(2)) area now occupied by the melt lake. The bottom level of the glacier was close to 600 m a.s.l.; this level has been confirmed by recent radar soundings and bathymetric surveys. The present lake level stands at 727 m a.s.l. The surveys demonstrate how the terminus region of the largest New Zealand glacier has disintegrated over the past 22 years.					; Nobes, David/AAC-6539-2021	Nobes, David/0000-0002-0344-7890; 													0028-8306					MAR	1995	38	1					1	16		10.1080/00288306.1995.9514635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.1995.9514635													WOS:A1995RQ51200001
J	ASSOULINE, S; MAHRER, Y				ASSOULINE, S; MAHRER, Y			EVAPORATION FROM LAKE KINNERET .1. EDDY-CORRELATION SYSTEM MEASUREMENTS AND ENERGY BUDGET ESTIMATES	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Evaporation rates over Lake Kinneret were directly and continuously measured by means of the eddy correlation system (ECS) for the relatively long periods of 20 and 44 days at the beginning and end of the summer (first and second periods), respectively. Results clearly show that wind speed and stability of thermal stratification over the water surface strongly affect evaporation from the lake. Consequently, large differences in measured daily evaporation rates were apparent during both periods. Evaporation rates, estimated by the energy budget method (EBM) were compared with the corresponding values measured directly by the ECS. Large differences were found between the estimated hourly evaporation rates and the measured ones, in both the values and the timing of maximal rates. In addition, the EBM calculated negative nocturnal evaporation rates, while the ECS measured positive values. Differences between estimated and measured evaporation rates monitored on a daily basis were also noted. The differences were larger for the first period, characterized by sharav events denoting climatic instability. High evaporation rates resulting from strong winds were not depicted by EBM estimates. The distributions of hourly evaporation rates over a 24 hour period or of the daily rates over an entire period as estimated by the EBM were very similar to those of net radiation, while corresponding distributions resulting from ECS measurements were very similar to those of wind speed. The daily average evaporation rate for the first period, calculated by the EBM, was smaller than the corresponding value resulting from ECS measurements. When applied on a hourly basis, the EBM gave a much more similar estimate. For the second period, there were no significant differences between the daily average based on the computed values (for both daily and hourly intervals) and the corresponding average based on the measured ones.																			0043-1397					APR	1993	29	4					901	910		10.1029/92WR02432	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/92WR02432													WOS:A1993KW17800012
J	WILSON, BL; SALEH, MA				WILSON, BL; SALEH, MA			A PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL-ANALYSIS OF EGYPTS WADI EL-RAIYAN MAN-MADE LAKES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Detailed physical and chemical analyses of selected sites in and around two Wadi El-Raiyan lakes in the El-Faiyum Province of Egypt were conducted over a two-year period. The man-made lakes were created in early 1973 as a reservoir for agricultural irrigation drainage water. The water created a surface area of about 200 square kilometers in a depressed area in the western desert of Egypt, and the evaporation coupled with very low precipitation has led to a rapid increase in salinity and trace metal content. The salinity was 0.5 g/L (ppt) at the water inputs the lakes coming from the tunnel of Wadi El-Raiyan and then increased gradually to about 1.0 ppt in the first lake and to an average of 2.0 in the second lake. Salinity of the water springs were constant, however, salinity of the seepage area increased dramatically to 7 ppt. Water pH was very much the same throughout the lakes being neutral to slightly basic (7.8 - 8.8). Heavy metals concentration in water was very low, much below the recommended levels for general uses and below the permissible values for public water supplies. Dissolved oxygen in the lakes varied from 6.2 to 11 mg/L (ppm) depending on station locations and depth. Ammonium nitrogen varied from 0.02 to 0.05 ppm. The dissolved oxygen and ammonium concentration in water were found to be suitable for fish production. Therefore, the water may be classified as salmonoid water. Nitrite, sulfide, phosphate and thiocyanate concentration was very low, halides concentration was moderately high and sulfate concentration was very high ranged from 515 to 1285 ppm. No arsenates were detected in any of the samples.																			1093-4529	1532-4117					1990	25	7					775	784		10.1080/10934529009375597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529009375597													WOS:A1990EL04000006
J	Baranskaya, AV				Baranskaya, A. V.			The Russian Part of the Baltic Crystalline Shield: Recent Uplift of One of the Earth's Most Ancient Massives	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												A general overview of the landforms of the Baltic crystalline shield was made; geologic, tectonic and geomorphological processes which created the modern landscapes were analyzed. The Baltic crystalline shield, composed by Archaean and Proterozoic rocks, is among the most ancient massives on Earth. It has seen numerous periods of tectonic activation, folding and faulting since the Precambrian time, which left numerous veins and intrusions with extreme diversity of minerals. In the Neotectonic time, the existing faults were re-activated and new ones were set, resulting in intense movements of crustal blocks. During the Quaternary, the Baltic shield was covered by ice sheets for several times. The ice left numerous moraines, glacial striae and fluvioglacial landforms. The last glaciation ended by 10-11 ka, and uplift of the Earth's crust driven by glacioisostatic adjustment (GIA) started. The rates of this uplift exceeded the eustatic rise of the World Ocean from meltwater input. Because of this, the eastern part of the Russian territory within the Baltic Shield experience a relative sea level (RSL) fall in the Holocene. Although the general uplift of the Earth-s crust in the last millennia was GIA-driven, local tectonic block movements of the Earth's crust were imposed on this general uplift, creating scatter in the RSL data. Such movements along major faults left numerous traces of ancient earthquakes. The combination of ancient resistant intrusive and metamorphic rocks, long-term uplift, past glaciations and high tides of the White Sea created the unique landscapes of the Baltic Shield with its rocky benches, skerries and sheepback rocks, meromictic lakes in former sea gulf which will later become isolation basins, series of uplifted coastal bars of well-rounded boulders and large tidal flats with boulders displaced by sea ice.

J	Swihart, GH; Carpenter, SB; Xiao, Y; McBay, EH; Smith, DH; Xia, YK				Swihart, George H.; Carpenter, Steven B.; Xiao, Yun; McBay, Eddie H.; Smith, David H.; Xia, Yingkai			A Boron Isotope Study of the Furnace Creek, California, Borate District	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY												About a third of the approximately 30 known deposits in the Furnace Creek, California, borate district reveal mineralogical zoning of borates. The deposits feature an Na-Ca borate (ulexite and/or probertite) inner zone (or zones) surrounded by Ca borate (colemanite). The remaining deposits consist essentially of colemanite. Investigators have debated the origin of the mineralogical zoning and the relationship, if any, between the zoned and colemanite-only deposits. The Ca and Na-Ca borate zoning has been characterized as either primary or formed by postdepositional alteration. Boron isotope analysis was applied to drill core samples from two zoned deposits, one non-zoned deposit, and selected samples from six other deposits accessed from surface and subsurface mine workings. Probertite samples from the inner regions of two zoned deposits yield delta B-11 values near 5 parts per thousand, whereas most colemanite samples from both zoned and non-zoned deposits yield results near -1 parts per thousand. The small delta B-11 range of most of the colemanite samples and their distribution from a grouping near 0 parts per thousand to isotopically lighter values suggest a pattern formed by alteration from a common initial value. Based on the new isotopic data and existing sedimentologic and stratigraphic knowledge of the Furnace Creek borate deposits, it is proposed that the isotopically heavier boron of probertite in the inner zone of zoned deposits reflects the composition of the ancestral lake and its springs during an early stage of deposition of the laminated series of the Furnace Creek Formation. Furthermore, the isotopically lighter B of colemanite in zoned deposits reflects the alteration of earlier formed Na-Ca borate deposits by downward migrating lake water at a later stage of deposition of the laminated series. Some non-zoned Ca borate deposits may have been precipitated directly during the later stages.					smith, douglas/A-1321-2007														0361-0128	1554-0774				MAY	2014	109	3					567	580		10.2113/econgeo.109.3.567	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/econgeo.109.3.567													WOS:000332681400002

Based on FengYun (FY) meteorological satellite datasets, the atmospheric circulation, the evolution of the sea-effect clouds, and the marine and atmospheric environments are examined. The results show that the temperature anomalies at 850 hPa from the polar regions to East Asia and the Northwest Pacific exhibited a "positive-negative-positive" pattern in early December, which is in favor of the polar vortex moving away from the polar region to lower latitudes causing cold waves. Caused by the northerly winds over the ocean the sea-effect snowstorm cloud systems exhibit as a wide range of cellular cumulus moving towards the land. The weakening wind speed is beneficial for the maintaining of the sea-effect snowstorm. The average cloud top temperature (CTT) of sea-effect snowstorm clouds over the Shandong Peninsula is from -18 degrees C to -10 degrees C, and the cloud top height (CTH) is about 1.5 km, showing significant differences from that of the cold front snowstorm clouds. The precipitation rate from FY-3G precipitation measurement radar (PMR) shows that the precipitation top of the cellular cumulus in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea is 2.0 - 2.5 km, and the maximum precipitation rate is 0.5 - 1.0 mm h-1. The high sea surface temperature (SST) provides warm and humid conditions for the cellular cumulus. The colder air moving into warmer and more humid sea surface can result in higher development of cellular cumulus and increasing precipitation rate. The overall performance is characterized by Peninsula. Additionally, the topography has impact on the distribution and intensity of sea-effect snowstorm.																			0026-1165	2186-9057				DEC	2024	102	6					633	653		10.2151/jmsj.2024-033	http://dx.doi.org/10.2151/jmsj.2024-033													WOS:001343592600002
J	Shi, YJ; Li, WB; Guo, X				Shi, Yujiao; Li, Wenbao; Guo, Xin			Composition, interaction networks, and nitrogen metabolism patterns of bacterioplankton communities in a grassland type Lake: a case of Hulun Lake, China	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The composition of bacterial communities in freshwater ecosystems is influenced by numerous factors including environmental conditions and biological interactions. In grassland inland closed lakes, factors affecting lake ecosystems are either exogenous or endogenous, contributing to the formation of distinct habitats in the surface and bottom waters of the bacterial communities. However, the extent to which environmental factors selectively shape the bacterial communities in aquatic systems remains unclear. Therefore, we sampled the surface, middle, and bottom waters at 13 sampling points in each layer. High-throughput sequencing techniques were employed to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the bacterial community structure during summer in Hulun Lake, the largest grassland-type lake in Inner Mongolia, China, to determine the microbial community dynamics and symbiosis patterns under different habitat conditions. Our results revealed a decrease in the diversity and heterogeneity of the bacterioplankton community, influenced by changes in the environment from exogenous inputs to endogenous releases. Furthermore, this alteration in community structure was concomitant with enhanced co-occurrences among microorganisms in the bottom water layers. This finding suggests that endogenous release promotes heightened symbiotic interactions, thereby facilitating the development of more complex modular structures. Symbiotic networks in different layers were differentiated by key species, with the ecological clustering modules of these species demonstrating dissimilar environmental preferences. The microbial communities were highly habitat-specific, mimicking responses to total nitrogen (TN) in the surface layer, pH in the middle layer, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the bottom layer. Bacterioplankton functions were assessed using Tax4Fun, indicating exogenous inputs and endogenous release increased the relative abundance of genes with nitrogen-fixing and nitrification potential nitrogen metabolism functions in surface and bottom waters, respectively. With Planctomycetota and Proteobacteria phyla as potential key groups for regulating nitrogen metabolic processes, Proteobacteria may facilitate the depletion of nitrate in surface and bottom waters, while the close contact of surface waters with the atmosphere accelerated Planctomycetota-dominated nitrogen fixation into the lake. Our findings contribute to the understanding of vertical microbial diversity and its network patterns in grassland type lakes, underscoring the potential role of environmental factors (exogenous inputs and endogenous releases) in bacterioplankton community formation.																				1664-302X				NOV 22	2023	14								1305345	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1305345	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1305345								38075882					WOS:001115139400001
J	Holliday, VT				Holliday, VT			Folsom drought and episodic drying on the Southern High Plains from 10,900-10,200 14C yr BP	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The paleoenvironments of late Pleistocene and early Holocene time on the Southern High Plains have been studied for decades, but regionally extensive or long-term, easily recoverable proxy climate indicators are difficult to find. The stratigraphy of valley fill and upland eolian deposits and stable-carbon isotope data, in addition to geographically limited paleontological data, now provide clues to the environment during this time, which includes the earliest, or Paleoindian period (similar to 11,200-8000 C-14 yr B.P.) of human occupation. During the Clovis occupation (similar to 11,200-10,900 C-14 yr B.P.), valleys contained perennial streams. This was followed in Folsom time (10,900-10,200 C-14 yr B.P.) by an abrupt change to lakes and ponds (with water levels fluctuating between several meters depth and no surface water) and marshes and accumulation of sheet sands on uplands, starting the earliest phase of construction of the regional dune fields. These changing conditions indicate a shift from relatively wetter to relatively drier conditions with episodic drought. Stable-C isotopes further indicate that warming characterized the Clovis-Folsom transition. During the rest of the Paleoindian period the environment was relatively cool but fluctuated between wetter and drier conditions with an overall trend toward drying that resulted in further enlargement of the dune fields and culminated in the warm, dry Altithermal beginning similar to 8000 C-14 yr B.P. Clovis time probably was the wettest of any Paleoindian period in terms of runoff and spring discharge. The Folsom period was drier and was the earliest episode of regional wind erosion and eolian deposition and may have been the warmest of Paleoindian times. Evidence of a previously hypothesized "Clovis drought" in this region is sparse.

While inland lakes are unlikely to form storm deposits because of their limited width and water temperature. The Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation in the Sichuan Basin is a set of coal-bearing, clastic sequences with dominant sedimentary facies varying from braided river delta to lacustrine settings, with storm deposits widely reported. In the Zilanba of Guanyuan area, in situ tree trunks on a palaeosol surface in Member V of the Xujiahe Formation provide new evidence of a storm event. Six fallen-down directions of nine in situ tree trunks were predominant in the NW direction, contrary to the palaeocurrent direction of the underlying strata, suggesting that the southeasterlies prevailed during the end-Triassic in the northern Sichuan Basin. Massive mud clasts were frequently recorded in sandstones of the Xujiahe Formation, as well as in the Xindianzi section. These mud clasts showed a rip-up or a plastic deformation with upside-down V-shapes, were capped on an erosional surface, showed no transport traces and were therefore interpreted as a storm lag deposit. The megamonsoonal climate prevailed during the Late Triassic, although the megamonsoons themselves could not generate a storm deposition in the Xujiahe Formation due to its low maximum surface wind speed. The driving mechanism for generating storm deposits in the Xujiahe Formation is suggested to be tropical cyclones over the Tethys Ocean moving eastward, further landfalling on the western margin of the Sichuan Basin. Statistics of storm events in the circum-Tethys region show a widespread storm surge in low latitudes during the end-Triassic. The storm deposits at the top of the Xujiahe Formation represent a sedimentary response to the end-Triassic hyperthermal event.

Sonic transmitters were surgically implanted in 37 adult white crappies (265-327 mm, total length; 315-530 g) at intervals from 10 April through 22 September 1992. From 15 April to 15 October, 1,712 locations were recorded for 34 of these fish. Movement (m/h; measured along the straight-line distance between successive locations) was significantly different among months (P < 0.05). Movement was highest in May (102.1 m/h) and significantly different from movements in April and June. The second highest amount of movement was in July (82.4 m/h). Other than in early spring, movement did not vary significantly among months. Depth of lake at white crappie locations differed significantly among months. White crappies were in significantly shallower lake areas in June and October than in August. Distance from shore differed,significantly among months. White crappies were nearest to shore in April, June, and October and farthest from shore in August. Home range varied from less than 0.1 to 85.0 hectares with a median of 15.8 hectares and differed significantly among months. Movement differed significantly among diel periods for May, June, and August. Depth of lake at fish location was significantly different among diel periods for April, May, June, and September. Distance from shore differed significantly among diel periods for all months except July and October. For diel comparisons yielding no significant differences, power (1 - beta) values were low (less than or equal to 0.51). We found weak relationships between environmental variables and movement. Although there have been few biotelemetry studies of crappies, it appears that the major monthly and diel movements are similar between species and among various water bodies where these fish have been studied. Minor differences in movement were observed but are likely related to lake morphology and geographic location.

Spatially explicit analysis of gastropod biodiversity in ancient Lake Ohrid	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The quality of spatial analyses of biodiversity is improved by (i) utilizing study areas with well defined physiogeographical boundaries, (ii) limiting the impact of widespread species, and (iii) using taxa with heterogeneous distributions. These conditions are typically met by ecosystems such as oceanic islands or ancient lakes and their biota. While research on ancient lakes has contributed significantly to our understanding of evolutionary processes, statistically sound studies of spatial variation of extant biodiversity have been hampered by the frequently vast size of ancient lakes, their limited accessibility, and the lack of scientific infrastructure. The European ancient Lake Ohrid provides a rare opportunity for such a reliable spatial study. The comprehensive horizontal and vertical sampling of a species-rich taxon, the Gastropoda, presented here, revealed interesting patterns of biodiversity, which, in part, have not been shown before for other ancient lakes. In a total of 284 samples from 224 different locations throughout the Ohrid Basin, 68 gastropod species, with 50 of them (= 73.5%) being endemic, could be reported. The spatial distribution of these species shows the following characteristics: (i) within Lake Ohrid, the most frequent species are endemic taxa with a wide depth range, (ii) widespread species (i. e. those occurring throughout the Balkans or beyond) are rare and mainly occur in the upper layer of the lake, (iii) while the total number of species decreases with water depth, the proportion of endemics increases, and (iv) the deeper layers of Lake Ohrid appear to have a higher spatial homogeneity of biodiversity. Moreover, gastropod communities of Lake Ohrid and its feeder springs are both distinct from each other and from the surrounding waters. The analysis also shows that community similarity of Lake Ohrid is mainly driven by niche processes (e. g. environmental factors), but also by neutral processes (e. g. dispersal limitation and evolutionary histories of species). For niche-based mechanisms it is shown that large scale effects such as type of water body or water depth are mainly responsible for the similarity of gastropod communities, whereas small scale effects like environmental gradients affect gastropod compositions only marginally. In fact, neutral processes appear to be more important than the small scale environmental factors, thus emphasizing the importance of dispersal capacities and evolutionary histories of species.					; Wilke, Thomas/G-1517-2012; Birkhofer, Klaus/AAA-2374-2021	Wilke, Thomas/0000-0001-8263-7758; Hauffe, Torsten/0000-0001-5711-9457; Birkhofer, Klaus/0000-0002-9301-2443; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2011	8	1					175	188		10.5194/bg-8-175-2011	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-8-175-2011													WOS:000286722500013

In the Camargue (southern France), most invertebrates inhabiting temporary shallow oligohaline marshes and pools are large-bodied, conspicuous and defenceless taxa that are restricted to fish-free environments. Management practices, by creating drainage canals, strongly affect the invertebrate community by allowing colonization by fish. 2. Sticklebacks colonizing the study pool were sampled daily and zooplankton sampling was carried out at weekly intervals. From early October until the pool dried in June, 1365 sticklebacks entered and only 139 stickleback's fry and seven adults left the pool. Zooplankton abundance was high during the whole study period with a mean density of 1360 ind. 100 cm-2. Larger forms (Daphnia magna, Simocephalus vetulus, Arctodiaptomus wierzejskii) quickly disappeared after the first wave of sticklebacks entered the pool in November. Subsequently, smaller species (Diacyclops bicuspidatus odessanus, Chydorus sphaericus and ostracods) replaced the larger ones until the pool dried. 3. Food selectivity of sticklebacks and daily zooplankton consumption were investigated under experimental conditions within the pool in spring. After introduction of sticklebacks, densities of zooplankton species dropped quickly (D. b. odessanus, C. sphaericus) with the exception of Ostracoda. Estimates of daily zooplankton consumption by adult sticklebacks varied between 2.8 and 10.7% of fish body weight. Examination of gut contents showed that fry mainly ingested Chydorus sphaericus. 4. Given that the stickleback is an annual species in the Camargue, and that few fry are able to leave the pool due to the early drying out, the colonization of such a former fish-free pool is not beneficial for the stickleback population. However, a more serious effect of such colonization is the progressive local extinction of the most typical zooplankton species inhabiting these formerly fish-free environments.						pont, Didier/0000-0001-5187-0135													0046-5070					OCT	1991	26	2					149	163		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb01725.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb01725.x													WOS:A1991GQ11500001

There have been 81 taxonomic entities (species, varieties and doubtful records), distributed among 21 genera recorded for the vast Indian sub-continent. Species distribution among the 21 genera are as follows: Audouinella-12; Balliopsis-1; Batrachospermum-11; Bosttychia-7; Caloglossa-8; Catenella-3; Chroodactvlon (including Asterocytis)-2; Chroothece-1; Compsopogon-8, Compsopogonopsis-1; Hildenbrandia-1; Kumanoa-7; Kyliniella-1; Lemanea-6; Nothocladus-1; Polysiphonia-1; Porphyridium-1; Sheathia-1; Sirodotia-4; Thorea-2; and Tuomeya-2. Of the seven currently recognized classes of Rhodophyta, no members of Bangiophyceae, Cyaniodiophyceae, or Rhodellophyceae are recorded from India. For each taxon, the following information is provided: (i) valid and currently accepted binomial (ii) synonyms as applicable to Indian records (iii) references with distribution in India and (iv) brief notes. Descriptions of new species based on Indian collections (holotypes) are indicated and some new combinations were made, when necessary. Several generic records (e.g., Balliopsis, Hildenbrandia, Kvliniella, Nothocladus and Tuomeya) and some species records (e.g. Batrachospermum longiarticulatum, Lemanea australis, L. catenata, L. fluviatilis, L. mamillosa, L. lorulosa and Thorea hispida) warrant detailed confirmatory data based on reinvestigation of fresh collections for morphology, reproduction and particularly molecular data to confirm the presence in the country. Future collections, especially in the Indian Biodiversity Hotspots (Indo-Burma, Western and Eastern Ghats and Andaman & Nicobar Islands), may uncover the occurrence of genera such as Bangia, Cyanidium and Nemalionopsis known to be present in neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Nepal and Thailand. Geothermal (acidic) hot water springs in India may reveal the presence of extremophilic unicellular red algal genera like Cyanidium, Cyanidioschvzon and Galdieria of the Cyanidiophyceae. Two maps showing the political and biogeographic zones of India are included.

Continuous monitoring of the ponds before and after the biomanipulation allowed the effects of the management intervention on different compartments of pond ecosystems (phytoplankton, zooplankton, submerged vegetation and nutrients) to be assessed. Fish removal resulted in a drastic reduction in phytoplankton biomass and a shift to the clear-water state in seven out of eight biomanipulated ponds. The reduction in phytoplankton biomass was associated with a marked increase in density and size of large cladocerans in six ponds and a restoration of submerged macrophytes in five ponds. The phytoplankton biomass in the ponds with extensive stands of submerged macrophytes was less affected by planktivorous fish recolonisation of some of the ponds later in the summer. The two non-vegetated ponds as well as one pond with sparse submerged vegetation showed a marked increase in phytoplankton biomass associated with the appearance of fish. Phytoplankton biomass increase coincided with the decrease in large Cladocera density and size. One pond lacking submerged macrophytes could maintain very low phytoplankton biomass owing to large Cladocera grazing alone. The results of this study confirmed the importance of large zooplankton grazing and revegetation with submerged macrophytes for the maintenance of the clear-water state and restoration success in hypereutrophic ponds. They also showed that large Cladocera size is more important than their number for efficient phytoplankton control and when cladocerans are large enough, they can considerably restrain phytoplankton growth, including bloom-forming cyanobacteria, even when submerged vegetation is not restored. The positive result of fish removal in seven out of eight biomanipulated ponds clearly indicated that such management intervention can be used, at least, for the short-term restoration of ecological water quality and prevention of noxious cyanobacterial bloom formation. The negative result of biomanipulation in one pond seems to be related to the pollution by sewage water.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2009	634	1					125	135		10.1007/s10750-009-9888-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9888-4													WOS:000269190100011
J	Lacourse, T				Lacourse, Terri			Environmental change controls postglacial forest dynamics through interspecific differences in life-history traits	ECOLOGY												A key goal of functional ecology is identifying relationships between species traits and environmental conditions. Here, the nature and significance of these relationships to community composition on long ecological timescales is investigated using paleoecological and paleoenvironmental data from coastal British Columbia, Canada. RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, two three-table statistical techniques, are used to link traits of the region's dominant woody plants to environmental conditions over the last 15 000 calendar years (cal yr) through a fossil pollen record derived from lake sediments. Both RLQ and fourth-corner analyses revealed highly significant correlations between plant traits and temporal changes in environmental conditions. Axis 1 of the RLQ explained 92% of the total covariance between plant species traits and paleoenvironmental variables and was correlated most strongly with temperature and relative growth rate. In general, climate change during the cold period following deglaciation favored species such as Alnus sinuata and Pinus contorta that exhibit a "fast'' life-history strategy (e.g., high relative growth rate, short life span, low shade tolerance), whereas the relative climatic stability of the last 8000 cal yr favored species such as Tsuga heterophylla that exhibit a "slow'' life-history strategy (e.g., low relative growth rate, long life span, high shade tolerance). Fourth-corner analyses revealed significant correlations between all paleoenvironmental variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, summer insolation, vegetation density) and most plant traits (relative growth rate, minimum seed-bearing age, seed mass, height, life span, and shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerances). The strongest correlation was between paleotemperature and height, reflecting the positive effect of temperature on plant growth and development and the overarching competitive advantage that height confers. This research demonstrates that environmental conditions interact significantly with life-history and stress tolerance traits over long ecological timescales to determine forest composition. Climate is the ultimate control on postglacial forest composition and species abundances, but long-term community assembly is also constrained through interspecific differences in plant traits.					; Lacourse, Terri/G-5647-2012	Lacourse, Terri/0000-0002-7559-5374; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				AUG	2009	90	8					2149	2160		10.1890/08-1136.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1136.1								19739377					WOS:000268293000014
J	Meriano, M; Eyles, N				Meriano, M; Eyles, N			Groundwater flow through Pleistocene glacial deposits in the rapidly urbanizing Rouge River-Highland Creek watershed, City of Scarborough, southern Ontario, Canada	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The city of Scarborough lies on the eastern margin of the Greater Toronto Area of southern Ontario, Canada, along the northern coastline of Lake Ontario. The City has a population of 500,000 and is presently one of the fastest growing communities in Canada. The City is expanding northwards onto rural land on the south slope of the large Pleistocene glacial Oak Ridges Moraine system. The moraine system is underlain by a thick (150 m) succession of tills, sands and gravels and is a regionally- significant recharge area for three principle aquifer systems that discharge to numerous watercourses that flow to Lake Ontario. Protection of deeper aquifers from surface-generated urban contaminants is a particular concern. A groundwater flow model using Visual MODFLOW was developed for the 350-km(2) Rouge River-Highland Creek (RRHC) drainage basin using an extensive GIS-based collection of subsurface geological, geophysical and hydrogeological data, maps of land use and surficial geology. The RRHC model was calibrated against point water level data, known potentiometric surfaces of the principal aquifers and baseflow measurements from strearnflow gauging stations and determined to be within acceptable limits. Water balance calculations indicate that 70% of the basin recharge (106,000 m(3)/day) enters the Upper Aquifer along the crest and immediate flanks of the Oak Ridges Moraine. To the south, Upper Aquifer water moving through fractured till aquitards accounts for more than 75% of recharge to deeper aquifers. Water quality data confirm previous observations that urban-and rural-sourced contaminants (chlorides and nitrates) present in Upper Aquifer waters are moving rapidly into deeper aquifers. Some 83% of total RRHC recharge water is ultimately discharged as baseflow to creeks draining to Lake Ontario; the remainder discharges to springs and along eroding lakeshore bluffs. Model results demonstrate that deeper aquifers are poorly protected from urban contaminants and that long-term protection of ground and surface water quality has to be a priority of municipal planners if the resource is not to be severely degraded.																			1431-2174					APR	2003	11	2					288	303		10.1007/s10040-002-0226-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-002-0226-4													WOS:000183197800009
J	Lotter, AF				Lotter, AF			The palaeolimnology of Soppensee (Central Switzerland), as evidenced by diatom, pollen, and fossil-pigment analyses	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The development of Soppensee (Central Switzerland, 596 m a.s.l.) has been reconstructed using algal remains such as diatoms, chlorophytes and fossil pigments, as well as the pollen and spores of macrophytes. Sediment accumulation in Soppensee began at the end of the last glacial period, approximately 15,000 yrs ago. During the Oldest Dryas biozone (> 12,700 radiocarbon yrs B.P.) the lake had low primary productivity. After reforestation with birch and later pine, around 12,700 B.P., phases of summer anoxia occurred in the lake. These anoxic conditions were most probably caused by additional carbon input from the catchment, as well as longer phases of stratification due to reduced wind exposure caused by the sheltering effect of increased tree cover. From the Younger Dryas biozone(10,800 to 10,000 radiocarbon yrs B.P.) onwards, Soppensee became meromictic for several millennia. The fossil diatom assemblages are dominated by planktonic alkaliphilous to alkalibiontic species with mainly meso- to eutrophic preferences. Diatom-inferred total phosphorus reconstructions suggest meso- to eutrophic conditions throughout the Holocene. Eutrophic conditions are also suggested by the presence of pigments of cyanobacteria, including Oscillatoria species. First human activity in the catchment is evidenced ca. 5000 radiocarbon yrs B.P. by the occurrence of cereal pollen. Diatom-inferred total phosphorus concentrations also increased slightly during the Neolithic period. According to the fossil pigment record, meromictic conditions ended during the Iron Age. Deep-water anoxia, however, persisted at least during the stratification period. During the Middle Ages massive deforestation in the catchment and around the lake changed the limnological conditions drastically. The lack of forest increased the wind fetch and, therefore, also the mixing of the lake, while soil erosion and retting of hemp supplied additional nutrients. Because of intensive agriculture in its catchment, Soppensee has become hypertrophic and diatom assemblages have consequently changed completely in the last 50 yrs.

The average mass ratio of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in Vortsjarv (45) was about twice as high as that in Peipsi (22). In Peipsi, the N-2-fixing Gloeotrichia echinulata, Aphanizomenon flosaquae and Anabaena species prevailed in the summer phytoplankton, while in Vortsjarv the dominant cyanobacteria were Limnothrix planktonica, L. redekei and Planktolyngbya limnetica, which cannot fix N-2; the main N-2-fixing taxa Aphanizomenon skujae and Anabaena sp. seldom gained dominance. In May-October the critical TN: TP mass ratio, below which N-2-fixing cyanobacteria (Nfix) achieved high biomasses, was similar to 40 in Vortsjarv and similar to 30 in Peipsi. The percentages of both total cyanobacteria (CY) and Nfix (CY% and Nfix%) in Peipsi achieved their maximum values at an N:P mass ratio at or below 20 for both TN:TP and Nmin:SRP. In Vortsjarv, the TN: TP supporting a high Nfix% was between 30 and 40 and the Nmin: SRP supporting this high percentage was in the same range as that in Peipsi (<20), though the maximum Nfix% values in Vortsjarv (69%) were much lower than in Peipsi (96%). The Nmin: SRP ratio explained 77% of the variability in Nfix% in May-October. The temperature dependence of Nfix% approximated to the maximum function type, with an upper limiting value at a certain water temperature, and this was most distinct in May-October. The critical TN: TP ratios obtained from our study (roughly 30 for Peipsi and 40 for Vortsjarv are much higher than the Redfield N: P mass ratio routinely considered (7). Our results represent valuable guidelines for creating effective management strategies for large shallow lakes. They provide a basis for stressing the urgent need to decrease phosphorus loading and to keep the in-lake P concentration low, and not to implement nitrogen reduction measures without a simultaneous decrease of phosphorus concentration.

The filling process and variations in sediment yield have been investigated by mechanical coring, seismic surveys, and electric soundings. The detrital sediment yield of the upstream watershed can be calculated by quantifying the sedimentary stocks for each climatic stage of the Late-Glacial period and Holocene Epoch and estimating the lake's entrapment capacity. This enables us to determine the intensity of the erosion processes in relation to climate and environmental factors. The Bolling-Allerod Interstade produced the greatest yields with mean values of 19,500 metric tons per calendar year (t/yr). The Younger Dryas Chronozone saw a sharp fall (8900 t/yr) that continued into the Preboreal (2100 t/yr). Clastic supply increased during the Boreal (4500 t/yr) before declining again in the Early Atlantic (2400 t/yr), Since then, yields have risen from 4500 t/yr in the Late Atlantic to 6800 t/yr in the Subboreal and 11,100 t/yr in the Subatlantic, Comparison of quantitative data with the qualitative analysis of the deposits and with the paleohydrologic curve of the watershed based on level fluctuations in lakes around Chaillexon shows that climate was the controlling factor of sediment yield until the Late Atlantic. From the Late Atlantic-Subboreal around 5400 cal yr B.P. (4700 C-14 yr B.P,) and especially from the end of the Subboreal Chronozone and during the Subatlantic Chronozone (2770 cal yr B.P./2700 C-14 yr B.P.-present) climatic constraints have been compounded by human activity related to forest clearing and land use.

J	Mittlefehldt, DW				Mittlefehldt, DW			Geochemistry of the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Tagish Lake, the anomalous CM chondrite Bells, and comparison with CI and CM chondrites	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												I have determined the composition via instrumental neutron activation analysis of a bulk pristine sample of the Tagish Lake carbonaceous chondrite fall, along with bulk samples of the Cl chondrite Orgueil and of several CM chondrites. Tagish Lake has a mean of refractory lithophile element/Cr ratios like those of CM chondrites, and distinctly higher than the Cl chondrite mean. Tagish Lake exhibits abundances of the moderately volatile lithophile elements Na and K that are slightly higher than those of mean CM chondrites. Refractory through moderately volatile siderophile element abundances in Tagish Lake are like those of CM chondrites. Tagish Lake is distinct from CM chondrites in abundances of the most volatile elements. Mean Cl-normalized Se/Co, Zn/Co and Cs/Co for Tagish Lake are 0.68 +/- 0.01, 0.71 +/- 0.07 and 0.76 +/- 0.02, while for all available CM chondrite determinations, these ratios lie between 0.31 and 0.61, between 0.32 and 0.58, and between 0.39 and 0.74, respectively. Considering petrography, and oxygen isotopic and elemental compositions, Tagish Lake is an ungrouped member of the carbonaceous chondrite clan. The overall abundance pattern is similar to those of CM chondrites, indicating that Tagish Lake and CMs experienced very similar nebular fractionations. Bells is a CM chondrite with unusual petrologic characteristics. Bells has a mean CI-normalized refractory lithophile element/Cr ratio of 0.96, lower than for any other CM chondrite, but shows CI-normalized moderately volatile lithophile element/Cr ratios within the ranges of other CM chondrites, except for Na which is low. Iridium, Co, Ni and Fe abundances are like those of CM chondrites, but the moderately volatile siderophile elements, Au, As and Sb, have abundances below the ranges for CM chondrites. Abundances of the moderately volatile elements Se and Zn of Bells are within the CM ranges. Bells is best classified as an anomalous CM chondrite.

J	Schindelin, AJ; Frimmel, FH				Schindelin, AJ; Frimmel, FH			Nitrate and natural organic matter in aqueous solutions irradiated by simulated sunlight - Influence on the degradation of the pesticides dichlorprop and terbutylazine	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												By means of simulated sunlight, the influence of natural organic matter (NOM) on the photochemical degradation of halogenated pesticides in the absence and presence of nitrate as a precursor of the highly reactive OH radicals in aqueous solutions and freshwater was investigated. Solutions of dichlorprop or terbutylazine (a) in phosphate-buffered demineralized water containing nitrate and/or NOM and (b) in natural freshwaters were irradiated by a 1000-W Xe short-are lamp. The collimated beam was filtered using a combination of optical filters (WG 320 and WG 295) to simulate the solar spectrum under summer midday conditions. In the absence of nitrate and NOM, the pesticides were degraded photolytically by simulated sunlight. The degradation rates depended on the absorption spectrum in the UVB range and the quantum yield of the degradation. The photochemical degradation of the pesticides was faster in the presence of nitrate due to the sunlight-induced formation of OH radicals. In the absence of nitrate, low concentrations of NOM of a brown-water lake accelerated the degradation due to the formation of reactive species by NOM. At higher concentrations of NOM, the inner filter effect of NOM lowered the degradation rates. In the presence of: 50 mg 1(-1) nitrate, NOM decreased the degradation rate significantly. In case the natural water samples were used as a matrix for the experiments (nitrate concentrations between 2 mg l(-1) and 15 mg l(-1), DOC concentrations below 2.3 mg l(-1)), NOM acted mainly as a radiation filter and as a scavenger of OH radicals. As a consequence, in most freshwater systems, the accelerating effect of NOM by the formation of reactive species is of minor importance compared to the inner filter effect and to radical scavenging.																			0944-1344						2000	7	4					205	210		10.1007/BF02987349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02987349								19005835					WOS:000165724800005

Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) of Leech Lake, Minnesota: Temporal Variation of Diets and Assessment of Differential Prey Selection in Adults	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												In 1998, after 160 y without documented nesting, Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) recolonized Leech Lake, Minnesota. Competition for nesting space with the state threatened Common Tern (Sterna hirundo), and concern regarding potential walleye (Sander vitreus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) population declines prompted culling of cormorants and research into their diet. Stomach contents of adult and subadult cormorants were collected in 2004, 2005, and 2006 (186, 356 and 348, respectively) and from cormorant chick regurgitants in 2005 and 2006 (151 and 114, respectively). Perca flavescens (>70% composition and biomass) and shiner species (Notropis sp.) (>4% composition and biomass) were the main components of subadult and adult cormorant diets in 2004 and 2005 and the diet of chicks in 2005. However in 2006, whitefish species (Coregonus sp.) was the majority of percent biomass consumed by subadults and adults (43.4%) and a large proportion of percent biomass consumed by chicks (17.8%). In 2006 percent biomass of Corengonus sp. was different from other years for adults and subadults (P < 0.001) and chicks (P < 0.01) and may have been a product of a warming event die-off in late summer. All eight of the select common prey species varied (P < 0.01) in percent biomass between at least one of the ten delineated periods within 2004, 2005, or 2006. Differential prey selection by adults for self-feeding and provisioning for chicks was detected in Coregonus sp. (P < 0.01). While the diet of Leech Lake cormorants mainly consists of small abundant fish (P. flavescens and Notropis sp.), cormorant diet can vary within and among years. This study represents the first description of the diet of cormorants from a midwestern location other than the Great Lakes and reinforces the importance of site specific diet assessment, as the particular abundant prey species differs between locations.					; Hundt, Peter/K-2128-2019	Hundt, Peter/0000-0001-5567-3905; 													0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	2013	169	2					354	370																WOS:000338206900009

Its imaging manifestations are diverse, which brings challenges to clinical diagnosis. However, its formation mechanism is unclear.ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to analyse the relevant mechanisms of the formation of pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma by observing its different imaging and pathological manifestations.Data and methodsRetrospective analysis was conducted on imaging manifestations and pathological data of 103 patients with pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma confirmed intraoperatively or pathologically.ResultsForty-three patients had pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma with a solitary nodule/mass, 41 patients with localized pneumonia and 19 patients with diffuse pneumonia. Their CT manifestations included 'falling snowflake sign', ground-glass opacity close to the heart, vacuous signs/honeycombing and withered tree branches. Under the microscope, all the three types of pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma had visibly formed mucus lakes but were made of tumour cells with totally different shapes, which included the goblet-like shape (tall column-like shape) and quasi-circular shape. Tall column-shaped tumour cells were negative or weakly positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and strongly positive for ALK mutation, whereas quasi-circular tumour cells were positive for TTF-1 and less positive for ALK mutation.ConclusionThe different imaging manifestations of mucinous adenocarcinoma are possibly due to the different amounts or viscosity of mucus produced, and the mechanisms of its formation may include (1) tumour cells in different shapes have different abilities to produce mucus; (2) tumours in different stages produce different amounts or viscosity of mucus; and (3) the TTF-1 and ALK genes affect the production of mucus. In this work, retrospective analysis was conducted on imaging manifestations and pathological data of 103 patients with pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma confirmed intraoperatively or pathologically. The different imaging manifestations of mucinous adenocarcinoma are possibly due to the different amounts or viscosity of mucus produced. image					; Wu, Yuxin/AAG-9394-2019	Han, Jun/0000-0001-6393-7042; 													1752-6981	1752-699X				APR	2024	18	4							e13750	10.1111/crj.13750	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/crj.13750								38616354					WOS:001201705500001

Here we target two cores from Mfabeni Peatland, one of the few long continuous terrestrial archives in South Africa that reaches into the Pleistocene, to generate a composite temperature record spanning the last similar to 43 kyr. The Mfabeni Peatland has previously been proven suitable for temperature and hydrological reconstructions based on pollen and geochemical proxies. Here we use branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) preserved in the Mfabeni peatland to derive a new quantitative air temperature record for south-east Africa. Our temperature record generally follows global trends in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but is decoupled at times. Annual air temperatures during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 were moderately high (c. 20.5 degrees C), but dropped by c. 5 degrees C during the Last Glacial Maximum, reaching a minimum at c.16-15 ka. Asynchronous with local insolation, this cooling may have resulted from reduced sea surface temperatures linked to a northward shift in the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds. Concurrent with the southward retreat of the westerlies, and increasing sea surface temperatures offshore, warming from minimum temperatures (c. 15.0 degrees C) to average Holocene temperatures (c. 20.0 degrees C) occurred across the deglaciation. This warming was briefly but prominently interrupted by a millennial-scale cooling event of c. 3 degrees C at c. 2.4 ka, concurrent with a sudden change in hydrological conditions. The average Holocene temperatures of c. 20.0 degrees C were similar to those reconstructed for MIS 3, but after the 2.4 ka cooling period, air temperatures in the Mfabeni peat recovered and steadily increased towards the present. In summary, our record demonstrates that land temperature in eastern South Africa is highly sensitive to global drivers as well as nearby sea surface temperatures. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

In January, 1989, mobile observations were carried out in order to clarify the urban effects on these local climatic phenomena. The small city, Jinghong, is located in the northwestern part of the Jinghong basin. The basin bottom has an area of about 76 km2. The city had a population of about 40 000 in 1988. Heat islands with an intensity higher than 1-degrees-C were clearly observed in the city. The formation of radiation fog was also observed simultaneously on the slope located in the northeastern part of the basin. It was found that radiation fog was formed first in an air layer at a height of several tens of meters above the city and then it spread over the whole basin within about one hour. It disappeared from the northwestern part of the basin, where the city is located. The mechanism of the urban effect on radiation fog is discussed. On the other hand, some previous studies have pointed out that the local climate in Xishuangbanna has been changing; it has become drier, sunshine duration has increased, and the number of fog-days and the duration of fog at night have decreased. By comparing the meteorological data in the 1960s, when the population of the city was less than 10 000, and in the 1980s, when it was about 40 000, the effects of urbanization and deforestation on the local climate phenomena, such as cold air lakes and radiation fog, are analyzed.

J	Panter, KS; Winter, B				Panter, Kurt S.; Winter, Brian			Geology of the Side Crater of the Erebus volcano, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The summit cone of the Erebus volcano contains two craters. The Main crater is roughly circular (similar to 500 m diameter) and contains an active persistent phonolite lava lake similar to 200 m below the summit rim. The Side Crater is adjacent to the southwestern rim of the Main Crater. It is a smaller spoon-shaped Crater (250-350 m diameter, 50-100 m deep) and is inactive. The floor of the Side Crater is covered by snow/ice, volcanic colluvium or weakly developed volcanic soil in geothermal areas (a.k.a. warm ground). But in several places the walls of the Side Crater provide extensive vertical exposure of rock which offers an insight into the recent eruptive history of Erebus. The deposits consist of lava flows with subordinate volcanoclastic lithologies. Four lithostratigraphic units are described: SC 1 is a compound lava with complex internal flow fabrics; SC 2 consists of interbedded vitric lavas, autoclastic and pyroclastic breccias: SC 3 is a thick sequence of thin lavas with minor autoclastic breccias; SC 4 is a pyroclastic fall deposit containing large scoriaceous lava bombs in a matrix composed primarily of juvenile lapilli-sized pyroclasts. Ash-sized pyroclasts from SC 4 consist of two morphologic types, spongy and blocky, indicating a mixed strombolian-phreatomagmatic origin. All of the deposits are phonolitic and contain anorthoclase feldspar. The stratigraphy and morphology of the Side Crater provides a record of recent volcanic activity at the Erebus volcano and is divided into four stages. Stage I is the building of the main summit cone and eruption of lavas (SC 1 and SC 3) from Main Crater vent(s). A secondary cone was built during Stage II by effusive and explosive activity (SC 2) from the Side Crater vent. A mixed strombolian and phreatomagmatic eruption (SC 4) delimits Stage III. The final stage (IV) represents a period of erosion and enlargement of the Side Crater. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since 1984, the key driver in acidification reversal was sulphate (SO4) concentration (median decrease of -3.58 mu eq L-1 yr(-1)) which fell in line with reductions in sulphur (S) deposition. Reduction of nitrogen (N) deposition was followed by proportional reduction in nitrate (NO3) leaching although decline in NO3 concentrations was more pronounced at two sites, the ertovo Lake (CT) and Prailsk, Lake (PR) until 2006; only A1/2AArsk, pond showed effective catchment N immobilization. Coherent decline of chloride concentration was detected across all sites. The decrease of strong mineral acids was partly compensated by decrease of inorganic aluminium (Al-in), especially at sites most acidified in the beginning of observations (ANC(1984-1986) between -160 and -90 mu eq L-1 at CT, ern, Lake-CN and Plen, lake-PL) and by reductions of base cations and increases of pH. All lakes (CN, CT, PL, PR and LK) moved to the ANC range between -29 and 30 mu eq L-1 (2010-2012) where sensitivity of pH to further reductions in acid anions may be expected. Concurrently, charge of weak organic acids (OAs) increased and partly balanced the strong mineral acid decrease as a consequence of (i) significant DOC (dissolved organic carbon) increase (median change of 0.13 mgC L-1 yr(-1) since 1993) and (ii) deprotonation of weak OAs caused by pH rise. Since 2000s, bark beetle induced forest decline accelerated NO3 leaching at most of the catchments (by 200 % at LK, PL and PR). However, elevated N leaching was effectively neutralized by base cations (K, Mg, Ca) originating from decaying fresh litter, thus acidification recovery was not reversed, but slowed down. After cessation of NO3 leaching we hypothesise that collapsed tree canopy across catchments (from 12 to 87 % compared to 1984) will cause lower total acid input in precipitation (S + N) and regrowth of vegetation may stimulate higher N immobilization (in biomass and soil); processes which could lead to further increase of ANC and pH, key indicators for biological recovery.

C	Bowman, CF			ASME	Bowman, Charles F.			THE ORIENTED SPRAY COOLING SYSTEM FOR SUPPLEMENTING COOLING LAKES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME POWER CONFERENCE JOINT WITH ICOPE-17, 2017, VOL 1					ASME Power Conference 2017	JUN 26-30, 2017	Charlotte, NC	ASME, Power div				With ever-increasing ambient temperatures many electric power plants that employ cooling lakes to reject their waste heat into the environment are struggling to maintain reasonable turbine backpressures during the hot summer months when electric load demand is often the greatest. Some consider adding mechanical draft cooling towers (MDCT) to further cool the condenser circulating water (CCW) prior to entering the main condenser, but the additional auxiliary power required to drive MDCT fans often consume the additional generator output resulting from the lower backpressure. Spray ponds offer significant advantages over MDCT including superior simplicity and operability, lower power requirements, and lower capital and maintenance costs. The Oriented Spray Cooling System (OSCS) is an evolutionary spray pond design. Unlike a conventional spray pond in which spray nozzles are arranged in a flat bed and spray upward, blocking the ambient air flow to the spray region as it travels down to the pond below, the OSCS nozzles are mounted on spray trees arranged in a circle and are tilted at an angle oriented towards the center of the circle. As a result, the water droplets drag air into the spray region while the warm air concentrated in the center of the circle rises. Both of these effects work together to increase air flow through the spray region. Increased air flow reduces the local wet-bulb temperature (LWBT) of the air in the spray pattern, promoting heat transfer and more efficient cooling. During the late 1970's the author developed a purely analytical model to predict the thermal performance of the OSCS which was successfully compared with the OSCS at the Columbia Generating Station (CGS) in the mid 1980's. This paper describes how the OSCS may be employed to supplement the cooling capacity of an existing cooling lake to reduce the temperature of the CCW prior to entering a power plant, resulting in lower main condenser pressures and more net plant output.																					978-0-7918-5760-1				2017									UNSP V001T05A002															WOS:000414877000073

Field observations and analyses of sand layer water content, field capacity, secondary salt content, and grain size reveal 3 types of important natural phenomenon: (a) vegetation bands on the leeward slope of the megadunes reflect the hydrological regime within the sandy vadose zone; (b) seepage, wet sand deposits, and secondary salt deposits indicate the pattern of water movement within the sandy vadose zone; (c) zones of groundwater seeps and descending springs around the lakes reflect the influence of the local topography on the hydrological regime of the megadunes. The seepage exposed on the sloping surface of the megadunes and gravity water contained within the sand layer confirm the occurrence of preferential flow within the vadose zone of the megadunes. Alternating layers of coarse and fine sand create the conditions for the formation of preferential flows. The preferential flows promote movement of water within the sand layer water that leads to deep penetration of water within the megadunes and ultimately to the recharging of groundwater and lake water. Our results indicate that a positive water balance promotes recharge of the megadunes, which depends on the high permeability of the megadune material, the shallow depth of the surface sand layer affected by evaporation, the occurrence of rainfall events exceeding 15 mm, and the sparse vegetation cover. Water balance estimates indicate that the annual water storage of the megadunes is about 7.5 mm, accounting for only 8% of annual precipitation; however, the shallow groundwater per unit area under the megadunes receives only 3.6% of annual precipitation, but it is still able to maintain a dynamic balance of the lake water. From a water budget perspective, the annual water storage in the megadunes is sufficient to serve as a recharge source for lake water, thereby enabling the long-term persistence of the lakes. Overall, our findings demonstrate that precipitation is a significant component of the hydrological cycle in arid deserts.

Aims This research focused on the assessment of changes in snow cover within Chitral district imposed by temperature increase. Methods ArcGIS and Origin programs were used in this research to study the glacier pattern of Chitral. Results Therer was a significant increase of 266.7% in urban development and an expansion of 135.9 km(2) in agricultural areas within this remote mountainous region. The findings of the study show that in the year 2000, >51.6% of Chitral district's total land was covered by snow during early winter. However, this coverage drastically declined to similar to 6.8% by 2008. Across the initial two 4-year periods, similar to 44.7% (5694.6 km(2)) of the glaciated area transitioned to barren rock, whereas the overall reduction in snow-covered areas accounted for similar to 43.3% (5514.6 km(2)). Conclusion Owing to the increasing stress on freshwater resources, it is essential to conduct thorough analyses and monitoring of snow patterns to ensure sustainable freshwater availability and effective environmental risk management. Implications This study emphasises the critical consequences of climate-driven glacial retreat, waning snow cover and increased risks of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) for the management of water resources with the rise in global CO2 and temperatures levels. These changes threaten the timing and availability of water supply, with impacts on agriculture, ecosystem and hydropower. Effective adaptation measures and sustainable management practices are crucial to alleviate these risks and ensure water security in a warming world.

J	Arnott, SE; Yan, N; Keller, W; Nicholls, K				Arnott, SE; Yan, N; Keller, W; Nicholls, K			The influence of drought-induced acidification on the recovery of plankton in Swan Lake (Canada)	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In response to North American and Western European reductions in atmospheric emissions of SO,, research efforts are now being focused on the recovery of aquatic ecosystems from acidification. Improvements in water quality have been hampered by drought-induced acidification events, but the biological consequences of such events have not been described. We present evidence of biotic recovery in Swan Lake near Sudbury, Canada, in response to water quality improvement, then demonstrate the damaging impacts of a 1988 re-acidification event. Changes in species composition, richness, diversity, and multivariate indices were assessed from 1977 to 1997 for phytoplankton, from 1977 to 1990 for rotifers, and from 1977 to 1998 for crustacean zooplankton. While there was some evidence of recovery in the plankton during the 1980s, recovery was incomplete at the time of the re-acidification event. We suspect that the severity of past acidification, ongoing water quality problems, and biological resistance to colonization restricted recovery. The response of each taxonomic group to re-acidification varied. The recovery of both phytoplankton and rotifer communities was impaired by the re-acidification event; both phytoplankton and rotifers reverted to a damaged state, with the effect on phytoplankton lasting seven years. The recovering crustacean zooplankton community was not obviously influenced by the re-acidification event, probably because most acid-sensitive taxa had not recolonized the lake at the time of re-acidification. There was, however, an unexpected response of the crustacean zooplankton to re-acidification. While phytoplankton and rotifer richness decreased, crustacean richness increased even though lake pH fell from near 6 to 4.5. We hypothesize that the; explanation is a complex interaction among chemical and physical changes associated with the lake's re-acidification. Specifically we hypothesize that a massive hatching event of zooplankton resting eggs was triggered by increases in light, temperature, or oxygen concentrations at the sediment-water interface and/or desiccation of littoral sediments during the drought.

J	Shaw, PA; Bateman, MD; Thomas, DSG; Davies, F				Shaw, PA; Bateman, MD; Thomas, DSG; Davies, F			Holocene fluctuations of Lake Ngami, Middle Kalahari: chronology and responses to climatic change	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					International Conference on Late Quaternary Environmental Change in African Dryland	AUG, 2002	KALAHARI, SOUTH AFRICA					Lake Ngami, a 3000 km(2) basin at the distal end of the Okavango Delta, Botswana, has a complex suite of shorelines ranging from the lake sump at 919 m asl up to 945 m asl, linked to topographic thresholds and inflows, current and fossil, in the Okavango system. The lake has been ephemeral throughout the 20th century and completely dry since 1982, yet held a substantial body of water up to a level of 930 in asl when visited by European travellers in the mid-nineteenth century. The historical decline in the lake has been well documented and used as evidence for regional desiccation, but the Holocene record, based on archaeological studies and radiocarbon dating of inorganic carbonates, is more speculative. A study of a 30 km(2) diatomite at the eastern end of the basin indicates that a substantial freshwater lake at a level of at least 932 in asl was present throughout the Holocene, linked to a now abandoned inflow of the Kunyere River. A programme of 18 luminescence age determinations of the peripheral Dautsa and Nlagotlwanen shoreline sequences suggests that they are old features that have been constructed on a lacustrine substrate dating back to 90-100 ka or earlier, and have been modified by Holocene fluctuations in lake level and subsequent aeolian reworking. The water level peaked at 936 m asl between 4 and 3 ka, returned to 934 in at 2.8-2 ka, ponding water into the Phatane Gap, and fell rapidly thereafter to 932 m and thence to historical levels. The 936 m level can be correlated with increased throughflow in the Okavango Delta, hence increased rainfall in the catchment. The subsequent decline can be attributed to episodic closure and rerouting of Okavango distributaries, in particular the Thaoghe, perhaps aided by anthropogenic activities. As such the desiccation of the lake is not indicative of regional climatic change. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Use of classification trees to apportion single echo detections to species: Application to the pelagic fish community of Lake Superior	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Acoustic methods are used to estimate the density of pelagic fish in large lakes with results of midwater trawling used to assign species composition. Apportionment in lakes having mixed species can be challenging because only a small fraction of the water sampled acoustically is sampled with trawl gear. Here we describe a new method where single echo detections (SEDs) are assigned to species based on classification tree models developed from catch data that separate species based on fish size and the spatial habitats they occupy. During the summer of 2011, we conducted a spatially-balanced lake-wide acoustic and midwater trawl survey of Lake Superior. A total of 51 sites in four bathymetric depth strata (0-30 m, 30-100 m, 100-200 m, and >200 m) were sampled. We developed classification tree models for each stratum and found fish length was the most important variable for separating species. To apply these trees to the acoustic data, we needed to identify a target strength to length (TS-to-L) relationship appropriate for all abundant Lake Superior pelagic species. We tested performance of 7 general (i.e., multi-species) relationships derived from three published studies. The best-performing relationship was identified by comparing predicted and observed catch compositions using a second independent Lake Superior data set. Once identified, the relationship was used to predict lengths of SEDs from the lake-wide survey, and the classification tree models were used to assign each SED to a species. Exotic rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) were the most common species at bathymetric depths <100m with their population estimated at 755 million (3.4 kt). Kiyi (Coregonus kiyi) were the most abundant species at depths >100 m (384 million; 6.0 kt). Cisco (Coregonus artedi) were widely distributed over all strata with their population estimated at 182 million (44 kt). The apportionment method we describe should be transferable to other large lakes provided fish are not tightly aggregated, and an appropriate TS-to-L relationship for abundant pelagic fish species can be determined.

J	Maloletko, AA				Maloletko, Anton A.			PHYSIOGRAPHIC PRECONDITIONS FOR BUILDING OVERLAND ROADS IN KOLYVAN-VOSKRESENSK DEPARTMENT IN 1749-1762	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												In the middle of the 18th century, the infrastructure development on the territory of the Kolyvan-Voskresensk department was inseparably linked with the development of the fields and the construction of the copper and silver smelting plants. New settlements and paths for the transportation of the ore were constructed. The connection ways between fields, river piers, plants and villages were established. The number of the Russian population had increased considerably by then. Both the mining enterprises and the population needed to be protected from militant nomads. Empress Elizaveta Petrovna issued a decree about the organization of a confidential foreign expedition to the south from the Kolyvan-Voskresensk department. Privy Councilor and Siberian Governor Fyodor Ivanovich Soymonov was appointed responsible for the expedition organization. The expedition continued from 1760 to 1762. During this time research parties studied the intensive territory of the Mountain Altai region from north to south - from the mouth of the Biya River to the Bukhtarma River; and from west to east - from the Ust-Kamenogorsk fortress to Teletskoe Lake. The expeditions studied carefully the old Asian paths, both deserted and still used by the local nomad tribes. Much attention was paid to the study of the physiographic components: relief, climate, surface water, vegetation. The cartographic material of the studied territory was received. Later, both the cartographic material and the traveling notes were preserved at the storage centre of the archival funds of the Altai Territory. When passing the route, the groups noted places suitable for the construction of defense works, ploughing and haymaking. The experts studied the rivers: rifts, sand banks, the speed of a current and the depth of the rivers; suitability of the rivers for navigation was also estimated. After studying the received physiographic and hydrographic materials of the studied part of the Kolyvan- Voskresensk department, the following conclusions were made. The rapid current of the rivers and frequent floods as a result of snow thawing and large amounts of precipitation were a feature of the Mountain Altai rivers. These circumstances complicated organization of ferries and construction of bridges. Overland roads were difficult ways for movement because they were narrow tracks which lay on the abrupt stony slopes of the mountains. Only pack horses could pass these tracks. The places for building fortresses and redoubts were low-suitable because they were situated either in the mountains at a big height or in the narrow gorges. This circumstance was more difficult because of the snow in the deep gorges that thawed in the first half of summer only. Therefore, the transport communication stopped completely in winter due to the deep snow. Accordingly, overland transportation of loads was possible four months a year only. After considering all these facts, the organization of the defense line from the Ust-Kamenogorsk fortress to the Novikovskiy outpost was estimated as an impracticable, expensive and non-profitable project for the state. As a result, a decision to build the defense line from the Ust-Kamenogorsk fortress to the Biysk fortress was made. In a short time, the defense line was built. It passed through the average stream of the Urba River, through the riverhead of the Aley River, the middle part of the Charysh River and from the Anuy River downstream to the junction of the Biya and the Katun Rivers. The defense line kept its strategic significance till the end of the 18th century. The overland roads supporting the communication between the fortresses, the outposts, the redoubts of the line, the mines and the settlements were built along the defense line. The research expeditions of 17601762 received a considerable physiographic, hydrographic and cartographic material of the territory of the Kolyvan-Voskresensk department. The difficulties of movement in the mountain district and the features of the water obstacles overcoming were described in the expedition reports. Such important factors as the topography of the researched territory, the water obstacles and the climatic conditions were considered when planning and constructing roads. The expedition results became the base for the formation of the strategically important ways of communication between the fortifications of the defense line at the distant boundaries of the Russian Empire. Some of the roads, which were investigated by expeditions in 1760-1762, received further development. Nowadays, they are important transportation routes of the Russian Federation.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				FEB	2015		391					209	213		10.17223/15617793/391/33	http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/15617793/391/33													WOS:000421012000033
J	Nelson, GJ; Pufahl, PK; Hiatt, EE				Nelson, Gabriel J.; Pufahl, Peir K.; Hiatt, Eric E.			Paleoceanographic constraints on Precambrian phosphorite accumulation, Baraga Group, Michigan, USA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Palaeoproterozoic Baraga Group (ca. 1850 +/- 1 Ma) of northern Michigan is a similar to 1200 m thick sedimentary succession of marine clastic, iron formation, chert, and phosphatic sedimentary rocks that accumulated at the peak of the world's first major phosphogenic episode. Lithofacies stacking patterns are interpreted to record the flooding of the Nuna continental margin during two sea-level cycles. The base of the first sequence is marked by a transgressive lag on Archean basement that is transitional into a highstand accumulation of sandstones deposited in peritidal environments. The bottom of the second sequence is characterized by a chert and carbonate unit with numerous subaerial exposure surfaces deposited in intertidal to supratidal environments. This chert grades upward into subtidal deposits composed of interbedded organic-rich mudstone and sandstone. The highstand and falling stage systems tracts are composed of progradational deltaic deposits. Sequences were framed using the newly discovered Sudbury impact ejecta horizon as a datum. Its emplacement approximately coincides with unrelated environmental changes that increased the delivery of river-borne sediment to the Nuna margin. Iron bearing minerals ankerite, siderite, and pyrite show that ferrous iron was present in peritidal to deep marine environments. Ankerite dominates nearshore settings where pyrite is absent; pyrite occurs in deeper, progradational deltaic deposits where sulfide was produced by bacterial sulfate reduction. Phosphorite is restricted to shallow-water sediments of the first sequence and the lowstand of the second sequence. Precipitation is interpreted to be the result of Fe-redox pumping just below the sediment-water interface where photosynthetically-produced, nearshore oxygen oases impinged on the seafloor. Such shallow-water phosphorite accumulation is in stark contrast to many Phanerozoic depositional systems in which phosphogenesis occurs across the shelf. This difference likely reflects the dissimilarity in the oxygenation state of the seafloor. In the Precambrian, Fe-redox pumping and thus, phosphogenesis, was restricted to shallow-water settings with a suboxic seafloor. In the Phanerozoic, phosphorite forms in the full spectrum of shelf environments because the entire seafloor is generally well oxygenated. The concentration of bioavailable P in neritic environments during the Proterozoic may have played a major role in the development of benthic microbial ecosystems and evolving eukaryotes.

Subsidence is crucial for allowing the long-term preservation of lacus- trine deposits. Lakes can temporarily store water and sediments in areas that lack subsidence, but these deposits will not be preserved in the stratigraphic record. Consequently, two types of lakes are recognized: 1) subsiding lakes, which have permanent accommodation space and 2) hanging lakes, having temporary ac- commodation space. Although they cannot permanently store sediments, hanging lakes are fundamental for lacustrine sequence stratigraphy, since they can flood subsiding lakes with the near-instantaneous release of a substantial volume of water, creating favorable conditions for the accumulation of organic-rich shales. This rapid flooding from hanging lakes induced a forced transgression (FT), which is a large-scale rapid trans- gression (xenoconformity) not related to the normal sediment and water supply from local source areas.

TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF CLIMATE, FLOODED AND WET ZONES IN WESTERN SIBERIA FROM DATA STATIONS, ATMOSPHERIC REANALYSIS AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY.	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												It is difficult to make an assessment of climate variability and hydrological characteristics using only in situ data, especially on such vast and remote territories as Western Siberia where the network is sparse and has declined over the past decades. Therefore, atmospheric reanalysis and satellite altimetry provide regular and reliable data for the territory and are an additional source of information to in situ data. The main objective of this study is to assess the variability of climate parameters in different landscape zones from different data sets. First, we analyzed air temperature and precipitation of mid size watersheds of the Ob River system (the Poluy, Nadym, Pur, Taz, Nazym, Lyamin, Tromyugan, Vakh, Tym, Bol'shoy Yugan, Vasyugan, Severnaya Sosva, Konda, Tavda, Tura, Om Rivers, the inner watershed of the ObIrtysh interfluve area) from meteorological stations and ERA-40 reanalysis data (1958-2001). Data analysis revealed the increase of air temperature in the northern, central and southern parts of Western Siberia. The most pronounced warming was found in the north (the Nadym, Poluy, Pur, Taz Rivers). Increase of precipitation for the same period was observed mostly in the western part of the territory (the Severnaya Sosva, Konda, Tavda, Tura Rivers), central part (the Nazym and the Vakh) and northern part (the Taz). Variability of flooded and wet zones is difficult to estimate from in situ data. Moreover, the presence of wetlands in most of the Western Siberia significantly complicates its monitoring. Therefore, to estimate the variability of flooded and wet zones we applied satellite altimetry method for watersheds of the Ob River system. Although the primary mission of satellite altimetry was to measure the altitude of the object above the fixed level, it also provides information about the surface of different natural objects (wetlands, lakes, rivers, etc.). In this work, we used radar altimetry data from TOPEX/Poseidon mission (T/P) covering the period from 1993 to 2001. To estimate the flooded areas we analyzed the backscatter coefficient which is the ratio between the power reflected from the surface and the incident power emitted by the onboard radar, expressed in decibels (dB). As calm water provides a much higher return signal than land, a threshold approach was used and validated with available in situ data and maps. Next we classified the watersheds into 4 groups according to the difference in seasonal signal: 1) the central part of the Ob-Irtysh interfluve area and its inner watershed, 2) the western part of the territory and the northern part of the Ob-Irtysh interfluve area, 3) the Ob-Yenisey interfluve area, 4) Surgut swamp region and rivers in the north of Western Siberia territory. The proposed classification corresponds well to those proposed by Zemtsov (2003). Finally, a significant correlation between the flooded zones and summer precipitation from reanalysis data was found for several watersheds that validate good applicability of satellite altimetry data for estimation the variability of flooded and wet zones.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				NOV	2012		364					173	+																WOS:000421514800035

Significance of paleovalley sediments and landscape in the development of stream salinity in three southwest Australian catchments	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Cenozoic fluvial sediments present west of the Meckering Line occur at similar elevation ranges (mostly 200-260m AHD) in the largely rejuvenated forested landscapes of the Darling Plateau between the Helena River catchment and the south coast of Western Australia. These widespread paleovalley sediments are more continuous than previously recognised, and possess common hydrogeological characteristics. The upper parts of catchments in southwest Western Australia are flat and poorly drained with widespread salt lakes and wetland systems developed on the sediments. The lower rejuvenated landscapes below the base of remnant sediments, which are locally marked by saline springs and right angle changes in river courses, have undulating topography with well-defined drainage lines cut into competent basement rocks. This paper identifies groundwater flow systems associated with the paleovalley sediments in three varied catchments and describes the role of the Cenozoic sand aquifer in the development and potential management of dryland salinity. Groundwater flow in the Cenozoic paleovalley sand aquifer has more significance for land and water salinisation than that in the local weathered basement. The sand aquifer is a conduit for salt mobilised from weathered basement following land clearing. Erosion of the sedimentary profile by rejuvenation has exposed this sand aquifer within specific elevation ranges in modern drainages facilitating saline groundwater discharge, and land and water salinisation. In the Helena River catchment 63% of the salt load to the Mundaring Reservoir is discharged through this sand aquifer in only 30% of the streamflow. Such mismatched salt load and flow means southwest landscapes respond differently to key dryland and stream salinity management actions. Revegetation to reduce the salt load should target areas of weathered basement locally discharging saline groundwater to the sand aquifer. Reforestation elsewhere in the rejuvenated bedrock landscape can, by contrast, reduce the streamflow (that is diluting large salt loads from the remnant sedimentary landscapes) and hence raise the overall stream salinity.																			0812-0099	1440-0952					2010	57	2					221	230	PII 919326749	10.1080/08120090903521689	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120090903521689													WOS:000277464000005

Estuarine foraminifera record Holocene stratigraphic changes and Holocene climate changes in ENSO and the North American monsoon: Baffin Bay, Texas	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												During the last Quaternary sea level fall (120- ka), Baffin Bay was formed by the down-cutting of the Los Olmos, San Fernando, and Petronila Creeks of south Texas. When sea level rose, this incised valley was then filled with mixed siliciclastic/carbonate sediments that record coastal environmental change over the past 10 Icy. Previous sedimentological and seismic analysis shows that Baffin Bay contains atypical depositional environments as a result of its semi-arid climate setting and isolation from the Gulf of Mexico. Three prominent stratigraphic surfaces can be recognized within the bay deposits, and are chronostratigraphically constrained using radiocarbon dates. The purpose of the present study is to use foraminifera to create a separate account of change and to determine if foraminiferal data corroborate sedimentological evidence for sea level and climate fluctuations. Foraminifera were sampled at 20 cm intervals from a 14.4 m dated core and from surface and subsurface sediments of five cores along a dip transect. Multiple discriminate analysis was used to compare sections of the core by species proportions, and clearly delineates three different foraminiferal communities: deltaic, open-bay, and hypersaline. Breaks between these communities coincide with two of the surfaces observed in the core, one at about 8.0 Icy and the other around 5.5 ky. Rapid sea level rise at the 8.0 ky flooding surface corresponds with a shift from a deltaic to an open-bay foraminiferal assemblage, while faunal change across the 5.5 ky surface is due to the formation of a large barrier island (Padre Island) and the onset of more arid climate conditions. Prior to the isolation of Baffin Bay at 55 Icy, foraminiferal assemblages do not correspond to climate change records, perhaps because open circulation with the Gulf of Mexico tempered regional climate effects on bay salinity. After 5.5 ky, changes in foraminiferal assemblages correspond to independently derived records of the El Niflo-Southern Oscillation and North American monsoon. Foraminiferal analysis supports sedimentological interpretations in that assemblages and sediments track climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Objective: To investigate whether dexamethasone or tadalafil reduces the incidence of HAPE and acute mountain sickness (AAAS) in adults with a history of HAPE. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study performed in summer 2003. Setting: Ascent from 490 in within 24 hours and stay for 2 nights at 4559 in. Patients: 29 adults with previous HAPE. Intervention: Prophylactic tadalafil (10 mg), dexamethasone (8 mg), or placebo twice daily during ascent and stay at 4559 m. Measurements: Chest radiography was used to diagnose HAPE. A Lake Louise score greater than 4 defined AMS. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure was measured by using Doppler echocardiography, and nasal potentials were measured as a surrogate marker of alveolar sodium transport. Results, Two participants who received tadalafil developed severe AMS on arrival at 4559 m and withdrew from the study; they did not have HAPE at that time. High-altitude pulmonary edema developed in 7 of 9 participants receiving placebo and 1 of the remaining 8 participants receiving tadalafil but in none of the 10 participants receiving dexamethasone (P = 0.007 for tadalafil vs. placebo; P < 0.001 for dexamethasone vs. placebo). Eight of 9 participants receiving placebo, 7 of 10 receiving tadalafil, and 3 of 10 receiving dexamethasone had AMS (P = 1.0 for tadalafil vs. placebo; P = 0.020 for dexamethasone vs. placebo). At high altitude, systolic pulmonary artery pressure increased less in participants receiving dexamethasone (16 mm Hg [95% Cl, 9 to 23 mm Hg]) and tadalafil (13 mm Hg [Cl, 6 to 20 mm Hg]) than in those receiving placebo (28 mm Hg [Cl, 20 to 36 min Hg]) (P = 0.005 for tadalafil vs. placebo; P = 0.012 for dexamethasone vs. placebo). No statistically significant difference between groups was found in change in nasal potentials and expression of leukocyte sodium transport protein messenger RNA. Limitations: The study involved a small sample of adults with a history of HAPE. Conclusions: Both dexamethasone and tadalafil decrease systolic pulmonary artery pressure and may reduce the incidence of HAPE in adults with a history of HAPE. Dexamethasone prophylaxis may also reduce the incidence of AMS in these adults.

J	BLAIR, TC; MCPHERSON, JG				BLAIR, TC; MCPHERSON, JG			HISTORICAL ADJUSTMENTS BY WALKER RIVER TO LAKE-LEVEL FALL OVER A TECTONICALLY TILTED HALF-GRABEN FLOOR, WALKER LAKE BASIN, NEVADA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Historical records of lake and river adjustments in the tectonically active, north-south elongated, Walker Lake extensional basin of west-central Nevada provide important insight to the style and rate that rivers react to tectonic tilt in half grabens. The northern part of this basin, historically containing Walker Lake, is now occupied by the south-flowing Walker River. Walker Lake, presently restricted to the central basin sector, is a perennial water body 30 m deep sustained by, and forming the terminus of, Walker River. Both the river and lake have a strongly assymmetric distribution, located preferentially near the active Walker Lake fault bounding the western basin margin. Walker Lake has withdrawn from the northern basin sector since 1882 due to a 45 m drop in lake level caused by human diversion of the river upstream. This withdrawal has forced Walker River to incrementally lengthen, and to sequentially reposition its delta along the retreating northern lake margin. Twelve deltas have been deposited since 1882 in response to these changes. The initiation of eight of the twelve post-1882 deltas was associated with channel avulsion, and four with channel lengthening. Ten of the twelve channel and delta relocation events entailed significant westward lateral movements toward the Walker Lake fault, illustrating the dominating influence of the basin-floor tectonic tilt on river adjustments. The two eastward shifts were triggered intrinsically by avulsions resulting from erosion of the outer bank of channel meanders. The three phases of progressive westward shifting of the river towards the Walker Lake fault occurred over periods of 18, 6, and 16 years, respectively, documenting the rapid response time of Walker River to basin-floor tectonic tilt despite the countering effects of the intrinsic avulsions, and hindrances to lateral migration caused by the muddy substrate of the former lake bottom deposits within which the river is incised.																			0037-0738					AUG	1994	92	1-2					7	16		10.1016/0037-0738(94)00058-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0037-0738(94)00058-1													WOS:A1994PC72900002

Within fourteen lakes and marine lagoons from the inner part of Bredefjord (Nordre Sermilik) in southern Greenland, isolations revealed by stratigraphic and palaeoecological analyses are dated and relative sea levels reconstructed. Due to coastal emergence caused by the GIS retreat within the area, the relative sea-level fell rapidly in the early Holocene between at least c. 9600 and c. 7300 cal. yrs BP attaining a rate of 2 cm per year between 9600 and 8000 cal. yrs BP. Spatial variability in relative sea-level changes is show for southern Greenland from a comparison with the Nanortalik and the Qagortoq areas. The regression occurred about 2000 years later in the inner Bredefjord area, compared to the Nanortalik area, and about 1000 years later compared to the Qaqortoq area. This is a consequence of earlier deglaciation in areas located at the outer coast. Between c. 8000 cal. yrs BP and the present day, relative sea level was lower than today. The lowest relative sea level in the Inner Bredefjord area of between -5.4 and -15 m a.h.a.t. (above highest astronomical tide) was reached between 7000 and 1000 cal. yrs BP. The neoglacial readvance together with the collapse of the Laurentide peripheral bulge is probably responsible for the transgression in the Inner Bredefjord area, as has been indicated from the nearby sites Qagortoq and Nanortalik. Our relative sea-level reconstructions showing spatial variability within southern Greenland have implications for Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) modelling and the understanding of the GIS ice sheet dynamics. The early Holocene regression is consistent with the recession of the southern sector of the GIS from the shelf edge at c. 22 000 cal. yrs BP, reaching inland of the present day outer coast by c. 12 000 cal. yrs BP, and its present margin by c. 10 500 cal. yrs BP.

In an attempt to determine the importance of these high cyanobacteria densities to planktonic herbivory in the system, short-term grazing experiments were conducted in July and August 1987. Using size-fractionated river phytoplankton assemblages, zooplankton grazing rates were determined for dominant or subdominant planktonic microzooplankton and mesozooplankton feeding on C-14-labeled river assemblages, C-14-labeled river assemblages enriched with unlabeled cyanobacteria, and unlabeled river assemblages enriched with C-14-labeled cyanobacteria. Grazing rates were estimated for the rotifers Polyarthra remata, Hexarthra mira, Asplanchna brightwelli, Brachionus angularis, Epiphanes sp., Trichocerca similis, and the cyclopoid copepod Cyclops vernalis. Neither rotifers nor the copepod grazed heavily on Microcystis. Rotifer grazing rates on labeled cyanobacteria ranged from 4 to 1,650 nl . [individual . h]-1 while copepod rates ranged from undetectable to 135 mul . [copepod . h]-1. Grazing rates on labeled river phytoplankton assemblages were 4-100 times higher than noted for zooplankton feeding on cyanobacteria. The addition of the colonial alga to labeled river phytoplankton assemblages resulted in mixed zooplankton responses, that is, lower and higher grazing rates than observed on river assemblages with no added cyanobacteria. Total zooplankton demand for cyanobacteria and river phytoplankton assemblages was estimated for the study period july-August 1987. Rotifer plus C. vernalis herbivory would have removed 1-5% and 49%, respectively, of the standing stock of the two autotroph pools each day. Literature-derived clearance rates for Bosmina indicate, however, that herbivory by this cladoceran could increase demand to 24% and 60%, respectively, in bloom and nonbloom assemblages. These data suggest that the majority of cyanobacterial production remains ungrazed and may be transported to the lower estuary for salinity-induced aggregation and sedimentation.																			0160-8347					DEC	1993	16	4					859	872		10.2307/1352445	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1352445													WOS:A1993MW14700018

Soc. 133(2): 225-239. 2006-Frequency of groundlayer plants was measured across oak woodland canopy gaps at three sites in northwest Indiana to examine how vegetation varied with gap size, direction along the gap edge, and microhabitat. Microhabitats were defined as under the canopy adjacent to the gap, along the gap edge, and within the gap. Gap-sites consisted of gaps plus adjacent tree canopy. Gaps were classified as small (16 +/- 1 m(2)), medium (97 +/- 8), and large (310 +/- 32). Neither richness nor diversity differed among microhabitats, gap sizes, or edges. Similarity between microhabitats wthin a gap-site increased as the distance between plots decreased and as the difference in PAR decreased, the latter explaining twice the variation in percent dissimilarity compared to Mg concentration, A horizon depth, and litter cover. Diervilla lonicera, Frageria virginiana, Helianthus divaricatus, Polygonatum pubescens, Quercus velutina, Smilacena stellata, and Tradescantia ohiensis decreased, while Tephrosia virginiana and legumes increased in frequency, from canopy to gap, and C-4 grasses peaked at the gap edge, independent of gap size. Additional species frequency varied across the microhabitat gradient within specific sites. Sorghastrum nutans was three times more frequent in gaps at large sites than elsewhere. The vegetation in medium-sized gap-sites was more variable than within small and large gap-sites, suggesting greater environmental heterogeneity at that scale. Within gap-sites, vegetation was more heterogeneous within edges and canopies than in gaps. Edges were more similar in composition to gaps than to canopy groundlayer within gap-sites. Few species varied significantly in frequency around the gap edge. The oak woodland groundlayer on sandy substrates can be characterized as a mosaic of forb dominated vegetation that varies across light gradients associated with canopy gaps, transitioning to islands of grassland vegetation when gaps exceed 160 m(2).																			1095-5674	1940-0616				APR-JUN	2006	133	2					225	239		10.3159/1095-5674(2006)133[225:GVGAOW]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3159/1095-5674(2006)133[225:GVGAOW]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000240212300002
J	KAZMER, M				KAZMER, M			BIRTH, LIFE AND DEATH OF THE PANNONIAN LAKE	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Miocene-Pliocene Pannonian Lake formed in an extensional basin system behind the compressional arc of the Carpathians. Its size and depth were comparable to those of the Caspian Sea. Subsidence began in Middle Miocene times, forming deep, pelagic basins, separated by reef-bearing ridges. Clastic influx filled the marginal basins during Middle Miocene time. Prograding deltas dissected the lake and completed the infilling of the basin system by the end of the Pliocene. Basin plain, prodelta, delta front, delta plain, beach, fluviatile, and marsh environments can be recognized. Terminal Miocene uplift of the Carpathians isolated the Pannonian region from the rest of Paratethys. The subsequent decrease of salinity resulted in the evolution of an endemic, freshwater mollusc fauna. Rich nutrient influx from rivers supported high organic productivity (dinoflagellates, diatoms, nannoplankton, foraminifers, ostracods, etc.), yielding organic-rich sediments. Preservation of organic matter was helped by a stratified water column and oxygen deficient bottom conditions. Deep burial, continuing subsidence, and high geothermal flux due to an extremely thin crust, led to the formation of commercially exploitable oil and gas accumulations. Shallow lacustrine zones of basin margins provided suitable environments for a rich Congeria-Melanopsis mollusc fauna. Wave action on beaches produced commercially exploitable pure quartz and deposits. Taxodium and Alnus forests flourished around the lake producing enormous lignite deposits. Besides a rich land snail and mammal fauna, prehominids lived in the forests. There was a warm, temperate climate, with probably frostfree winters. Basaltic volcanoes overlooked the landscape, and maars hosted minor lakes with rich algal flora forming oil shale. The catchment area included most of the Carpathians and parts of the Alps and Dinarides. The positive water balance resulted in a supposed overflow in the southern margin, supplying exotic fauna to the South Carpathian and Dacian basins of the Eastern Paratethys. The Pannonian Lake was completely filled by the end of Pilocene. Recent lakes in the Carpathian Basin are not descendants of it.

THE ROLE OF LAKE SHORE SAND DEPOSITS AS BANK OF CILIATE, ROTIFER AND CRUSTACEAN RESTING FORMS: EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The experiment, with the use of sand deposit from hygroarenal (shore sand beach wetted by lake waves) of the beach of eutrophic Lake Mikolajskie (Masurian Lakeland, Poland), was performed in order to test the hypothesis that shore sand deposit is the bank of resting forms of ciliate, rotifer and crustacean species. The experiment was conducted over a 38 days period in March-April 2004. Frozen sand taken in winter was exposed in aquariums filled with pre-filtered (GF/C) lake water in stable temperature (20 degrees C), oxygen saturation and 12:12 light/dark conditions. Samples (three replicates) were taken each day. A total number of 44 ciliate, 59 rotifer and 9 crustacean taxa were identified during the studied period. Resting forms of different species and/ or taxonomic groups developed in different time and it may be the result of different strategies in colonization of new habitats. Organisms forming resting cysts such as ciliates (11 species) and bdelloid rotifers appeared after the first day of the incubation whereas organisms hatching from resting eggs (monogonont rotifers and crustacea) were observed from the 2nd-3rd day of the experiment. The numbers of all the studied groups of organisms increased gradually and then strongly decreased indicating probably nutrient and/or organic matter limitation. The highest numbers of ciliates (731 ind, cm(-2) of sand) was found on the 5th day, rotifers (987 ind. 100 cm(-2)) on the 23(rd) day, cladocerans (60 ind. 100 cm(-2)) on the 21(st) day and copepods (30 ind. 100 cm(-2)) on the 33(rd) day of the experiment. The results of this study suggests that shore sand deposits being the temporal refugium for the small-bodied invertebrates transported here with the wave action may also play an important role as the transfer for their further dispersal in addition to postulated ways of expansions such as wind, rain, animals and surface runoff.

Its highest peak Musala is of 2,925 m altitude. It is situated in part of the Rila-Rhodopean Massive in southwest Bulgaria, the Balkans' oldest land. Rila is a domeshaped horst mountain, composed of various metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary rocks. Many of the high-grade metamorphic rocks are of Precambrian age. It is believed that the oldest rocks in the area are the metamorphites of the Ograzhden Supergroup, composed of amphibolites, amphibole-biotite schists, gneisses and migmatites of Early Precambrian age. The younger Rhodopean Supergroup is composed of migmatites, gneisses, metaultrabasites, marbles and distene-silimanite schists and amphibolites. The Late Precambrian and Early Paleozoic are represented by low-grade metamorphic rocks - green schists, phyllites, metadiabases and diorites. They are intruded by the granitoids of the Eocene Rila-West Rhodopean batholith. During the Cenozoic basin-range fault blocks were formed, filled with sedimentary rocks. The modeling of the fault-block structure of the mountain started during the Late Alpine stage. Rila's alpine relief was formed during the Plio-Pleistocene by a series of glaciations. During the most recent Wurm glaciation, the lower boundary of the glaciers was at 2,200 m. Above this line they radically changed the existing relief, carving out deep cirques, pyramid-shaped peaks, glacier valleys, moraines and other typical glacial formations. More than 200 glacial lakes disposed between 2,000 and 2,700 m altitude are among the most remarkable remnants of the Quaternary glaciations. At the foot of the mountain there are many hot mineral sources, associated with the surrounding faults, the most famous of which is the only geyser in the Balkans with water temperature 101,4 degrees C. All these advantages are a good basis for developing a National Geopark, which will boost the local economy through geotourism and winter sports.																			1314-2704		978-619-7105-31-5				2015							529	536																WOS:000371662300067

USA, reveal evidence for development of a deep paleoweathering profile with geochemical biosignatures consistent with the presence of microbial communities and weakly oxygenated conditions. Weathering profiles are characterized by a 5-50 m thick regolith that consists of saprolitized Saganaga Tonalite and Paulson Lake succession basaltic metavolcanic rocks retaining rock structure, which is cross-cut by a major unconformity surface marking development of a successor basin infilled with alluvial deposits. The regolith and unconformity are overlain by thick conglomerate deposits that contain both intrabasinal (saprock) as well as extrabasinal detritus. Thin-section microscopy and electron microprobe analyses reveal extensive hydrolysis and sericitization of feldspars, exfoliation and chloritization of biotite, and weathering of Fe-Mg silicates and Cu-Fe sulfides: weathering of Fe-Ti oxides was relatively less intense than for other minerals and evidence was found for precipitation of Fe oxides. Geochemical analyses of the tonalite, assuming immobile TiO2 during weathering (tau(Tij)), show depletion of SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O, CaO, MgO, and MnO, and to a lesser degree of K2O, relative to least-weathered parent materials. Significant Fe was lost from the tonalite. A paleoatmospheric pCO(2) of 10-50 times PAL is estimated based on geochemical mass-balance of the tonalite profile and assuming a formation time of 50-500 Kyr. Interpretations of metabasalt paleoweathering are complicated by additions of sediment to the profile and extensive diagenetic carbonate (dolomite) overprinting. Patterns of release of P and Fe and retention of Y and Cu in tonalite are consistent with recent laboratory experiments of granite weathering, and with the presence of acidic conditions in the presence of organic ligands (produced, for example, by a primitive microbial community) during weathering. Cu metal in the profile may document lower pO(2) than present day at the surface. Comparison with previous studies of weathered tonalite and basalt (Denison, 2.45-2.22 Ga) in Ontario, Canada, reveal general similarities in paleoweathering with our study, as well as important differences related to lower paleoatmospheric pO(2) and terrestrial biosignature for the older Minnesota profile. A falling water table in the Alpine Lake locality is presumed to have promoted formation of this gossan-like deep-weathering system that extends to 50-m depth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A geochemical and sedimentary record of high southern latitude Holocene climate evolution from Lago Fagnano, Tierra del Fuego	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Situated at the southern margin of the hemispheric westerly wind belt and immediately north of the Antarctic Polar Frontal zone, Tierra del Fuego is well-positioned to monitor coupled changes in the ocean-atmosphere system of the high southern latitudes. Here we describe a Holocene paleoclimate record from sediment cores obtained from Lago Fagnano, a large lake in southern Tierra del Fuego at 55 degrees S, to investigate past changes in climate related to these two important features of the global climate system. We use an AMS radiocarbon chronology for the last 8000 yr based on pollen concentrates, thereby avoiding contamination from bedrock-derived lignite. Our chronology is consistent with a tephrochronologic age date for deposits from the middle Holocene Volcan Hudson eruption. Combining bulk organic isotopic (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and elemental (C and N) parameters with physical sediment properties allows us to better understand sediment provenance and transport mechanisms and to interpret Holocene climate and tectonic change during the last 8000 yr. Co-variability and long-term trends in C/N ratio, carbon accumulation rate, and magnetic susceptibility reflect an overall Holocene increase in the delivery of terrestrial organic and lithogenic material to the deep eastern basin. We attribute this variability to westerly wind-derived precipitation. Increased wind strength and precipitation in the late Holocene drives the Nothofagus forest eastward and enhances run-off and terrigenous inputs to the lake. Superimposed on the long-term trend are a series of abrupt 9 negative departures in C/N ratio, which constrain the presence of seismically-driven mass flow events in the record. We identify an increase in bulk delta C-13 between 7000 and 5000 cal yr BP that we attribute to enhanced aquatic productivity driven by warmer summer temperatures. The Lago Fagnano delta C-13 record shows similarities with Holocene records of sea surface temperature from the mid-latitude Chilean continental shelf and Antarctic air temperatures from the Taylor Dome ice core record in East Antarctica. Mid-Holocene warming occurred simultaneously across the Antarctic Frontal Zone, and in particular, in locations currently influenced by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

This paper pre sents detailed information from the Darss Sill threshold area as well as the adjacent basins, i.e. the Mecklenburg Bay and Arkona Basin located in the southwesternmost Baltic. The threshold area was transgressed at the Baltic Ice Lake maximum phase and during the following regression about 10.3 ka BP a river valley was incised in the Darss Sill to a level of 23-24 m below present sea level (b.s.l.). Preboreal sediments in the study area show lowstand basin deposition in the Arkona Basin and the existence of a local lake in Mecklenburg Bay. The lowstand system is followed by the Ancylus Lake transgression that reached a maximum level of 19 m b.s.l. Thus, at the maximum level the water depth was about 5 m over the threshold, and the shore level fall during the Ancylus Lake regression must be in the same range. The Darss Sill area is the key area for drainage of the Ancylus Lake, and if the previously suggested regression of 8-10 m in southeastern Sweden is to be achieved, isostatic rebound must also play a role. The existence of the so-called Dana River in the Darss Sill area cannot be supported by our investigations. We observed no signs of progressive erosion of the Darss Sill area in the Early Holocene, and there are no prograding systems in Mecklenburg Bay that can be related to the Ancylus Lake regression. On the contrary, local lakes developed in Mecklenburg Bay and in the Darss Sill threshold area. In the Darss Sill area, marl was deposited in a lake in the valley that developed after the fnal drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake. Studies of diatoms and macrofossils, combined with seismic interpretation and radiocarbon dating, provide detailed information about the chronology and the relative shore level of these lake phases as well as about environmental conditions in the lakes.

AD 1580 and 2001 at Lake Silvaplana, a varved lake located in the Engadine, eastern Swiss Alps. The goal of this study was to reconstruct temperature changes at near-annual resolution, and validate the reconstruction by comparison with records based on early instrumental data, documentary proxy evidence, dendrochronology, geochemical (biogenic silica (BSi)) and mineralogical data (quartz/mica ratios) at local and regional scales. Warmer than-the-climate-normal (AD 1961-1990) mean July air temperatures were inferred between c. AD 1610 and 1662, AD 1710 and 1740, AD 1790 and 1866, AD 1940 and 1960 and AD 1990 and 2001. Colder-than-the-climate-normal July air temperatures were reconstructed between c. AD 1662 and 1710, AD 1740 and 1790, AD 1866 and 1919, and AD 1970 and 1990. The 420-year chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature record was significantly (p < 0.01) related to June-September (JJAS) temperatures reconstructed from early instrumental and documentary data at regional scale, JJA temperature inferred from documentary proxy evidence at local scale and summer temperatures based on early instrumental data in central Europe. When the Z-scores of warm/cold periods were compared between records, only one period (c. AD 1740-1790) did not show significant correlations between the chironomid record and any of the eight other records considered here, probably because of increased precipitation and changes in the sediment composition which influenced the chironomid assemblages. 75% of the periods considered had significant correlations between the chironomid records, and both the reconstruction based on quartz/mica ratios and the inferred JJAS early instrumental and documentary proxy evidence, while 60% of the periods showed significant correlations between the chironomid-based record and the reconstruction based on early instrumental data of Central Europe. These results suggest that chironomids in the sediment of wake Silvaplana yield valid temperature reconstructions at regional scales for the last 420 years.					; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Trachsel, Mathias/I-2194-2017	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Trachsel, Mathias/0000-0003-0078-5795													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2009	19	8					1201	1212		10.1177/0959683609348253	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683609348253													WOS:000271911200008
J	Naidu, PD				Naidu, PD			Driving forces of Indian summer monsoon on Milankovitch and sub-Milankovitch time scales: A review	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												A scientific consensus exists that tectonic evolution of Himalaya is the main cause of monsoon initiation and evolution in southeast Asia. Several forcing factors such as tectonic, solar insolation, latent heat transport, albedo of the earth surface and deep water circulation changes drive the variability of southwest (SW) monsoon in the Indian subcontinent. Different forcing factors act on different time scales. Arabian Sea sediments consist of distinct fauna that are endemic to areas of upwelling. The SW monsoon wind strength, upwelling in the Arabian Sea and precipitation in the subcontinent are inter linked. Thus Arabian Sea sediments provide a record of past monsoon variability covering a time span of a few million years. Detailed analysis of numerous monsoon indices and General Circulation Models (GCM) show that SW monsoon was strong during interglacials (warm periods) and weak during glacials (cold periods). Spectral analysis of detailed time series of monsoon indices reveal that the intensity of the SW monsoon fluctuates with periodicities of 100 ka and 23 ka. These periodicities of SW monsoon were attributed to the orbitally induced changes in solar radiation and surface boundary conditions (Milankovitch Theory). Recent high-resolution studies from the Oman Margin provide new evidences on the SW monsoon variability on century time scale and a Sub-Milankovitch Periodicity in the range of 2,200 to 2,400 years. The SW monsoon variability on century scale and high frequency periodicities might be forced by the deep water circulation changes in high latitudes. The present review discusses the atmospheric C-14 changes and recent onset of aridity in the tropics, which is also linked to the SW monsoon variability in one way or other.

Although two of the lakes lie beyond the mapped limits of late Quaternary glaciation, their records only extend to similar to 12,000 yr B.P. The third site lies within the limits of the late Wisconsin Laurentide advance and a basal radiocarbon date provides a minimum date of ca. 11,500 yr B.P. for retreat of the northwestern margin of Laurentide ice. Artemisia and Salix-dominated herb-tundra occurred at all elevations from at least 12,000 yr B.P. until ca. 10,200 yr B.P., when shrub tundra dominated by Betula glandulosa expanded throughout the region. Populus balsamifera was also present by this time and probably grew up to and beyond the current treeline. Picea arrived in the central Mackenzie Mountains by 8500 yr B.P., and expanded to the elevation of the current treeline by 8000 yr B.P. Vegetation composition became similar to that of the present by 6000 yr B.P. with the expansion of Alnus at all elevations. Pollen accumulation rates and detrended correspondence analysis suggest Picea population densities in the forest-tundra were greater than present between ca. 8000 yr B.P. and 5000 yr B.P. and have since declined steadily. At the open forest site, Picea population density has not declined in the late Holocene, but the forest composition has shifted towards a greater affinity with higher elevation sites. In general, the changes apparent in the treeline vegetation of the Mackenzie Mountains during the postglacial are consistent with predicted changes in summer insolation based on the Milankovitch theory.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				FEB	1995	113	2-4					351	371		10.1016/0031-0182(95)00070-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(95)00070-3													WOS:A1995QN17700014
J	EVERLY, RT				EVERLY, RT			LOSS IN CORN YIELD ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF THE CORN LEAF APHID, RHOPALOSIPHUM-MAIDIS, IN INDIANA	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The corn leaf aphid is a common pest of corn in Indiana, causing occasional damage in a few widely scattered fields. In 1959, conditions favored the development of this insect and serious losses occurred in many corn fields in the northern two-thirds of the State. The area of heaviest infestation was a band three counties wide in the north central part of the State, from Warren and Fountain counties on the west to the Ohio line, and a single row of counties north and west along the Michigan line to Lake Michigan. The area of greatest losses followed a similar pattern. Losses in yield as high as 40% occurred in many fields. The data obtained under these conditions of widespread and heavy infestations supported previous observations that severe infestations result in barren plants. In addition, such infestations also increased the production of nubbins. In one field, data indicated that light infestations can also reduce the yields as much as 10% through decreased size and weight of ears. There was also evidence that commercial hybrid corn varies in degree of infestation and tolerance to loss by this insect. Data from the 12 areas of Indiana used for the Fall Corn Insect Survey indicated a high degree of correlation between loss of yield and percent of plants infested. It was possible to estimate the amount of loss in individual fields from this relationship when the percentage of plants infested was known. The relationship of reduction in yield and infestation by the corn leaf aphid will probably vary from year to year as the interaction of control factors change, but it indicated the possibility of establishing a relationship of infestation and loss through the proper evaluation of environmental factors.																			0022-0493	1938-291X					1960	53	5					924	932		10.1093/jee/53.5.924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/53.5.924													WOS:A1960WX63100061

In this context, shallow lakes are considered particularly sensitive to a changing environment and it is essential to acknowledge their water quality conditions and recent trends to guide effective water resource management and mitigation strategies. The European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) offers globally consistent satellite observations of the Lakes Essential Climate Variable (ECV) including satellite products such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), turbidity and surface water temperature (LSWT) for over 2000 lakes during 1992-2020. From this dataset, we extracted a subset of 347 lakes with mean depth <= 3 m distributed globally to investigate a long-term timeseries (2002-2020) for Chl-a and turbidity. Theil-Sen trend analysis showed that Chl-a did not change significantly in 33 % of lakes, significantly increased in 45 % and decreased in 22 % of the lakes, while turbidity significantly increased in 60 % and decreased in 17 % of lakes. Most lakes with increasing Chl-a and turbidity trends were located in lowland areas, and had relatively large areas (surface area >50 km(2)). Further analysis revealed that the majority of lakes showed a concurrent increase in both Chl-a (48 %) and turbidity (50 %) with LSWT, indicating the potential influence of climate warming on lake water quality. A structural equations model-based analysis used for modelling the interactions between climatic, socioeconomic features and water conditions overall showed that Chl-a and turbidity had a concurrent positive increase with population and gross regional product in most lakes. This finding suggests that the impact of human population growth in lake catchments represents an important factor driving pressures on the water quality of shallow lakes.					; Albergel, Clement/B-8896-2012; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; Simis, Stefan/B-1703-2008; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013	Simis, Stefan/0000-0002-6296-9146; Pinardi, Monica/0000-0001-5289-8842; Albergel, Clement/0000-0003-1095-2702; Giardino, Claudia/0000-0002-3937-4988; Greife, A.

J	Fortelli, A; Scafetta, N; Mazzarella, A				Fortelli, Alberto; Scafetta, Nicola; Mazzarella, Adriano			Local Warming in the Historical Center of Naples	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND TECHNOLOGY												Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a physical process getting more and more hazardous for people living in a large city. It can be influenced by several factors such as geomorphological context, the presence of lakes, rivers or sea, the land use and urban features with special regard to the presence of extended green areas/infrastructures. The metropolitan area of Naples is heavy affected by UHI in a very complex manner due to the simultaneous action of various morphological and orographic factors (e.g. presence of hills and closeness to sea surface) so to prevent the quantification of each percentage weight. This large amount of parameters makes it difficult to identify a clear relationship with urbanization features. Therefore, it is strictly necessary to enhance the knowledge of urban micro-climate by focusing on the evolution of the temperature and relative humidity. To obtain a clearer representation of the process, we propose a methodology based on the collection and the analysis of a specific set of high quality data. An appropriate study of this phenomenon has to be carried on by analyzing directly thermo-hygrometric data measured by appropriate local sensors instead of remote sensing technologies which could lead distorted scenarios. The goal is to characterize the thermal properties of the atmosphere layers below 50 m above the ground. In fact, people live within the "building envelope" that is thermo-hygrometrically regulated.

C	Ataberk, E; Baykal, F		Efe, R; Ozturk, M		Ataberk, Emre; Baykal, Fusun			Utilization of natural and cultural resources of Dikili (Izmir) for tourism	2ND INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHY SYMPOSIUM-MEDITERRANEAN ENVIRONMENT 2010	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences				2nd International Geography Symposium-Mediterranean Environment	JUN 02-05, 2010	Antalya, TURKEY					Agriculture, fishing, greenhousing, carpet manufacturing, granite stone engraving and tourism are the primary sources of income in Dikili, Izmir. Tourism started to develop in the region since the 1980s and recently, coastal tourism and domestic tourism have gained importance. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that beside coasts where coastal tourism takes place, Dikili, has natural and cultural sources required for development of thermal tourism and rural tourism/ecotourism. Additionally, presenting these sources give way to provide numerous opportunities as a power, is complement aim. The presence of high-flow geothermal water sources in Kaynarca and Ilica districts in Dikili provides opportunities for heating houses and performing greenhousing in the districts, however Nebiler, Bademli, Kocaoba, French hot springs and etc. offer a great potential for the development of thermal tourism. The land allocations for the establishment of two facilities in Dikili indicate that the region will soon be mentioned with thermal tourism. Except for the Aegean Sea and geothermal waters, the mountains, mountain pastures, islands, lakes, waterfalls, caves, forests, monumental trees, natural medicinal plants, wild animals and scenic beauties indicate how rich natural geography Dikili has. Local economic products (olive, olive oil, marine products, Yagcibedir carpets and etc.), ancient cities, rock tombs and ruins of castles as well as villages display the diversity of cultural sources in the region. These all sources mean great attractions for rural tourism/ecotourism and the only shortcoming is that these products have not been branded or turned into touristic products yet. In this sense, the design of tracking paths, the establishment of shopping stands and the opening of some restaurants in some villages are primarly steps and touristic products to launch tourism. Finally in the study, SWOT analysis is made and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of Dikili in terms of thermal tourism and rural tourism/ecotourism are suggested. The paper has been written in the field of tourism geography and prepared after data collection, geographical observations, analysis and synthesis. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sinninghe			Drastic changes in the distribution of branched tetraether lipids in suspended matter and sediments from the Yenisei River and Kara Sea (Siberia): Implications for the use of brGDGT-based proxies in coastal marine sediments	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in soils has been shown to correlate with pH and mean annual air temperature. Because of this dependence brGDGTs have found an application as palaeoclimate proxies in coastal marine sediments, based on the assumption that their distribution is not altered during the transport from soils to marine systems by rivers. To study the processes acting on the brGDGT distributions, we analysed the full suite of brGDGTs, including the recently described 6-Me brGDGTs, in both the suspended particulate matter (SPM) of the Siberian Yenisei River and the SPM and sediments of its outflow in the Kara Sea. The brGDGT distribution in the SPM of the Yenisei River was fairly constant and characterized by high abundances of the 6-Me brGDGTs, reflecting their production at the neutral pH of the river water. However, the brGDGT distribution showed marked shifts in the marine system. Firstly, in the Yenisei River Mouth, the fractional abundance of the 6-Me brGDGTs decreases sharply. The brGDGT signature in the Yenisei River Mouth possibly reflects brGDGTs delivered during the spring floods that may carry a different distribution. Also, coastal cliffs were shown to contain brGDGTs and to influence especially those sites without major river inputs (e.g. Khalmyer Bay). Further removed from the river mouth, in-situ production of brGDGTs in the marine system influences the distribution. However, also the fractional abundance of the tetramethylated brGDGT 1a increases, resulting in a distribution that is distinct from in-situ produced signals at similar latitudes (Svalbard). We suggest that this shift may be caused by preferential degradation of labile (riverine in-situ produced) brGDGTs and the subsequent enrichment in less labile (soil) material. The offshore distribution indeed agrees with the brGDGT distribution encountered in a lowland peat. This implies that the offshore Kara Sea sediments possibly carry a soil-dominated signal, indicating potential for palaeoclimate reconstructions at this site. Both in the river system and coastal cliffs, brGDGTs were much more abundant than crenarchaeol, an archaeal isoprenoid GDGT, resulting in high (>0.93) Branched and Isoprenoid Tetraether (BIT) index values. Moving downstream in the marine sediments, a decrease in brGDGT concentrations, coeval with an increase in crenarchaeol, resulted in decreasing BIT index values. This decrease correlates with changes in bulk proxies for terrigenous input (delta C-13(org), C/N), confirming the use of the BIT index to trace the delivery of river-transported and coastal cliff-derived terrigenous organic matter.

THE DEPTH DISTRIBUTION OF SEISMICITY AT THE NORTHERN END OF THE RWENZORI MOUNTAINS: IMPLICATIONS FOR HEAT FLOW IN THE WESTERN BRANCH OF THE EAST AFRICAN RIFT SYSTEM IN UGANDA	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												Data from a six-month deployment of seismic stations around the northern end of the Rwenzori Mountains have been used to investigate the depth extent of seismicity and its implications for heat flow in the Western Branch of the East Africa Rift System in Uganda. Previous seismicity studies of the Western Branch in Uganda show earthquake nucleation at depths greater than or equal to 40 km suggesting that heat flow from the rift is not elevated. However, heat flow elsewhere in the Western Branch (e.g., western Tanzania and Lakes Kivu and Tanganyika) is elevated, similar to the elevated heat flow in the Eastern Branch of the East African Rift System in Kenya. To investigate further the depth extent of seismicity in the Western Branch, seismological clam were collected and analysed to obtain accurate hypocenters using both standard and double difference location algorithms. Focal mechanisms were also obtained to place constraints on the local stress regime. Results show that seismicity is concentrated along the major border faults of the Rwenzori hoist, suggesting an eastward dip on the Ruimi-Wasa Fault and a northwestward dip on the Toro-Bunyoro Fault. Fault motions are predominantly normal, with possible strike slip motions between the Ruimi-Wasa and Toro-Bunyoro Faults. The number of earthquakes increases with depth, peaking at 16 km and falling sharply by 22 km. Strength envelope models indicate that heat flow in the range of 54 mWm(-2) to 66 mWm(-2) is required to explain this result. A heat flow of 54 to 66 mWm(-2) is similar to heat flow in other mobile belts in East Africa away from major rift valleys, and therefore heat flow around the Rwenzori Mountains does not appear to be elevated. This finding does not preclude the possibility of a deep seated (i.e., mantle) thermal anomaly beneath the rift, which may not have had sufficient time to reach the surface.																			1012-0750	1996-8590				DEC	2009	112	3-4			SI		261	276		10.2113/gssajg.112.3-4.261	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gssajg.112.3-4.261													WOS:000277500800006

Long-term tagging reveals variable escapement of stocked Muskellunge among four Ohio reservoirs: Consequences for managing reservoir fisheries	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Muskellunge Esox masquinongy are stocked by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife (ODNR-DOW) into nine reservoirs to create trophy fisheries. Escapement is recognized as a potential impediment to maintaining quality fisheries in these reservoirs. We evaluated the escapement of Muskellunge at four reservoirs using mark-recapture methods during 2013-2022. At each reservoir, all juvenile Muskellunge (254-305 mm) stocked during 2013-2018 were implanted with passive-integrated-transponder (PIT) tags prior to release. In addition, adult mark-recapture sampling events were conducted by the ODNR-DOW during 2019-2022 to check for tagged fish and implant untagged fish. Muskellunge anglers were also outfitted with handheld PIT readers to scan and report tagged fish during the study. Escapement was monitored continuously with PIT tag detection systems installed within dam spillways. We used multi-state (in-reservoir vs escaped) mark-recapture models to estimate annual escapement for juvenile (<= age 1) and adult Muskellunge. A total of 51,826 fish were tagged (51,052 juveniles, 774 adults), resulting in 3428 detections (2316 individuals). The number of Muskellunge escaping varied widely among reservoirs (0-481). Most escapement (85 %) occurred during the spring (March-May). Nearly all (96 %) known age fish that escaped were age 3 or greater. Modelling revealed that annual probability of juvenile escapement (<= 0.02) was likely inconsequential at all reservoirs. However, adult escapement was highly variable among reservoirs (mean = 0-0.34). Escapement was lowest at reservoirs where water levels are managed via offshore sluice-gate tower structures, and greatest at locations where surface water is discharged from along-shore structures (i.e., crest gates and unregulated spillway). Where escapement occurred, there was a negative relationship between the annual probability of escapement and fishing success. Results will be useful for informing stocking strategies, mitigating fish loss, and managing fishery expectations.

Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush, mean weight, 5.9 g) were more tolerant, with a 96-h LC50 of 5.21 .mu.gSn/l. Rainbow trout concentrated significant levels of Bu3Sn+ during a 64-d exposure at 0.21 .mu.g Sn/l, with bioconcentration factors of 406 and 570 (based on Bu3Sn+ and total Sn, respectively). Rainbow trout depurated Sn slowly on transfer to Bu3Sn+-free water. During the 32 d period following transfer, the whole-body concentration of Bu3Sn+ fell by 25% while the total Sn concentration was reduced by 17%. The total Sn concentrations in tissues of rainbow trout at the end of a 15-d exposure to 0.42 .mu.g Sn/l indicated that Bu3Sn+ partitions into trout on the basis of a three-compartment model. Peritoneal fat (mean concentration, 9.18 mg Sn/kg) constituted one compartment, kidney, liver and gall bladder/bile (mean concentration range, 3.07 to 3.72 mg Sn/kg) a second, and all other tissues (mean concentration range, 0.49 to 1.53 mg Sn/kg) a third. After 15 d of depuration the system had simplified; only two compartments (liver plus gall bladder/bile and all other tissues) were apparent. Varying proportions of Bu3Sn+ and its metabolites di-n-butyltin, n-butyltin and inorganic tin were present in all tissues sampled. The percent of metabolites in liver (74) and gall bladder/bile (89) were, however, significantly higher than the levels in all other tissues, which ranged from 10 to 43. This suggests hepatic dealkylation and biliary-fecal excretion.																			0166-445X	1879-1514				JUL	1989	15	1					37	51		10.1016/0166-445X(89)90004-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-445X(89)90004-0													WOS:A1989AJ24600003
J	Krueger, R; Zoet, LK; Rawling, JE				Krueger, Russell; Zoet, Lucas K.; Rawling, J. Elmo, III			Coastal Bluff Evolution in Response to a Rapid Rise in Surface Water Level	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The water level in Lake Michigan began rising in 2013. Historically, erosion of the bluffs along the shoreline increases when water levels rise and remain high, beginning at the toe and propagating upslope, potentially damaging infrastructure near the crest. Bluff retreat is well understood over decadal scales; however, transient perturbations of force instabilities from toe to crest during disequilibrium are difficult to document. This instability for three bluffs, distinguished by height, was investigated using Scoops3D, a three-dimensional limit equilibrium stability model. For each study site, high-resolution (10 cm) elevation models were created using Structure from Motion from photographs collected by small unmanned aerial vehicle (sUAV), and steady state groundwater models were developed using MODFLOW. These were used as inputs for Scoops3D along with physical properties of the sediment reported in the literature. Photographs from all sites and a repeat sUAV flight at one site verified the model results. Slope angle and relative strength of the sediment are the most significant factors controlling stability, while pore water pressure below the water table acts as a destabilizing agent. At the time of the analysis, unstable surfaces had propagated to the top of the shortest bluffs while the propagation was still working upslope in the tallest bluffs. Unstable surfaces progressed up the bluff faces at an average rate of similar to 4.4 m/year, indicating the tallest bluff faces will not experience crest recession for a minimum of a decade following stabilization of the toe after waterlevels stabilize or begin to fall. Plain Language Summary Recent rising lake levels in the North American Great Lakes is causing bluff erosion. Since 2013, the level of Lake Michigan has increased about 1 m at a rate of 16 cm/year, a rate of water level rise that has been observed several times over the past 100 years. We used a drone-mounted camera to photograph three eroding bluffs along the southwestern shoreline of Lake Michigan. High-resolution digital elevation models of the bluff shape from the pictures were used in a three-dimensional slope failure model. This model includes the slope shape, ground water elevation, and material properties of the bluff to predict areas that are likely to fail. Our results indicate that failures beginning at the base of the bluff migrate upslope at a rate of similar to 4.4 m per year, and the tallest bluffs will continue to erode at the top for at least a decade after the base stabilizes. This information will be relevant for people and organizations with infrastructure located near the coast.

This shallow lake (up to 4 m deep) has limited water exchange with the adjacent sea through an artificial channel and karst formations. Based on the largest variances estimated from 1-min water level series measured between September 2021 and March 2024 under different mean water level conditions, the eight strongest episodes were analysed. Most episodes were observed during the colder part of the year, particularly between November and January. A decrease in the periods of spectral peaks by approximately 25% was documented between episodes occurring during maximum and minimum mean water level conditions. Most episodes were associated with a strong mid-troposphere jet, with its core located southwest or west of the lake, and a cyclone centered west or northwest of the lake. A strong episode observed during the summer months-on 5 September 2024-resembled synoptic conditions typically seen during Mediterranean meteotsunamis. All investigated water level oscillations were linked to travelling mesoscale convective systems. Modelling exercises indicate that the strongest lake oscillations correspond to the fundamental seiches of the lake, driven mostly by along-lake winds, while air pressure forcing contributes primarily to higher-frequency seiche modes. Modelled strong currents, reaching up to 50 cm/s, are associated with the most intense water level oscillations, presumably resulting in strong mixing of the lake, sediment resuspension, and the transport of salt and chemical compounds along the lake. This is particularly important as the lake is a protected Nature Park due to its ornithological reserve in the northwest, which is endangered by ongoing climate change. Rising sea levels and decreased precipitation in the lake's drainage area could lead to a substantial increase in salinity, threatening the lake's ecosystem.

Abrupt changes in crustal structure beneath the Coast Ranges of northern California - developing new techniques in receiver function analysis	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												New approaches to receiver function analyses at a suite of broad-band stations in the Coast Ranges of northern California identify rapid changes in crustal thickness accompanied by melt accumulation in the lower crust. These processes are associated with the northward migration of the Mendocino triple junction through the area over the past similar to 8 Myr. By simultaneously solving for crustal thickness, Poisson's ratio and Moho strike and dip, we facilitate the application of receiver function analyses in areas of crustal complexity where data sets are sparse. We also introduce a straightforward approach to calculating the Vp/Vs velocity ratio of the seismogenic zone, which is used here to aid in the interpretation of results from the receiver function analysis. Results are consistent with triple junction related crustal modifications occurring in the plate motion direction in a narrow swath of crust between the Maacama and Bartlett Springs Faults. Crustal thicknesses decrease from over 35 km thick in Round Valley, south of the current triple junction location, to 20 km thick just 100 km further south, near Clear Lake. Major crustal thinning is localized to a narrow area of the crust around Redwood Valley, where the Moho dips approximately 17 degrees to the northeast. This thinning may also be restricted to the lower crust rather than being evenly distributed throughout the crustal column. Coincident with these changes, melts are inferred in the lower crust from low velocity zones and elevated values of Poisson's ratio (sigma >= 0.32) at two seismic stations. These melts occur in the same area as melt bodies suggested in other seismological studies. Together these results provide the first detailed description of the crustal modifications-and the spatial extent of that deformation-associated with the passage of the Mendocino triple junction.

A review of the current state of process-based and data-driven modelling: guidelines for Lake Erie managers and watershed modellers	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Elevated phosphorus (P) loading from the watersheds draining into Lake Erie, particularly from agricultural (53%) and urban (43%) sources, is identified as one of the main drivers of the severe eutrophication. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 11 process-based models to characterize the water cycle as well as nutrient fate and transport within a watershed context, and to find a robust and replicable way to optimize the modelling strategy for the Lake Erie watershed. Our primary objective is to review the conceptual/technical strengths and weaknesses of the individual models for reproducing surface runoff, groundwater, sediment transport, nutrient cycling, and channel routing, and to collectively guide the management of the Lake Erie Basin. Our analysis suggested that the available models either opted for simpler approximations of the multifaceted, nonlinear dynamics of nutrient fate and transport, and instead placed more emphasis on the advanced representation of the water cycle or, introduced a greater degree of biogeochemical complexity but simplified their strategies to recreate the roles of critical hydrological processes. Notwithstanding its overparameterization problem, the MIKE SHE model provides the most comprehensive 3D representation of the interplay between surface and subsurface hydrological processes with a fully dynamic description, whereby we can recreate the solute transport that infiltrates from the surface to the unsaturated soil layer and subsequently percolates into the saturated layer. Likewise, the physically based submodels designed to represent the sediment detachment and erosion/removal processes (DWSM, HBV-INCA, HSPF, HYPE, and MIKE SHE), offer a distinct alternative to USLE-type empirical strategies. The ability to explicitly simulate the daily plant growth (SWAT and APEX) coupled with a dynamic representation of soil P processes can be critical when evaluating the long-term watershed responses to various agricultural management strategies. Drawing parallels with the (sub) surface and sediment erosion processes, a more complicated physically based approach, e.g., the dynamic wave model provided by MIKE SHE ( coupled with MIKE URBAN or MIKE HYDRO) and SWMM may be more appropriate for realistically simulating the pressurized flow and backwater effects of water routing in both open channels and closed pipes. While our propositions seem to favor the consideration of complex models that may lack the commensurate knowledge to properly characterize the underlying processes, we contend this issue can be counterbalanced by the joint consideration of simpler empirical models under an ensemble framework, which can both constrain the plausible values of individual processes and validate macroscale patterns. Finally, our study discusses critical facets of the watershed modelling work in Lake Erie, such as the role of legacy P, the challenges in reproducing spring-freshet or event-flow conditions, and the dynamic characterization of water/nutrient cycles under the nonstationarity of a changing climate.					; Shimoda, Yuko/I-3521-2017; Arhonditsis, George/AAI-7897-2020; Zamaria, Sophia/LSK-6755-2024; Dong, Feifei/AAW-7470-2020	Javed, Aisha/0000-0002-8516-6370; Zamaria, Sophia/0000-0001-9222-7787; Wellen, Christopher/0000-0001-6295-7789; Neumann, Alex/0000-0003-1590-8516; Arnillas, Carlos Alberto/0000-0003-1506-9978; Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737													1208-6053	1181-8700				DEC	2021	29	4					443	490		10.1139/er-2020-0070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/er-2020-0070													WOS:000727082300002

Hardly any surface water is encountered in the area which is covered by young and porous lava fields and transected by faults. The inflow of water and its chemical composition is, therefore, very stable. Geo-thermal and volcanic activities affect the groundwater system in the Lake Myvatn area and greatly influence the lake's chemistry and thus the biological conditions especially by providing continuous and ample sources of silica and sulphate. Groundwater studies have been intensified in the area during the last years for further developing the Namafjall geothermal field in the area and the Krafla geothermal field about 10 km from Namafjall. Groundwater chemistry was monitored regularly for 2 years at 22 sampling sites and for determining selected indicator constituents in the samples. Concurrently, several tracer tests were performed in the area, the rate of groundwater flow measured, a reservoir model of the groundwater system established. These studies enabled us to divide cold groundwater and geothermal effluent in the Lake Myvatn area into six distinct groups, based on stable isotope ratios, chemical composition and geographical position. The groundwater has separate origins in the local high ground north of Lake Myvatn and the highlands far to the south, possibly as far south as the glacier Vatnajokull. The waters are to a different extent affected by geothermal activity, and effects of volcanic activity were noted during the Krafla fires in 1975-1984. Although these have diminished, they have not completely disappeared. The effluent from Krafla seems to travel to the east of Lake Myvatn and traces of it have not been found to enter the lake. The Namafjall effluent on the other hand travels along fissures to the lake. Attempts made to simulate the evolution of the geothermal water of Krafla and by theoretically titrating local groundwater with rock at elevated temperatures and adding volcanic gas seem promising and result in a composition close to the natural one.																			1386-2588	1573-5125					2004	38	2					115	128		10.1023/B:AECO.0000032067.47495.71	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:AECO.0000032067.47495.71													WOS:000222064400003

This approach to those areas focuses the attention mainly on the products produced in those areas and their high sensitivity to climate disorders. Global climate changes may lead to the higher risk of sudden floods, more frequent coastal floods, increased erosion of sea coast (more frequent storms and water level increase), extinction of species in mountain areas, melting of glaciers, higher temperature (southern Europe), drought as well as waves of heat and fires. The humanity has no influence on such phenomena although we are able to introduce adaptive actions. The concept of limiting disasters contains the fundamental assumption that the influence of the disaster may be limited if we expect such a situation during planning of investments, development of space and real property. The main aim of the research is an economic-spatial analysis of the losses caused by extraordinary weather phenomena within rural areas of Warminsko-Mazurskie voivodeship and correlation analysis. Studies have shown that attention should be focused on the area in a direct neighborhood of the Great Masurian Lakes because there is the most sensitive area and the losses on the examined territory are correlated with the area (looses and agricultural lands), soil quality and with the occurrence of the negative consequences of plant wintering. The information on the magnitude of the studied phenomenon complemented with the spatial data on the distribution of the phenomenon represents an excellent tool for taming management decisions in relation to the rural space.					; KOCUR-BERA, KATARZYNA/N-3542-2018	Dudzinska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-1140-0435; KOCUR-BERA, KATARZYNA/0000-0001-7056-5443													1691-3078	2255-9930	978-9984-48-189-0				2015		39					15	23																WOS:000367171900001

Their deposits can be dated using a combination of historical and stratigraphic data, providing a good means to study historical records of contamination transported by rivers. Contamination history over the last few decades is of special significance for Central and Eastern Europe as it can reflect high pollutant levels in the second half of the twentieth century and the subsequent improvement after the fall of the Iron Curtain. The purpose of this study was to investigate recent sediments of an oxbow lake of the Morava River, Czech Republic, their stratigraphic records, sediment architecture, and history of contamination. Materials and methods Seven ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiles and three sediment cores up to 4 in deep were studied. The stratigraphy of the cores was inferred from visible-light spectrophotometry, X-ray radiography, grain size analysis, and semiquantitative modal analysis of sandy fractions. The sediments were dated using the Cs-137 mass activity and combinations of stratigraphic and historical data. The cores were sampled for concentrations of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. Wet sampled, lyophilized, and sieved sediments were extracted and analyzed for heavy metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) of aqua regia leachate and for persistent organic pollutants by gas chromatography (GC-ECD and GC-MS). Results Three distinct sedimentary sequences (S1, S2, and S3) were identified. The basal sequence SI represents river channel sediments deposited before the fort-nation of the oxbow lake, most likely before the 1930s. The boundary between the S1 and S2 sequence correlates with the level of sediment dredging from 1981 evidenced from historical data. The overlying sequences S2 and S3 represent a post-dredging sediment wedge, which progrades into the lake. 137Cs dating revealed a distinct Chernobyl 1986 peak at similar to 150 cm depth inferring sedimentation rates up to 7.7 cm/year. Sediment contamination abruptly increased from the pre-1930s deposits to the post-1981 deposits. The concentration levels increased two to five times for Ph, As, Zn, and Cu, about 10 to 15 times for Cr, Sb, and Hg, up to 34 times for Cd, and 25 to 67 times for DDTs, PCBs, and PAHs. The concentrations of most contaminants remained approximately constant until the late 1980s when they started to decrease slowly. The decreasing trends were most prominent for heavy metals and anthracene, less prominent for DDTs, and almost absent for PCBs and most PAHs. Discussion Different temporal and spatial patterns for various contaminants make it possible to distinguish between anthropogenic point sources from local industry (anthracene, Cr, Cd), possible diffuse sources (most PAHs), and geological background (V, Co, Ni, and Mo). The observed recent trends in heavy metal and persistent organic pollutant contamination are generally consistent with data from other Central European rivers. The roughly balanced contamination levels in sediments from the lake and the adjacent river channel suggest that the oxbow lake deposits reflect immediate levels of the contamination bound to suspended particulate matter passing through the river. Conclusions The investigated oxbow lake accumulated suspended sediment from Morava River, developing a thick sedimentary body. The sediments offer a good time framework to study historical contamination of the river on a decade time scale. Continuous contamination trends can be traced back to the early 1980s. The results show that stratigraphic analysis of cores has a good potential for identification of uninterrupted historical trends and unconformities, e.g., due to dredging. Recommendations and perspectives Oxbow lakes may provide an alternative to floodplains and reservoir deposits when studying river contamination history. High sedimentation rates of up to 7.7 cm/year offer a very good stratigraphic resolution, making it possible to study contamination patterns on annual or even seasonal time scales. On the other hand, oxbow lakes may represent long-term contamination stores, which are unlikely to be redistributed by river erosion and, hence, may possess significant environmental risks for the farther future.

Some PAHs have carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic effects. Urban lakes are severely polluted by PAHs due to human activities. Longyang Lake (LL) and Moshui Lake (ML), which serve as entry lakes for Wuhan's "Six Lakes Connectivity" project, were chosen as the study areas to learn about the migration of PAHs. Water flows from LL to ML through the Mingzhu River. Multi-Media Mass Balance Model (MMBM) and fugacity fractions (ff) were used to characterize the migration of PAHs under the hydrological connectivity project. Compared to ff, the MMBM can describe the migration of PAHs in a more detailed and quantitative way. The concentration of PAHs in water of LL decreased from 36.5 ng L- 1 to 26.59 ng L- 1 over 43 days, while those in ML increased from 46.8 ng L- 1 to 198.25 ng L- 1 over 141 days. Sediment takes a longer time to decrease to stabilization. The concentration of PAHs in the sediment of LL decreased from 932 ng g- 1 to 0.95 ng g- 1 over 13.33 years, while those in ML decreased from 4812 ng g- 1 to 1.04 ng g- 1 over 16.96 years. The stabilized concentrations were consistently lower than the observed concentrations and fell below the modeled stabilized concentrations obtained in the unconnected case (2170 ng L- 1 in water and 40.81 ng g- 1 in sediment). The MMBM showed that PAHs in the lake are mainly exported through runoff. However, modeling results indicated that upstream LL did not increase total PAHs concentrations in the ML because the output from ML was significantly higher. Sediment parameters sensitively influenced the results of the model. Although the simulation results showed reductions of PAHs pollution in two lakes under the hydrological connectivity project, longterm monitoring results are needed to optimize the model.					; Du, Minkai/LKN-2485-2024; Xing, Xinli/O-1880-2015; 邹, 艳敏/HHZ-2831-2022	Shi, Mingming/0000-0002-4376-4735; Zhang, Shizhao/0009-0009-1235-4248													0269-7491	1873-6424				FEB 1	2025	366								125556	10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125556	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125556		DEC 2024						39701362					WOS:001393179300001

Therefore, predicting the impact of ice cover on a river-reservoir system is of critical importance for hydro producers. Ice impact can be described using historical records, where typical conditions are characterized by a daily median ice factor (IF) curve. The daily median IF curve works well only for past years with typical climatic conditions. Moreover, the median curve would not respond to climate-induced changes in the ice cover. In this research, a novel statistical (ST) model, named ST-IF, is developed to simulate the impact of river ice on the conveyance of the Nelson River West Channel (NRWC) as a function of daily air temperature. ST-IF uses a series of statistically based functions, including regression and threshold functions to estimate different characteristics of IF, such as its initial and peak values, and its daily distribution during ice-on period. Model performance was evaluated against historical records and the daily median value of the ice cover impact. Results showed that ST-IF significantly improved the simulation of each year-specific IF curve in NRWC compared to the daily median curve. Moreover, the model was used to predict the impact of ice cover under future climate conditions using 19 climate simulations. Results showed that, due to the predicted warmer future, ice cover is expected to take longer to fully form. This leads to longer Ice Stabilization Program duration, higher program implementation cost, and potential additional downstream stakeholder impacts. In addition, earlier ice impact peak date, shorter ice impact duration, and lower ice impact magnitude leading to overall higher winter hydroelectricity generation potential for Manitoba Hydro are expected in the future. Such future alterations intensify from near to far future time periods.

Statistical analysis of four palynozones allows reconstruction of paleotemperature and paleohumidity conditions. Pinus, steppic, xerophilous, and Mediterranean taxa persisted continuously through the record, and only during periods of increased humidity did deciduous and Mediterranean taxa expand (Zones II, subzone IIIb). Cooler and dry conditions favored the development of Cupressaceae and scrubs between 7300 and 7000 yr cal BP. The mid-Holocene (Northgrippian) mesophytic optimum took place between 6800 and 4000 yr cal BP during which time a Mediterranean climate was present and open forest developed, predominantly consisting of Mediterranean taxa and deciduous trees. The gradual rise in aridity in the Meghalayan (4000-1700 yr cal BP) led to Mediterranean forest being replaced by steppic and xerophilous vegetation, a change related mostly to a decrease in summer insolation, with superimposed centennial-scale variability in humidity. In parallel with forest degradation caused by increasing aridity, the record shows marked evidence of human influence since 4000 yr cal BP, which accelerated the progression of open landscapes from the Chalcolithic onwards, this change being especially marked during the Roman period. Significant denudation of the landscape can be attributed to the use of fire, as well as due to agriculture and grazing, with a major contributor being intense metallurgical and mining activity in the area. The Cartagena Bay record reported herein shows centennial-scale oscillations in humidity and temperature that correlate with well-known climatic events during the late Holocene in the western Mediterranean region, synchronous with variability in solar and atmospheric dynamics. The alternation of persistent North Atlantic Oscillation modes is likely to have played a key role in regulating humid-arid periods.

Impacts of habitat loss by reservoir inundation on occurrence, abundance, and genetic diversity of an imperiled, river-adapted, benthic-specialist fish, Etheostoma lemniscatum (Tuxedo Darter)	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Dams homogenize habitat and alter natural depth and flow regimes of lotic habitats, leading to extirpation of many stream-adapted fishes such as darters (Percidae). The Tuxedo Darter, Etheostoma lemniscatum, is a habitat-specialist of shallow, flowing pools with cobble substrate in the Big South Fork Cumberland River. One threat to this species is Wolf Creek Dam on the Cumberland River that creates Lake Cumberland, which during summer pool, inundates the lower 72 river kilometers (rkms) of the Big South Fork. A six-year period of lower reservoir elevations for dam repairs allowed a 9 rkm reach to return to riverine habitat and E. lemniscatum to colonize this reach. Once dam repairs were complete, the lower 72 rkms were again regularly inundated by Lake Cumberland. To determine the impact of post-dam repair inundation on E. lemniscatum, we compared occurrence, abundance, and genetic diversity metrics estimated from samples from 2015 and from several years post-inundation in 2019 and 2020 from 11 sites spanning the species' range. Declines in occurrence and abundance were detected within the re-inundated reach. We observed low genetic diversity for the species for both sample periods, but no significant changes in genetic diversity between years. A trend towards lower allelic richness and an increase in the proportion of private alleles was observed in the 2019/2020 samples. Coupled with local extirpation and declines in abundance, these trends may be early warning signs of future declines in genetic diversity. We suggest future genetic monitoring to identify any time delayed responses to inundation not detected herein.																			1566-0621	1572-9737				FEB	2025	26	1					1	18		10.1007/s10592-024-01628-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-024-01628-4		NOV 2024											WOS:001359510500001

Syndonia			Retrogressive thaw slumps in the Alaskan Low Arctic may influence tundra shrub growth more strongly than climate	ECOSPHERE												Thermokarst disturbance in permafrost landscapes is likely to increase across the tundra biome with climate warming, resulting in changes to topography, vegetation, and biogeochemical cycling. Tundra shrubs grow on permafrost, but shrub-thermokarst relationships are rarely studied in detail. Since the 1980s, Alaska's North Slope has experienced increased thermokarst activity, including retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) on hillslopes. Within decades, RTSs near Toolik Lake, Alaska, were colonized by tall (>= 0.5 m) deciduous shrubs. We used dendrochronology methods on 66 shrubs (182 stem cross sections) representing dominant deciduous species: willows (Salix pulchra and S. glauca) and dwarf birch (Betula nana) at two RTS chronosequences on Alaska's North Slope comprising seven sites, to quantify thermokarst and climate effects (25 years of temperature and precipitation records) on shrub secondary growth (i.e., annual rings) in RTS-disturbed and undisturbed moist acidic tussock (MAT) tundra. Across species, average growth ring widths were two times wider for shrubs in RTSs than in MAT, and ring widths decreased with RTS age. A 1 degrees C June temperature increase was associated with 2% wider rings across species and sites, but shrubs showed marginal growth in warmer summers, supporting tundra-wide shrub climate sensitivity studies. A 4.5% average ring width increase per 1 mm of previous year's September precipitation was seen in shrubs in mid-successional RTSs, suggesting protective effects of early snowfall in RTSs versus open tundra. Retrogressive thaw slump age category explained 47% and 30% of average ring width variance of willows and dwarf birch, respectively, in linear mixed-effects models. Climate variables explained 2% average ring width variance across species. Our results suggest that RTS exerts strong successional effects on tundra shrub growth. Climate effects appear to show weaker synoptic patterns across the study area. Retrogressive thaw slumps will likely contribute to tundra greening where RTS activity is increasing.					; Buchwal, Agata/F-5516-2013	Buchwal, Agata/0000-0001-6879-6656; Huebner, Diane/0000-0003-2605-7534; Bret-Harte, Marion Syndonia/0000-0001-5151-3947; 													2150-8925					JUN	2022	13	6							e4106	10.1002/ecs2.4106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4106													WOS:000815035800001

Frisian lake district are highly eutrophic. In the mid-1980's a project on eutrophication and lake restoration research was started. This project was aimed at modelling water transport and phosphorus (P) dynamics and at simulating management scenarios. A simple dynamic P-balance model was used to calculate total phosphorus (TP) balances and to simulate three TP reduction scenarios in each of three lakes: Tjeukemeer, Groote Brekken and Slotermeer. The model covered three periods in 1985, 1986 and 1987. The external loads to Tjeukemeer were highest, moderate to Groote Brekken, and lowest to Slotermeer. The major P sources in the area were discharges from the surrounding polders, used mainly for agriculture, and from IJsselmeer. Despite a 75 % TP-reduction in water from the surrounding polders the 0.07 mg l-1 target level could be reached only occasionally in Tjeukemeer, while in the other two lakes this level was not even approached. The effect of a 75 % reduction in water from IJsselmeer was greatest in Groote Brekken (but again approached the target only occasionally), moderate in Tjeukemeer and least in Slotermeer. The simulations showed that only a 75 % reduction in both external loads (from polders and from IJsselmeer) will lead to achieving the target level in Tjeukemeer and Groote Brekken during the summer periods. In Slotermeer, a relatively isolated lake, other measures are necessary to reach the target level. The results are confirmed by an approximate theoretical analysis of the effects of load reduction.																			0018-8158					MAY 15	1992	233	1-3					271	281		10.1007/BF00016115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016115													WOS:A1992JD64800027

Evaporite and carbonate sediments occur at the bottom of the lake which is fed by high-sulfate spring and well waters circulating N-S through salt domes. The recent sediments of Seyfe Lake are deposited in delta, backshore, beach, mud-flat and shallow lake environments. In the mud-flat environment, calcite, gypsum, halite, and thenardite are associated with fine-grained detrital sediments. Sediments from the margin to the lake center are distributed as calcite, gypsum and halite thenardite, yielding an annular distribution pattern. An increase in Na2O, SO3, and S, and a decrease in CaO toward the lake center are due to sediment distribution. On the other hand, a positive correlation of SiO2 with MgO, K2O, Na2O, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 + TiO2 is attributed to the presence of smectite, illite and feldspar. In addition, a positive correlation of Sr and Ba with CaO is related to the amount of gypsum in the sediments. Strontium is associated with in situ gypsum crystals; it increases in the intermediate and central zones of the lake as a result of a relative increase in salinity toward the lake center. The association of Sr with gypsum in the sediments suggests that Ca and Sr were derived from Sr-bearing evaporites and their carbonate host rocks, which were the likely aquifers for the brine. The S- and O-isotopic compositions of sulfate crystals range from +19.1 parts per thousand to +21.7 parts per thousand and from +16.9 parts per thousand to +20.9 parts per thousand SMOW, respectively, suggesting precipitation in a closed lake system. A relative increase of oxygen and sulfur isotope ratios toward the lake center suggests dissolution of gypsum in the host rock, with contributions from circulating groundwater and sulfate reduction (possibly by bacterial reduction). Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios range from 0.707286 to 0.707879, suggesting a non-marine Oligo-Pliocene evaporitic host rock source for precipitation in Seyfe Lake. The concentration of Sr- and S-isotope ratios in the gypsum crystals indicates formation by precipitation/recrystallization from brine rather than from seawater. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Williams, M				Williams, Martin			Interactions between fluvial and eolian geomorphic systems and processes: Examples from the Sahara and Australia	CATENA												The remains of once integrated drainage systems are still discernible in many of the hot deserts of the world. Some of these date back to the Mesozoic, as in arid Western Australia, where they now form chains of salt lakes. Others were active in Miocene times, such as the Sahabi Rivers that once flowed from Chad to the Mediterranean. A few remained active during Quaternary interglacials, as in the Sahara. All contributed sediments that were reworked by wind during drier phases to form desert dunes. The desert dunes of Australia and of the 9500 km long chain of deserts extending from the Sahara through Arabia to the Thar desert of India originated from sediments eroded from the uplands and deposited in closed interior basins formed during the course of Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic faulting, rifting and epeirogenic movements. It was the unconsolidated Neogene sediments laid down in large subsiding sedimentary basins such as the Kufra-Sirte basin in Libya and the Chad basin which provided the source material for the Late Pliocene and Quaternary desert dunes of the Sahara. One effect of the progressive build up of high latitude ice sheets during the Neogene was to steepen the temperature and pressure gradients between the equator and the poles, resulting in increased Trade Wind velocities. Stronger winds were better able to mobilize the alluvial sands of the increasingly dry Sahara and adjacent deserts and to fashion them into desert dunes. A more subtle form of interaction between eolian and fluvial processes concerns the interplay between desert dust (loess) accumulation on hill slopes in arid regions and the onset of fine-grained valley-fill accumulation by sluggish, low energy streams in mountain valleys. Some of these Late Pleistocene wetlands served as refuge areas for plants, reptiles and invertebrates at a time when the surrounding desert plains were very cold and dry, as in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia In the arid Flinders Ranges such valley-fills were built up between 35 kyr and 15 kyr ago, after which the return of the summer monsoon led to stream channel incision and the formation of a network of gullies, often erroneously attributed to human activities. Understanding the causes of such accelerated erosion can prevent unnecessary and expensive attempts at restoration, since the latter are based on the incorrect assumption that overgrazing and present-day land use are responsible.

Habitat heterogeneity has many implications in ecological assessment studies. On one hand it provides varying niches for organisms, increasing diversity. On the other hand, the inherent spatial variability of structurally complex systems may overlap with ecological condition making it difficult to disentangle the effects of perturbation. This study investigated the combined and single effects of habitat and pond condition on the macroinvertebrate assemblages of 35 ponds located in north-west Spain and spanning a range of water quality and habitat characteristics. 2. Macroinvertebrate communities and several environmental variables were sampled in the summer of 2004 or 2003. Samples were collected from four dominant habitats (vegetated shores, shores without vegetation, submerged vegetation, bare sediments) following a time-limited sampling. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and two-way crossed ANOSIM were used to investigate the taxonomic and functional differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure among habitats (four types) and pond conditions (optimal, good, moderate, poor, very poor). To investigate the individual and combined effects of pond condition and habitat on several diversity measures GLM models were used. In addition, the accuracy of two sampling designs - stratified and multihabitat - was compared using the CVs of seven macroinvertebrate attributes. 3. Results showed that macroinvertebrate communities differed significantly, albeit weakly, among habitat types and pond condition categories. In particular, the abundance of several Chironomidae genera., rarefied richness and Shannon index decreased both in perturbed systems and bare sediments, whereas no marked differences occurred between shores and submerged vegetation. 4. We suggest that a multihabitat approach together with the use of community attributes not (or slightly) affected by habitat type will provide more comparable results across ponds than a stratified approach or observation of the whole community, especially in ponds where degradation leads to habitat loss.

J	Havens, KE; Nürnberg, GK				Havens, KE; Nürnberg, GK			The phosphorus-chlorophyll relationship in lakes:: Potential influences of color and mixing regime	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												We used summer epilimnetic means from a large dataset (369 lakes from North America, Europe, Asia, and New Zealand) to examine whether color or mixing regime significantly influence the log-log relationship between chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total phosphorus (TP) in lakes. We found no significant difference in regression models for clear (color < 10 Pt units) vs. humic takes (color > 20 Pt units), even when data were screened so that both types of lakes were represented by the same range of TP. Likewise, there was no significant difference in regression models for mixed vs. thermally stratified lakes. Knowing that a particular lake is clear vs. humic, or mixed vs. stratified, therefore is not helpful in developing a predictive model of Chl a from TP. However, when we simultaneously considered water color and mixing regime, a potentially useful feature was identified. Mixed humic lakes have a somewhat lower (significant at p = 0.10) ratio of Chl a / TP than mixed clear water lakes, whereas no such difference exists between humic and clear water lakes that are thermally stratified. Likewise, when we plotted the Chl a / TP ratio vs. color, there was a negative slope for mixed takes, but no significant relationship for stratified lakes. We suggest that in stratified humic lakes, which are often sheltered deep systems with a high Osgood Ratio, phytoplankton can compensate for reduced underwater irradiance by migrating toward the water surface, whereas in mixed humic lakes, that response is not possible. Lake managers dealing with mixed humic lakes might expect a lower yield of Chl a / TP than in mixed clear water lakes. Further research is needed to test this hypothesis. In any case, caution is warranted when applying such results to lake management, because given the numerous effects of high P inputs (e.g., changes in benthic invertebrate communities, biological oxygen demand, and sediment metabolism) it is unwise to focus solely on the Chl a response to protect water quality.

J	Lennartson, GJ; Schwartz, MD				Lennartson, GJ; Schwartz, MD			A synoptic climatology of surface-level ozone in Eastern Wisconsin, USA	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Areas in Eastern Wisconsin (EWI), USA, experience exceedances of the federal health standard for ozone each summer. Recent work from the Ozone Transport Assessment Group has provided support for the association between slowly migrating anticyclones over the Eastern United States and widespread amounts of high ozone throughout much of the region. Case studies have yielded additional evidence of this connection, and, further, have shown that synoptic-scale transport in association with this anticyclone can be an important factor in elevating ozone levels in EWI. A case study approach however is Limited since only a small number of events can be analyzed. To address this deficiency, our investigation employed a synoptic climatology, which is capable of linking patterns of atmospheric circulation with patterns of tropospheric ozone over an extended period of time. To classify the atmospheric circulation a correlation-based scheme was applied to 30 yr of gridded sea-level-pressure data. Our synoptic climatology showed that the highest ozone levels occurred when an anticyclone was present to the east of the Lake Michigan Air Quality Region (LMAQR); the same type of anticyclone identified by others as being responsible for the transport of regional-scale ozone and precursors to the LMAQR. Our synoptic climatology, therefore, supports the contention that the synoptic-scale transport of ozone from the Southern and Eastern US plays an important role in episodes of elevated ozone in EWI. Moreover, our results suggest that synoptic-scale systems (i.e. anticyclones situated over the Eastern US), which operate at much greater space and time scales than sub-regional scale circulations, are likely to transport sufficient ozone into Eastern WI to often exceed the new 8 h, 80 ppb health standard-unless steps are taken to reduce regional-scale emissions.																			0936-577X					DEC 10	1999	13	3					207	220		10.3354/cr013207	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr013207													WOS:000085624800004

Castle Lake is a subalpine, nitrogen-limited lake with similar to 5 months of annual ice cover. Human impacts include light recreational use, past fish stocking, and experimental use by the Castle Lake Research Station. The base of the core (below 32 cm; pre mid-1700s) represents the period of maximum ice cover. In contrast, the end of the Little Ice Age (mid 1700s-early 1800s) is dominated by cyclotelloids (mostly Discostella stelligera), indicating significant open-water periods, a condition that persisted into the early 1900s. Cyclotelloids began to decline in the 1960s and were replaced by the Fragilaria tenera grp. (peak in 1970s), succeeded by Asterionella formosa (peak similar to 2010), and accompanied by a reduction in delta N-15 values and a decrease in C:N that may represent increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Another anthropogenic signal was discerned in the core and was interpreted to be the result of an ammonium nitrate fertilization experiment of the epilimnion that was conducted in 1980 and 1981. This signal was manifested in the core largely by a negative excursion in delta N-15, possibly caused by fractionation during denitrification in surface sediment. A phytoplankton monitoring dataset collected by the Castle Lake Research Station from 1967 to 1984 corroborates the timing of increased araphid euplanktonic species in the 1970s, and increases in two benthic diatoms (Staurosirella pinnata and Tabellaria fenestrata), entrained in the phytoplankton tows during the experimentation years. Both ice cover and nitrogen addition appear to be strong drivers that affected the lake diatoms, although additional drivers, such as fish stocking and associated cascade effects need further exploration. These data will be helpful for interpreting longer core records from Castle Lake, should the opportunity arise, as well as cores from similar systems in the region.					; Aquino López, Marco/AAX-4063-2021	Noble, Paula/0000-0002-9558-9123; Aquino-Lopez, Marco Antonio/0000-0002-5076-7205													0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2021	65	2					201	217		10.1007/s10933-020-00160-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-020-00160-y		NOV 2020											WOS:000588584200001

We explore the potential for generating long (centuries to millennia) proxy records of tree mast seeding, from pollen deposited in lake sediments. This proxy record uses pollen recovered from annually-banded (varved) sediments from a core collected from Lake Ohau, South Island, New Zealand to reconstruct masting events for two genera of Southern Beech, Fuscospora spp. and Lophozonia spp. We find average mast frequencies inferred from Fuscospora pollen from a 43-year sediment core collected from Lake Ohau comparable to seed fall expected for the catchment using a differential-temperature (Delta T) statistical model for the period 1974-2016. In contrast, Lophozonia pollen mast frequency in the 1974-2016 timeseries was consistently lower than that predicted by the Delta T model, although the patterns of variability were broadly similar. We explore this approach in a second 32-year pollen timeseries from Lake Ohau, spanning the pre-instrumental period 1833-1864. During this interval, average air temperature was similar to 1 degrees C cooler than the late 20th century, and interannual variability of air temperature was subdued, such that mast frequency predicted by the Delta T model is the lowest in 200 years. We find mast frequency in our pollen records reflects this pattern for Fuscospora, with a minima of mast frequency from 1850, compared to the 1974-2016 record, but not for Lophozonia. This paper demonstrates that a centuries-long pollen record from the Lake Ohau sedimentary sequence has the potential to form a valuable proxy for Fuscospora masting that would supplement existing seedfall records. Long records of this type could significantly enhance our understanding of the environmental drivers of mast seeding.					; Horgan, Huw/I-5847-2019	Horgan, Huw/0000-0002-4836-0078; Howarth, Jamie/0000-0003-4365-0292													0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2022	32	11					1184	1192		10.1177/09596836221114292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836221114292		AUG 2022											WOS:000835458900001

Frequently observed objectionable taste and odorous products of cyanobacteria are geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol. Investigations focused on the littoral zone of Wahnbach Reservoir (Germany) revealed that benthic cyanobacteria were present in this oligotrophic drinking water reservoir. Benthic cyanobacteria were found in the depth horizon between 1.75 m and 11 m, particularly on south-exposed slopes. This spatial distribution indicates a possible key role of the underwater light climate. Moreover, cell-bound and dissolved geosmin were detected in corresponding littoral samples. Both fractions were subjected to spatial and primarily temporal variations with maximum concentrations at the end of summer. However, a substantial lowering of the water level caused a diminution of cyanobacterial growth. Due to the drawdown of the water level concentrations of cell-bound geosmin and pigments (as a proxy of cyanobacterial biomass) were remarkably reduced, and dissolved geosmin was never detected during this phase. Except for the influence of water level fluctuation no other abiotic variables had a significant influence on pigment and geosmin concentrations. From geosmin concentrations detected in the littoral zone, the probability of serious episodes of odour events in the raw water of the Wahnbach Reservoir was estimated. Hence, the probability that the raw water was affected by geosmin was minor, which was supported by routine flavour profiles. Nevertheless, the study shows that odorous episodes caused by benthic cyanobacteria are likely to develop even in an oligotrophic lake or reservoir when these cyanobacteria, and consequently odorous production, proliferate. In principle, such a proliferation cannot be excluded as nutrients are available from the sediment pore water, and underwater light at the sediment surface in the sublittoral is sufficiently high due to very low phytoplankton-induced turbidity under oligotrophic conditions. Thus, management-induced fluctuations of the water level seem to be the main control variable to generate light conditions at the sediment surface fluctuating in a given depth horizon faster than cyanobacteria can develop there.

Hence, the aim of the study was to evaluate the hydro-geochemical characteristics of Selamko farm reservoir water quality and its suitability for multipurpose uses using GIS-based water quality indices. The water sampling sites and parameters were selected systematically based on the land use, land cover, and anthropogenic activities around Selamko reservoir watershed in Debre Tabor, Ethiopia. Water samples were collected from 11 sampling stations from July 2019 to March 2020 using the composite sampling method and examined using standard procedures. The suitability of the reservoir's water quality for multipurpose use was investigated using drinking and irrigation water quality indices, and other tools. The spatial distribution maps of water quality parameters were prepared using the kriging method in ArcGIS 10.5. The results of the geospatial analysis indicated that the reservoir water quality parameters had spatial variation, which was caused by industrial and household wastewater inflow across the reservoir's watershed. Based on WHO and ES standards, the computed drinking water quality index results revealed that 81.81% and 18.18% of the reservoir's water quality fall into the poor to very poor classes, which indicates that the water in the reservoir is not fit for drinking. However, a Wilcox diagram, irrigation indices, and USEPA regulations revealed that the reservoir water quality is found to be safe and suitable for irrigation, fishing, and livestock purposes. The study concluded that Selamko reservoir's water quality is suitable for irrigation, fishing, and livestock watering with proper management accordingly.					; Munye, Dawit/GYU-3153-2022; Aragaw, Tamru/GWC-1207-2022	Aragaw, Tamru Tesseme/0000-0003-3557-5376; 													2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2022	12	10							239	10.1007/s13201-022-01763-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-022-01763-8													WOS:000855801200002

Sterile water samples were irradiated by sunlight over the whole photoperiod and subsequently analyzed for CO2. Mean energy-normalized apparent photochemical yield of CO2 (an index of DOM photoreactivity normalized for the energy absorbed by samples) was significantly higher in the reservoir (27.7 +/- 13.0 mg CO2 center dot m(-3)center dot kJ(-1)) and the boreal river (35.8 +/- 2.3 mg CO2 center dot m(-3)center dot kJ(-1)) than in the boreal lakes (15.5 +/- 5.1 mg CO2 center dot m(-3)center dot kJ(-1)). The DOM photoreactivity of the temperate lakes (20.9 +/- 8.1 mg CO2 center dot m(-3)center dot kJ(-1)) was not statistically different from any type of boreal water bodies. There was no significant difference in either the integrated photoproduction of CO2 (273-433 mg CO2 center dot m-2 center dot d(-1)) or the potential photochemical contribution to CO2 diffusive fluxes (56-92%) among these water bodies. DOM photoreactivity was significantly affected by the cumulative hydrological residence time (CHRT) when considering the whole data set. However, when considering only the boreal water bodies, iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) also intervened. The fact that DOM photoreactivity was related to CHRT as well as to Fe and Mn concentrations, which are respectively permanent and long-lasting features of the reservoir, suggests that the photoproduction of CO2 is not likely to decrease over time. This process may therefore play a substantial role in the long-term CO2 emissions from boreal reservoirs during the summer, its potential contribution to CO2 diffusive fluxes being estimated at 56 +/- 29 %.

The ecosystem was dominated by a dinoflagellate, Ceratium hirundinella, two filter-feeding cladocerans, Daphnia rosea and Ceriodaphnia reticulata, and an invertebrate predator, the dipteran Chaoborus flavicans. The midsummer zooplankton community showed a large change in species composition (the Daphnia population crashed) when a heavy Ceratium bloom occurred. It is shown that (i) the rapid density decline of D.rosea in mid-May was mainly caused by a shortage of edible phytoplankton, which was facilitated by the rapid increase in C.hirundinella abundance; (ii) the low density of D.rosea in June-July was considered to be mainly caused by the blooming of Ceratium hirundinella (which may inhibit the feeding process of D.rosea), while predation by C.flavicans larvae, the changing temperature, the interspecific competition and the scarcity of edible algae were not judged to be important; (iii) the high summer biomass of the planktonic C.flavicans larvae was maintained by the bloom of C.hirundinella, because >90% of the crop contents of C.flavicans larvae were C.hirundinella during this period. The present study indicates that the large-sized cells or colonies of phytoplankton are not only inedible by most cladocerans, but the selective effect of the blooming of these algae can also influence the composition and dominance of the zooplankton community, especially for the filter-feeding Cladocera, in a similar way as the selective predation by planktivorous fish. The large-sized phytoplankton can also be an important alternative food for ominivorous invertebrate predators such as Chaoborus larvae, and thus may affect the interactions between these predators and their zooplanktonic prey. In this way, such phytoplankton may play a very important role in regulating the dynamics of the aquatic food web, and become a driving force in shaping the community structure of zooplankton.

Boron, molybdenum, vanadium, and tungsten	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Water samples were collected from 10 locations along the Truckee River system, 14 locations along the Walker River system, and 12 locations along the Carson River, and analyzed for B, Mo, V, W, Na, Cl, and pH. Boron concentrations ranged from approximately 2 mu mol/kg in the upper reaches of the Truckee River to almost 1,200 mu mol/kg in Pyramid Lake. Molybdenum, V, and W had concentrations in the nanomolal range; Mo varied from a low of about 12 nmol/kg to a high of 3,200 nmol/kg (Walker Lake); V ranged from 9 nmol/kg to approximately 470 nmol/kg; and W varied from a low value around 0.8 nmol/kg (West Walker River) to 1,030 nmol/kg. The high concentrations of these oxyanion-forming trace elements in the rivers reflects (1) the relative stability of these oxyanions (e.g., MoO42-, HVO42-, WO42-, B(OH)(3), and/or B(OH)(4)(-)) in the alkaline, well oxygenated river and lake waters, (2) contributions of hydrothermal waters (especially for B), and (3) weathering of rocks/regolith with high concentrations of these elements. In the case of Mo, V, and W, each exhibited relatively conservative behavior in the upper, oxygenated reaches of all three rivers. During the study period the region experienced a prolonged drought such that the lower reaches of each river were typified by no flow or stagnant waters and probably low oxygen and/or anoxic conditions (although not measured). Reductive processes occurring in the low flow to stagnant reaches of each river could have led to removal of Mo, V, and W from solution as coprecipitates with Fe monosulfides, or via sorption to Fe oxides/oxyhydroxides and/or organic matter. Boron, however, exhibited essentially no or minor removal from these rivers, and instead was added to each river via B-rich hydrothermal waters (e.g., Steamboat Creek from Steamboat Hot Springs), or by B-rich groundwaters via base-flow during the extensive drought.

Assessment of benthic algal biomonitoring protocols to evaluate effects of shoreline development on the nearshore zone of Precambrian Shield lakes in Ontario	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Thomas KE, Kluke A, Hall RI, Paterson AM, Winter JG. 2011. Assessment of benthic algal biomonitoring protocols to evaluate effects of shoreline development on the nearshore zone of Precambrian Shield lakes in Ontario. Lake Reserv Manage. 27:398-413. We assessed the ability of benthic algal biomonitoring protocols to detect effects of differences in shoreline development in the littoral zone of oligo-to mesotrophic Precambrian Shield lakes in south-central Ontario. The study sites (n = 28 in Aug 2006, n = 29 in Aug 2007) spanned a broad gradient of shoreline development (e. g., intact forest, cottages, marinas) but a modest gradient of nutrient concentration (3-22 mu g/L total phosphorus). Each site was sampled for water chemistry (nutrients, ions, metals, pH) and 5 levels of benthic algal bioassessment, which differed in the amount of time, resources and expertise required. Level 1 involved visual descriptions of algal cover; Level 2 involved biomass measurements (chlorophyll a, ash-free dry mass); Level 3 involved enumeration of algae to a coarse taxonomic level (i.e., the major algal classes); Level 4 involved quantification of photosynthetic pigments by high-performance liquid chromatography; and Level 5 involved high taxonomic resolution enumeration of diatom communities. Multi-and univariate numerical analyses (e. g., PCA, ANOSIM, ANOVA) were used to assess relationships between measurements of shoreline development, water chemistry, and benthic algal metrics. Results identified that Level 5 was the most sensitive to track differences in the shoreline development among sites. For lakes on the Precambrian Shield, we suggest that benthic algal biomonitoring programs focus on Level 5, despite the higher requirements of time, technical skill, and training. We further recommend that the other levels of bioassessment be explored further in other regions where broader gradients of shoreline development and lake trophic status exist.

Mature chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tsawytscha), collected during the Fall 1991 spawning runs from Sydenham River, Lake Huron, and Credit River, Lake Ontario, were filleted, lyophilized, and incorporated into standard rat diets at 25% (w/w) or 100% (w/w) of the normal protein compliment [casein, 20% (w/w)]. This resulted in diets composed of 5 or 20% (w/w) lyophilized fish and estimated daily fish intakes by the rats at levels approximately 15- and 60-fold greater, respectively, than the current estimate for the Canadian public for all fish and seafood. Both fresh and lyophilized fish were analyzed for the following groups of contaminants: halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons [polychlorinated biphenyls, dibenzodioxins, and dibenzofurans (PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs)], polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides, metals, volatile organics, and other extractable organics (chlorinated phenols and benzenes). In general, only minor site differences existed for the specific types of contaminants detected; however,fish from the Credit River contained slightly greater amounts of PCBs (2- to 3-fold), dioxin toxic equivalencies (TCDD TEQs; 1.5- to 2.0-fold), DDT and metabolites (1.5-fold), and appreciably higher amounts of mirex (15-fold). This general pattern of contaminant differences continued when the various diets were prepared using the lyophilized fish. Tissue samples (adipose, liver) were taken from the animals at various stages of the study and also analyzed for the same groups of contaminants. In general, adipose tissue was the major reservoir for organochlorine (OC) pesticides and PCBs, while "dioxin-like" PCDD/DF congeners and mercury were found preferentially in the liver. Contaminant intake calculations and tissue residue levels are provided.

O'D; Maden, Colin			Noble gases in CM carbonaceous chondrites: Effect of parent body aqueous and thermal alteration and cosmic ray exposure ages	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Like most primitive carbonaceous chondrites, the CM chondrites experienced varying degrees of asteroidal aqueous alteration, which may have overprinted pre-accretionary processing. Several aqueous alteration scales for CM chondrites (and other carbonaceous chondrites) have been proposed based on alteration-dependent changes in various petrological and geochemical characteristics. Given the possibility that the intensity of aqueous alteration could be recorded in the primordial noble gas compositions, we test potential correlations between petrologic, geochemical and noble gas characteristics in a detailed study on 39 CM chondrites, including some of the most pristine CM chondrites identified to date, and 4 CM related carbonaceous chondrites. We mainly compare our noble gas data with the alteration schemes proposed by Alexander et al. (2013) and Howard et al. (2015). In addition to the noble gas analyses, we determined the phyllosilicate fractions of 17 of the CM chondrites using X-ray diffraction (XRD) to complement missing data points in the Howard alteration scheme. The influence of post-hydration thermal modification on noble gases in CM chondrites is investigated by comparison of heated and unheated samples. Cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages are determined for all samples in this study as well as for 26 more samples based on CM chondrite literature noble gas data. The noble gas inventory in CM chondrites represents a mixture of cosmogenic, radiogenic, and abundant primordially trapped noble gases. Additionally, about 50 % of our CM bulk samples contain detectable solar wind (SW), which implies that many but not all CM chondrites are regolith breccias or carry SW from a pre-accretion irradiation phase. Aqueous alteration affects primordial noble gas abundances and elemental and isotopic compositions in CM chondrites. In particular, the process causes loss of an Ar-rich component, different in elemental and isotopic composition to known noble gas components. This component is lost during the early stages of aqueous alteration until complete degassing of its carrier material (possibly upon at least partial destruction) below petrologic type of similar to 1.5 on the Howard et al. (2015) scale. Likely, small amounts of Q gases were additionally released by aqueous alteration. Strong thermal modification at >750 degrees C results in a significant additional loss of noble gases, whereas peak temperatures <500 degrees C likely have minor effects on the noble gas inventories of CM chondrites. Some of the described trends of noble gas contents and elemental and isotopic ratios in this study are observable across multiple carbonaceous chondrite groups, in particular also the CR chondrites. Hence, these carbonaceous chondrites may have started with similar initial noble gas inventories due to accretion of material from a common reservoir. The CRE ages of most of our CM samples fall within the typical range of <10 Myr previously observed for CM chondrites. A few CM chondrites, however, show longer CRE ages, with the longest CRE age of-20 Myr determined for the SW-rich CM Allan Hills (ALH) 85013. The degree of aqueous and thermal alteration is variable among CM chondrites with similar CRE ages. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Benthic community structure in stands of Typha angustifolia and herbicide-treated and untreated Phragmites australis	WETLANDS												We compared benthic community structure among stands of Typha angustifolia (narrow-leaf cattail) and herbicide-treated (Glypro) and untreated Phragmites australis (common reed) over two summers in a Lake Erie coastal wetland (i.e., drowned river mouth). Both macrophytes are invasives, but only Phragmites is currently controlled by herbicides because of its reputed "undesirable" effects on wetland community structure and function. Macroinvertebrate diversity was similar among stand types and relatively high (Shannon-Weaver indices similar to 2.6-4.2), probably because of high system primary productivity and a mix of lentic and riverine species. Proportions of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups were also similar, but Jaccard's similarity indices were relatively low (29%-57%), suggesting macroinvertebrate compositional differences among stand types. Coleopterans particularly affected species presence/absence patterns, but their presence was associated with low water level rather than hydrophyte type per se. Moreover, total macroinvertebrate densities were greater in both Phragmites treatments than in Typha; a pattern generated mostly by gastropods ( >= 95% Gyraulus deflectus and Physella gyrina) and chironomids. Microalgal food supply likely plays a part in explaining these density differences, given diatom-dominated epiphyton was denser on submerged shoots of Phragmites than on Typha. Common diatom assemblages were similar among stand types, but species richness was significantly greater on untreated-Phragmites than on herbicide-treated, early senescent Phragmites and untreated-Typha. However, advanced senescence from herbicide application (similar to 3 months) did not apparently affect macroscale habitat suitability and structure above and below the waterline, given counts of ovipositing odonates (mostly Ischnura and Enallagma) and captures of juvenile fishes (> 90% Lepomis spp.) were similar among stand types. Overall, our results suggest that benthic community structure is comparable between similarly-aged stands (similar to 4 yrs old) of invading reed and cattail and is not directly or indirectly affected by Glypro application.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	2008	28	1					40	56		10.1672/07-63.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/07-63.1													WOS:000255117200004
J	Heiri, O; Millet, L				Heiri, O; Millet, L			Reconstruction of Late Glacial summer temperatures from chironomid assemblages in Lac Lautrey (Jura, france)	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												A chironomid-July air temperature inference model based on chironomid assemblages in the surface sediments of 81 Swiss lakes was used to reconstruct Late Glacial July air temperatures at Lac Lautrey (Jura, Eastern France). The transfer-function was based on weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression and featured a leave-one-out cross-validated coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.80, a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.53degreesC, and was applied to a chironomid record consisting of 154 samples covering the Late Glacial period back to the Oldest Dryas. The model reconstructed July air temperatures of 11-12degreesC during the Oldest Dryas, increasing temperatures between 14 and 16.5degreesC during the Bolling, temperatures around 16.5-17.0degreesC for most of the Allerod, temperatures of 14-15degreesC during the Younger Dryas and temperatures of ca. 16.5degreesC during the Preboreal. The Lac Lautrey record features a two-step July air temperature increase after the Oldest Dryas, with an abrupt temperature increase of ca. 3-3.5degreesC at the Oldest Dryas/Bolling transition followed by a more gradual warming between ca. 14 200 and 13 700 BP. The transfer-function reconstructs a less rapid cooling at the Allerod/Younger Dryas transition than other published records, possibly an artefact caused by the poor analogue situation during the earliest Younger Dryas, and an abrupt warming at the Younger Dryas/Holocene transition. During the Allerod, two centennial-scale 1.5-2.0degreesC coolings are apparent in the record. Although chronologically not well constrained, the first of these cold events may be synchronous with the beginning of the Gerzensee Oscillation. The second is inferred just before deposition of the Laachersee tephra at Lac Lautrey and is therefore coeval with the end of the Gerzensee Oscillation. In contrast to the Greenland oxygen isotope records, the Lac Lautrey palaeotemperature reconstruction lacks a clearly defined Greenland Interstadial (GI)event 1d and the decreasing temperature trend during the Bolling/Allerod Interstadial.

J	Khalaf, EEAH				Khalaf, Ezz El Din Abdel Hakim			Mechanisms of volcaniclastic aggradation in fluvial systems influenced by explosive volcanism: An example from Neoproterozoic Hammamat Group, Wadi Queih area, Central Eastern Desert, Egypt	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Wadi Queih basin records different continental settings that interacted with explosive volcanism. This paper discusses the contrasting aggradational mechanisms in fluvial systems strongly influenced by explosive volcanism which took place during sedimentation of the Queih basin. Six main facies associations composed of 12 lithofacies have been recognized in the Neoproterozoic succession filling the Queih basin: (1) lava flows and pedogenically modified pyroclastics facies association, (2) debris-flow-dominated alluvial fan facies association, (3) sheetflood-dominated alluvial fan fades association, (4) crevasse-splay facies association, (5) lacustrine facies association, and (6) loess facies association. These facies assemblages are typical of low-sinuosity rivers flowing through unsymmetrical half graben basin. Petrographical and geochemical data of the Queih sediments indicate a predominantly continental volcanic block provenance and stable craton to fault-bounded basement uplift. Low values of Chemical and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (CIA and PIA) are consistent with low intensity source rock weatheming under prevailing semi-arid to arid climate. During deposition of the lower member of the Queih basin, common fall and flow tuff events occurred, indicating syn-eruptive conditions. In contrast, deposition of the upper member occurred in a fluvial-aeolian setting without input of primary volcaniclastic detritus, indicating inter-eruptive conditions. The change in depositional mode from the lower to upper is considered to be due to a change in the balance between the sedimentation rate and the rate of lake-level rise. Lithofacies stacking and rapid lateral changes of lithological units in conjunction with interformational unconformities and basin margin faults suggest tectonically induced sedimentation. Volcanism can also influence basin evolution and the delicate balance between erosion, sedimentation, and prevalent transport processes is affected the Queih basin by volcanic input. Thus, the Queih basin records the response of fluvial system to large, volcanism-induced sediment loads. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, J; Cao, YC; Liu, HM; Gao, YJ				Wang Jian; Cao Yingchang; Liu Huimin; Gao Yongjin			Formation Conditions and Sedimentary Model of Over-Flooding Lake Deltas within Continental Lake Basins: An Example from the Paleogene in the Jiyang Subbasin, Bohai Bay Basin	ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION												A large quantity of drilling core, paleontology, geochemistry and geophysics data revealed several features of the Jiyang subbasin during the deposition of the Ek(1)-Es(4)x members: (1) the paleotopography of the gentle slope belt had an extremely low gradient; (2) the paleoclimate frequently alternated between dry and wet periods in a generally arid setting; (3) there was strong weathering around the periphery of the basin; (4) the lake was very shallow; (5) the lake level frequently rose and fell; and (6) the sedimentary environment of the gentle slope belt was an over-flooding lake. All of these factors provided favorable geological conditions for the development of an over-flooding lake delta. The lithologies of the continental over-flooding lake delta deposits are complex and diverse. The compositional maturity is moderate to low, and the grain size distribution curves and sedimentary structures indicate the presence of both gravity and traction currents. The sedimentary microfacies associations consist of a combination of ordered superposition of flood channels, distributary channels and sheet sands. The delta exhibits a weak foreset seismic reflection. The over-flooding lake delta deposits are laterally extensive. The sandstone content is high, and the individual sandstone beds are thin. The flood channel and distributary channel deposits exhibit evidence of bifurcation and lateral migration. The distribution of the sandbodies and the oxidation color of the mudstones provide evidence of cyclic deposition. The paleoclimate was the dominant factor controlling the development of the over-flooding lake delta. Due to the frequently alternating wet and dry paleoclimates, the over-flooding lake delta is characterized by the development of a broad upper plain and a lower delta plain. The upper delta plain is characterized by flood channel deposits, whereas the lower delta plain is represented by distributary channel deposits. The transition zone is characterized by the interaction of flood channels and distributary channels. Due to fault activity, the sandbodies of the over-flooding lake delta were juxtaposed against hydrocarbon source rocks, which was favorable for the development of lithologic reservoirs or structural-lithologic reservoirs. The lower delta plain deposits comprise the most favorable reservoirs.					Wang, Jian/Q-3331-2019														1000-9515	1755-6724				FEB	2015	89	1					270	284																WOS:000352828700022

John B.; Liu, Xingqi; Kubatzki, Claudia; Lohmann, Gerrit			RETRACTED: What caused the mid-Holocene forest decline on the eastern Tibet-Qinghai Plateau? (Retracted article. See vol. 20, pg. 366, 2011)	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Atmospheric CO(2) concentrations depend, in part, on the amount of biomass locked up in terrestrial vegetation. Information on the causes of a broad-scale vegetation transition and associated loss of biomass is thus of critical interest for understanding global palaeoclimatic changes. Pollen records from the north-eastern Tibet-Qinghai Plateau reveal a dramatic and extensive forest decline beginning c. 6000 cal. yr bp. The aim of this study is to elucidate the causes of this regional-scale change from high-biomass forest to low-biomass steppe on the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau during the second half of the Holocene. Location Our study focuses on the north-eastern Tibet-Qinghai Plateau. Stratigraphical data used are from Qinghai Lake (3200 m a.s.l., 36 degrees 32'-37 degrees 15' N, 99 degrees 36'-100 degrees 47' E). Methods We apply a modern pollen-precipitation transfer function from the eastern and north-eastern Tibet-Qinghai Plateau to fossil pollen spectra from Qinghai Lake to reconstruct annual precipitation changes during the Holocene. The reconstructions are compared to a stable oxygen-isotope record from the same sediment core and to results from two transient climate model simulations. Results The pollen-based precipitation reconstruction covering the Holocene parallels moisture changes inferred from the stable oxygen-isotope record. Furthermore, these results are in close agreement with simulated model-based past annual precipitation changes. Main conclusions In the light of these data and the model results, we conclude that it is not necessary to attribute the broad-scale forest decline to human activity. Climate change as a result of changes in the intensity of the East Asian Summer Monsoon in the mid-Holocene is the most parsimonious explanation for the widespread forest decline on the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau. Moreover, climate feedback from a reduced forest cover accentuates increasingly drier conditions in the area, indicating complex vegetation-climate interactions during this major ecological change.

J	Stickney, AA; Anderson, BA; Ritchie, RJ; King, JG				Stickney, AA; Anderson, BA; Ritchie, RJ; King, JG			Spatial distribution, habitat characteristics and nest-site selection by Tundra Swans on the Central Arctic Coastal Plain, northern Alaska	WATERBIRDS					4th International Swan Symposium/18th Trumpeter-Swan-Society Conference	FEB 13-18, 2001	WARRENTON, VIRGINIA	Trumpeteer Swan Soc				Annual aerial surveys of nesting Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) were conducted during 1989-2000 on the Kuparuk and Milne Point oilfields and adjacent areas of the central Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska. Spatial analysis indicated that swans selected nest sites close (less than or equal to100 m) to large lakes (20-33 ha) and that nests were clumped in distribution each year, although nests on average were greater than 2.5 km apart. The clumped distribution of nests suggests that suitable habitats for nesting swans are not randomly distributed in the study area. Mean distance of nests to the Beaufort Sea coastline ranged annually from 11.1-14.5 km. Waterbodies near nests had significantly higher shoreline complexity each year than the closest waterbodies to random locations. Complex shorelines (i.e., small coves or sheltered areas) provide areas suitable for emergent vegetation such as Pendant Grass (Arctophila fulva), a dominant species in preferred foraging habitat in northern Alaska. Photographs of Tundra Swan nests, taken over a seven-year period, were used to characterize nest-site habitats at both macrotype and microtype scales. Nests primarily were located on the driest microtypes and on macrosites associated with lakes, usually within 20 m of the lake shore. Nest sites afforded good visibility and early exposure during spring thaw. Among the 89 swan territories that had at least three years of use, swans used the same mound each year in 36% of territories and used a different mound each year in 12%; swans in remaining territories used the same mound in some years and new mounds in others. Studies such as cuts may be useful for evaluating the impacts of oil development, and for planning and permitting future developments in new regions on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska.																			1524-4695						2002	25			1			227	235																WOS:000180160100031
J	Edlund, MB; Williams, RM; Soninkhishig, N				Edlund, MB; Williams, RM; Soninkhishig, N			The planktonic diatom diversity of ancient Lake Hovsgol, Mongolia	PHYCOLOGIA												Lake Hovsgol (51degreesN, 101degreesE) is Mongolia's largest lake, over 1.6 million years old, and the southernmost extant lake in the 25 million years old Baikal Rift Zone. In spite of their proximity and geological relationship, Lake Baikal and Lake Hovsgol share no common offshore planktonic diatoms, though their planktonic communities are both characterized by species-poor richness and probable endemism. Lake Hovsgol's phytoplankton has been studied sparsely for nearly 100 years; however, a modern taxonomic and systematic treatment has not been undertaken. Vertical net-tow plankton samples collected in summer 1998 from throughout the lake showed that the phytoplankton is dominated by chlorococcalean green algae, nanoplanktonic cyanobacteria, and six predominant diatom species: a large-celled race of Asterionella formosa, the epizooic Synedra cyclopum, two new Stephanodiscus species, Cyclotella sibirica, and a complex of forms identified as C. ocellata. Some taxa may be endemic to Lake Hovsgol or restricted in distribution to lakes in and near the Baikal Rift Zone. Stephanodiscus mongolicus Edlund, Soninkhishig & R.M. Williams sp. nov. is characterized by a spine and marginal fultoportula at each interfascicle, one rimoportula, and no central fultoportulae. Stephanodiscus jamsranii Edlund, Soninkhishig & R.M. Williams sp. nov. has a spine on each interfascicle, one rimoportula, and heterovalvy expressed in valve form and placement of central fultoportulae. Cyclotella ocellata contains a complex of forms. Evidence of near species-level separation is a polymodal distribution of postsexual initial cell sizes, a larger size range of initial and vegetative cells than is known for C ocellata, notably at the taxon's upper size spectrum, and persistence of these size distributions. The complex may represent a species flock that has developed reproductive separation but has not yet clearly separated along morphological lines. Alternatively, there may be a life history mechanism that allows stepwise auxosporulation or multiple vegetative cell sizes to enter sexuality and produce size-restored cell lines containing a wider range of cell sizes than previously reported for C. ocellata.

This study is based on the analysis of diatoms, pollen, microalgae, charcoal, magnetic susceptibility, geochemistry (organic carbon and titanium) and micromorphology in sediments from a section in a 5 m deep trench at Tulyehualco in the southern BM, close to the Zohapilco and Atlapulco archaeological sites. The chronology is based on five radiocarbon dates and on the correlation with two dated tephra layers. Abundant diatoms and microalgae attest for a period of high lake levels during the deglaciation (17,000-11,000 cal bp), followed by lowering lake levels during the Greenlandian (11,000-8,200 cal bp) when summer insolation peaked, and more oxidative subaerial conditions likely caused poor pollen preservation. Micromorphological analysis showed soil development processes and poor diatom and pollen preservation that confirmed subaerial (dry land) conditions during the 8,200 cal bp cold event. Zohapilco and Atlapulco were first occupied during this period of environmental difficulty. Better diatom and pollen preservation suggest a return to wetter conditions at similar to 7,500-6,500 cal bp, but unusually high charcoal concentrations could reflect human impact in the landscape since the mid Archaic. The diatom record showed that the late Formative (2,000 cal bp, 50 bc) abandonment of sites in the BM was associated with a new reduction in lake levels and a sedimentation hiatus.

J	Darby, PC; Bennetts, RE; Miller, SJ; Percival, HF				Darby, PC; Bennetts, RE; Miller, SJ; Percival, HF			Movements of Florida apple snails in relation to water levels and drying events	WETLANDS												Florida apple snails (Pomacea paludosa) apparently have only a limited tolerance to wetland drying events (although little direct evidence exists), but their populations routinely face dry downs under natural and managed water regimes. In this paper, we address speculation that apple snails respond to decreasing water levels and potential drying events by moving toward refugia that remain inundated. We monitored the movements of apple snails in central Florida, USA during drying events at the Blue Cypress Marsh (BC) and at Lake Kissimmee (LK). We monitored the weekly movements of 47 BC snails and 31 LK snails using radio-telemetry. Snails tended to stop moving when water depths were < 10 cm; however, there was no apparent effect of water depth on distance traveled in water depths >10 cm. Snails moved along the greatest positive depth gradient (i.e., towards deeper water) when they encountered water depths between 10 and 20 cm. Snails tended to move toward shallower water in water depths greater than or equal to50 cm, suggesting that snails were avoiding deep water areas such as canals and sloughs. Of the 11 BC snails originally located in the area that eventually went dry, three (27%) were found in deep water refugia by the end of the study. Only one of the 31 LK snails escaped the drying event by moving to deeper water. Our results indicate that some snails may opportunistically escape drying events through movement. The tendency to move toward deeper water was statistically significant and indicates that this behavioral trait might enhance survival when the spatial extent of a dry down is limited. However, as water level falls below 10 cm, snails stop moving and become stranded. As the spatial extent of a dry down increases, we predict that the number of snails stranded would increase proportionally. Stranded Pomacea paludosa must contend with dry marsh conditions, possibly by aestivation. Little more than anecdotal information has been published on P. paludosa aestivation, but it is a common adaptation among other apple snails (Caenogastropoda: Ampullaridae).																			0277-5212	1943-6246				SEP	2002	22	3					489	498		10.1672/0277-5212(2002)022[0489:MOFASI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2002)022[0489:MOFASI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000178600900005

Nitrogen isotopes have been widely used in environmental and climatic research. Various biogeochemical processes and nitrogen sources contribute to the sedimentary organic matter. Therefore, environmental implications of sedimentary nitrogen isotope (delta N-15(sed)) require further investigation. In this study, we report and compile the delta N-15(sed). records from eight lakes in China influenced by either climate changes or anthropogenic activities since the late Holocene to determine the major forcing factors of delta N-15(sed) . Our results showed that: (1) During the late Holocene, lacustrine delta N-15(sed). was mainly regulated by natural climate changes, such as temperature, precipitation, or both as anthropogenic activities were weak. (2) The impact of gradually increasing anthropogenic disturbances on delta N-15(sed). in the different lakes varied. Globally, the declining lacustrine delta N-15(sed). values could be attributed to atmospheric reactive nitrogen deposition. However, on the regional catchment scale, the increased delta N-15(sed). values in lakes may be related to increased nutrient input and higher primary production caused by increased anthropogenic activities, whereas the rapid decline of delta N-15(sed). values in lakes is possibly related to more nutrient input and 15 N-depleted organic matter input resulting excessive anthropogenic activities. Our study suggests that the impact of anthropogenic activities on lake eco- systems gradually increased in recent decades, and the amplitudes in variations of delta N-15(sed). values in some lakes exceeded those during periods of weak anthropogenic disturbances. If not properly managed, anthropogenic disturbances may outweigh nature (i.e., temperature, precipitation) as the leading cause of lake ecosystem changes in the future.

Additional deepwater sampling of prey fish in Lake Michigan annual bottom trawl survey reveals new insights for depth distribution dynamics	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Beginning in 2013, sites at the 128-m bottom depth contour were added to the sampling design of the annual Lake Michigan bottom trawl survey for prey fish, which has been conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC) each fall since 1973, to better assess fish depth dis-tributions in a changing ecosystem. The standard sampling design included bottom depths from 9 to 110 m, although the GLSC also sporadically conducted bottom trawl tows at the 128-m bottom depth contour during 1973-1988. Enactment of this new sampling design in 2013 revealed that mean biomass density of deepwater sculpins (Myoxocephalus thompsonii) at the 128-m depth exceeded the sum of mean biomass densities at shallower depths, indicating that the bulk of the deepwater sculpin population is residing in waters deeper than 110 m. Thus, our findings supported the hypothesis that the depth distri-bution of the deepwater sculpin population had shifted to deeper waters beginning in 2007, thereby explaining, at least in part, the marked decline in deepwater sculpin abundance since 2006 based on the standard sampling design. In contrast, our results did not support the hypothesis that the slimy scul-pin (Cottus cognatus) population had shifted to deeper waters sometime after 2000. A portion of the bur-bot (Lota lota) population may have also shifted in depth distribution to waters deeper than 110 m after 2007, based on our results. Our findings have served as an impetus to further expand the range of depths sampled in our bottom trawl survey.(c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Exploring the Potential Effects of Lost or Discarded Soft Plastic Fishing Lures on Fish and the Environment	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												As the popularity and use of soft plastic lures (SPLs) by recreational anglers have increased in recent years, so does the number of anecdotal reports of SPLs being found in aquatic environments and in the digestive tract of a variety of fish species. We used a multistep approach to determine the possible consequences of SPLs on fish and aquatic environments. Field work focussed on lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomeiu) in Charleston Lake in eastern Ontario, a system identified by resource managers and the lake association as potentially having an SPL problem based on numerous anecdotal reports from anglers. Snorkel surveys revealed that the deposition rate of SPLs was potentially as high as similar to 80 per km of shoreline per year. In the laboratory, eight different types of SPLs were immersed in water at two temperatures (4 and 21 degrees C) for a 2-year period to evaluate change in SPL size (both swelling and decomposition). Despite SPLs varying by manufacturer and in composition, there was little evidence of decomposition. Indeed, most SPLs swelled and remained that way throughout the study. In cold water, SPLs increased an average of 61 % in weight and 19 % in length, while warm water treatments experienced an increase of 205 % in weight and 39 % in length. A summer creel survey conducted on Charleston Lake revealed that 17.9 % of anglers interviewed reported finding at least one ingested SPL when cleaning lake trout. However, when we sampled lake trout (using gill nets) and smallmouth bass (by rod and reel), we found few ingested SPLs (2.2 and 3.4 %, respectively). Based on the examination of fish that contained SPLs and the near-shore surveys, the most common SPLs were soft stick baits/wacky worms. The most promising approach to address the SPL problem is to educate anglers about the need to rig SPLs in a manner such that they are less likely to be lost during fishing and to always discard SPLs appropriately. Moreover, the tackle industry should continue to investigate SPLs that are less likely to be pulled off by fish and/or that degrade rapidly.

The potassium-bearing brine is primarily found at depths exceeding 150 m within the porous alluvial and fluvial sand-gravel reservoir of the Middle to Lower Pleistocene. This deposit is characterized by a relatively shallow water table, moderate-to-strong aquifer productivity, high salinity, and a KCl content that meets the conditions for exploitation, with the advantage of reduced salt crystallization during well mining, making it a potential reserve base for potash development. A geochemical analysis of the sand-gravel brine revealed consistent trends for the major ions K+, Na+, Mg2+, Cl-, and SO42- along the east-west axis of the alluvial fan, while Ca2+ showed an opposite trend compared to Mg2+. Along the exploration lines from north to south, the concentrations of the main ions gradually increase. The brine is enriched in Na+ and Cl- ions, while SO42- and HCO3- are depleted. In the K+-Na+-Mg2+/Cl--H2O (25 degrees C) quaternary phase diagram, the brine falls within the halite stability field, with the hydrochemical type classified as chloride type. The brine coefficient characteristics indicate a multi-source origin involving residual evaporation, salt rock leaching, and metamorphic sedimentary brine. Comparison studies of the ionic composition and isotopic signatures (delta D, delta 18O, delta 37Cl, and delta 7Li) of deep sand-gravel brines in the study area with interstitial and confined brines in the southern depression suggest similar geochemical characteristics between them. The genetic analysis of the deposit proposes that during the basin tectonic evolution, the potassium-rich interstitial and confined brines originally located in the southern depression of the Mahai Basin were displaced under compressional forces and migrated northward as the depositional center shifted, eventually backfilling into the loose alluvial and fluvial sand and gravel reservoirs at the front of the Saishiteng Mountains, forming the deep sand-gravel brine deposits in the foreland.																				2073-4441				DEC	2024	16	24							3562	10.3390/w16243562	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16243562													WOS:001386843100001
J	Knoll, S; Zwisler, W; Simon, M				Knoll, S; Zwisler, W; Simon, M			Bacterial colonization of early stages of limnetic diatom microaggregates	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Macroscopic organic aggregates in pelagic environments are colonized by bacterial populations that differ from those in the surrounding water. To understand better how this well-adapted bacterial community is established, it is important to examine the initial colonization early in the aggregation process. We studied, therefore, the early formation and bacterial colonization of diatom microaggregates (MA) (< 150 pm) during the phytoplankton spring bloom in Lake Constance, Germany. Water samples were incubated in plexiglass cylinders rolled horizontally for 44 to 48 h and subsampled for MA and their bacterial colonization, which was examined by fluorescent in situ hybridization with oligonucleotides of various specificity. During the initial 24 h bacterial numbers remained <similar to>70 cells MA(-1) and finally increased to similar to 250 MA-1. Detection rates of Bacteria by probe EUB338 ranged from 40% to >80% of the DAPI-stainable cells. Initially, alpha -Proteobacteria detected by the probe ALF1b dominated the bacterial community on MA, whereas toward the end of the incubation beta -Proteobacteria increasingly dominated. Proportions of Cytophaga/Flavobacteria detected by the probe CF319a also increased systematically on MA toward the end but constituted lower proportions than beta -Proteobacteria. In the surrounding water beta -Proteobacteria dominated during the initial 24 h whereas Cytophaga/Flavobacteria consistently dominated in the late phase of the experiments. Applying highly specific probes for narrow clusters of close relatives of the genus Sphingomonas (alpha -Proteobacterium), Duganella zoogloeoides (formerly Zoogloea ramigera) and Acidovorax facilis (both beta -Proteobacteria), we found that these bacteria were present on MA already at the initial sampling or at the latest after 10 h and comprised substantial and sometimes dominant proportions of total alpha- and beta -Proteobacteria. These bacteria, also dominant on natural lake snow aggregates in Lake Constance, were never detected among the free-living bacterial community in the surrounding water. Hence, our results indicate that the bacterial community on lake snow aggregates develops largely from seeds on their precursor MA.																			0948-3055					SEP 4	2001	25	2					141	150		10.3354/ame025141	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame025141													WOS:000171011000004

Habitat use of remnant forest habitats by the threatened arboreal marsupial Dromiciops gliroides (Microbiotheria) in a rural landscape of southern Chile	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. Remnant forest patches in rural landscapes may be important sites for maintaining viable populations of restricted forest species, especially when these remnant habitats maintain some connectivity, for instance through riparian vegetation strips and other forest patches. Aims. We assessed the use of remnant forest habitats in a rural landscape of southern Chile (40 degrees S) by the 'near threatened' arboreal marsupial Dromiciops gliroides (Microbiotheria), in relation to habitat type (riparian strips, forest fragments and continuous forests), width of the riparian forests, and the presence and abundance of the hemiparasite Tristerix corymbosus, whose fruits are readily eaten by D. gliroides. Methods. In two summers, 2004 and 2008, we set up grids of 96 live traps for three consecutive nights at each of 16 sites along two riparian forest strips, four additional sites in remnant, non-riparian forest patches, and four more within continuous pre-Andean forest. We counted hemiparasites on trees in the trapping grid area, and estimated their individual volumes. Key results. In total, 48 individuals of D. gliroides were captured at all sites during the 2 years. We documented a significant positive relationship between the width of riparian vegetation and the number of individuals captured (r(s) = 0.78, P = 0.02, n = 8) for one riparian strip, but not for the second one. Neither habitat type nor the frequency of hemiparasites related statistically to D. gliroides abundance. Key conclusions. We conclude that in the rural landscape of the Chilean Lake District, narrow riparian forest strips, in a highly inter-connected mosaic of remnant forest patches may be as important as large patches and continuous Andean forests to sustain viable populations of this threatened, strictly arboreal, marsupial. Implications. The present study reports, for the first time, the presence in narrow riparian forests immersed in a pasture-dominated agricultural matrix of this forest-specialist marsupial, which was previously known only from continuous pre-Andean forests.

Changing depocentre environments of Palaeolake Olduvai and carbonates as marker horizons for hiatuses and lake-level extremes	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Primary carbonate and marl layers and limestone nodular horizons were intersected in OGCP Boreholes 1A, 2A, 3A, 3B, drilled into the depocentre of Palaeolake Olduvai. The various carbonate types were analysed, employing petrographic (including cathodo-luminescence), stable isotope, and sequence stratigraphic techniques, and recorded important information concerning lake evolution. Primary carbonate and marl layers are preserved at the top of lake deepening cycles (lake-parasequences), marking maximum flooding, followed by lake withdrawal, and then fluvial erosion, leading to the next depositional cycle. Presence of pelagites and a meromict lake favouring anoxic conditions, show it to be not a playa lake, but a deeper fault-bound lake, akin to present day Lake Eyasi. Carbonate and marl layers were exclusively deposited when claystone facies show a geochemical magnesium anomaly associated with a phase of basaltic volcanism affecting the basin, marked by mafic tuffs and basaltic lava flows. Calcium was partitioned into evaporites, such as gypsum/anhydrite, together with the nodular horizons and carbonate soil profiles in the sequence. The resulting high Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio in the lake waters promoted dolomite deposition and replacement, and the formation of aragonite. The nodular horizons yield rainfall isotope values and mark times when the lake was empty and the lake-bed fell under meteoric conditions, precipitating limestone nodules just below the sediment surface under pedogenic vadose, groundwater interface, and groundwater phreatic conditions. The nodular limestone horizons sit below erosional/hiatal surfaces and show vadose micritic and fibrous types to phreatic sparry and other accretionary type textures. Enterolithic to chickenwire textured nodules indicate the pseudomorphing of anhydrite nodules that form beneath salt marshes. Thus, the two carbonate types, primary layers and nodular horizons, provided depth gauges, respectively for the extremes of lake expansion and emptying/drying out. In the case of nodular horizons, the maturity of the carbonate profile gives an indication of the magnitude of the hiatal time gap represented, similar to 1 kyr to 2 kyr for a single horizon to similar to 3 kyr to 9 kyr for more mature soil profiles. Emptying/drying out episodes of Palaeolake Olduvai were not uncommon, and often short-lived. A spectrum of hiatal disconformities in the Olduvai Basin vary from multimillennial hiatuses to mega-disconformities of similar to 40 kyr and similar to 75 kyr.

J	Hubbs, CL				Hubbs, CL			Speciation of fishes	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Environment is as indispensable in speciation as are changing gene ratios. Parallel variation demonstrates this point, and is exemplified by the general tendency of fishes to have distinctive proportions and an increased (rarely a decreased) number of segments in colder or more saline waters; to be stream-lined in large, swift rivers, less so in creeks; to have less inferior mouths and more poorly developed sense organs in springs than in creeks; of cyprinodonts to lose pelvic fins in isolated waters; to develop many long gill-rakers in lakes; to be terete and small-finned in waters of low productivity and deep-bodied and large-finned in rich waters; to have smaller eyes but better developed tactile organs in the more silty waters; to hypertrophy the sense organs in the deep sea; to become large-eyed and red in the twilight zone of moderate depths; to lose eyes and pigment in caves (an almost universal relation, explainable on the basis of repeated mutation); of lampreys to become non-parasitic and degenerate in creeks. Consideration of such parallel variations is essential to an explanation of specia- lion, which is an interplay between the adaptation of the organism and the selection of habitat. Natural selection is an essential basis of speciation as well as general phylogeny. "Blended" inheritance is typically shown when races, spp. or genera of vertebrates are crossed; this also is a fact essential to an explanation of speciation. Phases but not systematic forms of vertebrates are due to characters showing simple Mendelian segregation. Marked parallelisms are shown between specific and racial differences, direct environmental effects, age variations, and sexual dimorphism. Similar if not identical biochemical processes are probably involved in all spheres of differentiation. "Speciation is no aimless wandering of genes through the organic world, but rather an orderly adjustment under the rigid control of the environment.".																			0003-0147	1537-5323					1940	74						198	211		10.1086/280888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/280888													WOS:000188901200021
J	WRIGHT, JC				WRIGHT, JC			THE HYDROBIOLOGY OF ATWOOD LAKE - A FLOOD-CONTROL RESERVOIR	ECOLOGY												A two-year study was made of the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of Atwood Lake in eastern Ohio with special reference to the effect of these factors on the production of desirable crops of game fish. Previously, the lake was drained to get rid of rough fish thought to be creating conditions unfavorable for game and pan fish. Poor light penetration in the upper end of the lake was due largely to the presence of iron-humus colloids. Turbidity was important only during spring months as a result of surface runoff. Phytoplankton crops were low in comparison to more productive lakes. Phytoplankton numbers were greater in 1949 than in 1948, and marked variations in horizontal distribution were noted both years. Zooplankton populations were greater in the upper end of the lake where a large amount of vegetation was inundated by the rise in water level in 1947. Zooplankton crops were smaller in 1949 compared to 1948; the greatest decline occurred in the upper end of the lake. Bottom fauna consisted of Chaoborus and chironomid larvae. Compared to other lakes, bottom fauna was very low, which was correlated with low phytoplankton production. The average rate of gross photosynthesis was 906 mg O2/m2/day, and the average rate of oxygen consumption amounted to 1262 mg O2/mVday. The efficiency of gross production in Atwood was .063%. No evidence was obtained to show that carp were affecting the productivity of the lake either by making the water turbid, eliminating weed beds, or by interference with spawning activities of game fish. It was concluded that the natural level of productivity of Atwood Lake was too low to maintain satisfactory growth rates of the populations of game fish produced following draining.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1954	35	3					305	316		10.2307/1930091	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930091													WOS:A1954UZ52200001
J	Manning, PG				Manning, P. G.			MOSSBAUER SPECTRAL STUDIES OF FERRIC PHOSPHATE INTERACTION IN SEDIMENTS UNDERLYING OXIC LAKE WATERS	CANADIAN MINERALOGIST												Mossbauer spectra were obtained of freeze-dried sediment samples from the Bay of Quinte, a shallow eutrophic bay on the northern shore of lake Ontario. Spectra were measured on sections from the upper 6 cm of sediment collected beneath 4 m of oxic water during late July and August, a period covering a massive release of phosphate from the sediments to the overlying waters (Lean & Charlton 1,976), The spectra comprise two resolvable doublets which mark ferrous and ferric ions in octahedral coordination. Fe8+:Fe2+ ratios for the 0-2 cm sections of core decreased from late July (ratio=2.8) to late August (ratio=2.2), showing that the release of phosphate is coincident with the reduction of sediment-bound ferric ions. For fractions of core collected in late August, Fe3+. Fe2+ ratios increased in the order 0-2 cm (ratio=2.23), 4Fe(2+) ratios for 0-2 cm, 2-4 cm, and 4-6 cm fractions collected in mid-June were equal. Calculated values of isomer shift (IS) and of quadrupole splitting (PS) are for Fe3+, IS=0.37 mm s(-1) and QS=0.67 mm s(-1), and for Fez+, IS=1.13 mm s(-1) and QS=2.53 mm s-1. These results are consistent with the theory that, for most of the year, ferric phosphate complexes are a sink for phosphate ion, but under the reducing conditions generated by the decay of the load or organic matter deposited in early summer, the complexes are unstable and phosphate is released. The ferric ions are present on exchangeable cation sites in amorphous hydrated ferric oxides or in clay minerals.																			0008-4476	1499-1276				AUG	1977	15		3				422	426																WOS:000208513200020

However, prehistoric fire regimes, their ecological consequences, and their relationships with large-scale climate drivers and human activities remain poorly understood. Here, we use a high-resolution sedimentary charcoal record from Verlorenvlei, a coastal lake situated on the west coast, to interrogate links between fire, climate, and pastoralism in the Fynbos Biome. Our record has a robust chronology supported by 24 radiocarbon dates and provides a continuous sedimentary sequence spanning the last 4200 years, documenting fire activity before and after the local arrival of pastoralists in the Verlorenvlei area similar to 1500 cal years BP. Fire at Verlorenvlei over the last 4200 years is variable, with relatively low activity until similar to 2000 cal years BP, after which variable but generally higher fire activity occurs until the highest period of fire activity from similar to 1450 to 1800 CE (similar to 500-150 cal years BP). The increase in fire activity similar to 2000 years ago corresponds with a shift in the diatom assemblage at Verlorenvlei from marine towards brackish and freshwater species, reflecting increased precipitation derived from a strengthening of the southern westerly winds. The peak in fire activity beginning similar to 1450 CE (similar to 500 cal years BP), near the onset of the Little Ice Age, tracks a second diatom-inferred strengthening of the westerly winds. Other southern hemisphere and Antarctic records further corroborate this increased westerly influence after similar to 2000 years. Linear regression modeling on the fire record indicates that moisture availability is the primary driver of fire at Verlorenvlei, with little evidence that human populations influenced fire. Our reconstruction suggests that fire activity at Verlorenvlei is limited by moisture availability and that wetter conditions facilitate increased vegetation (i.e., fuel) and intensified fire at this otherwise fuel-limited site. This work has implications for management and conservation decisions in response to future predictions of a warmer and drier climate along South Africa's west coast.

J	Kershaw, JA; Clague, JJ; Evans, SG				Kershaw, JA; Clague, JJ; Evans, SG			Geomorphic and sedimentological signature of a two-phase outburst flood from moraine-dammed Queen Bess Lake, British Columbia, Canada	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												On 12 August 1997, the lower part of Diadem Glacier in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia fell into Queen Bess Lake and produced a train of large waves. The waves overtopped the broad end moraine at the east end of the lake and flooded the valley of the west fork of Nostetuko River. The displacement waves also incised the outflow channel across the moraine. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic evidence supports the conclusion that the flood had two phases, one related to wave overtopping and a second to breach formation. Empirical equations were used to calculate the peak discharge of the flood at various points along the west fork of the Nostetuko valley and to describe the attenuation of the flood wave. The velocity of the flood was also calculated to determine the time it took for the flood to reach the main fork of Nostetuko River. The highest peak discharges were achieved in the upper reach of the valley during the displacement phase of the flood. Peak discharge declined rapidly just below the moraine dam, with little change thereafter for approximately 7 km. Empirical formulae and boulder measurements indicate a rise in peak discharge in the lower part of the west fork valley. We suggest that flow in the upper part of the valley records the passage of two separate flood peaks and that the rise in discharge in the lower part of the valley is due to amalgamation of the wave and breach peaks. Hydraulic ponding in confined reaches of the valley extended the duration of the flood. In addition, erosion of vegetation and sediment in the channel and valley sides may also have exerted an influence on the duration and nature of flooding. Sediments were deposited both upstream and downstream of channel constrictions and on a large fan extending out into the trunk Nostetuko River valley. This study extends our understanding of the variety and complexity of outburst floods from naturally dammed lakes. It also shows that simple empirical and other models for estimating peak discharges of outburst floods are likely to yield erroneous results. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

The area and length of the home range and total distance travelled between observations were greater for female turtles than for males. Mean home range did not differ between 1990 (8.6 ha for females and 2.2 ha for males) and 1991 (9.7 ha for females and 3.4 ha for males) for either sex. The maximum distance travelled from the nesting site in 1990 was 2020 m. This was not measured in 1991. In 1990, but not in 1991, the distance travelled from the nesting site, the maximum length of the home range, and distances travelled between observations by females were positively and significantly related to their body mass. In both years, turtles moved the greatest distances from spring until mid-July and movement decreased throughout late July and August. Very little movement occurred between 31 August 1990 and 15 March 1991 when the turtles were hibernating. Following overwintering, turtles resumed movement after 15 March 1991. Male and female Snapping Turtles did not have significantly different home range sizes than turtles in previous studies of a more northern population in Ontario. However, nesting migrations were shorter for turtles from the Lake Ontario population probably due to greater availability of suitable nesting and feeding areas. Our findings indicate that home range size is not clearly correlated with expected differences in energetics requirements based on differences in habitat productivity, sex: or body size.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1995	109	2					192	200																WOS:A1995TB34800004

Biomineralization is perhaps the most obvious time-bounded driver. However, other changes in the sedimentological character of Archean and Proterozoic carbonates offer an under-considered record of fluctuations in Earth's chemical, biological, and physical systems before and during the rise of animal life. Geobiologists and geochemists have successfully used large geochemical datasets to track changes in Earth's surface chemistry through time, but inconsistencies between proxies make the recognition of clear spatial-temporal patterns challenging. In order to place new constraints on the environmental history of Archean and Proterozoic oceans, especially with regard to redox state, we present for the first time a high-resolution database of global Precambrian and Cambrian carbonate sedimentation. Our initial datasbase, named Microstrat, comprises carbonate-bearing successions dating from c. 3.4 billion to similar to 500 million years old; these include more than 130 carbonate-bearing formations, digitized at the highest stratigraphic resolution possible and classified by environment of deposition. Lithofacies details are recorded at the finest scale available, including a range of microbial and other depositional fabrics, mineralogy, environment of deposition, age and location. We interrogate the Archean, Proterozoic, and Cambrian carbonate records, testing both long-standing and novel hypotheses about changes in Earth's carbonate system through time. Changes in carbonate sedimentology illuminate global changes in bioturbation and microbial community structure; the depth-dependent timing of marine oxygenation and the transition from anaerobic to aerobic respiration at and within the seafloor; and temporal changes in patterns of dolomitization. Shifts in both the loci of carbonate precipitation and in markers of animal activity are consistent with time- and depth-dependent trends in ocean oxygenation. We also note changes through time in the morphologies of stromatolites and thrombolites, which we suggest reflect secular shifts in carbonate precipitation, clastic sediment transport, and eukaryotic evolution. Observations from the database and petrographic studies confirm that the nature and extent of Proterozoic dolomite contrasts with that of dolomite in the Phanerozoic, consistent with dolomite being an early or even, in some cases, primary precipitate prior to the Cambrian Period. Because this database preserves environmental context and the stratigraphic relationships of carbonate features rather than tracking the occurrence of single features through time, it permits new and detailed analyses of the physical sedimentology of Precambrian carbonates and correlations in time and space among different features. We also consider how to build upon this initial dataset. Capturing and analyzing sedimentological data is difficult. Analysis becomes more challenging when data have been collected by multiple researchers working across Earth's entire history and surface. Field observations have a great deal of power to describe and explain changes in Earth's surface environments, yet they are often reported in idiosyncratic ways that make it difficult to compare them, obscuring their true explanatory power. Microstrat is an effort to pool idiosyncratic sedimentological data in hopes of illuminating Archaean, Proterozoic, and Cambrian carbonate depositional environments, yet it is unavoidably limited. We describe how other researchers can help to build Microstrat into a community-curated database by reporting and sharing data.						/0000-0002-6106-2059; /0000-0002-9674-018X													0012-8252	1872-6828				FEB	2020	201								103065	10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.103065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.103065													WOS:000520949700020

Tight-reservoir micropore formation and evolution in sedimentary organic-matter-bearing tuff: a case study from the Permian Tiaohu Formation in the Santanghu Basin, NW China	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Recently, a tuffaceous tight oil reservoir with considerable reserves has been found in the Santanghu Basin, northwestern China. The physical properties of the tuff are characterised by high porosity (5-25%) and low permeability (0.01-0.50 mD). This reservoir has the peculiar property of being a sedimentary organic-matter-bearing tuff formed by air-fall volcanic ash in a lake. Its discovery offered an excellent opportunity to further our knowledge of the formation and evolution of tuffaceous tight-reservoir micropores. This study integrates analyses of organic geochemistry, thin-sections, scanning electron microscopy, CT scanning, mineral and element compositions, mercury injections and measurements of porosity and permeability to determine the characteristics of the formation and evolution of the tuff micropores. (1) The tuff reservoir comprises vitric, crystal-vitric, pelitic and silicified tuffs, which are characterised by high porosity and big throat, moderate porosity and thin throat, low porosity and thin throat, and very low porosity and moderate throat pore structures, respectively. (2) Of the four types, vitric tuff has the properties best suited to a reservoir, and devitrification of volcanic glasses is the principal mechanism of reservoir micropore formation. (3) The tuff of the Permian Tiaohu Formation contains sedimentary organic matter, and organic acids produced during kerogen maturation facilitate the process of devitrification. (4) Evolution of tuff porosity depends mainly on the original composition and burial depth. The porosity of vitric tuff is higher than crystal-vitric tuff at the same depth, but both their porosities initially decrease and then increase with depth. At depths >3000m, vitric tuff retains the trend towards higher porosity, whereas the porosity of crystal-vitric tuff remains largely unchanged or even decreases. The results of this investigation could be considered a reference regarding the distribution and prediction of tuffaceous reservoirs in similar situations in other parts of the world.

Anguillicoloides crassus infection of European eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.), in inland waters of Estonia: history of introduction, prevalence and intensity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					International Conference and Workshop on Managing Alien Species for Sustainable Development of Aquaculture and Fisheries	NOV 05-07, 2008	Univ Florence, Florence, ITALY		Univ Florence			Eel fishery in Estonian inland waters depends entirely on the stocking of glass eels or pre-grown (farmed) eels. Via importation of live eels of 20-30 cm length the non-indigenous swimbladder nematode Anguillicoloides crassus was probably introduced via Germany into Lake Vortsjarv in 1988, and has since spread to many inland waters of Estonia. In 1992, the parasite was found in eel caught from Lake Vortsjarv. Between 1992 and 2002 and additionally in 2008, we examined in total 870 eels from Lake Vortsjarv (270 km(2)) and in 2008, 63 eels from three small lakes for adult A. crassus. The aim of the study was to obtain information on the variation of A. crassus infection in eels in Estonian lakes, to determine the temporal dynamics of prevalence and intensity of infection, and to establish a relationship between the length of host and intensity of infection in the eels in Lake Vortsjarv. There appeared to be a pronounced variation in prevalences of infected eels (from 3.7% to 100%) between the four investigated lakes. However, in Lake Vortsjarv, the prevalence of adult A. crassus infection remained stable (mean about 65%) for many years. The average number of nematode per infected eel (mean intensity) ranged from 12.6 +/- 2.5 in 1993 to 4.0 +/- 0.6 in 1999 in Lake Vortsjarv, while it was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in the period 1992-1998 compared to 1999-2002 and 2008. The mean number of parasites per swimbladder was not related to eel length and no statistical difference was found in the condition factor of infected and non-infected eels. Although under normal environmental conditions A. crassus has not caused serious disease problems to eels in the study area, high intensity of parasite infection may contribute to eel kills due to oxygen deficiency in winter under the ice in Lake Vortsjarv.

The Azuaje travertine: an example of aragonite deposition in a recent volcanic setting, N Gran Canaria Island, Spain	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Azuaje travertines in the north of Gran Canary Island crop out in the Azuaje Gorge, which is incised into Miocene volcanic breccias of the Roque Nublo Formation. This travertine is interesting because of the scarcity of travertines in the Canary Islands and its close relationship with recent volcanic events. Part of the travertine overlies a lava flow, dated at 2420 +/- 40 years BP. The travertine is composed mainly of aragonite in both perched systems on the gorge walls and in gorge bottom deposits parallel to the present stream Perched systems include, deposits from the feeder conduits within the Roque Nublo Formation that spilled out through waterfalls and over barriers. The gorge (valley) bottom system includes barrier and pool deposits. The main laminated fades are composed mostly of large fibrous aragonite crystals, while there are also common micritic and porous microfabrics. Shrubs, coated grains, coated bubbles and rafts are present in many of the deposits. Detailed study of the microfacies shows the presence of sparsely distributed biogenic features. The delta C-13 values are between +4.0 and +11.0%., and the delta C-13 values range between -11.0 and -2.0%. VPDB. These delta C-13 values lie within the range of those of thermogene travertines fed by thermal waters that cooled downstream, as indicated by the increase of the carbon and oxygen isotope values in that direction. The common occurrence of fibrous radial fabrics is interpreted to be due to disequilibrium conditions during aragonite precipitation. Disequilibrium was likely caused by rapid CO2 degassing of the thermal waters that led to a rapid increase in the degree of aragonite saturation. Thus, the morphology of the aragonite crystals and the isotopic composition indicate that the formation of the Azuaje travertine was: mostly due to abiogenic processes induced by rapid degassing of thermal waters, linked to the presence of a recent lava flow within the Gorge. In short, the Azuaje travertine shows the important role of volcanic activity in travertine deposition, in the fades distribution as well as in the geochemical signatures of the deposits, and so can be used as a recent analogue for ancient travertine deposits in volcanic settings.

J	Ojala, A; Kokkonen, S; Kairesalo, T				Ojala, A; Kokkonen, S; Kairesalo, T			The role of phosphorus in growth of phytoplankton in Lake Vesijarvi, southern Finland - a multitechnique approach	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The role of phosphorus in phytoplankton growth was studied in Lake Vesijarvi, a large previously eutrophic body of water with a history of flourishing fishery. The study combined different approaches: long-term algal enrichment experiments with natural phytoplankton assemblages were carried out together with observations on nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, elemental ratios (N: P, C: P C: N) of particulate matter, and analysis of P uptake using [P-33]. None of the approaches revealed periods of P limitation, but some growth experiments as well as elemental ratios indicated slight deficiency in early summer. Concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), which were usually 20-30 mug l(-1), also indicated luxurious P resources. Thermal stratification was weak and the lake mixed twice during the study period; this was reflected in the phytoplankton biomass that increased up to 4-fold. Results of elemental ratios usually suggested the occurrence of nitrogen limitation, and in general these ratios were low for a lake. All size fractions >0.22 mum in the experiments with [P-33] showed P uptake. In August most of the P was taken up by picoplankton, but when the lake turned over in September, the uptake of P by this fraction was absent. Thus, there was always a plentiful supply of P for phytoplankton, but the shortage of inorganic N may have affected those algae not capable of fixing N, These conditions should have favoured the growth of heterocystous cyanobacteria, but these prokaryotes never attained high abundances. This may have been due to the weak stability of the water column, or the growth of cyanobacteria may have been limited by trace elements such as molybdenum or iron.																			1015-1621						2003	65	3					287	296		10.1007/s00027-003-0652-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-003-0652-y													WOS:000185741300011

Rapidly changing climates are superimposed on other ecosystem stresses such as urbanization, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, loss of native biodiversity, and the invasion of exotic species. Climate influences the frequency and intensity of disturbance (e.g. fire and insect outbreaks), species distribution patterns, hydrological patterns, and forest condition. I present examples of research and monitoring activities on Department of the Interior lands, primarily in the western United States. Evidence of regional warming comes from rapidly disappearing glaciers in Montana, lake level decline in Crater Lake, Oregon, and expansion of high-elevation forests in Colorado and Washington. I also present evidence of regional cooling in the summer months due to land-use changes in the plains of Colorado, where crop irrigation and landscaping have influenced the climate, hydrology, and forest vegetation patterns in the adjacent Rocky Mountains. In some areas, the effects of land-use practices on regional climate may overshadow larger-scale temperature changes commonly associated with observed increases in CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Our understanding of rapid climate change, and other equally important multiple stresses to forest condition, is aided by strong ecosystem research and long-term monitoring programs. Our challenges in North America (and the world) are to: (1) determine which species, habitats, and ecosystem processes are most sensitive to rapid environmental change and multiple stresses; (2) monitor ecosystem change in consistent and comparable ways; and (3) coordinate mitigation strategies and efforts.																									1999		12					5	9																WOS:000086142400001
J	Watanabe, K; Hino, S; Takahashi, N				Watanabe, K; Hino, S; Takahashi, N			Effects of exogenous phenol-degrading bacteria on performance and ecosystem of activated sludge	JOURNAL OF FERMENTATION AND BIOENGINEERING												Three exogenous phenol-degrading bacteria, Alcaligenes sp. R5, Acromobacter sp. El and Alcaligenes sp. E2, were each inoculated into separate laboratory units of activated sludge fed on peptone, and then phenol loading was started. The control unit (no inoculum) required 10 d for complete degradation of phenol. Inoculation with strain R5 did not shorten this start-up period, whereas inoculation with strains El or E2 shortened it to 2 or 3 d, respectively. Population dynamics of the three strains were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by which a population with a density of more than 1 x 10(8) cells per mi (background density) could be detected. The R5 population density was never greater than the background, whereas the El population increased to 2 x 10(9) cells per mi (approximately 50% of the total cell count) during the startup period, and fell to below the background 35 d after the inoculation. The E2 population initially increased to 8 x 10(8) cells per mi, and subsequently survived at approximately 2 x 10(8) cells per mi throughout the remainder of 40-d experiment. These results suggest that the inocula, strains El and E2, capable of forming the predominant populations, caused successful bioaugmentation which shortened the start-up period. In pure-culture experiments performed to investigate the growth of the strains on phenol and peptone, it was found that strain El was superior in terms of growth on peptone at low concentrations to the other strains, and strain R5 was inferior. Such an advantage of strain El was not observed during growth on phenol. From these results, it is proposed that one of the important properties of microorganisms for successful bioaugmentation, i.e. shortening of the start-up period, Is potential for rapid growth on coexisting nutrients, such as peptone in this study.

Owing to the frequent spread of waterborne diseases in different regions where the communities do not have access to clean potable water the objective of this study was to isolate disease causing bacteria especially diarrhoea. In this study we isolated and characterised four species of Gram-negative bacteria from environmental waters used for domestic purposes by some communities in Kenya. Attempts were also made to isolate potential bacteriophages from the environmental waters for application as biocontrol agents in water decontamination. Clear, circular plaques of different sizes were formed on lawns of each of the bacterial species which could form the basis for bacteriophage isolation. The sources of water included Lake Victoria, rivers, wells, ponds, beaches, boreholes, springs and Indian Ocean. The four bacterial species characterized by 16S rRNA partial gene sequences and phylogenetic tree were: Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli: O83, Providencia sneebia and Proteus mirabilis. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers: MN467398.1 and MN907473.1 (Escherichia coli), MN467401.1 (Providencia sneebia), MN467400.1 (Proteus mirabilis), MN467399.1, MN907465.1 and MN907464.1 (Vibrio cholerae) bacterial isolates. On the phylogenetic tree, P. sneebia grouped most closely to Morganella species, a closely related genus. Overall, the phylogenetic analysis also indicates the bacterial species isolated were not identical to bacteria in the database, but rather new isolates of the given species. The presence of these bacteria in the environmental waters of Kenya was an indication that the water was not safe for human consumption. Development of clear phage plaques was an indication of the presence of lytic phages that can be used for subsequent bacteriophage isolation from each bacterial strain after concentration.																			2250-0480					MAR	2021	11	2					L121	L129		10.22376/ijpbs/lpr.2021.11.2.L121-129	http://dx.doi.org/10.22376/ijpbs/lpr.2021.11.2.L121-129													WOS:000631706400014

Indeed, regional climate differences have been evidenced during the Late Glacial in Europe and the northern Mediterranean. However, past climate patterns are still debated since temperature and precipitation changes are poorly investigated towards the lower European latitudes. Lake Matese in southern Italy is a key site in the central Mediterranean to investigate climate patterns during the Late Glacial. This study aims to reconstruct climate changes and their impacts at Matese using a multi-proxy approach including magnetic susceptibility, geochemistry (XRF core scanning), pollen data and molecular biomarkers like branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs). Paleotemperatures and paleo-precipitation patterns are quantitatively inferred from pollen assemblages (multi-method approach: modern analogue technique, weighted averaging partial least-squares regression, random forest and boosted regression trees) and brGDGT calibrations. The results are compared to a latitudinal selection of regional climate reconstructions in Italy to better understand climate processes in Europe and in the circum-Mediterranean region. A warm Bolling-Allerod and a marked cold Younger Dryas are revealed in all climate reconstructions inferred from various proxies (chironomids, ostracods, speleothems, pollen, brGDGTs), showing no latitudinal differences in terms of temperatures across Italy. During the Bolling-Allerod, no significant changes in terms of precipitation are recorded; however, a contrasted pattern is visible during the Younger Dryas. Slightly wetter conditions are recorded south of 42(?) N, whereas dry conditions are recorded north of 42(?) N. During the Younger Dryas, cold conditions can be attributed to the southward position of North Atlantic sea ice and of the polar frontal jet stream, whereas the increase in precipitation in southern Italy seems to be linked to relocation of Atlantic storm tracks into the Mediterranean, induced by the Fennoscandian ice sheet and the North European Plain. By contrast, warm conditions during the Bolling-Allerod can be linked to the northward position of North Atlantic sea ice and of the polar frontal jet stream.					; Menot, Guillemette/A-5403-2017; Guedron, Stephane/K-7692-2018; Charlet, Laurent/G-2437-2019; Guédron, Stéphane/K-7692-2018; Vanniere, Boris/E-4002-2010; Vannière, Boris/E-4002-2010; Wulf, Sabine/C-7777-2013; Ménot, Guillemette/A-5403-2017; Joannin, Sebastien/C-8324-2012	Robles, Mary/0000-0002-9237-1874; Menot, Guillemette/0000-0003-2423-8294; Guedron, Stephane/0000-0003-4229-1566; Vanniere, Boris/0000-0002-6779-6053; Wulf, Sabine/0000-0003-0229-7656; Dugerdil, Lucas/0000-0003-0266-564X; Joannin, Sebastien/0000-0001-8345-9252													1814-9324	1814-9332				FEB 23	2023	19	2					493	515		10.5194/cp-19-493-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-493-2023													WOS:000937168400001

Reconstructing the hydrological landform and sedimentary history of its surrounding areas (Shizhu) is significant for further constraining any links between regional paleoenvironmental change and the human-land relationship in the lager river valley. To examine paleo-hydrological and provenance evolution, the rare earth element (REE) and trace element ratio from the Shizhuping (SZP) section were analyzed. The SZP section records the paleo-hydrological evolution over 1300 years: river network cutting plain landscape-Shizhu Lake-river floodplain-Shizhu Lake reformation-Shizhu flat. This section was labeled as stages IV to I, respectively. The deposition of stages IV was wind and dust accumulation during the Last Glacial. The provenance of stages III (1288-1094 a.BP) was wasted from the ceramic production process. The layer of stage II (1094-380 a.BP) was in two parts. In stage II-2 (1094-890 a.BP), provenance was dominated by granite. Sedimentary rocks became the source of stage II-1 (890-380 a.BP). In stages I (380 a.BP-), the primary material sources were anthropogenic bedding and weathering erosion deposits around the slope. During the Medieval Warm Period, the climate was warm and humid, and the rising water level of the Xiangjiang River led to the emergence of lakes in the Shizhu area. The migration of northern China into Changsha kiln brought new technology and labor. In the late Five Dynasties, the climate turned dry, and the falling water level of the Xiangjiang River caused Changsha kiln to lose its commercial wharf.

J	de Groot, GA; During, H				de Groot, G. Arjen; During, Heinjo			Fern Spore Longevity in Saline Water: Can Sea Bottom Sediments Maintain a Viable Spore Bank?	PLOS ONE												Freshwater and marine sediments often harbor reservoirs of plant diaspores, from which germination and establishment may occur whenever the sediment falls dry. Therewith, they form valuable records of historical inter- and intraspecific diversity, and are increasingly exploited to facilitate diversity establishment in new or restored nature areas. Yet, while ferns may constitute a considerable part of a vegetation's diversity and sediments are known to contain fern spores, little is known about their longevity, which may suffer from inundation and - in sea bottoms - salt stress. We tested the potential of ferns to establish from a sea or lake bottom, using experimental studies on spore survival and gametophyte formation, as well as a spore bank analysis on sediments from a former Dutch inland sea. Our experimental results revealed clear differences among species. For Asplenium scolopendrium and Gymnocarpium dryopteris, spore germination was not affected by inundated storage alone, but decreased with rising salt concentrations. In contrast, for Asplenium trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens germination decreased following inundation, but not in response to salt. Germination rates decreased with time of storage in saline water. Smaller and less viable gametophytes were produced when saline storage lasted for a year. Effects on germination and gametophyte development clearly differed among genotypes of A. scolopendrium. Spore bank analyses detected no viable spores in marine sediment layers. Only two very small gametophytes (identified as Thelypteris palustris via DNA barcoding) emerged from freshwater sediments. Both died before maturation. We conclude that marine, and likely even freshwater sediments, will generally be of little value for long-term storage of fern diversity. The development of any fern vegetation on a former sea floor will depend heavily on the deposition of spores onto the drained land by natural or artificial means of dispersal.																			1932-6203					NOV 4	2013	8	11							e79470	10.1371/journal.pone.0079470	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0079470								24223951					WOS:000326503400116

We sought to describe the epidemiology of this infection in pregnant women in Uganda to provide background data for a study into the effect of H. pylori infection during pregnancy on the hematological response to iron supplementation. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, H. pylori infection was assessed by the stool antigen test among 447 pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in Apac, Mbale, Mbarara and Rakai Districts which are in different geographical regions in Uganda, and at Kawempe Health Center which serves a low-income densely populated area in Kampala City. Socio-demographic and household data were collected by face-to-face interviews using a questionnaire. Associations between H. pylori infection and socio-demographic and household characteristics were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: The overall prevalence of H. pylori infection was 45.2% but varied by geographical location from 18.2% in Apac District to 60.5% at Kawempe Health Centre. At 18.4%, the Langi ethnic group, who were enrolled exclusively in Apac District, had the lowest prevalence of H. pylori infection while the Gisu had the highest prevalence (58.4%). H. pylori was independently associated with enrollment at clinics not in Apac (adjusted OR = 5.68; 95% CI: 3.02-10.7) and with using water from public wells, boreholes or springs (AOR = 3.20; 95% CI: 1.19-8.61) and from rivers, lakes or streams (AOR = 5.20; 95% CI: 1.58-17.05). Urban residence (AOR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.13-2.60) and no formal education (AOR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.03-3.67) were also independently associated with H. pylori infection. Conclusions: The unexpected variation in the prevalence of H. pylori infection in Uganda calls for population-based studies in the region and offers an opportunity to study the transmission dynamics of H. pylori infection. The association between H. pylori infection and surface water sources for household use suggests waterborne transmission of H. pylori infection highlighting the need for concerted efforts in environmental health in communities and at the household level.					; Baingana, Rhona/MFI-9436-2025	Baingana, Rhona/0000-0002-9954-8257; Davidsson, Lena/0000-0001-9322-5513; 													1471-2458					SEP 4	2014	14								915	10.1186/1471-2458-14-915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-915								25190150					WOS:000341459100001

Currently, no basin-encompassing model to assess ground-water resources of the shallow ground-water system has been satisfactorily completed. The purpose of this study was to conceptualize and characterize the Jackson Hole hydrologic system using a procedure advocated by Kolm (1993), the ARC/INFO Geographic Information System (GIS) for data management and analysis, and MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988), a finite-difference numerical model. The study area encompassed the Jackson Hole valley from Jackson Lake south to the Grand Canyon of the Snake River, Teton County, Wyoming. Published data, collected in disparate formats and scales, were-integrated into an ARC/INFO database that included geographic, geologic and hydrologic data. Each data set was analyzed in ARC/INFO to characterize surface and subsurface conditions and the hydrologic system. A water table map was developed from well, river, natural lake, spring, vegetation and topography information. The flow system, conceptualized as three inter-connected systems, was estimated from the water table distribution, landforms, surface water features, and/or geology (depositional patterns, faulting). Conceptual models were numerically tested by interfacing the ARC/INFO database with MODFLOW. Mass balance estimates and a water table were predicted by MODFLOW for the shallow hydrologic system. The MODFLOW model was calibrated to estimates of recharge, discharge, baseflow and the water table map. A state-of-the-art database of the Jackson Hole hydrologic system was developed. The hydrologic system was characterized to the full potential of the available data. A basin-encompassing conceptual and numerical model, which simulates the hydrologic system in Jackson Hole, was satisfactorily completed. GIS technology was proven to be a viable technique for supporting the hydrologic investigation and the modeling process. Since the numerical model was not designed for ground-water management purposes, the development of a more complex, numerical model for management decisions, and additional data gathering are recommended.																			0013-7952					JUN	1996	42	2-3					119	137		10.1016/0013-7952(95)00073-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0013-7952(95)00073-9													WOS:A1996UX73000003

Despite their ecological importance, the distribution and risks of thermokarst lakes are not well understood due to complex influencing factors. In this study, we introduced a new interpretable ensemble learning method designed to improve the global and local interpretation of susceptibility assessments for thermokarst lakes. Our primary aim was to offer scientific support for precisely evaluating areas prone to thermokarst lake formation. In the thermokarst lake susceptibility assessment, we identified ten conditioning factors related to the formation and distribution of thermokarst lakes. In this highly accurate stacking model, the primary learning units were the random forest (RF), extremely randomized trees (EXTs), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and categorical boosting (CatBoost) algorithms. Meanwhile, gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs) were employed as the secondary learning unit. Based on the stacking model, we assessed thermokarst lake susceptibility and validated accuracy through six evaluation indices. We examined the interpretability of the stacking model using three interpretation methods: accumulated local effects (ALE), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). The results showed that the ensemble learning stacking model demonstrated superior performance and the highest prediction accuracy. Approximately 91.20% of the total thermokarst hazard points fell within the high and very high susceptible areas, encompassing 20.08% of the permafrost expanse in the QTP. The conclusive findings revealed that slope, elevation, the topographic wetness index (TWI), and precipitation were the primary factors influencing the assessment of thermokarst lake susceptibility. This comprehensive analysis extends to the broader impacts of thermokarst hazards, with the identified high and very high susceptibility zones affecting significant stretches of railway and highway infrastructure, substantial soil organic carbon reserves, and vast alpine grasslands. This interpretable ensemble learning model, which exhibits high accuracy, offers substantial practical significance for project route selection, construction, and operation in the QTP.

Reaching a height of 1200 m above sea level at its top (the highest point of Kola Peninsula), Khibiny is constructing the regional landscape for tens of kilometers around. Alpine character of the mountains area is unparalleled to any other territories on the Peninsula and is unique with its crags, rock bends, lofty precipices, boulders, crevices, and other landscape rock forms such as the leveling surface in the gable zone, denudation pavement, regoliths, outliers, and samples of physical weathering. In addition, there are numerous thresholds and bends filled with lakes and ponds, underground springs, crevice waterfalls, and other water sources. Such a landscape scenery makes the Khibiny mountain group a popular attraction for tourists and visitors of the region willing to get acquainted with the extraordinary local nature ranging from the taiga forests to the Arctic desert. The area also serves as a habitat for several fauna representatives, including brown bears and various Arctic birds species. The long-lasting human presence in the area manifests itself in the local toponymy of geographical names referring to the Saami language and culture. A particular interest lies in the history of the territory's colonization and development as well as in numerous artifacts related to the Soviet and Russian imperial past (i.e., US steam engine from the early 1920s). Another option for possible tourist attraction might be found in the unusual substrate of alkaline rocks having a very rare type of mineralization containing eudialyte, lorenzenite, aenigmatite, or arfvedsonite with rare phases particular for only a few places in the world, as well as in a variety of locally discovered minerals that can be observed while hiking in the area. This uniqueness and significance have come to appreciate by establishing a local geological museum serving as a geocenter and by the area itself being acknowledged as a national park. All of this foregrounds the development and formalization of off-road hiking tourist routes. This article aims to meet this need by proposing a tourist trail in the area of western Khibiny while taking the reader on an excursion around this extraordinary area.

J	Harwell, MC; Havens, KE				Harwell, MC; Havens, KE			Experimental studies on the recovery potential of submerged aquatic vegetation after flooding and desiccation in a large subtropical lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												In Lake Okeechobee (Florida), above average water depths from 1994 to early 2000 created poor light conditions on the lake bottom, leading to a widespread loss of submerged aquatic vegetation. In 2000, a controlled laboratory study quantified seedling emergence of Vallisneria americana (80 +/- 20 m(-2); mean +/- S.E.) and emergence of Chara spp. (504 +/- 21 m(-2); mean +/- S.E.) from sediments collected at a variety of sites confirming that a viable seed bank had persisted through years of poor light conditions. Considerable variance existed among the five sites from which seed banks were collected. Other species of submerged vegetation were hardly encountered. Additionally, a field transplant study using young V americana plants examined the survival potential of V americana in regions that had not supported submerged vegetation in the recent past. Although all transplants lost biomass, they produced new shoots and stolons in both sediment types. Transplants fared better in peat sediments than in the sandy sediments characteristic of areas where submerged vegetation was lost in the recent past. In summer 2001, an extensive drought exposed thousands of hectares of near-shore lake bottom, killing much of the submerged vegetation community. The potential for recovery of submerged vegetation from a desiccated and re-inundated seed/oospore bank was examined with cores taken from areas that had previously supported submerged vegetation. Extensive emergence of Chara spp., including a faster rate of emergence and a greater magnitude of emergence observed in desiccated cores (mean from three sites: 2728 m(-2); I S.E.: +/-192) relative to cores still inundated (mean from one site: 918 m(-2); I S.E.: +/-165), suggests that the drought may have led to an increased germination response for Chara. In contrast, there was little germination of vascular species except for a few seedlings of the native V americana and a few plants of Hydrilla verticillata. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Liukkonen, M; Kairesalo, T; Haworth, EY				Liukkonen, M; Kairesalo, T; Haworth, EY			Changes in the diatom community, including the appearance of Actinocyclus normanii f. subsalsa, during the biomanipulation of Lake Vesijarvi, Finland	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												After 60 years of receiving treated sewage effluent from the city of Lahti, Lake Vesijarvi had become very eutrophic. Diversion of the effluent in 1976 resulted in a slow recovery of the water quality. In 1989-93, biomanipulation removed 380 kg of coarse fish per hectare from Enonselka, the most polluted basin of the lake. Since then cyanobacterial blooms have decreased and water transparency has increased. Paleolimnological analysis of deep water sediments was used to reconstruct the changes in the diatom community, with varved sediment structure providing a year-by-year chronology. During the biomanipulation period the following diatom species increased in Enonselka: Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria crotonensis, Stephanodiscus heterostylus and Tabellaria spp. In contrast, diatom species commonly considered to be indicators of eutrophication, such as Aulacoseira islandica, Diatoma elongatum and Stephanodiscus porous, have decreased since the end of the 1980s reflecting the recovery of the Enonselka basin. The changes in the diatom plankton recorded in the less polluted basin of Laitialanselka were much less marked than those recorded from the sediments of the Enonselka basin. In 1990 a diatom species, Actinocyclus normanii f. subsalsa, appeared for the first time in Lake Vesijarvi and since then it has been one of the dominant diatoms in the plankton of the Enonselka basin. Two years later it was also present in small numbers in the plankton of Laitialanselka, the least polluted basin of the lake. The appearance of A. normanii f. subsalsa was concomitant with the dredging of the boat harbour of Lahti city in the late summer of 1990. It was therefore apparently not directly affected by biomanipulation but benefited indirectly from the collapse of cyanobacterial populations that led to improved light and nutrient availability in the water column.																			0967-0262	1469-4433				NOV	1997	32	4					353	361		10.1017/S0967026297001406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0967026297001406													WOS:000071195200004

In addition, water-level variations will directly affect the lake's migratory bird habitat and migratory bird wintering. The reconstruction of the long-term Poyang Lake water-level variation series has important mitigation and adaptation significance for ecological protection and socio-economic development in the lake area. In this study, the historical records of drought floods from three representative regional stations of Poyang Lake were collected, and an OLS-PLS model was constructed for reconstruction. In this way, the water levels from the three regional stations were reconstructed for the past 500 years. The relationship between the water levels of the three regional stations and the Poyang lake water levels was analyzed using the partial least square (PLS) method, with R-2 = 0.490 (p < 0.001). The variations in water levels from 1500 to 2000 were then reconstructed based on this model, with a low relative bias of - 0.19%. According to the results, there were nine periods of high water levels and nine periods of low water levels, among which 1604-1619 was the most obvious period of high water levels during the past 500 years and 1633-1647 was the most obvious period of low water levels. The results of the accumulated anomaly and the moving t-test revealed that a mutational point of water levels shift from high to low occurred in the year 1600. As can be seen from the results of the wavelet power spectrum, there were variations in the water levels with cycles of 2-4 years, 6-8 years, 10-12 years, 20 years, 38 years, and 128 years. The results of this study can be used for lake area ecological environment management and to mitigate the adverse effects of flood and drought disasters in the future.					; 陈, 曦/JJC-5567-2023	Chen, xi/0000-0001-8038-8364; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				AUG 30	2020	558						66	74		10.1016/j.quaint.2020.06.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.06.013													WOS:000579842700008

Due to declining inflow and irrigation exhaustion, the Amu Darya River vanishes before reaching the South Aral Sea. Therefore, groundwater (GW) has become the vital water source for the South Aral Sea surface water and the local ecosystem. To develop feasible adaptation strategies for water resource management, it is necessary to quantify the GW flux into the South Aral Sea under ongoing climate change. Based on numerical models (MODFLOW and SWAT) and with the support of observed data, remote sensing data, reanalysis data, and the output of Global Circulation Models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), the hydraulic connection between a shallow aquifer and the lake was investigated and projected for future change. The GW model was calibrated by one in-situ GW well and six Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived GW heads. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the GW flow field simulation (MODFLOW) was lower than 0.21 m from 2005 to 2016. Under three shared socioeconomic pathways (sustainable pathway, medium pathway, and fossil-fueled development), the GCMs indicate that the evapotranspiration (ET) experiences the greatest change, and will potentially rise to 602.6 mm/yr by 2100 in fossil-fueled development. While the precipitation and the runoff of the Amu Darya River will both rise slightly, and with the range of 146.4-163.3 mm/yr and 107.8-118.4 m(3)/s from 2021 to 2100 separately, and the increase is mainly during winter. With climate change signals forcing on the historical hydrometeorological data, the simulation result revealed that the GW contributes to more than 78 % of the total influx of water into the lake during 2021-2100, and the predicted GW flux into the lake will slightly rise over time. However, the ET will also increase due to rising temperatures and may gradually outpace the recharge growth. The simulation results indicate that the South Aral Sea may maintain a surface area of 4.47 x 10(3)km(2) in fossil-fueled development, which means it will continue to shrink if there is no human intervention. Therefore, a set of sustainable water resource management methods is urgently needed to preserve the ecological environment of the South Aral Sea and prevent ecological disasters.

J	Farooqui, A; Khan, S				Farooqui, Anjum; Khan, Salman			Evaluation of Temperature and Precipitation Since 4.3 ka Using Palynological Data from Kundala Lake Sediments, Kerala, India	QUATERNARY												A comprehensive database of paleo vegetation from Kundala Lake, Kerala, was used for a palynological study in a 120 cm sedimentary profile from Kundala Lake (1700 mamsl), Palni Hills, to understand the climate and vegetation equilibrium during the last four millennia. On the basis of pollen assemblage and cluster analysis, a relatively high percentage of evergreen vegetation between 4.3 and 3.4 ka (phase I) was inferred to represent the relicts of middle Holocene vegetation during a warmer climate. Subsequently, in the periods of 3.4-2.3 ka (phase II) and 2.3-0.87 ka (phase III), herbs/shrubs dominated. A relative increase in the percentage of arboreals along with herbaceous taxa was again observed from 0.87 to 0.12 ka (phase IV). Later, in phase V (from 1820 AD to present), few new plant taxa were recorded. On the basis of the 'coexistence approach', the Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) was inferred to be 22 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 22 degrees C during phases I to V, respectively. The Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP)was 2660 +/- 3700 mm from similar to 4.3 to 0.12 ka; however, it decreased to similar to 1750 mm between 3.4 and 2.3 ka. However, pollen evidence reveals short-term cooler spells during the 16/17th century AD, which is in concordance with the globally recorded cooler and arid climate that began sometime from similar to 5.0 to 4.0 ka. A thematic digital elevation map of vegetation reconstructed for the years 2005 and 2018 shows a reduction in evergreen plants and water bodies in the vicinity of Kundala Lake, which was correlated with the results of palynological studies and Indian meteorological data for the last similar to 100 years in the region.																			2571-550X					APR 1	2025	8	2							17	10.3390/quat8020017	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/quat8020017													WOS:001515626100001

Fasting in the ureotelic Lake Magadi tilapia, Alcolapia grahami, does not reduce its high metabolic demand, increasing its vulnerability to siltation events	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												Lake Magadi, Kenya, is one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth (pH similar to 10, anoxic to hyperoxic, high temperatures). Recently, increased water demand and siltation have threatened the viable hot springs near the margins of the lake where Alcolapia grahami, the only fish surviving in the lake, live. These Lake Magadi tilapia largely depend on nitrogen-rich cyanobacteria for food and are 100% ureotelic. Their exceptionally high aerobic metabolic rate, together with their emaciated appearance, suggests that they are energy-limited. Therefore, we hypothesized that during food deprivation, Magadi tilapia would economize their energy expenditure and reduce metabolic rate, aerobic performance and urea-N excretion. Surprisingly, during a 5-day fasting period, routine metabolic rates increased and swimming performance (critical swimming speed) was not affected. Urea-N excretion remained stable despite the lack of their N-rich food source. Their nitrogen use switched to endogenous sources as liver and muscle protein levels decreased after a 5-day fast, indicating proteolysis. Additionally, fish relied on carbohydrates with lowered muscle glycogen levels, but there were no signs indicating use of lipid stores. Gene expression of gill and gut urea transporters were transiently reduced as were gill rhesus glycoprotein Rhbg and Rhcg-2. The reduction in gill glutamine synthetase expression concomitant with the reduction in Rh glycoprotein gene expression indicates reduced nitrogen/ammonia metabolism, most likely decreased protein synthesis. Additionally, fish showed reduced plasma total CO2, osmolality and Na+ (but not Cl-) levels, possibly related to reduced drinking rates and metabolic acidosis. Our work shows that Lake Magadi tilapia have the capacity to survive short periods of starvation which could occur when siltation linked to flash floods covers their main food source, but their seemingly hardwired high metabolic rates would compromise long-term survival.

The internship focused on a sustainability approach, discussing recycling methods, the sustainable use of resources and the circular economy in prehistory. The UNESCO World Heritage "Prehistoric Pile Dwellings around the Alps" was used as a research area for the project. The project also aimed to make the content developed by the students available to the public as a digital media tool. The pupils brought an illustration of a prehistoric lake shore settlement to life and created an interactive image available at the website of Kuratorium Pfahlbauten. Various scenes of the illustration have been augmented with animations created by the students of HTL Spengergasse in Vienna. Students from federal secondary schools from Vienna (Stubenbastei) and Upper Austria (Traun) researched the information about the objects and wrote texts that, as a description of the animated videos, introduce the users to the prehistoric artifact and explain the recycling process behind it. The students worked independently using the scientific literature, 140-year-old inventory books and 6000-year-old objects from the collection of the Natural History Museum Vienna. The activities and the supporting program within the internship were recorded by the students in blog posts, available at the Pfahlbauten-Blog. The co-creative approach of the FFG Talent Internship made it possible to introduce a group of school students to the process of scientific work and the communication of results.

The crops grown were alfalfa (M. sativa L. ''Iroquois'')-timothy (P. pratense L. ''Climax'') mixture; summer cabbage (B. oleracea var. capitata L. ''Bergkabis''); and a red clover (T. pratense L. ''Lakeland'')-timothy mixture. These were grown in the sequence listed above. The 2nd and 3rd sequence crops were grown in pots of the treatments where 1st sequence crops were grown to deplete the soil of its Mo reserves. Liming significantly increased the yield of all crops studied with the largest increases occurring between pH 5.1 and 5.6. In the forage mixtures, percent timothy yield was much higher at soil pH 5.1 than at pH values of 5.6-6.7. Applied Mo increased cabbage yield while forage yields were generally not affected. The tissue Mo levels of 0.17 ppm in cabbage were associated with Mo deficiency. In the check (0 Mo) treatments of the 3rd sequence crops, the Mo concentrations of grass-legume mixture were as low as 0.11 ppm but there was no evidence of Mo deficiency. Soil-applied Mo resulted in tissue Mo concentration of 1.26-3.03 ppm in the mixtures. The tissue Mo concentrations of greater than 10 ppm were found in the treatments where germinating seeds were treated with a Mo preparation. Liming the soil increased the average tissue Mo concentration from 0.42 ppm at soil pH 5.1-1.84 ppm at pH 6.7 in the grass-legume mixtures.

Population and Life-History Characteristics of Two Micropterus Species in the Flint River System, Georgia	MANAGING CENTRARCHID FISHERIES IN RIVERS AND STREAMS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				87th American-Fisheries-Society Symposium on Managing Centrarchid Fisheries in Rivers and Streams / 146th AFS Annual Meeting	AUG 23-25, 2016	Kansas City, MO	SE Aquat Resources Partnership, Black Bass Comm So Div AFS, N Central Div AFS, Centrarchid Tech Comm NCD AFS, Arkansas Chapter Amer Fisheries Soc, Mississippi Interstate Cooperat Resource Agreement				Black bass Micropterus spp. are important components of river fisheries in the southeastern U.S., but little is known about their basic life history and population characteristics in these systems. Largemouth Bass M. salmoides and Shoal Bass M. cataractae were collected from three areas in the Flint River on multiple occasions from 2005 through 2013. Collections were taken from the undammed section of the Flint River above Lake Blackshear, within Lake Blackshear, and the regulated reach of river below Lake Blackshear. Shoal Bass do not occur in Lake Blackshear, so only Largemouth Bass were collected. Population and life history data such as body condition, growth, mortality, and recruitment variability were examined for these species in all three areas. Shoal Bass and Largemouth Bass appeared to have similar scopes of growth in this system, reaching similar maximum sizes. However, Largemouth Bass grew slower than Shoal Bass in both river sections. Growth of both species was slower in the upper versus lower area of the river; growth of Largemouth Bass was similar between the lower Flint River and Lake Blackshear. Female Largemouth Bass grew faster than males in both sections of the river; whereas, growth of Shoal Bass was similar between sexes. Longevity of Largemouth Bass appeared to be slightly higher than Shoal Bass, with correspondingly lower annual mortality. Age frequencies and annual mortality was similar between the sexes for both species in all areas. Recruitment of Largemouth Bass was negatively affected by high flows in the spring in the upper Flint River and Lake Blackshear; whereas, Shoal Bass recruitment in the upper Flint River was not correlated to any flow measure. The opposite pattern was found in the lower Flint River, with recruitment of Largemouth Bass unaffected by flow but Shoal Bass recruitment negatively affected by high flows. Shoal Bass exhibited numerous differences from Largemouth Bass in the Flint River, including growth, mortality, and recruitment, demonstrating the danger in applying rate function data or basic biology concepts from one species to another closely related one. Results from this study will help biologists better understand the potential and limitations of black bass fisheries in rivers, and thereby enable more effective management.

From a digital elevation model (DEM) of the 112-km(2) study area, 583 dishes (covering about 10% of the area) are identified and classified into four geometric types, ranging in size from 2,500 to 22,500 m(2), and with a maximum depth of 2 m. The collective influence of these depressions on the hydrology of the study basin is investigated with a coupled model of three-dimensional saturated and unsaturated subsurface flow and one-dimensional (along the rill or channel direction s) hill-slope and stream overland flow. Special attention is given to the handling of dishes, applying a "lake boundary-following" procedure in the topographic analysis, a level pool routing algorithm to simulate the storage and retardation effects of these reservoirs, and a higher hydraulic conductivity in the topmost 3 m of soil relative to non-dish cells in accordance with field observations. Modeling the interactions between the surface and subsurface hydrologic regimes requires careful consideration of the distinction between potential and actual atmospheric fluxes and their conversion to ponding, overland flow, and infiltration, and this coupling is described in some detail. Further consideration is given to the treatment of snow accumulation, snowmelt, and soil freezing and thawing processes, handled via linear and step function variations over the winter months in atmospheric boundary conditions and in upper soil hydraulic conductivities. A 1-year simulation of the entire watershed is used to analyze the water table response and, at the surface, the ponding heads and the infiltration/exfiltration fluxes. Saturation patterns and return flow and seepage fluxes are similar between the dishes and the main channel networks, with, as expected, preferential infiltration in the dishes.

J	Miñana-Albanell, C; Ryu, D; Pérez-Martín, MA				Minana-Albanell, Carlos; Ryu, Dongryeol; Perez-Martin, Miguel Angel			Water Temperature Model to Assess Impact of Riparian Vegetation on Jucar River and Spain	WATER												Water temperature is a critical factor for aquatic ecosystems, influencing both chemical and biological processes, such as fish growth and mortality; consequently, river and lake ecosystems are sensitive to climate change (CC). Currently proposed CC scenarios indicate that air temperature for the Mediterranean Jucar River will increase higher in summer, 4.7 degrees C (SSP5-8.5), resulting in a river water temperature increase in the hotter month; July, 2.8 degrees C (SSP5-8.5). This will have an impact on ecosystems, significantly reducing, fragmenting, or even eliminating natural cold-water species habitats, such as common trout. This study consists of developing a simulated model that relates the temperature of the river with the shadow generated by the riverside vegetation. The model input data are air temperature, solar radiation, and river depth. The model proposed only has one parameter, the shadow river percentage. The model was calibrated in a representative stretch of the Mediterranean river, obtaining a 0.93 Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) that indicates a very good model fit, a 0.90 Kling-Gupta efficiency index (KGE), and a relative bias of 0.04. The model was also validated on two other stretches of the same river. The results show that each 10% increase in the number of shadows can reduce the river water temperature by 1.2 degrees C and, in the stretch applied, increasing shadows from the current status of 62% to 76-87% can compensate for the air temperature increase by CC. Generating shaded areas in river restorations will be one of the main measures to compensate for the rise in water temperature due to climate change.

The quality and quantity of algae fundamentally influence the ecosystems of water bodies. Inland lakes are less-frequently studied despite their essential ecological role compared to ocean and sea waters. One of the reasons for this is the small-scale surface extension, which poses challenges during satellite remote sensing. In this study, we investigated the correlations between remote-sensing- (via Seninel-2 satellite) and laboratory-based results in different chlorophyll-a concentration ranges. In the case of low chlorophyll-a concentrations, the measured values were between 15 mu g L-1 and 35 mu g L-1. In the case of medium chlorophyll-a concentrations, the measured values ranged between 35 and 80 mu g L-1. During high chlorophyll-a concentrations, the results were higher than 80 mu g L-1. Finally, under extreme environmental conditions (algal bloom), the values were higher than 180 mu g L-1. We also studied the accuracy and correlation and the different algorithms applied through the Acolite (20231023.0) processing software. The chl_re_mishra algorithm of the Acolite software gave the highest correlation. The strong positive correlations prove the applicability of the Sentinel-2 images and the Acolite software in the indication of chlorophyll-a. Because of the high CDOM concentration of Lake Napl & aacute;s, the blue-green band ratio underestimated the concentration of chlorophyll-a. In summer, higher chlorophyll-a was detected in both laboratory and satellite investigations. In the case of extremely high chlorophyll-a concentrations, it is significantly underestimated by satellite remote sensing. This study proved the applicability of remote sensing to detect chlorophyll-a content but also pointed out the current limitations, thus assigning future development and research directions.

J	Barrett, H; Gregory, S; Armstrong, J				Barrett, Hannah; Gregory, Stanley; Armstrong, Jonathan			Evidence of a temperature-oxygen squeeze within floodplain thermal refuge habitats	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Vertical heterogeneity in lakes and estuaries can present cold-adapted fishes with a temperature-oxygen squeeze, such that the epilimnion is stressfully warm and the cooler hypolimnion is hypoxic, thereby restricting fishes to the metalimnion. In temperate floodplain rivers, patches of lentic habitat (e.g., alcoves) have the potential to provide thermal refuge for cold-water fishes during summer, but little is known about whether these smaller habitat features present fish with temperature-oxygen constraints. In this study, we measured temperature and oxygen profiles in six cold-water alcoves on the Willamette River floodplain (Oregon, U.S.A.) to characterise potential trade-offs in temperature and oxygen for a cold-water fish, coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii). To evaluate how fish responded to trade-offs, we used synergistic methods (needle probe thermocouple, surgically implanted iButtons, and external temperature transmitting radio tags) to monitor fish body temperatures at different temporal scales and compare them to temperature-depth profiles. The cold-water alcoves displayed a linear relationship between dissolved oxygen and temperature, where cooler temperatures came at the expense of reduced oxygen. Fish body temperatures were intermediate to temperatures recorded at the surface and bottom of the alcove. The span of depths selected by these fish represents less than 20% of the available vertical habitat in these alcoves. These results demonstrate that refuges formed by cool hyporheic upwelling can generate a temperature-oxygen squeeze where fish use only a subset of the refuge habitat feature. Oxygen constraints on thermal refuge use may be a blind spot for climate adaptation planning for cold-water fishes, because dissolved oxygen data are limited compared to water temperature data, and many cool refuges are fed by subsurface flows which are potentially hypoxic.
