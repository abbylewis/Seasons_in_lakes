Lean lake trout are found in spawning condition during spring-summer in lakes Michigan and Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Here we report the first observations of the capture of lean lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in spawning condition in lakes Michigan and Huron during April-July, which is well outside their normal fall spawning season of September-December. Examination of 5731 lake trout landed by anglers at 56 ports in 2022 and 2023 revealed nine female lake trout possessing body cavities filled with mature, loose eggs and two males in ripe condition. Six fish were hatchery-reared and five were of wild origin. Ages of these fish ranged from 6 to 19 years and, of those where strain could be determined, were members of the Seneca Lake and Lewis Lake genetic strains. Loose eggs were similar in appearance to those found in mature fish in fall on spawning grounds. Histological examination of eggs from four females confirmed all were in some stage of ovarian maturity. Two females had ovulated just prior to capture, and the remaining two ovulated much earlier than the capture date. The adaptive advantage of the alternative seasonal spawning is speculative but may include reduced competition with fall spawners, decreased predation risk for juveniles during winter, and access to greater environmental resources in the early spring and summer.																			0380-1330					AUG	2025	51	4							102583	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102583													WOS:001540922200032

However, understanding the mechanism behind seasonal fluctuations in Pb mobility in these sediments is lacking. Here, the seasonal variability of Pb concentration and isotopic ratio were investigated in the uppermost sediments of a shallow eutrophic drinking lake located in southeast China. Results reveal a sharp increase in labile Pb concentration during autumn-winter period, reaching similar to 3-fold higher levels than during the spring-summer seasons. Despite these fluctuations, there was a notable overlap in the Pb isotopic signatures within the labile fraction across four seasons, suggesting that anthropogenic sources are not responsible for the elevated labile Pb concentration in autumn-winter seasons. Instead, the abnormally elevated labile Pb concentration during autumn-winter was probably related to reduction dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides, while declined labile Pb concentration during spring-summer may be attributed to adsorption/precipitation of Fe/Mn oxides. These large seasonal changes imply the importance of considering seasonal effects when conducting sediment sampling. We further propose a solution that using Pb isotopic signatures within the labile fraction instead of the bulk sediment can better reflect the information of anthropogenic Pb sources.					wei, rongfei/M-4016-2018; 陈, 姗姗/P-1323-2015														0304-3894	1873-3336				AUG 15	2024	475								134833	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134833		JUN 2024						38880043					WOS:001259135000001

Winter conditions are rapidly changing (e.g., reduced ice cover extent and duration, altered thermal and mixing regimes) in northern lakes, making it important to fill the existing winter knowledge gap. In this study, we sampled five stations in Lake Superior across a nearshore depth gradient through the full year to assess the phenology of crustacean zooplankton communities and the effect of environmental drivers on them. Across stations, zooplankton densities were the lowest in winter (0.9 +/- 0.6 Ind. L-1) and highest in summer (14.2 +/- 15.1 Ind. L-1). Zooplankton abundances and community composition were less seasonally variable at deeper stations compared to shallower and more terrestrially affected regions. Cladocerans were the dominant taxonomic group during the summer across all stations, while cyclopoid and calanoid copepods were more important during the fall, winter, and spring. Among feeding groups, herbivores were most abundant in summer while omnivores and carnivores dominated in winter. We found that water temperature and food availability were the main drivers of total zooplankton densities through the year and during the cold seasons, but the effect of these factors varied among the main taxonomic groups. Our study demonstrates seasonal and spatial variation in crustacean zooplankton and environmental parameters, with the highest fluctuation at shallower stations. This study offers new information on seasonal crustacean zooplankton dynamics and contributes to understanding the effects of climate change on large lake ecosystems.

Winter-spring diatom production in Lake Erie is an important driver of summer hypoxia	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Re-eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie have resulted in a renewed call for remedial measures such as reductions of phosphorus loads to the lake's western basin. The action of further nutrient reductions may also reduce the intensity of seasonal central basin hypolimnetic anoxia by reducing algal biomass. However, winter-spring blooms of diatoms have not been fully recognized as a source of algal biomass that might contribute significantly to summer hypoxia. We compared spring and summer phytoplankton abundance in central and western Lake Erie based on monitoring data to show that spring phytoplankton biovolume was 1.5- to 6-fold greater than summer biovolume and that most spring biovolume was composed of filamentous diatoms, primarily Aulacoseira islandica, that is likely supported by an increasing silica load from Lake Huron. The rise of silica export was attributed to the dreissenid mussel invasion and establishment that reduced diatom abundance in Lake Huron and thereby increased silica availability in the receiving water body of Lake Erie. The relationship between phosphorus and winter-spring diatom blooms was unclear, but diatoms probably contributed the majority of the algal biomass that accumulated annually in the hypolimnion of the central basin of Lake Erie. Remedial measures aimed at reducing hypoxia must consider the winter-spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake Erie as an important and reoccurring feature of the lake that delivers a considerable quantity of algal biomass to the profundal zone of the lake.

J	Ghane, A; Boegman, L				Ghane, Alireza; Boegman, Leon			The dissolved oxygen budget of a small Canadian Shield lake during winter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Deep-water hypoxia is an environmental concern in temperate lakes. Seasonal turnover events provide a mechanism for deep-water oxygenation; however, the lake oxygen budget and mixing dynamics during turnovers are poorly understood. In the present study, the oxygen cycle in a small dimictic lake was investigated from long-term field measurements supplemented with output from a three-dimensional numerical model. Photosynthetic production and atmospheric exchange were modeled to predominate during spring and fall turnovers, respectively, contributing 92% (surprisingly) and 8% of the net dissolved oxygen (DO) input to the lake. Of the DO production, 41% occurred under-ice, with a potential to supply 17%+/- 11% of the hypolimnetic DO saturation deficit at spring turnover. The corresponding DO sinks were sediment oxygen demand (-54%), mineralization (-33%), and nitrification (-13%). The watercolumn circulation and stratification during pre-winter and spring turnover controlled the inter-annual variability in hypoxia during the following summer. Warm winters (~4 degrees C watercolumn leading to rapid summer stratification) and severely cold winters (strong winter stratification with shallow convective mixing in spring) were followed by incomplete spring turnover, whereas, following cold winters (moderate winter stratification and extended convection) turnover was complete. This underscores the connection between winter hydrodynamics and summer water quality in dimictic lakes.					; Ghane, Alireza/ADH-9568-2022	Ghane, Alireza/0000-0001-6013-5319; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2023	68	1					265	283		10.1002/lno.12265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12265		NOV 2022											WOS:000889009100001

The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity, abundance and frequency of these microorganisms in water samples from the eastern regions of the lake over four seasons. Amplicon sequencing for the 16S rRNA gene was performed to examine bacterial communities in the samples. The study revealed significant seasonal variations in water quality parameters and their influence on the microbial communities. Majority and rarity analyses showed that winter and spring had higher core abundance and higher Gini index values, indicating a greater dominance of certain genera, while autumn and summer had a more balanced distribution. Analysis of beta diversity using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index emphasized that bacterial communities diverge most strongly in summer and winter, reflecting the significant changes in the environment with the season. Overall, understanding the seasonal variation in water chemistry and bacterial communities is critical for effective ecosystem management and conservation efforts.

J	Ghane, A; Boegman, L				Ghane, Alireza; Boegman, Leon			Vertical Mixing, Light Penetration and Phosphorus Cycling Regulate Seasonal Algae Blooms in an Ice-Covered Dimictic Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Many temperate lakes accumulate sediment derived orthophosphate (PO4) in their hypolimnion during late-summer deep-water hypoxia. In dimictic lakes, fall turnover will mix the PO4 through the water column. However, the fate and transport of this primary production limiting nutrient, during winter, is unknown. Does it remain available for the spring bloom, and why does it not trigger a fall bloom in many dimictic lakes? We conducted field observations and supplemented these with three-dimensional physical biogeochemical numerical simulations to gain a deeper understanding of PO4 transport and cycling within a small dimictic lake from 2011 to 2020. Our focus was particularly on the often-ice-covered winter season. We found, the sediment derived PO4 to be only a small portion (similar to 1%) of the total PO4 load, with most of the load from mineralization (49% ice free, 29% ice covered) and tributary inflows (22%). The accumulated hypolimnetic PO4 increased the water column concentration during fall turnover, but a fall bloom was not initiated, because the associated mixing transported phytoplankton beneath the photic zone. This PO4 remained available in the water column during winter and was combined with under-ice mineralized PO4 to initiate the spring bloom, in a thin stable layer beneath the ice, as solar radiation increased seasonally during spring.

This pattern was revealed to be associated with the autumn sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies in the Barents-Laptev Seas on the interannual variability. Increased autumn SIC over the Barents-Laptev Seas tends to increase spring NDVI over the west of Lake Baikal and decrease spring NDVI in the Russian Far East. Further analyses indicated that the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies persisting from winter to spring over the Northeast Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific play an important role in such a relationship. Increased autumn SIC over the Barents-Laptev Seas is associated with a teleconnection pattern over the mid-high latitudes in the following winter, accompanied by anomalous anticyclonic circulations over the Northeast Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific. Such changes in the large-scale circulations induce downward net heat flux anomalies over the Northeast Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific, thereby contributing to the warming of SST which may persist to spring and in turn influence the atmospheric circulations. The Northeast Atlantic SST warming in spring may evoke a downstream wave train and cause positive geopotential height anomalies over the west of Lake Baikal, which increases local temperature and hence the vegetation. The Northwest Pacific SST warming in spring may lead to negative geopotential height anomalies over the Russian Far East through a meridional wave train, consequently resulting in a decrease in local temperature and hence vegetation.

Earlier winter/spring runoff and snowmelt during warmer winters lead to lower summer chlorophyll-a in north temperate lakes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Winter conditions, such as ice cover and snow accumulation, are changing rapidly at northern latitudes and can have important implications for lake processes. For example, snowmelt in the watershed-a defining feature of lake hydrology because it delivers a large portion of annual nutrient inputs-is becoming earlier. Consequently, earlier and a shorter duration of snowmelt are expected to affect annual phytoplankton biomass. To test this hypothesis, we developed an index of runoff timing based on the date when 50% of cumulative runoff between January 1 and May 31 had occurred. The runoff index was computed using stream discharge for inflows, outflows, or for flows from nearby streams for 41 lakes in Europe and North America. The runoff index was then compared with summer chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass) across 5-53 years for each lake. Earlier runoff generally corresponded to lower summer Chl-a. Furthermore, years with earlier runoff also had lower winter/spring runoff magnitude, more protracted runoff, and earlier ice-out. We examined several lake characteristics that may regulate the strength of the relationship between runoff timing and summer Chl-a concentrations; however, our tested covariates had little effect on the relationship. Date of ice-out was not clearly related to summer Chl-a concentrations. Our results indicate that ongoing changes in winter conditions may have important consequences for summer phytoplankton biomass and production.					; Laas, Alo/G-7992-2016; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020; Robertson, Dale/O-1913-2018; Nejstgaard, Jens/ABB-8903-2020; Yokota, Kiyoko/AAR-4563-2020; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022; Hejzlar, Josef/F-8526-2014; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023; Silow, Eugene/C-2958-2011	Bhattacharya, Ruchi/0000-0001-5657-9603; Grossart, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-9141-0325; Laas, Alo/0000-0002-4801-0377; Hrycik, Allison/0000-0002-0870-3398; Knoll, Lesley/0000-0003-0347-5979; Bacon, Linda/0000-0001-8744-4656; Rusak, James/0000-0002-4939-6478; Berger, Stella A./0000-0002-8835-545X; Hejzlar, Josef/0000-0002-7186-4776; Hetherington, Amy/0000-0003-3002-2924; Isles, Peter/0000-0003-4446-6788; Pilla, Rachel/0000-0001-9156-9486; Silow, Eugene/0000-0002-7039-3220; Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; Yokota, Kiyoko/0000-0002-4578-6540													1354-1013	1365-2486				OCT	2021	27	19					4615	4629		10.1111/gcb.15797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15797		JUL 2021						34241940					WOS:000674903300001

However, seasonal variations of lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) rate and solute fluxes in the coal mining subsidence were rarely reported. In this study, we conducted four seasonal samplings in a coal mining subsidence, during which samples for stable water (delta 18O) and radioactive (222Rn) isotopes were collected to quantify the seasonal dynamics of LGD rates. The LGD rates estimated from the 222Rn mass balance model were 10.2 +/- 8.7, 5.5 +/- 3.2, 11.5 +/- 7.8, and 7.8 +/- 4.5 mm d-1 in summer, autumn, winter and spring, respectively. According to the 18O mass balance model, the corresponding LGD rates were 15.1, 7.3, 15.6, and 11.3 mm d-1 in summer, autumn, winter and spring, respectively. We found a significant correlation between precipitation and LGD rates, suggesting precipitation was recognized as the main control factor for seasonal variations of LGD rates. Based on this correlation, the extrapolated LGD rates over a year ranged from 3.1 to 12.7 mm d-1 with an average of 8.8 mm d-1. Moreover, the fluxes of dissolved silicon (DSi), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) from LGD in autumn were (1.6 +/- 0.9) x 105, (1.9 +/- 1.1) x 104, and (1.1 +/- 0.6) x 104 mol a-1, respectively. Correspondingly, in winter they were (3.5 +/- 2.4) x 105, (4.1 +/- 2.8) x 103, and (2.8 +/- 1.9) x 103 mol a-1, respectively. This study demonstrated significantly seasonal variations of LGD, with precipitation being the main control factor of LGD in the coal mining subsidence lake. The fluxes of dissolved substance (DSi, Fe, Mn) from LGD need to be emphasized because they may have important impacts on the ecological stability in coal mining subsidence lakes.

Three space-time cube-based models were applied. The forest-based forecast model, with a mean of 0.14 forecast root mean square error (RMSE) and 0.39 validation RMSE, had a better performance. According to the model's results, the peripheral parts of the lake will mainly stay completely arid with a 42.5% extension in the entire period, 21.7% in spring, and a 27% reduction in winter. In the middle parts, the aridity will increase by 121% in summer, 93% in fall, and 38% in spring. Eventually, the centric areas will not be completely arid; however, the water patterns' extent will decrease by 53.46% in fall, 34.6% in spring, and 28.5% in summer. Additionally, southern, eastern, western, and northern areas will experience drier conditions, respectively. The findings can be used for water resource management and water restoration plans for the lake.

Fish were sampled and [THg] was quantified in the dorsal muscle during four seasons in this humic lake. Bioaccumulation regression slopes (mean & PLUSMN; STD, 0.039 & PLUSMN; 0.030, range 0.013-0.114) between [THg] and fish length were steepest during and after spawning and shallowest during autumn and winter for all species. Fish [THg] was significantly higher in the winter-spring than summer-autumn in all percids, however, not in cyprinids. The lowest [THg] was observed in summer and autumn, likely due to recovery from spring spawning, somatic growth and lipid accumulation. Fish [THg] was best described by multiple regression models (R2adj: 52-76%) which included total length and varying combinations of seasonally changing environmental (water temperature, total carbon, total nitrogen, and oxygen saturation) and biotic factors (gonadosomatic index, and sex) in all species. The seasonal variation in [THg] and bioaccumulation slopes across multiple species suggests a need for standardized sampling seasons in long-term monitoring to avoid any seasonality bias. From the fisheries and fish consumption perspective in seasonally icecovered lakes, monitoring of both winter-spring and summer-autumn would improve knowledge of [THg] variation in fish muscle.					; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020	Piro, Alexander/0000-0002-6190-843X; Eerola, Emmi/0000-0003-4355-0080; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337													0013-9351	1096-0953				AUG 15	2023	231		2						116187	10.1016/j.envres.2023.116187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.116187		MAY 2023						37224941					WOS:001012615000001

This study attempts to assess trends in the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB) ST magnitude during 1960-2016 from station observations at multiple depths. The Mann-Kendall, Thiel-Sen, linear regression, and probability density statistics (PDF) are used for ST trend assessment with a significance level of 95%. The ST seasonal variability shows minimum values in winter (8celcius) and maximum in the summer season (32 celcius). On an interannual scale, spring and winter seasons exhibited a significant increase in both land surface temperature (LST) (0.4celcius, 0.4celcius) and ST (0.3 & DEG;C, 0.15celcius) magnitude than summer (LST - 0.1celcius, ST 0.2celcius) and autumn seasons (LST 0.3celcius, ST 0.2celcius). The northern basin exhibited a significant increase in LST, and ST magnitude, especially during the cold seasons (spring, winter) than the warm seasons. The maximum and minimum temperature trend and their diurnal difference infer an increase in the minimum temperature, especially during the summer, autumn, and winter seasons. The PDF further inferred that extreme cold events' frequency decreased, and a significant increase in extreme warm events is obvious in the recent decade. The increasing trend in soil temperature magnitude is more in the northern basin than the high-altitude southern basin. Large-scale global warming and regional water and energy cycle changes can be the leading factors of such a warming trend.					; Ullah, Waheed/ADS-8864-2022; Zhou, Hao/C-3442-2018	Shi, Xiao/0009-0003-7184-434X; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2023	154	1-2					717	731		10.1007/s00704-023-04522-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-023-04522-0		JUN 2023											WOS:001011677400001

Various water quality determinants influence the temporal variations in DIN concentration, making the identification of key drivers essential for a deeper understanding of nutrient cycling and the formulation of targeted management strategies. However, the impact of hydrological alterations on the key drivers of DIN and its seasonal variability remains unclear. This study investigates seasonal variations in DIN in Hanfeng Lake, a subtropical urban lake located in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area, over the period from 2021 to 2023. The results indicated that DIN concentration was seasonally significantly different, showing higher values in winter and spring than that in summer and autumn. Random Forest modelling indicated that the temporal variations in DIN concentration were closely related to the notable seasonal fluctuations in key water quality indicators such as the temperature (T), Secchi depth (SD), and concentrations of dissolved phosphorus (DP), dissolved silica (DSi), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), which were predominantly attributable to hydrological alterations associated with reservoir management and external pollutant inputs from agricultural fertilization. Partial Least Squares Path Modeling confirmed that physical indicators, like T and SD, were the primary drivers of variations in DIN concentration, while DP, DSi, and Chl-a also had significant effects. Based on these insights, the study recommends to minimize the agricultural fertilizer application in spring and summer for decreasing external inputs, and optimize reservoir operation strategies in autumn and winter for controlling hydrological alterations.

However, climate model simulations predict that rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet caused mean annual warming during this epoch. This contrast could reflect a seasonal bias in temperature proxies, and particularly a lack of proxies that record cold (late fall-early spring) season temperatures, or inaccuracies in climate model predictions of NH temperature. We reconstructed winter-spring temperatures during the Common Era (i.e., the last 2000 years) using alkenones, lipids produced by Isochrysidales haptophyte algae that bloom during spring ice-out, preserved in sediments from Vestra Gislholtsvatn (VGHV), southwest Iceland. Our record indicates that winter-spring temperatures warmed during the last 2000 years, in contrast to most NH averages. Sensitivity tests with a lake energy balance model suggest that warmer winter and spring air temperatures result in earlier ice-out dates and warmer spring lake water temperatures and therefore warming in our proxy record. Regional air temperatures are strongly influenced by sea surface temperatures during the winter and spring season. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) respond to both changes in ocean circulation and gradual changes in insolation. We also found distinct seasonal differences in centennial-scale, cold-season temperature variations in VGHV compared to existing records of summer and annual temperatures from Iceland. Multi-decadal to centennial-scale changes in winter- spring temperatures were strongly modulated by internal climate variability and changes in regional ocean circulation, which can result in winter and spring warming in Iceland even after a major negative radiative perturbation.

J	Shchapov, K; Ozersky, T				Shchapov, Kirill; Ozersky, Ted			Full year seasonality of benthos in the nearshore of Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Relatively little is known about the full-year dynamics of benthic invertebrates in seasonally-freezing lakes. In this study, we describe the seasonal variability in benthic invertebrate abundance and coarse-level taxonomic composition across five nearshore locations in Lake Superior, with a focus on the winter period. We found that benthos abundances were relatively stable across the year, with similar winter (2294 f 987 SD ind. m-2) and summer densities (2710 f 1445 SD ind. m-2) across all stations. Community composition was also relatively stable across the year at our study stations, with Hexagenia sp., chironomids, and oligochaetes dominating our shallowest station (Duluth Harbor) and oligochaetes, Diporeia sp., and clams (Sphaeriidae) dominating deeper locations. Across all stations, diversity was similar across seasons, with the highest number of taxa observed in the fall (5.4 f 1.8) and lowest number in the summer (4.5 f 1.4). We found that the winter-spring period was an important time for the reproduction of the Lake Superior keystone amphipod Diporeia sp. Finally, we show that community structure was more variable across sites than across seasons. This is one of very few studies of winter benthos in the Great Lakes and suggests that benthic invertebrate communities show muted seasonal variability compared to planktonic organisms.

The model well reproduces the seasonal lake thermodynamics, highlighting the phases of summer-autumn warm thermal stratification, late-autumn overturning, winter-spring inverse thermal stratification, and late-spring overturning. Heat budget analysis underscores the importance of lateral heat transport and ice freeze-thaw processes in shaping the horizontal thermal variability. During 2007-2017, lake surface temperature, as well as the duration, onset and end of warm thermal stratification, show significant interannual variations related to the surface air temperature and ice conditions. During winter-spring, the lake water flow speed shows strong interannual variability related to wind speed and ice conditions. Nevertheless, a consistent circulation pattern is found, featuring a dominant mid-lake cyclonic gyre, upwelling along the western coast, and strong coastal currents driven by the prevailing southwesterly winds during December-January, followed by weakened lake water motions during February-April when the packed ice inhibits the wind stress input. In contrast, the summer-autumn lake circulation is weaker but more variable, with the mid-lake circulation shifting between being cyclonic (caused by the combined effects of southwesterly winds, positive wind stress curl and density effects) and occasionally anti-cyclonic (due to the presence of negative wind stress curl).					; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021	Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 28	2025	130	12							e2025JD043846	10.1029/2025JD043846	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025JD043846													WOS:001511069100001

However, changes in phytoplankton community structure caused by phytoplankton's preference for N utilization under the increasing N input remain poorly understood. This study used nitrate isotopes (delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-) to investigate seasonal differences in N cycling as well as associated response of phytoplankton biomass and community composition. Results Results showed that the average delta N-15-NO3- values in spring, summer, autumn, and winter were 7.6 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand, 6.1 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand, 5.5 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand, and 7.4 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand, respectively. Accordingly, the average delta O-18-NO3- values showed the following order: winter (12.8 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand) > summer (11.5 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand) > spring (10.3 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand) > autumn (7.9 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand). The main nitrate sources in Lake Poyang were soil N, N fertilizer, and the manure and sewage in all seasons, contributing 93.8%, 3.3%, and 2.8%, respectively. Nitrification and algal-derived nitrate (NO3--N) assimilation were the main biochemical processes affecting N. In spring, the signal of nitrification was stronger, while in autumn, the signals of N assimilation by algae were more pronounced. The phytoplankton community composition varied with the seasonal changes of N concentrations and forms. The total biomass of phytoplankton in winter was the lowest of all four seasons and it was negatively correlated with NO3--N concentration (P < 0.05). Conclusions The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the role of available forms of N in floodplain lake and provide essential support for prediction of phytoplankton growth and functions. Our work deciphers the role of phytoplankton in the lake N cycle, providing theoretical support to management of phytoplankton community to future environmental changes.

Atotal of 194 fish, distributed in the four species, were examined for C. corderoi in the digestive tract at the end of September (spring) of 2006 and at the end of January (summer), March (autumn) and June (winter) of 2007. Nematodes were identified after fixation in formalinsaline and diaphanization in lactophenol. Immature females and third and fourth instar larvae of C. corderoi are described for the first time in fish. Prevalence and mean intensity were higher (p<0.05) in P. trucha. Prevalence in B. australis was higher (p<0.05) and mean intensity was similar with O. mauleanum and O. mykiss. Larval stages were present in P. trucha, B. australis and O. mykiss in spring and in autumn in B. australis. Only the native fish that had a higher percentage and average of pregnant females was in P. trucha. Pregnant females were identified in spring, summer and winter in P. trucha, in summer and autumn in B. australis and in spring in O. mauleanum. Prevalence was similar between sampling periods and sex in the four hosts, as well as the mean intensity in P. trucha and B. australis (p>0.05). The number of parasites and size of P. trucha, B. australis and O. mykiss did not show significant correlation. The higher prevalence and mean intensity and higher percentage of gravid females in P. trucha suggest it as the main disseminator of C. corderoi in Lake Panguipulli.																			1682-3419	1609-9117				MAR-APR	2025	36	2							e30629	10.15381/rivep.v36i2.30629	http://dx.doi.org/10.15381/rivep.v36i2.30629													WOS:001553766700017

The results showed that a total of 168 species of phytoplankton were identified in nine phyla, and there were significant spatial and temporal differences in the abundance of phytoplankton at the three waterworks intakes, with a spatial trend of annual mean values of Duchang > Xingzi > Hukou and a seasonal trend of summer and autumn > spring and winter. The dominant species of phytoplankton in the waterworks intakes of the three waterworks also showed obvious spatial and temporal differences. Cyanobacteria (particularly Pseudanabaena sp. and Microcystis sp.) dominated the phytoplankton communities during summer and autumn, demonstrating significant water degradation potential. In contrast, Cyclotella sp. prevailed in winter and spring assemblages. Based on water quality assessments at the three intake sites, the Duchang County intake exhibited year-round mild eutrophication with persistent mild cyanobacterial blooms (June-October), while the other two sites maintained no obvious bloom conditions. Further analyzing the toxic/odor-producing algal strains, the numbers of dominant species of Pseudanabaena sp. and Microcystis sp. in June-October in Duchang County both exceeded 1.0 x 10(7) cells<middle dot>L-1. It is necessary to focus on their release of ATX-a (ichthyotoxin-a), 2MIB (2-Methylisoborneol), MCs (microcystins), etc., to ensure the safety of the water supply at the intake. Building upon these findings, we propose a generalized algal monitoring framework, encompassing three operational pillars: (1) key monitoring area identification, (2) high-risk period determination, and (3) harmful algal warnings. Each of these is substantiated by our empirical observations in Poyang Lake.																				2073-4441				JUL 7	2025	17	13							2034	10.3390/w17132034	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17132034													WOS:001527088200001

During winter, plankton rely on updrafts caused by convection to remain in the photic zone and perform primary production. Thus, there is a crucial link in winter between under-ice light levels, circulation, and dissolved oxygen (DO) production. Detailed observations of temperature, oxygen, and incoming solar radiation over three winters between 2015 and 2017 suggested that plankton abundance and DO concentrations were maximal near the end of the winter before the ice melted when there was increased under-ice light and convection. DO was supersaturated by the end of the severe winter of 2015 when the ice cover duration was the longest. In comparison, DO increased but was not saturated in the warmer winters of 2016 and 2017. The spring overturn started when the water column became isothermal and continued until when the mean water column temperature first exceeded 4 degrees C, at which time, hypolimnetic DO depletion started and continued until the fall overturn. The concentration of DO when the water column becomes stratified in spring, along with the timing of the end of spring overturn, are both important initial conditions for summer DO concentrations.						wells, mathew/0000-0003-3838-9202; Yang, Bernard/0000-0003-3646-0634; Young, Joelle/0000-0002-9833-9437													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2020	65	11					2713	2729		10.1002/lno.11543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11543		JUL 2020											WOS:000552872700001

Preparing for the future offspring: European perch (Perca fluviatilis) biosynthesis of physiologically required fatty acids for the gonads happens already in the autumn	OECOLOGIA												Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are critical for reproduction and thermal adaptation. Year-round variability in the expression of fads2 (fatty acid desaturase 2) in the liver of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) in a boreal lake was tested in relation to individual variation in size, sex, and maturity, together with stable isotopes values as well as fatty acids (FA) content in different tissues and prey items. ARA and DHA primary production was restricted to the summer months, however, perch required larger amounts of these PUFA during winter, as their ARA and DHA muscle content was higher compared to summer. The expression of fads2 in perch liver increased during winter and was higher in mature females. Mature females stored DHA in their gonads already in late summer and autumn, long before the upcoming spring spawning period in May. Lower delta C-13(DHA) values in the gonads in September suggest that these females actively synthesized DHA as part of this reproductive investment. Lower delta C-13(ARA) values in the liver of all individuals during winter suggest that perch were synthesizing essential FA to help cope with over-wintering conditions. Perch seem able to modulate its biosynthesis of physiologically required PUFA in situations of stress (fasting or cold temperatures) or in situations of high energetic demand (gonadal development). Biosynthesis of physiologically required PUFA may be an important part of survival and reproduction in aquatic food webs with long cold periods.					; Pilecky, Matthias/HJO-8823-2023; Kainz, Martin/AAG-6268-2021; Taipale, Sami/HKE-2611-2023	Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337; Kainz, Martin/0000-0002-2388-1504; Tiirola, Marja/0000-0001-5589-3748; Rigaud, Cyril/0000-0002-2652-6313													0029-8549	1432-1939				DEC	2023	203	3-4					477	489		10.1007/s00442-023-05480-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-023-05480-0		NOV 2023						37975885					WOS:001105861300001

Winter/Spring Runoff Is Earlier, More Protracted, and Increasing in Volume in the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Winter/spring runoff has changed in streams worldwide due to climate change, particularly in temperate areas where winter/spring streamflow depends on snowmelt. Such changes potentially affect receiving waters through altered nutrient loading and mixing patterns. The Laurentian Great Lakes are an important freshwater resource and have experienced a myriad of impacts due to climate change. We analyzed 70 years of stream gauge data in the Great Lakes Basin to test for changes in timing, duration, and amount of winter/spring runoff during the period 1950-2019. We found strong evidence for earlier runoff in each of the Great Lakes except Lake Erie, protracted winter/spring runoff throughout the Great Lakes Basin, and a higher runoff depth during the winter-spring period over time for all watersheds except Lake Superior. Lake Ontario had the greatest change in the date by which 50% of the Jan-May runoff had been discharged (6 days earlier from 1950 to 2019). For winter/spring runoff duration, the most extreme change was observed in Lake Erie (increase of 19 days), and for runoff depth, the greatest change was in the Lake Huron Basin (increase of 3.3 cm). Results were similar for natural and impacted streams. Our results demonstrate dramatic changes in runoff patterns over the last seven decades in the Great Lakes Basin concomitant with previously published changes in precipitation and snowpack. Shifts toward earlier, more protracted, and more voluminous runoff likely change nutrient loading and mixing patterns that influence primary producers, particularly in the nearshore areas of the Great Lakes. Climate change has altered the timing of when snowmelt happens in the spring and how long it takes for the snowpack to melt. Such changes in snowmelt are caused by warming temperatures, and potentially, changes in winter and spring precipitation to include a greater proportion of rain. One way to measure the effects of melting and precipitation is to examine the amount and timing of stream flow, which includes water from snowmelt and precipitation. We examined stream flow data from the Great Lakes Basin since 1950 and found that the timing of streamflow in the winter and spring has become earlier and is stretched out over a longer period of time. This means that we are shifting away from "spring floods" toward smaller, more spread out melting events that now begin earlier during the winter. The amount of stream flow during the winter and spring has also increased over time. Because stream flow can transport particulate and dissolved nutrients, shallower areas of the Great Lakes may be affected by changes in the seasonality of nutrient inputs. The timing and amount of runoff entering the Great Lakes through tributaries has changed drastically since 1950 Winter/spring runoff is becoming earlier in the watersheds surrounding all of the Great Lakes except Lake Erie Runoff is occurring at a higher volume and over a more drawn-out time period as a consequence of climate change					; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023	Hrycik, Allison/0000-0002-0870-3398; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				MAR	2024	60	3							e2023WR035773	10.1029/2023WR035773	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR035773													WOS:001186309600001
J	Haberman, J; Haldna, M				Haberman, Juta; Haldna, Marina			How are spring zooplankton and autumn zooplankton influenced by water temperature in a polymictic lake?	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ESTONIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES												We singled out spring (season with a water temperature of 4-15 degrees C) and autumn (15-4 degrees C), i.e. the seasons with the most variable meteorological conditions, in order to study the development of zooplankton as well as concurrent meteorological conditions (air and water temperature, ice conditions) and their relationships in these seasons. The aims of this study were (1) to review the spring zooplankton versus autumn zooplankton of a shallow polymictic lake; (2) to assess how much the zooplankton of the transition seasons, i.e. spring and autumn, is influenced by water temperature; (3) to clarify what factors are the main drivers of water temperature in such type of lakes. Proceeding from these aims, a long-term (1965-2014) study was conducted in the shallow (mean depth 2.8 m) polymictic Lake Vortsjarv (Estonia). The main drivers of water temperature were air temperature and ice conditions. The water of the lake warmed up from 4 degrees C to 15 degrees C within 48 +/- 2 days in spring and it cooled down from 15 degrees C to 4 degrees C during 57 +/- 1.5 days in autumn. Both the air temperature in the territory of the studied lake and the water temperature in the lake increased while the duration of an ice cover on the lake decreased during the study period. The abundance of zooplankton in the seasons with the highly variable water temperature was also variable and largely dependent on the water temperature. In spring the effect of water temperature was greater than in autumn. Statistical analysis showed that when water temperature rose one degree in spring, the abundance of zooplankton increased by 27%, and when water temperature fell one degree in autumn, zooplankton abundance decreased by 9%. Zooplankton abundance was almost three times as high in spring (922 ind L-1) as in autumn (325 ind L-1) and was dominated by rotifers, small-bodied cladocerans, and juveniles of cyclopoid copepods. The domination of rotifers was more pronounced in spring (92%) than in autumn (70%). The share of cladocerans was negligible in the spring zooplankton (2%) but appreciable (24%) in the autumn zooplankton. The share of copepods in the total zooplankton abundance (6%) was modest and similar in both seasons. A shift (i.e. a marked increase in zooplankton abundance, switch from cold-water to warm-water species) in the abundance of spring zooplankton occurred in spring at a water temperature of about 10 degrees C (critical time window). A comparable but less conspicuous change (decrease in abundance, switch from warmwater species to cold-water species) was found at the same water temperature in autumn. During the 50 study years, the period with a mean water temperature of 10 degrees C shifted by 7 days to an earlier date in spring and by 6 days to a later date in autumn.																			1736-6046	1736-7530					2017	66	3					264	278		10.3176/proc.2017.3.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.3176/proc.2017.3.03													WOS:000408394600003
J	Yang, Y; Stenger-Kovács, C; Padisák, J; Pettersson, K				Yang, Yang; Stenger-Kovacs, Csilla; Padisak, Judit; Pettersson, Kurt			Effects of winter severity on spring phytoplankton development in a temperate lake (Lake Erken, Sweden)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th European Large Lakes Symposium (ELLS)	AUG 24-28, 2015	Univ Eastern Finland, Joensuu, FINLAND		Univ Eastern Finland			Phytoplankton seasonal succession has been linked to a variety of serial environmental changes, especially weather- and climate-induced physical forcing. This study compared spring phytoplankton dynamics after winters of different severity (cold, normal, and warm) in Lake Erken, Sweden. The spring diatom bloom was dominated by different functional groups: group A (centric diatoms 5-10 mu m) after cold winters, B (centric diatoms > 15 mu m) after normal winters, and P (Aulacoseira granulata, Fragilaria crotonensis) after warm winters. Our results suggest that weather-related processes were the primary external drivers accounting for differences in spring phytoplankton dynamics in Lake Erken. Spring phytoplankton are influenced by overwintering species from the last autumn that can initiate the following spring bloom. Average taxonomic distinctness of the spring community was assessed using a new biodiversity measurement that incorporates taxonomic relatedness information. This value was lower than expected after warm and cold winters, which had winter air temperature 1A degrees C deviation from an average value calculated over 21 years. Such winters increased the level of disturbance or stress to the lake, resulting in a spring with less diverse phytoplankton by narrowing the niche for species with various ecological requirements.

Shahu Lake, a smaller body of water connected to Poyang Lake during the wet season, is separated in the dry season. Due to a special fishing method termed 'lake enclosed in autumn, the water level is lowered and reaches its lowest point in January, which is <0.5 m deep in the middle of the lake. Our research investigated the effect of water level changes on the zooplankton community composition in Shahu Lake. Methods: We used both DNA metabarcoding method (MBC) (18S rRNA gene V4 region) and morphological method (MOI) to track the zooplankton community structure over four seasons in Shahu Lake (China). Results: Totals of 90 and 98 species of zooplankton were detected by MOI and MBC, respectively, with rotifers being the main zooplankton component. The alpha-diversity index of both methods increased from spring to summer and decreased from summer to autumn, reaching the lowest value in winter. NMDS and a cluster analysis showed that all zooplankton communities detected by MOI and MBC were significantly separated by season. The zooplankton community in winter was separated from that of the other three seasons, but the summer and autumn communities were more similar. Conclusions: Changes in the water level had significant effects on the zooplankton community composition. We found that MBC was more able to detect the differences in the zooplankton composition than MOI. MBC also had more advantages in copepod recognition. In our study, 37 species of copepods were detected by MBC, but only 11 species were detected by MOI. We concluded that MBC should be used to research the seasonal variations of zooplankton.

To achieve this, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm was used to select the top 10 general circulation models (GCMs) among 23 CMIP5 GCMs in the baseline period (1951-2005). Based on the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) method, 10 GCMs were combined and their uncertainties were quantified. Also, the future period (2028-2079) data were generated by using the LARS-WG model. According to the results, the temperature increased in all seasons of the future period. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, the precipitation decreases by 10.4 and 27.8% in spring and autumn, respectively, while it increases by 18.2 and 3.4% in summer and winter, respectively. Moreover, the RCP8.5 scenario lowers the precipitation by 11.4, 22.7, and 4.8% in spring, autumn, and winter, respectively, while it rises by 26.5% in summer. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were used to calculate the short-, medium- and long-term meteorological droughts of the baseline and future periods. The occurrence number and peaks of droughts increase, while their durations decrease, in the future period. In general, the SPEI has a robust relationship than the SPI with changes in the water level of Lake Urmia.					; Lotfirad, Morteza/GOE-5727-2022	Lotfirad, Morteza/0000-0002-4425-8172; Esmaeili-Gisavandavi, Hassan/0000-0001-5027-2360; 													2040-2244	2408-9354				JUN	2022	13	6					2255	2277		10.2166/wcc.2022.300	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2022.300		MAY 2022											WOS:000796026900001

The relationship between the spatiotemporal variation in PPeu and environmental factors was also analyzed. Our findings indicated that the temporal heterogeneity of PPeu was strong, and the average annual PPeu of the four seasons was significantly different (P < 0.05, F = 54.74), exhibiting the following descending order: summer (1279.89 +/- 111.04 mg Cem-2ed-1) > spring (782.42 +/- 59.34 mg Cem-2ed-1) > autumn (465.03 +/- 49.30 mg Cem-2ed-1) > winter (96.34 +/- 10.36 mg Cem-2ed-1). Even in winter with harsh environmental conditions, PPeu under the ice sheet can reach 8 % of that in summer. The spatial heterogeneity was weak, and only the average annual PPeu in spring exhibited a significant spatial difference (P < 0.05, F = 5.18): north > central > south. However, there were no significant differences in other seasons. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) results showed that in addition to directly participating in the calculation of the environmental factors of PPeu, PPeu in spring was mainly affected by total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved oxygen (DO). PPeu in summer was mainly affected by dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), dissolved oxygen (DO), salinity (S), electrical conductivity (EC), and water temperature (WT). PPeu in autumn was mainly affected by pH, electrical conductivity (EC), suspended solids (SS), and water temperature (WT). PPeu in winter was mainly affected by water temperature (WT) and ice thickness (IT). The mechanisms through which environmental factors affect primary productivity are complex and dynamic. Therefore, long-term monitoring and research of PPeu in Wuliangsuhai Lake are necessary to explore the adaptation strategies of phytoplankton in ice and ice-free periods and understand the operation of natural life support systems under the alternation of ice generation and extinction. In turn, this would facilitate the development of strategies to maintain phytoplankton biodiversity and prevent algal blooms.					guohua, li/ABD-4825-2020; Liu, Yu/HNQ-3822-2023; shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024	Yu, Haifeng/0000-0002-4406-3658; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2022	144								109545	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109545		OCT 2022											WOS:000874543400004

The relationship between the seasonal variation of WT stratification and the spatial and temporal distribution of EC, pH, DO and Chl-a was explored. The relationship between EC and WT was found for the epilimnion, thermocline and hypolimnion. The results of the study showed that: (1) The Lake Lugu water body shows obvious thermal stratification in spring, summer and autumn. In winter, the WT is close to isothermal condition in the vertical direction; in summer, the thermocline is located at 10-25 m water depth; while in autumn, the thermocline moves down to 20-30 m. (2) The Hypolimnion WT was maintained at 9.5 degrees C similar to 10 degrees C, which is consistent with the annual mean temperature of Lake Lugu, indicating that the hypolimnion water column is stable and relatively constant, and reflects the annual mean temperature of the lake. The thermally stratified structure has some influence on the changes of EC, DO, pH and Chl-a, resulting in the obvious stratification of EC, DO and pH in the water body. (3) Especially in summer, when the temperature increased, the thermal stratification phenomenon was significant, and DO and pH peaked in thermocline, with a decreasing trend from the peak upward and downward, and the hypolimnion was in an anoxic state and the pH value was small. Although chlorophyll a remained low below thermocline and was not high overall, there was a sudden increase in the surface layer, which should be highly warned to prevent a large algal bloom or even a localized outbreak in Lake Lugu. (4) There is a simple linear function between EC and WT in both vertical section and Epilimnion, thermocline and hypolimnion, which proves that Lake Lugu is still influenced by natural climate and maintains natural water state, and is a typical warm single mixed type of lake. (5) It is suggested to strengthen water quality monitoring, grasp its change pattern and influence factors, and take scientific measures to prevent huge pressure on the closed ecological environment of Lake Lugu, and provide scientific basis for the protection of high-quality freshwater lakes in the plateau.					; Hou, PengFei/C-4123-2018	Zhang, Yang/0000-0002-1082-6661; 														2073-4441				AUG	2022	14	16							2554	10.3390/w14162554	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14162554													WOS:000845211500001

Winter Precipitation and Summer Temperature Predict Lake water Quality at Macroscales	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Climate change can have strong effects on aquatic ecosystems, including disrupting nutrient cycling and mediating processes that affect primary production. Past studies have been conducted mostly on individual or small groups of ecosystems, making it challenging to predict how future climate change will affect water quality at broad scales. We used a subcontinental-scale database to address three objectives: (1) identify which climate metrics best predict lake water quality, (2) examine whether climate influences different nutrient and productivity measures similarly, and (3) quantify the potential effects of a changing climate on lakes. We used climate data to predict lake water quality in similar to 11,000 north temperate lakes across 17 U.S. states. We developed a novel machine learning method that jointly models different measures of water quality using 48 climate metrics and accounts for properties inherent in macroscale data (e.g., spatial autocorrelation). Our results suggest that climate metrics related to winter precipitation and summer temperature were strong predictors of lake nutrients and productivity. However, we found variation in the magnitude and direction of the relationship between climate and water quality. We predict that a likely future climate change scenario of warmer summer temperatures will lead to increased nutrient concentrations and algal biomass across lakes (median similar to 3%-9% increase), whereas increased winter precipitation will have highly variable effects. Our results emphasize the importance of heterogeneity in the response of individual ecosystems to climate and are a caution to extrapolating relationships across space.					; Stachelek, Jemma/GWC-1230-2022; Tan, Pang-Ning/L-3839-2019; Wagner, Tyler/MIU-0726-2025; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/F-1838-2010	Stachelek, Jemma/0000-0002-5924-2464; Tan, Pang-Ning/0000-0003-3205-0339; Oliver, Samantha/0000-0001-5668-1165; Spence Cheruvelil, Kendra/0000-0003-1880-2880; Collins, Sarah/0000-0001-5503-7386; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-5862-7955													0043-1397	1944-7973				APR	2019	55	4					2708	2721		10.1029/2018WR023088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023088													WOS:000468597900009

Impacts of extreme 2013-2014 winter conditions on Lake Michigan's fall heat content, surface temperature, and evaporation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Since the late 1990s, the Laurentian Great Lakes have experienced persistent low water levels and above average over-lake evaporation rates. During the winter of 2013-2014, the lakes endured the most persistent, lowest temperatures and highest ice cover in recent history, fostering speculation that over-lake evaporation rates might decrease and that water levels might rise. To address this speculation, we examined interseasonal relationships in Lake Michigan's thermal regime. We find pronounced relationships between winter conditions and subsequent fall heat content, modest relationships with fall surface temperature, but essentially no correlation with fall evaporation rates. Our findings suggest that the extreme winter conditions of 2013-2014 may have induced a shift in Lake Michigan's thermal regime and that this shift coincides with a recent (and ongoing) rise in Great Lakes water levels. If the shift persists, it could (assuming precipitation rates remain relatively constant) represent a return to thermal and hydrologic conditions not observed on Lake Michigan in over 15years.					; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020	Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721; Smith, Joeseph/0000-0002-1896-1390; Lofgren, Brent/0000-0003-2189-0914; Beletsky, Dmitry/0000-0003-4532-0588; Gronewold, Andrew/0000-0002-3576-2529													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 16	2015	42	9					3364	3370		10.1002/2015GL063799	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL063799													WOS:000355878300038

Changes in the Frequency of Cool Season Lake Effects within the North American Great Lakes Region	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS												The North American Great Lakes influence surface weather downwind, distinctly in winter when southward migrating cold air passes over relatively warm lakes. Study of the synoptic atmospheric patterns favorable for lake effects has focused on lake-effect snowfall, the most impactful effect of the lakes. Although the patterns are conducive to lake effects, they might not actually yield discernible modification of downwind surface weather. This study uses historical daily data (1964-1965 through 2017-2018) of weather types to detect cool season (November-April) modification of cold, dry air upwind of the Great Lakes to cool, moist air downwind of the eastern (Erie, Ontario) and western (Michigan, Superior) lakes. A spatial arrangement of weather types across the region is shown to identify individual days characterized by a lake effect. The frequency of lake effects increased through the first one third of the record, but it has since decreased, most profoundly since a change point in the late 1990s and more prominently for the eastern lakes. At stations immediately downwind of the lakes, the result is a changed cool season hydroclimate, with fifty-four-year declines in lake-effect precipitation amount and frequency and in the percentages of seasonal precipitation amount and frequency attributed to lake effects.																			2469-4452	2469-4460				JUL 27	2020	111	2					385	401		10.1080/24694452.2020.1785270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2020.1785270		JUL 2020											WOS:000555219200001

Lake Horowhenua is currently hypertrophic but flips between a winter clear-water, macrophyte dominated phase (Potamogeton crispus), and a turbid phytoplankton dominated phase with substantial cyanobacterial (Microcystis sp.) blooms from mid-summer to autumn. Nitrogen for growth comes from agriculture and horticulture via groundwater and spring-fed streams. Phosphorus is released from the sediment when the weed beds die back. These nutrients stimulate the growth of Microcystis sp., until the water temperature falls below 15 degrees C. Microcystis sp can raise the pH to over 10, which releases P from the sediment, sustaining its growth. High pH transforms non-toxic ammonium-N released from the sediment to toxic unionised NH3, which may contribute to fish kills in summer/autumn. Management strategies cannot use P-inactivation agents for cultural reasons and eradicating the macrophyte beds by spraying would cause the lake to permanently flip to a turbid state. Management of the macrophyte beds with a weed harvester is being trialled to allow a gradual replacement of P. crispus with indigenous species from the seed bank in the sediment.

The morphological functional traits of cyanobacteria play important roles in maintaining their competitive advantages. To explore the regulatory mechanisms of the morphological functional traits of different bloom-forming cyanobacteria, we performed a one-year-long phytoplankton survey from November 2016 to October 2017 in Lake Chaohu, China. The colony size and cell diameter of the dominant cyanobacteria were measured, and their relationships were analyzed. The results showed that Dolichospermum flos-aquae and Microcystis aeruginosa were the dominant cyanobacteria in the lake. Microcystis was the dominant species during the summer; the growth of Dolichospermum growth surpassed that of Microcystis, and Dolichospermum became the dominant species in the late autumn, winter and spring. From winter to spring, the colony size of Dolichospermum decreased from 222.25 mu m to 10.51 mu m, and the individual cell diameter increased from 6.5 mu m to 7.4 mu m. From summer to autumn, Dolichospermum showed enlarged colony sizes and reduced cell diameters. The Microcystis colony size increased from 83.71 mu m in the spring to 196.71 mu m in the summer and autumn, while cells diameter remained essentially at 3-4 mu m from March to October in Lake Chaohu. The relationship between colony size and cell diameter in Dolichospermum was significantly positive, while that of Microcystis was not significant. These results suggest that Dolichospermum may maintain biomass through a trade-off between cell diameter and colony size, and that a flexible morphological regulatory mechanism exists. This study seeks to improve our understanding of how bloom-forming cyanobacteria maintain their dominance by regulating their morphological traits.					yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022	yangyang, meng/0000-0002-4820-5182; , Min/0000-0002-8130-5214														1424-2818				JUN	2022	14	6							435	10.3390/d14060435	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14060435													WOS:000819048300001

The membership functions were established via the Nor-Half Sinusoidal Distribution Method, and the weight was calculated via the Exceeding Standard Multiple Method. To enhance the efficiency of extracting principal pollutant, the eigenequation was solved through the Jacobi Method, and the principal components were extracted based on eigenvalue, contribution ratio, accumulating contribution ratio, principal component loading and score. Water quality classification based on "National Surface Water Environmental Quality Standards of China (GB3838-2002) was used to assess the water quality. Considering the difference of the temporal and spatial distribution in average, water quality of Level I was 28.9%, 28.1%, 25.1%, 25.6%, respectively in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, which suggested that water quality in spring and summer was better than in autumn and winter. The order of water quality was Zhaoyang Lake (Level I) > Nanyang Lake (Level I) > Dushan Lake (Level III) > Weishan Lake (Level III and IV). There were four extracted principal components that can replace the fourteen pollutant indexes for assessing water quality. According to the annual mean data of the 1st principal components, the most important pollutions were heavy metals, including As (0.933), Hg (0.931), Cd (0.929), Cr(VI) (0.926), Pb (0.925), and Cu (0.534). It is proved that the combined FCE-PCA model could provide valuable information in the water quality assessment for the Nansi Lake Basin.

The DOC concentration ranged from 1.92 to 5.60 mg??L-1, and the average DOC concentration was 3.30??0.78 mg??L-1. The DOC concentration was highest in winter, followed by spring, summer and autumn; it was significantly higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. The DOC concentration was lower in the northern area and higher in coastal areas.

Climate Change Impacts on Surface Heat Fluxes in a Deep Monomictic Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Turbulent and radiative energy exchanges between lakes and the atmosphere play an important role in determining the process of lake-mixing and stratification, including how lakes respond to climate and to climate change. Here we used a one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake model to assess seasonal impacts of climate change on individual surface heat flux components in Lough Feeagh, Ireland, a deep, monomictic lake. We drove the lake model with an ensemble of outputs from four climate models under three future greenhouse gas scenarios from 1976 to 2099. In these experiments, the results showed significant increases in the radiative budget that were largely counteracted by significant increases in the turbulent fluxes. The combined change in the individual surface heat fluxes led to a change in the total surface heat flux that was small, but sufficient to lead to significant changes in the volume-weighted average lake temperature. The largest projected changes in total surface heat fluxes were in spring and autumn. Both spring heating and autumnal cooling significantly decreased under future climate conditions, while changes to total surface heat fluxes in winter and summer were an order of magnitude lower. This led to counter-intuitive results that, in a warming world, there would be less heat not more entering Lough Feeagh during the springtime, and little change in net heating over the summer or winter compared to natural climate conditions, projected increases in the volume-weighted average lake temperature were found to be largely due to reduced heat loss during autumn.					; Ayala, Ana I./KNL-0648-2024; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023; Jones, Ian/AAE-8193-2022	Mesman, Jorrit/0000-0002-4319-260X; Goyette, Stephane/0000-0001-5199-5974; Ayala Zamora, Ana Isabel/0000-0003-3986-5100; Pierson, Donald/0000-0001-6230-0146; de Eyto, Elvira/0000-0003-2281-2491													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 16	2024	128	11							e2022JD038355	10.1029/2022JD038355	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JD038355													WOS:001259473500001

The fluxes, components, temporal-spatial variations, and sources of OCPs were also analyzed. Twenty-one types of OCPs were detected in the dust fall samples around Lake Chaohu, with a total concentration of 51.54 +/- 36.31 ng/g and a total flux of 10.01 +/- 13.69 ng/(m(2) day). Aldrin (35.3 %), endosulfan (39.1 %), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) (49.8 %), and isodrin (37.1 %) were the major OCPs in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. Both the residual level and the flux were higher in the spring than in other seasons and higher at the outer lake sampling sites than inner lake sampling site. The potential source of the hexachlorcyclohexanes in the dust fall may be recent lindane usage. The DDTs mainly came from historical dicofol usage, and a significant input of DDT was found during April and June. The presence of endosulfan may be due to the present use of technical endosulfan. The aldrin in the dust might be due to its occasional usage, and isodrin may be a result of long-distance transport from other countries.

The selected optimal multivariable GAM could effectively explain the concentration variation of Chla occurring during each season, and the interpretation degree followed the order: summer > autumn > spring > winter. The fitting results indicated that the concentration variation of Chia could reflect that of biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand in all seasons. In addition, the total phosphorus showed strong ability to explain the concentration change of Chla in spring and summer, as the growth of algae would be affected when the concentration of phosphorus shifted high or low. Nitrogen showed strong ability to explain the variations in Chia concentration in autumn. The condusions of the optimal multivariable GAM could provide decision basis for the eutrophication control. In other words, the prevention of eutrophication outbreaks could be carried out via the targeted control of key water pollutants. According to these results, the concentration of Chia was higher in northern and western lake during summer and autumn, the management should focus on nutrient input of adjacent rivers.

Two kinds of hydrophilic UF membranes, comprising a commercial poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membrane (organic polymer membrane) and a kaolin membrane (inorganic ceramic membrane) characterized by low-cost, environmentally friendly, and highly permeable, were employed to explore the effect of NOM seasonal variation on UF membrane fouling. The findings revealed that the concentration of protein-like and polysaccharide-like substances in the two surface water sources exhibited a seasonal trend of summer > autumn approximate to spring > winter, while that of humic-like substances was autumn > winter > spring > summer. Seasonal variation in the trend of membrane fouling and flux recovery was identical between kaolin and PES membranes, and the magnitude of the effects followed a seasonal pattern of summer > autumn approximate to spring > winter, demonstrating that protein-like and polysaccharide-like substances were the primary fouling contaminants, and their impact was reversible due to the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface, unlike that caused by humic-like substances (irreversible fouling formed by blocking membrane pores). In addition, the kaolin membrane outperformed the PES membrane in terms of antifouling performance. This investigation unveils the potential of the kaolin membrane for efficient surface water treatment, offering an economic, environmentally friendly, efficient, and scalable strategy for surface water treatment.

The Importance of Spring and Autumn Atmospheric Conditions for the Evaporation Regime of Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Feedbacks between ice extent and evaporation have long been suspected to be important for Lake Superior evaporation because it is during autumn and winter when latent heat fluxes are highest. Recent direct measurements of evaporation made at the Stannard Rock Lighthouse have provided new information on the physical controls on Lake Superior evaporation, in particular that evaporation can react within hours to days to a change in synoptic conditions. However, the large heat capacity of the lake creates a strong seasonal cycle of energy storage and release. There is a complex interaction among heat storage, evaporation, and ice cover that is highly dependent on atmospheric conditions in the spring and autumn "shoulder seasons." Small changes in conditions in November and March caused by synoptic-scale events can have profound impacts on annual evaporation, the extent of ice cover, and the length of the ice-covered period. Early winter air temperatures in November and December dictate the nature of ice formation and much of the winter evaporative flux. Decreased ice cover, by itself, does not necessarily lead to enhanced annual evaporation losses. Rather, a combination of low ice cover and warm spring air temperatures, leading to an early breakup, can significantly lengthen the next evaporation season and cause greater cumulative water loss the subsequent year. The influence of individual synoptic events on annual evaporation is notable enough that the research community should ensure that their role is properly captured in numerical models to provide sound predictions of future Laurentian Great Lakes evaporation regimes.

Using year-round, high-frequency DO data from 12 dimictic lakes, we compared 3 measures of deepwater DO depletion during winter and summer: DO depletion rate, DO minimum, and hypoxia duration. Hypoxia (DO < 3 mg L-1) occurred in over half of the lakes and persisted an average of 83% longer in summer than in winter. While we found no difference in DO depletion rates between winter versus summer, these rates were significantly related to lake morphology in winter but trophic state in summer. In assessing cross-seasonal linkages, we found limited evidence for significant legacy effects in deepwater DO availability. Only fall mixing efficacy significantly responded to the previous summer's minimum DO saturation, but it always reached moderate to high DO replenishment levels (>65%) regardless of the previous summer's DO depletion severity. This lack of ecological memory in deepwater DO depletion across seasons suggests that deepwater DO largely resets during spring and fall mixing periods in most years in these dimictic lakes. Understanding the patterns and drivers in deepwater DO depletion in both winter and summer is a key step forward for predicting future chemical and biological consequences of seasonal DO depletion and managing lake ecosystem health, as well as the effects that climate change may have on these patterns.					; Nejstgaard, Jens/ABB-8903-2020; Laas, Alo/G-7992-2016; de Wit, Heleen/ABO-9056-2022; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Couture, Raoul/AGR-6683-2022; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Granados, Ignacio/A-3737-2013	Couture, Raoul/0000-0003-4940-3372; Pilla, Rachel/0000-0001-9156-9486; Rusak, James/0000-0002-4939-6478; Granados, Ignacio/0000-0002-8669-6613													2044-2041	2044-205X				JUL 3	2023	13	3					327	338		10.1080/20442041.2023.2265802	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2023.2265802		JUL 2023											WOS:001143976700001

Data concerning the presence and ecology of IAVs in waterfowl during winter and spring seasons in the U.S. northern latitudes have been limited, mainly due to limited access to waterfowl for sampling. The southwestern Lake Erie Basin is an important stopover site for waterfowl during migration periods, and over the past 28 years, 8.72% of waterfowl sampled in this geographic location have been positive for IAV recovery during summer and autumn (June-December). To gain a better understanding of influenza A viral dynamics in waterfowl populations during winter and spring migration (February through April), cloacal swabs were collected from overwintering and spring-migrating waterfowl in Ohio and Michigan in 2006, 2007, 2013, and 2014. A total of 740 cloacal swabs were collected and tested using virus isolation in embryonating chicken eggs, resulting in the recovery of 33 (4.5%) IAV isolates. The influenza A isolates were recovered from eight waterfowl species in the order Anseriformes. Antigenically, the IAV isolates represent 15 distinct hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) combinations, with seven (21%) of the isolates reported as mixed infections based on antigenic HA subtyping, NA subtyping, or both. This effort demonstrates the presence of antigenically diverse IAV in waterfowl during overwintering and spring migration at northern latitudes in the United States, thereby contributing to the understanding of the maintenance of diversity among waterfowl-origin IAVs.

J	Zhou, BT; Xu, ML; Sun, B; Han, TT; Cheng, ZG				Zhou, Botao; Xu, Manlin; Sun, Bo; Han, Tingting; Cheng, Zhigang			Possible role of Southern Hemispheric sea ice in the variability of West China autumn rain	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												West China Autumn Rain (WCAR), the last rainy season in China associated with the East Asian summer monsoon, is prone to flooding and secondary disasters and has profound impacts on the economic society. Thus, it is of great interest to understand its variability. Through an analysis with gridded rainfall data and reanalysis data, this study reveals that the variability of WCAR is positively correlated to the boreal summer (austral winter) sea ice concentration (SIC) in the Southern Indian and Pacific Ocean basins. Such a relationship is supported by the SIC-related changes in atmospheric circulations and water vapor transport. Corresponding to a high summer SIC, both the Lake Balkhash trough and the Asian low pressure are deepened, the East Asian jet shifts northward, and the water vapor transport to West China is enhanced during the boreal autumn, providing a favorable background for the increase of WCAR, and vice versa. The potential mechanism of how the boreal summer SIC affects the autumn atmospheric situation is further investigated. Results show that the atmospheric circulation in the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere possesses a seasonal persistence from the boreal summer to autumn due to the sea ice persistence. Thus, the boreal summer SIC-related anomalies in the upper-tropospheric winds over the Southern Indian and Pacific Ocean basins can persist to the following autumn and subsequently exert substantial influences on the Eurasian atmospheric circulations via two meridional teleconnections. The counterpart in the lower troposphere contributes to the water vapor transport toward West China. Certainly, this candidate mechanism is a preliminary explanation, and other processes may also act in their linkage.

Shorter Ice Duration and Changing Phenology Influence Under-Ice Lake Temperature Dynamics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Temperate lakes worldwide are losing ice cover but the implications for under-ice thermal dynamics are poorly constrained. Using a 92-year record of ice phenology from a temperate and historically dimictic lake, we examined trends, variability, and drivers of ice phenology and under-ice temperatures. The onset of ice formation decreased by 23 days century-1, which can be largely attributed to warming air temperatures. Ice-off date has become substantially more variable with spring air temperatures and cumulative February through April snowfall explaining over 80% of the variation in timing. As a result of changing ice phenology, total ice duration contracted by a month and more than doubled in interannual variability. Using weekly under-ice temperature profiles for the most recent 36 years, we found that shorter ice duration decreased winter inverse stratification and was associated with an extended spring mixing period. We illustrate the limitations of relying on discrete ice clearance dates in our assumptions around under-ice thermal dynamics by presenting high-frequency under-ice observations in two recent winters: one with intermittent ice cover and a year with slow spring ice clearance.

The dataset was constructed from a half century of monitoring (1962-2010). The direction of the temperature trend depended on the water layer and the season, in that the yearly average temperature in the top layer (1-10 m) as recorded in summer (June-August) increased by 2.5 degrees C over the monitoring period, whereas that recorded when the lake was covered by ice (January-April) decreased from 0.6 to 0.2 degrees C. The water temperature in the bottommost layers showed no trends. We suggest that the water temperature under the ice is decreasing in this case as a consequence of mixed effects of lake-specific physical features and climate change, which cause variations in the heat content of the inflowing water of the Pielisjoki. The epilimnetic water temperature in summer appeared in turn to follow general trends in air temperatures. Our results stress the need for taking local and site-specific phenomena into account when drawing conclusions about the effects of climate change on lakes.

Projected phenological shifts in stratification and overturning of ice-covered Northern Hemisphere lakes	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT												The seasonal cycle of vertical mixing is crucial for lake ecosystems, yet its future under climate change remains uncertain. While lake stratification shifts have been widely studied, the annual overturning duration changes are less clear. Using sub-daily simulations from a fully coupled numerical Earth system model, we assess phenological changes in stratification and overturning in Northern Hemisphere ice-covered lakes. We find the total stratification duration (comprising both summer and winter phases) is projected to decrease by 0.7, 4.6, and 6.9 days in 2029, 2067, and 2096, respectively, under global temperature increases of 1.5 degrees C, 3 degrees C, and 4.5 degrees C. Conversely, the duration of overturning is expected to increase by 0.7, 4.2, and 8 days annually. Notably, these changes are asymmetrical, with most of the overturning extension occurring in the fall, following the peak growing season. This extended overturning could affect lake ecosystems, particularly through enhanced ventilation of bottom layers and altered nutrient cycling.

J	Nyzio, KD; Liu, P				Nyzio, Kazimir D.; Liu, Ping			Lake-Effect Snowfall Climatology over Lake Champlain: A Comparative Analysis of the 2015-2024 and 1997-2006 Periods	ATMOSPHERE												This study updates the climatology of lake-effect (LE) snowfall over Lake Champlain by analyzing radar and surface data from nine winter seasons spanning 2015 to 2024. A filtering approach was applied to isolate periods with favorable LE conditions, and events were manually classified using criteria consistent with a previous climatology from 1997 to 2006. A total of 64 LE events were identified and compared across the two periods to evaluate potential changes associated with regional warming. Despite a substantial reduction in lake ice cover during the recent decades, no increase in LE frequency or duration was observed. Instead, warming has shifted the seasonal distribution of events, with fewer early-season cases and more late-season occurrences. LE events also exhibited shorter durations and higher minimum temperatures and dew points. These findings suggest that warming may constrain LE snowfall development over small lakes such as Champlain, in contrast to intensification trends reported for larger lake systems. The analysis also highlights a rarely documented transitional band type that migrated along the lake axis during synoptic shifts. Results underscore the value of observational climatologies for detecting emerging snowfall behaviors in response to climate variability.																				2073-4433				AUG 28	2025	16	9							1011	10.3390/atmos16091011	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16091011													WOS:001579363500001
J	Woolway, RI				Woolway, R. Iestyn			The pace of shifting seasons in lakes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Lake ecosystems are vulnerable to seasonal thermal cues, with subtle alterations in the timing of seasonal temperatures having a dramatic influence on aquatic species. Here, a measure of seasonal change in temperature is used to describe the pace of shifting seasons in lakes. Since 1980 spring and summer temperatures in Northern Hemisphere lakes have arrived earlier (2.0- and 4.3-days decade(-1), respectively), whilst the arrival of autumn has been delayed (1.5-days decade(-1)) and the summer season lengthened (5.6-days decade(-1)). This century, under a high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, current spring and summer temperatures will arrive even earlier (3.3- and 8.3-days decade(-1), respectively), autumn temperatures will arrive later (3.1-days decade(-1)), and the summer season will lengthen further (12.1-days decade(-1)). These seasonal alterations will be much slower under a low-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario. Changes in seasonal temperatures will benefit some species, by prolonging the growing season, but negatively impact others, by leading to phenological mismatches in critical activities. Water temperature influences lake ecosystems, but little is known about changes in its seasonality. This study shows that the timing of spring temperatures will arrive earlier whilst autumn temperatures will be delayed globally under climate change.																				2041-1723				APR 13	2023	14	1							2101	10.1038/s41467-023-37810-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37810-4								37055406					WOS:001002488800007
J	Gören, GU				Goren, Gulsen Uzun			Seasonal variation of fatty acid compositions in freshwater crayfish (Pontastacus leptodactylus Eschscholtz, 1823)	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												This study aims to determine the fatty acid composition of Pontastacus leptodactylus Eschscholtz, 1823 crayfish living in Cernek Lake in Bafra Fish Lakes in four seasons. The study was carried out over a period of one year. The crayfish used in the study were randomly sampled from their natural habitat at legal catch sizes. It was found that there was no difference in saturated fatty acid (SFA) concentrations among autumn/summer and spring/winter seasons, but there was a difference (p < 0.05) among autumn/winter and spring/summer seasons. It was found that there was a difference (p < 0.05) between the concentrations of monounsaturated fatty acids (Sigma MUFA) in the spring and summer seasons. While the concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (Sigma PUFA) showed similar characteristics in the summer and autumn seasons, it was found that the concentrations were different in the other seasons (p < 0.05). It was also found that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentrations were lowest in spring and highest in summer, and the annual mean was 13.16 +/- 1.10. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentrations were highest in winter and the annual mean was 6.79 +/- 0.33. EPA+DHA concentrations were highest in the summer season and the annual mean was 19.96 +/- 1.26. Omega-3 (omega-3) concentrations were highest in spring and lowest in autumn. In addition, the average annual Sigma Omega 3 (omega-3) concentration was 25.05 +/- 4.62. Sigma Omega 6 (omega-6) concentrations were highest in winter and lowest in summer, and the annual general average was 18.60 +/- 2.12. The annual average of Sigma omega-3/Sigma omega-6 ratios was 1.36 +/- 0.33. Based on the results of this study, these crayfish are an important source of (omega-3) fatty acids. This investigation will have a beneficial impact on the local market and potential aquaculture activities.					; uzun goren, gulsen/AAQ-2851-2020	Uzun Goren, Gulsen/0000-0001-9109-2921; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC 31	2025	40	1							2461684	10.1080/02705060.2025.2461684	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2025.2461684													WOS:001417695500001
J	Ghane, A; Boegman, L				Ghane, Alireza; Boegman, Leon			Turnover in a small Canadian shield lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In dimictic lakes, the stable density stratification during summer and winter inhibits vertical mixing of nutrients and oxygen. This favors the development of hypolimnetic hypoxia, which degrades cool-water fish habitat and enhances nutrient mineralization from the sediments. Fall and spring turnover events, therefore, provide a crucial biannual link between surface and bottom waters. However, the physical processes occurring to mix lakes during turnover events remain comparatively uninvestigated. In this study, long-term field observations were supplemented with output from a three-dimensional numerical model, to better understand turnover events within a small temperate lake during 2011-2017. Mid-basin penetrative convection, sidearm convection, and wind-induced mixing were identified, with mid-basin convection likely contributing the most to turnover events; a typical side-arm convective plume had 2% (spring) to 4% (fall) of the mass flux compared to those at mid-basin. During fall turnover, wind shear only mixed the upper 35% of the surface mixed layer, with convection acting to deepen below. During spring turnover, ice-cover sheltered the lake from wind, causing convection to be the only process occurring and lengthening the turnover duration (similar to 51 d) compared to fall (similar to 13 d).					; Ghane, Alireza/ADH-9568-2022	Ghane, Alireza/0000-0001-6013-5319; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2021	66	9					3356	3373		10.1002/lno.11884	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11884		JUL 2021											WOS:000672915000001

We studied the changes in phytoplankton assemblages, expressed as morpho-functional groups, during four seasons over the past two decades in large shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. During this period, both climate and nutrient levels changed in the lake. Wind speed declined significantly from 1997 to 2016 in all seasons, while global radiation increased significantly in spring and winter. Phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations showed a significant increasing trend in all seasons, especially in summer and autumn. Diatoms, mainly Aulacoseira and Asterionella, increased during late winter and early spring. Multiple stepwise regression analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated that climatic variables (i.e., decreasing wind speed and increasing global radiation) were the main drivers of phytoplankton assemblage variance in winter and early spring. An increase in the dominance of cyanobacteria (mainly Microcystis spp.) in summer and autumn was mainly related to changes in phosphorus. Our results indicate that both nutrients and climatic variables were major drivers of the observed changes in phytoplankton assemblages, differing in importance between seasons. The differential response of phytoplankton community variation to future environmental change in the different seasons needs to be taken into account when evaluating the long-term changes in phytoplankton.

Sub-lakes are important for the maintenance of the ecosystem integrity of Lake Poyang, and zooplankton play an important role in its substance and energy flow. Methods. A seasonal investigation of zooplankton was conducted in spring (April), summer (July), autumn (October) and winter (January of the following year) from 2012 to 2016 in a sub-lake of Lake Poyang. The aim of the present study was to understand the seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of zooplankton communities and their relationship to environmental factors. Results. A total of 115 species were identified in all samples in the four years, which comprised of 87 Rotifera, 13 Cladocera and 15 Copepoda. Rotifera was the dominant group in terms of quantity, and its species richness and abundance were significantly higher when compared to Cladocera and Copepoda (P < 0.05), while Cladocera dominated in terms of biomass. The species richness of Rotifera exhibited a significant seasonal difference (P < 0.05). Both the density and biomass of zooplankton revealed significant seasonal differences (P < 0.05). In general, the density and biomass of zooplankton were higher in summer and autumn, when compared to winter and spring. Biodiversity indices were dramatically lower in spring than in the other seasons. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis su rested that these zooplankton communities can be divided into three groups: spring community, summer-autumn community, and winter community. The seasonal succession of zooplankton communities did not have interannual reproducibility. In high water level years, the dominant species of zooplankton (Cladocerans and Copepods) in the wet season had a lower density, and the result in low water level years was exactly the opposite. The redundancy analysis revealed that water temperature (WT), conductivity, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) had significant effects on the zooplankton community. Conclusions. The community structure of zooplankton has a significant seasonal pattern, but has no interannual repeatability. In high water level years, the dominant species of zooplankton (Cladocerans and Copepods) in the wet season had a lower density, and the result in low water level years was exactly the opposite. The density, biomass and diversity indices of zooplankton were significantly different in different seasons. The present study was helpful in the further understanding of the ecosystem stability of lakes connected with rivers, providing scientific guidance for the protection of lake wetlands.

J	Titze, DJ; Austin, JA				Titze, Daniel J.; Austin, Jay A.			Winter thermal structure of Lake Superior	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Moorings equipped with thermistors that span the water column were deployed at up to seven locations throughout Lake Superior from October 2005 through May 2013. This year-round, multi-year, multi-location, full water-column record of the thermal structure reveals significant inter-annual and spatial variability in Lake Superior's winter heat content, thermocline depth, and phenology. There is a stark contrast in thermal structure between the cold, icy winter of 2009, during which strong negative stratification formed, and the much warmer winter of 2012, during which the stratification was much weaker. Significant inter-annual and spatial variability was also observed in ice cover, which influenced heat content. Ice cover significantly inhibits heat flux between the lake and the atmosphere, and spatial variability in ice cover translates into spatial variability in end-of-winter heat content. This is found to be preserved through the spring warming season, and is strongly correlated with variability in the timing of the onset of summer stratification, with regions that have warmer end-of-winter water columns stratifying earlier than regions with colder end-of-winter water-columns. Observed spring warming rates appear to depend not on mooring depth, but on regionally averaged depth; this suggests the existence of a lateral mixing mechanism.

J	Smith, SB				Smith, Susan B.			A PHYSIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF SEASONAL DIFFERENCES IN SPRING AND AUTUMN MIGRATION STOPOVER AT BRADDOCK BAY, LAKE ONTARIO	CONDOR												This study investigated seasonal differences in fat deposition and nutritional status of migrating passerine birds at an important stopover site on the south shore of Lake Ontario. Birds were captured during spring and autumn stopovers, and their plasma metabolites were measured as indicators of refueling rates (plasma triglyceride) and nutritional state (plasma uric acid). Catharus thrushes had higher plasma triglyceride and lower plasma uric acid in autumn than in spring, whereas Red-eyed Vireos had higher plasma triglyceride in spring than in autumn, but no seasonal differences in plasma uric acid. There were no seasonal differences in plasma triglyceride concentrations in White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) and Blackpoll Warblers (Setophaga striata), although White-throated Sparrows had plasma uric acid higher in spring than in autumn, suggesting they were consuming more protein than were those captured during autumn migration. These data suggest that songbirds use this site for refueling during both spring and autumn, but substantial seasonal differences in fat and protein metabolism indicate seasonal shifts in habitat use by some species. Results of this study emphasize the importance of considering seasonal differences in food availability and interspecific differences in stopover site use when these sites are managed to provide high-quality habitat across seasons for a range of songbird species.																			0010-5422					MAY	2013	115	2					273	279		10.1525/cond.2013.120023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/cond.2013.120023													WOS:000319481300007

In this context, we investigated the effect of two groundwater levels (10 cm vs. 20 cm depth) on growth and reproductive parameters of Carex cinerascens, a dominant plant species in the Poyang Lake wetland, during three seasons (spring, summer, and autumn) and during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). Carex cinerascens showed low stem number, height, and individual and population biomass in summer compared to spring and autumn. 10 cm groundwater level was overall more suitable for plant growth resulting in higher stem height and biomass. However, the interactive effect between groundwater level and season clearly demonstrated that the effect of groundwater level on plant growth occurred mainly in autumn. After the withering of the plant population in summer, we observed that C. cinerascens growth recovered in autumn to similar values observed in spring only with 10 cm groundwater level. Consequently, we could deduce that lowering groundwater level in the studied Poyang Lake wetland will negatively impact C. cinerascens regeneration and growth particularly during the second growth cycle occurring in autumn. Additionally, our results showed that, independently of the season and groundwater level, population biomass of C. cinerascens was lower during drier year. Altogether, our findings suggest that water limitation due to both reduction in precipitation and decreased groundwater level during the year can strongly impact plant communities.

Patterns of Change in Metabolic Capabilities of Sediment Microbial Communities in River and Lake Ecosystems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Information on the biodegradation potential of lake and river microbial communities is essential for watershed management. The water draining into the lake ecosystems often carries a significant amount of suspended sediments, which are transported by rivers and streams from the local drainage basin. The organic carbon processing in the sediments is executed by heterotrophic microbial communities, whose activities may vary spatially and temporally. Thus, to capture and apprehend some of these variabilities in the sediments, we sampled six sites: three from the Saint Clair River (SC1, SC2, and SC3) and three from Lake Saint Clair in the spring, summer, fall, and winter of 2016. Here, we investigated the shifts in metabolic profiles of sediment microbial communities, along Saint Clair River and Lake Saint Clair using Biolog EcoPlates, which test for the oxidation of 31 carbon sources. The number of utilized substrates was generally higher in the river sediments (upstream) than in the lake sediments (downstream), suggesting a shift in metabolic activities among microbial assemblages. Seasonal and site-specific differences were also found in the numbers of utilized substrates, which were similar in the summer and fall, and spring and winter. The sediment microbial communities in the summer and fall showed more versatile substrate utilization patterns than spring and winter communities. The functional fingerprint analyses clearly distinguish the sediment microbial communities from the lake sites (downstream more polluted sites), which showed a potential capacity to use more complex carbon substrates such as polymers. This study establishes a close linkage between physical and chemical properties (temperature and organic matter content) of lake and river sediments and associated microbial functional activities.					; Tiquia, Sonia/B-7093-2008	Fenner, Mitchell/0000-0002-9684-0447; Oest, Adam/0000-0003-2714-3872; Tiquia-Arashiro, Sonia/0000-0001-5084-1658													1687-918X	1687-9198					2018	2018								6234931	10.1155/2018/6234931	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/6234931								29977299					WOS:000482126300035

Climate change alters the quantity and phenology of habitat for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in small Boreal Shield lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We analyzed monitoring data (1970-2013) from small Boreal Shield lakes to understand how variations in air temperature and precipitation affect the phenology and amount of habitat for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Annual air temperatures increased by similar to 2 degrees C (significant in fall and winter). In response, ice cover was reduced by similar to 19 days. Despite earlier ice-offs, springs became longer, allowing lake trout longer access to littoral regions when water temperatures were cool. Although summer surface water temperatures increased, the summer did not lengthen. Instead, later spring-warming and fall-cooling of lakes caused summer to shift later in the year, potentially delaying fall spawning. Complete loss of optimal oxythermal habitat volume occurred in all lakes and became more prevalent over time, more so in the darkest lakes. Although air temperatures did not become more variable, several habitat measures did, including mean summer surface water temperatures, duration of ice cover, timing of ice-off, and minimum volumes of optimal oxythermal habitat. Our results suggest that future warming will impose greater thermal stress on lake trout, but may be tempered by longer springs.

This study revealed a seasonal variation of both physico-chemical factors and biomass of zooplankton functional groups. Water temperature (TEP), total phosphorus (TP), ferrous ion (Fe2+) and total carbon (TC) were significantly higher in summer while water transparency (SD) was notably higher in spring. Zooplankton functional group biomass was higher in summer (5.11 mg/L) followed by winter, autumn and spring (0.91, 0.72 and 0.28 mg/L, respectively). LCC (large copepods and cladoceran carnivore) was the dominant functional group in spring accounting for about 86.7% of the total biomass. In summer, MCF (middle copepods and cladocerans filter feeders) was the dominant group probably because of the optimal temperature and availability of nutrients. Pearson correlation and RDA analysis results suggested that Fe2+, TP and TEP were the major factors influencing zooplankton functional groups. Notably, turbidity was not the main factor despite the fact that Small Xingkai Wetland Lake is a very turbid lake. The variation of zooplankton functional groups among seasons highlights the role of physico-chemical factors in structuring zooplankton composition.					; Mahboob Rana, Shahid/P-1131-2014; Sun, Xiaowen/M-6278-2014; Rana, Shahid/P-1131-2014; Xue, Meng/I-4853-2013	Ma, Chengxue/0000-0001-6100-1291; Mahboob Rana, Shahid/0000-0003-4969-5387; Mwagona, Patteson/0000-0003-4785-8875; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2019	34	1					65	79		10.1080/02705060.2018.1443847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2018.1443847													WOS:000456022000001

Using lake ice cover time-series spanning over 87 yr for 43 lakes across the Northern Hemisphere, we found that the interannual variability in ice duration, measured as standard deviation, significantly increased in only half of our studied lakes. We observed that the interannual variability in ice duration peaked when lakes were, on average, covered by ice for about 1 month, while both longer and shorter long-term mean ice cover duration resulted in lower interannual variability in ice duration. These results demonstrate that the ice cover duration can become so short that the interannual variability rapidly declines. The interannual variability in ice duration showed a strong dependency on global temperature anomalies and teleconnections, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. We conclude that many lakes across the Northern Hemisphere will experience a decline in interannual ice cover variability and shift to open water during the winter under a continued global warming trend which will affect lake biological, cultural, and economic processes.					; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019	Richardson, David/0000-0001-9374-9624; Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281													0024-3590	1939-5590				APR	2024	69	4					789	801		10.1002/lno.12527	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12527		FEB 2024											WOS:001170169000001

DYNAMICS OF PHYTOPLANKTON DISTRIBUTION IN RELATION TO STRATIFICATION AND WINTER PRECIPITATION, FALLEN LEAF LAKE, CALIFORNIA	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Seasonal succession and interannual variation of modern diatom populations in Fallen Leaf Lake, Sierra Nevada, California, are characterized and discussed in relation to stratification, water quality, and inflow during spring runoff. Fallen Leaf Lake is a deep, transparent subalpine lake that undergoes a 5-6 month period of stratification and develops a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) dominated by diatoms. A seasonal succession was observed, where the early spring was dominated by Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria tenera-group (F. tenera and F. nanana), Tabellaria flocculosa strain IIIp, Aulacoseira subarctica, and Urosolenia eriensis. Asterionella formosa and T. flocculosa strain IIIp persisted into the summer, becoming dominant components of the DCM. In late summer, Cyclotella rossii succeeded the araphids in the DCM and persisted until deep mixing in the late fall. In winter, the lake is ice free and well mixed, and Au. subarctica was abundant in surface waters, along with Nitzschia and the other components of the spring bloom. Strong species partitioning occurred between the epilimnion and hypolimnion, and Handmannia bodanica was the dominant summer epilimnetic diatom in all years. During a 3-year period, we observed interannual variation in the species of dominant phytoplankton. These years also varied in the depth and development of stratification, development of snowpack in the watershed, and timing of spring melt. The maximum depth of the epilimnion ranged from 12.5 to 17.5 m, and the DCM varied from 30 to 40 m deep. The weakest epilimnetic development was associated with 2011, a year with unusually deep snowpack, wintery spring conditions, and late melting. During 2011, Fragilaria tenera-group dominated the phytoplankton, and water clarity was low. A considerable portion of dead lotic diatoms were suspended in the water column, washed in from higher in the watershed during spring runoff. The lotic fraction is a significant portion of surface sediments and may be a useful proxy for identifying past changes in inflow. In addition, ratios of H. bodanica and C. rossii are explored as a possible proxy for strength in stratification. Collectively, these data provide a solid picture of the seasonal and interannual dynamics of the modern lake system, an essential step in evaluating the climate potential of the diatom record, which is currently being analyzed from lake cores.					; Kreamer, David/HRC-5915-2023	Noble, Paula/0000-0002-9558-9123; 													1527-0904	1944-8341				NOV	2013	73	3					302	322		10.3398/064.073.0301	http://dx.doi.org/10.3398/064.073.0301													WOS:000339960600004

Thunderstorm Characteristics during the Ontario Winter Lake-Effect Systems Project	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The Ontario Winter Lake-Effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign during the winter season of 2013/14 provided unprecedented data with regard to the structure and behavior of long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) lake-effect storms. One of the interesting characteristics of LLAP storm bands is their ability to initiate lightning. The OWLeS datasets provide an opportunity to examine more thoroughly the kinematics and microphysics of lake-effect thunder-snowstorms than ever before. The OWLeS facilities and field personnel observed six lake-effect thunderstorms during December-January 2013/14. Most of them produced very little lightning (fewer than six cloud-to-ground strokes or intracloud pulses recorded by the National Lightning Detection Network). The 7 January 2014 storm had over 50 strokes and pulses, however, which resulted in 20 flashes over a 6-h period (0630-1230 UTC), making it the most electrically active storm during the field campaign. Relative to the 18 December 2013 storm, which only had three flashes, the 7 January 2014 case had a deeper boundary layer and greater instability. Also, 45% of the lightning during the 7 January storm was likely due to flashes initiated by wind turbines or other man-made antennas, along with all of the lightning observed during 18 December. No lightning was documented over Lake Ontario, the primary source of instability for these storms.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				APR	2018	57	4					853	874		10.1175/JAMC-D-17-0188.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-17-0188.1													WOS:000430457500004
J	Carter, E; Steinschneider, S				Carter, Elizabeth; Steinschneider, Scott			Hydroclimatological Drivers of Extreme Floods on Lake Ontario	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study examines the hydrologic and climatic conditions that precede major flood events on Lake Ontario, with the purpose of understanding the potential for seasonal forecasts to inform lake level management. Seven late spring/early summer flood events are identified since 1949, including the record-breaking flood of 2017. The surface climate, atmospheric circulation, and antecedent lake levels for the preceding winter and spring seasons are examined. Results suggest that flood events are caused by different combinations of high, initial wintertime water levels across all of the Great Lakes, anomalously wet winters across the entire Great Lakes basin, and wet spring conditions, particularly in the eastern part of the basin. Wet winters that precede flood events are often associated with La Nina conditions, while wet springs are often associated with a westward shift of the North Atlantic Subtropical High. As the critical drawdown period for Lake Ontario occurs in the fall, before the onset of anomalous winter or spring/summer inputs, a generalized additive model was used to predict April-August maximum monthly average Lake Ontario water levels using November levels for all Great Lakes, a nonlinear response to the wintertime Nino 3.4 index, and scenarios of April-May overbasin precipitation. The Nino 3.4 index significantly improves lake level predictions, suggesting that an El Nino-Southern Oscillation signal may be useful for lake level management. Future work needed to verify the use of El Nino-Southern Oscillation for Lake Ontario flood forecasting and to link the North Atlantic Subtropical High to predictions of springtime Great Lakes climate is discussed.

Seasonal movements of non-native lake trout in a connected lake and river system	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Non-native lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum), threaten native salmonid populations in the western United States. Effective management of lake trout requires understanding movements within connected lake and river systems. This study determined the seasonal movements of subadult lake trout in the Flathead River upstream of Flathead Lake, Montana, USA using radio telemetry. The spatiotemporal distribution of lake trout in the river was related to water temperature. Lake trout were detected in the river primarily during autumn, winter and spring, when water temperatures were cool. By contrast, fewer were detected when temperatures were warmest during summer and during high spring flows. Downriver movements to Flathead Lake occurred throughout autumn and winter when water temperature decreased below 5 degrees C, and in late spring as water temperature rose towards 15 degrees C and river discharge declined following spring runoff. Upriver movements occurred primarily in October, which coincided with migrations of prey fishes. These results suggest that lake trout are capable of moving throughout connected river and lake systems (up to 230 km) and that warm water temperatures function as an impediment to occupancy of the river during summer. Controlling source populations and maintaining natural water temperatures may be effective management strategies for reducing the spread of non-native lake trout.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				JUN	2012	19	3					224	232		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2011.00821.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2011.00821.x													WOS:000303912000004

Detection of Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in Lake Tana, Ethiopia, Using Machine Learning Algorithms	WATER												Lake Tana is Ethiopia's largest lake and is infested with invasive water hyacinth (E. crassipes), which endangers the lake's biodiversity and habitat. Using appropriate remote sensing detection methods and determining the seasonal distribution of the weed is important for decision-making, water resource management, and environmental protection. As the demand for the reliable estimation of E. crassipes mapping from satellite data grows, comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms could help in identifying the most effective method for E. crassipes detection in the lake. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the ability of random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression tree (CART) machine learning algorithms to detect E. crassipes and estimating seasonal spatial coverage of the weed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images. Cloud-masked monthly median composite Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 data from October 2021 and 2022, January 2022 and 2023, March 2022, and June 2022 were used to represent autumn, winter, spring, and summer, respectively. Four spectral indices were derived and used in combination with spectral bands to improve the E. crassipes detection accuracy. All methods achieved greater than 95% and 90% overall accuracy when using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images, respectively. Using both data sets, all methods achieved a greater than 93% F1 score for E. crassipes detection. Though the difference in performance between the methods was small, the RF was the most accurate, while the SVM and CART methods had the same accuracy. The maximum E. crassipes coverage area was observed in autumn (22.4 km(2)), while the minimum (2.2 km(2)) was observed in summer. Based on Sentinel 2 data, the E. crassipes area coverage decreased significantly by 62.5% from winter to spring and increased significantly by 81.7% from summer to autumn. The findings suggested that the RF classifier was the most accurate E. crassipes detection algorithm, and autumn was an appropriate season for E. crassipes detection in Lake Tana.

Research on this lake's seasonal and spatial variations in phytoplankton diversity is needed to understand the distribution of eutrophication, as well as to find appropriate comprehensive biodiversity indices to assess the eutrophication status of the lake. The present study indicated that the Margalef index of all samples was as low as 0.799 +/- 0.543 in summer (August 2011) and as high as 1.467 +/- 0.653 in winter (February 2012). The Margalef index of the river samples had a high mean value and substantial variation compared with the lake samples. The Peilou index of the lake samples was higher than that of the river samples in summer and autumn (November 2011) but lower than that of the river samples in winter. In spring (May 2012), the Peilou index of the western samples was lower than that of the eastern samples. The spatial distribution of the Shannon-Wiener index was more similar to that of the Peilou index in autumn and winter, while in spring and summer, the spatial distribution was affected by both species richness and evenness. High eutrophication levels occurred in the western lake in spring and summer, whereas high levels occurred in the eastern lake, especially in the middle of the lake, in autumn and winter. The total trophic state index (TSI) in all samples exhibited a significant negative correlation with the Margalef (r = -0.726) and Peilou (r = -0.530) indices but a significant positive correlation with the Shannon-Wiener (r = 0.654) index. The partial correlation analysis results implied that these phytoplankton biodiversity indices could serve as synthetic ecological indicators to assess the eutrophication condition of Lake Chaohu.

Exploring the role of microorganisms in the material cycle of water bodies is of great significance for preventing the exacerbation of eutrophication in the reservoir. In this study, water samples from the overlying water of five points in the reservoir were collected four times in spring (April), summer (July), autumn (November), and winter (January) of 2022-2023 using a gas-tight water sampler. Physicochemical factors were measured, and the microbial community structure was analyzed by high-throughput MiSeq sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene in order to explore the relationship between physicochemical factors and microbial community structure and the dominant microbial populations that affect eutrophication of the reservoir. The following results were obtained through analysis. Among the 20 overlying water samples from Zhangjiayan Reservoir, a total of 66 phyla, 202 classes, 499 orders, 835 families, 1716 genera, and 27,904 ASVs of the bacterial domain were detected. The phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were dominant in the microbial community of the overlying water in Zhangjiayan Reservoir. At the genus level, hgcI_clade and Actinobacteria had the highest abundance and was the dominant population. The microbial community in the water of Zhangjiayan Reservoir has a high level of diversity. The diversity index ranked by numerical order was winter > autumn > summer > spring. Significant differences were found in the composition and structure of the microbial community between the spring/summer and autumn/winter seasons (p < 0.05). Total phosphorus, dissolved total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen have a significant impact on the composition and structure of the microbial community (p < 0.01). The bacterial community in the overlying water of Zhangjiayan Reservoir showed a mainly positive correlation. Sphingomonas, Brevundimonas, and Blastomonas were the central populations of the bacterial community in the overlying water of Zhangjiayan Reservoir. This study indicates that environmental factors, such as phosphorus and other nutrients, have a significant impact on the formation of the microbial community structure in different seasons. Sphingomonas, Brevundimonas, and Blastomonas are key populations that may have a significant impact on eutrophication in Zhangjiayan Reservoir.																			2045-2322					MAR 6	2024	14	1							5513	10.1038/s41598-024-55702-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55702-5								38448523					WOS:001180936100077

Satellite altimetry has proven to be an effective technique for monitoring water level changes in inland lakes. However, high-altitude and high-latitude lakes undergo seasonal freezing and melting, affecting satellite altimetry accuracy. This paper evaluates the accuracy of lake level height observations by the CryoSat-2, which uses synthetic aperture radar (SAR) across seasons. First, we used lake boundary based on optical remote sensing data to extract the footprints of CryoSat-2 that fall on Namco and Zhari Namco. After elevation conversion and anomaly identification, we obtained the time series of lake levels. These data were compared and verified against lake levels from in-situ measurements to assess the accuracy of CryoSat-2. The results show that CryoSat-2 can monitor lake level height with an accuracy of about 10-13 cm. The correlation coefficient between CryoSat-2 observations and in-situ measurements over Namco is 0.80 (p < 0.01), with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 13 cm. For Zhari Namco, the correlation coefficient is 0.91, with an RMSE of 10 cm, indicating a better match. At the seasonal scale, the seasonal correlation coefficients between CryoSat-2 and in-situ measurement in Namco are 0.47 (spring), 0.79 (summer), and 0.91 (fall) with no observations available for winter. The lower correlation in spring may be due to incomplete ice melting. For Zhari Namco, the seasonal correlation coefficients are 0.89 (spring), 0.93 (summer), 0.89 (fall), and 0.87 (winter). The results show that CryoSat-2 accuracy is higher in summer and fall, while slightly lower in spring and winter, indicating that ice formation affects accuracy. Even during winter, the altimetry results do not significantly exceed the in-situ lake water level observations.

Warming winters are leading to the loss of lake ice and changing snow cover on lakes. Historically, lake scientists have paid less attention to the ice cover period, leading to data and theory gaps about the role of winter conditions in lake ecosystem function and the consequences of changing winters. Here we use simple models to show that the latitudinal interaction between ice cover duration and light flux seasonality has profound and underappreciated implications for lakes. Our models focus on light and temperature, two key drivers of ecosystem processes. We show that the relative amount of light arriving in lakes during ice cover increases non-linearly with latitude and that the light climate of high latitude lakes is much more sensitive to changing winter conditions than that of lower latitude lakes. We also demonstrate that the synchronicity between high light and warm temperatures may decrease with latitude, with implications for primary and secondary production. Our results suggest that ice loss may lead to greater relative change to productivity and biotic interactions in higher latitude lakes and also offer several testable predictions for understanding the consequences of climate-induced changes across latitudinal gradients.

Emission and oxidation of methane in a meromictic, eutrophic and temperate lake (Dendre, Belgium)	CHEMOSPHERE												We sampled the water column of the Dendre stone pit lake (Belgium) in spring, summer, autumn and winter. Depth profiles of several physico-chemical variables, nutrients, dissolved gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), sulfate, sulfide, iron and manganese concentrations and delta C-13-CH4 were determined. We performed incubation experiments to quantify CH4 oxidation rates, with a focus on anaerobic CH4 oxidation (AOM), without and with an inhibitor of sulfate reduction (molybdate). The evolution of nitrate and sulfate concentrations during the incubations was monitored. The water column was anoxic below 20 m throughout the year, and was thermally stratified in summer and autumn. High partial pressure of CO2 and CH4 and high concentrations of ammonium and phosphate were observed in anoxic waters. Important nitrous oxide and nitrate concentration maxima were also observed (up to 440 nmol L-1 and 80 mu mol L-1, respectively). Vertical profiles of delta C-13-CH4 unambiguously showed the occurrence of AOM. Important AOM rates (up to 14 mu mol L-1 d(-1)) were observed and often co-occurred with nitrate consumption peaks, suggesting the occurrence of AOM coupled with nitrate reduction. AOM coupled with sulfate reduction also occurred, since AOM rates tended to be lower when molybdate was added. CH4 oxidation was mostly aerobic (similar to 80% of total oxidation) in spring and winter, and almost exclusively anaerobic in summer and autumn. Despite important CH4 oxidation rates, the estimated CH4 fluxes from the water surface to the atmosphere were high (mean of 732 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) in spring, summer and autumn, and up to 12,482 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) in winter).

The total concentrations of 16 U.S. EPA priority PAHs (sigma 16PAHs) were highest in winter (gaseous: 36.6 +/- 1.89 ng m- 3; PM phase: 16.9 +/- 10.2 ng m- 3) and lowest in summer (gaseous: 4.78 +/- 1.48; PM phase: 2.28 +/- 1.26), and followed the sequence of urban site > tourist site > rural site. In addition, rural site had higher particulate PAH concentrations in summer, autumn, and winter than other sites, primarily due to the extensive biomass burning. Low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs (2- and 3-ring PAHs) were the dominating compounds in gaseous phase, which was quite different from the high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs (4- to 6ring PAHs) predominating in the particulate phase. The fractions of LMW PAHs showed a declining trend with the decrease of particle size for all seasons. The gas-particle partitioning of PAHs was controlled by organic carbon absorption and primarily influenced by the particle sizes. Petrogenic, traffic emission, biomass burning, and coal combustion were the main sources of atmospheric PAHs, which contributed to 33%, 35%, 32%, and 32% in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. The overall population attributable fraction (PAF) for lung cancer due to inhalation exposure to PAHs was 0.78%o (interquartile range (IR) = 0.17-2.4%o), corresponding to the excess annual lung cancer incidence rates of 6.6 x 10-8, 1.2 x 10-8, and 2.0 x 10-7 for children, adolescents, and adults, respectively.

Mass concentrations of PM10 particles were higher during the summer compared to the winter season (14 f 5.3 mu g m- 3 and 6 f 3.4 mu g m- 3 , respectively). Such seasonal variation is unusual for this part of Europe, where the winters are harsh and biomass for domestic heating is most common. The analysis of carbohydrates in PM10 revealed the presence of anhydrosugars, sugar alcohols, and monosaccharides throughout the sampling period. Anhydrosugars were the most dominant compounds despite the season. The highest average mass concentrations of 124.1 f 100.06 ng m- 3 , 8.0 f 5.55 ng m- 3 , and 7.0 f 7.62 ng m-3 for levoglucosan (LG), mannosan (MNS), and galactosan (GA), respectively, were reached in the winter season. Sugar alcohols were most pronounced during the summer, while the levels of monosaccharides contributed evenly through autumn and summer. The levels of PAHs were higher during winter and lowest during the summer season. Their concentrations in PM10 were at least one order of magnitude smaller compared to carbohydrate concentrations. The highest average mass concentration was observed for benzo(b) fluoranthene (BbF) in spring (0.126 f 0.068 ng m-3), pyrene (Pyr) in summer (0.038 f 0.013 ng m- 3 ), benzo (ghi)perylene (BghiP) in autumn (0.153 f 0.107 ng m- 3 ) and BbF in winter (0.283 f 0.259 ng m-3). The annual average mass concentration of BaP was 0.086 f 0.1028 ng m- 3 , which is lower than the European Union (EU) directive target value of 1 ng m- 3 . To determine the sources of organic compounds in airborne particles, different multi-statistical techniques were used; Spearman correlation, factor analysis, principal Component Analysis (PCA), as well as diagnostic ratio method, revealing the seasonal dynamics of various sources. The reason for these changes can be found in different human and nature activities in the rural background area. Data analyses indicated that in the spring season, there were mixed sources, including traffic, emissions from domestic heating or the combustion of grass/agricultural waste, and biogenic aerosols. In the summer, the dominant sources were biogenic emissions related to fungi spores and degraded material, biomass burning, and traffic. Vehicular emissions and biogenic sources were likely dominant at Plitvice Lakes during autumn, whereas domestic heating was the dominant source in the studied area during winter.					; Sopčić, Suzana/KLD-7763-2024	Jakovljevic, Ivana/0000-0002-0556-0088; 													1352-2310	1873-2844				MAR 5	2025	345								121050	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121050		JAN 2025											WOS:001403440800001
J	MAGADZA, CHD				MAGADZA, CHD			COMPARATIVE SEASONAL ESTIMATES OF PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY IN THE WAIKATO RIVER LAKES DURING SUMMER, AUTUMN, AND WINTER	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Primary productivity measurements were made at 1 m and 10 m depths in 6 of the 8 impoundments on the Waikato River. At 1 m depth during the summer, C productivity varied from 17.68 mg/m3 per h in oligotrophic Lake Aratiatia to 509.4 mg/m3 per h in eutrophic Lake Karapiro; intervening lakes had intermediate values. The highest values were found in the autumn at 1 m depth (22.3-970.9 mg/m3 per h). The winter 1-m values were lower than the summer and autumn values by 1 order of magnitude. At 10 m depth, productivity appeared to be light-limited and was comparable in all the lakes in the summer and autumn assays, decreasing by 1 order of magnitude in the winter. N may have limited productivity during the relatively dry summer. Regression analysis indicated that N and light penetration were the principal factors affecting productivity. Dark-bottle counts indicated dark C-fixation processes which could have been biochemically different in the eutrophic and oligotrophic waters.

We took sediment samples in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. The total arsenic (As), total mercury (Hg) and other parameters (temperature, pH, EC, particle size of sediments and organic matter in sediments) were measured. Based on the temporal variations, seasonal comparisons and factor analysis, the following conclusions were obtained. (1) The seasonal characteristics of Hg and As were: summer > spring > autumn > winter, and spring > summer > autumn > winter. (2) The higher concentration of Hg and As during summer was considered to be caused by the higher organic matter and humus content, which made heavy metals strongly adsorbed and complexed, and changes in the organic matter content would enhance the binding state of the less active organic matter then deposit in sediment. (3) The speciation of mercury and arsenic was also the reason, in summer, the Hg-0 in the atmosphere was oxidized to Hg2+, entering into water through rainwater washing and dry deposition; then, soluble Hg2+ was quickly adsorbed and fixed in sediment, a series of transformations reduces its activity. The As3+ would be oxidized to As5+ which would form precipitated. Therefore, the content of Hg and As, environmental risk and potential ecological risk of mercury in sediments were higher in summer.					shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024														1606-9749	1607-0798				DEC	2020	20	8					3779	3790		10.2166/ws.2020.122	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2020.122													WOS:000617140800070

This study characterized the temporal dynamics and vertical profile of bacterial communities in oxic and anoxic zones of the lake across all four seasons: October (autumn), March (winter), May (spring), and August (summer). Bacterial richness and diversity in the anoxic zone varied widely between time points.Proteobacteriawas the dominant bacterial phylum throughout the oxic and anoxic zones across all four seasons.Alphaproteobacteria(Loktanella) andGammaproteobacteria(Aliidiomarina) exhibited the highest abundance in the oxic and anoxic zone, respectively. Furthermore, there was a successional shift in sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in the anoxic zone across the seasons. The most dominant SRB,Desulfonatronovibriosp., is likely one of the main producers of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and typically accumulates the most H2S in winter. The representative anoxygenic phototrophic bacterial group in Lake Uchum was purple sulfur bacteria (PSB). PSB were dominant (60.76%) in summer, but only had 0.2-1.5% relative abundance from autumn to spring. Multivariate analysis revealed that the abundance of these SRB and PSB correlated to the concentration of H2S in Lake Uchum. Taken together, this study provides insights into the relationships between changes in bacterial community and environmental features in Lake Uchum.

Controls and rates of evaporation from a water supply reservoir in the Colorado Front Range	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Evaporation can be a major component of a reservoir's water balance in arid, populated regions such as the western United States, yet accurate measurements are scarce. In an effort to fill this observation gap, direct measurements of evaporation from Standley Lake, a water supply reservoir in the Colorado Front Range, were collected via the eddy covariance method from March 1, 2020 through February 28, 2021. Evaporation followed a seasonal pattern, with the spring, summer, and early fall experiencing daily cycles that peaked just after midday, with measurable evaporation occurring each day for approximately 4-6 h. In the late fall and winter, the daily cycles decayed and episodic enhancements in evaporation were common, most often lasting between 18 and 36 h, some longer. Evaporation peaked in June, aligning with peak net radiation, and summertime evaporation was predominantly driven by diurnal variations in wind speed and the vapor pressure gradient. Interestingly, fall and winter saw multiple periods of negative (downward) sensible heat transfer which helped drive wintertime evaporation. The study period evaporation totaled 1377 mm, with 35 % of that occurring in summer, 27 % in fall, 21 % in spring, and 17 % in winter. This study shows that evaporation is a significant part of the energy balance of Standley Lake, and with continued observations, enables a better understanding of the impacts a changing climate and increased water demands have on water resources.

J	Wang, RX; Yang, XJ				Wang, Rong Xing; Yang, Xiao Jun			Seasonal pattern of waterbird communities at Lake Dianchi, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, south-west China	FORKTAIL												Habitat use and requirements of waterbird assemblages are often spatiotemporally variable. Conservation management needs to be planned to consider seasonally- occurring waterbird communities. The Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau is an important wintering region for waterbirds in China. It is unclear how wetlands on the plateau are consistently utilised as habitat by waterbirds across different seasons. We conducted three surveys per month over two years from March 2013 to February 2015 at Lake Dianchi, the largest lake on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, to determine multi-year waterbird species composition, annual similarity in species composition, and migratory consistency of species to better inform waterbird conservation. We detected approximately 60,000 individuals of 93 waterbird species at Dianchi. Annual species richness exhibited three peaks representing spring, autumn and winter migratory seasons. Year-on-year similarity in species composition was high for different groups, especially residents and summer visitors. The annual variation in waterbirds abundance exhibited a single peak in winter because of the high abundance of Anatidae and Laridae. Charadriiformes, such as shorebirds and plovers, had relatively low numbers of individuals, but exhibited high (R = 0.95, P < 0.01) to modest (R = 0.57, P < 0.01) migration consistency during the northward (spring) and southward (autumn) migrations. We highlight the importance of Dianchi for waterbird conservation. We suggest that waterbird conservation activities such as monitoring schemes should consider seasonal variation, especially for waders during the migratory seasons.

J	Anh, ND; Phuoc, VLH				Anh, Nguyen Duc; Phuoc, Vo Luong Hong			Forecasting and Assessing Water Demand and Rice Production in An Giang Province in 2024 by Using the CROPWAT and ORYZA Models	IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING												In early 2024, the Mekong Delta in Vietnam faced significant saltwater intrusion, exceeding average levels. Between February and March, the region experienced three periods of increased saltwater intrusion, primarily driven by the El Ni & ntilde;o phenomenon, which resulted in a striking lack of rainfall (60%-95% below normal levels). Extended sunny days led to considerable evaporation from fields, canals, rivers, and lakes. Concurrently, reduced upstream water flow into the Delta and heightened spring tide levels pushed saltwater deeper into rice fields, severely impacting local livelihoods and agriculture. To address this issue, the study aims to predict evapotranspiration and water demand using the CROPWAT 8.0 model in combination with simulating the growth and development of rice crops in An Giang province by utilizing the ORYZA model. This research will focus on the three main rice growing seasons: Winter-Spring, Summer-Autumn, and Autumn-Winter, utilizing a rice variety with a growth duration of 95-100 days. Forecasts for 2024 will rely on drought data from 2019, projecting continuous high temperatures (0.5 degrees C above 2019 levels) and no rainfall from January to May in 2024. It can be seen that agricultural activities in 2024, particularly during the Summer-Autumn season, could face severe consequences. (c) 2025 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

However, partitioning methane emissions between diffusion and ebullition pathways remains insufficiently investigated. Here, we developed data-driven models to separately quantify diffusive and ebullitive methane fluxes and characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of methane dynamics from rivers within the Yangtze River Basin, China. Annual methane emissions emitted from rivers across the Yangtze River Basin were estimated at 0.827 (0.751-0.903) teragrams, with ebullition dominating total emissions (accounting for 86%). Seasonal methane emissions exhibited a pattern of being higher in summer and lower in winter, while dissolved methane concentrations were higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. Urban rivers exhibited significantly higher methane concentrations, diffusive fluxes, and ebullitive fluxes than natural rivers. This study provides valuable insights for refining methane prediction models and highlights the critical contribution of ebullition to methane emissions from large-scale river systems.

J	Ni, BB; Liu, XM; Wu, YF; Jiang, M; Zou, YC				Ni, Bingbo; Liu, Xuemei; Wu, Yanfeng; Jiang, Ming; Zou, Yuanchun			A comprehensive water quality assessment for a typical river-lake watershed in Northeast China: implications for the water management of boundary lake	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Seasonal freezing and a mismatch between river and lake water quality targets have limited the accurate evaluation of water quality in the northern river-lake system. The water quality of the boundary lake poses a threat to aquatic ecological security and may also affect regional geopolitical stability. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive water quality evaluation system to effectively manage the water health of boundary lakes. In this study, we aimed to develop a new comprehensive water quality index model to analyze the water quality status and identify the underlying driving mechanisms within the Muling-Xingkai watershed, thereby proposing effective water management strategies. The XGBoost model and the aggregation function of eight sub-indicators were employed to identify the primary control indicators across various seasons. These methods reduced data redundancy and enhanced the sensitivity of the comprehensive water quality index (WQI) model. The weighted harmonic mean model (R-2 = 0.95, RMSE = 7.1 for summer-autumn; R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 10.2 for winter-spring) and unweighted Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment model (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 4.2 for summer-autumn; R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 4.8 for winter-spring) were identified as the optimal functions for water quality assessment. Based on the WQI assessment of 480 water samples collected during 2022-2023, 60 % to 70 % of the monitoring stations achieved a good water quality status (WQI score > 80) in the Muling-Xingkai watershed. The water quality status within the watershed, as assessed by the WQI model, followed the order: river < reservoir < Xingkai Lake < Xiaoxingkai Lake. In addition, our systematic approach efficiently identified key water quality indicators from 11 types of indicators, including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and water temperature (Tw) during the summer-autumn period, and TN and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the winter-spring period. Based on structural equation modeling (SEM), human activities (irrigated area, fertilizer application rate) and natural factors (air temperature, precipitation, and flow) were identified as the primary driving forces behind water quality deterioration in the Muling-Xingkai watershed during the summer-autumn and winter-spring seasons, respectively. To safeguard the ecological health of Xingkai Lake, it is imperative to reduce nitrogen inputs from the Muling River and mitigate phosphorus release from lake sediments in response to climate warming and the expansion of irrigation districts.

Eighteen sampled sites were selected and overlying water was sampled from 2013 to 2014 to study the seasonal and spatial variation of nitrogen in overlying water of Jinshan Lake. Results showed that physicochemical characteristics of temperature, pH, and DO showed high seasonal variation, whereas they had no significant spatial differences in the 18 sampling points (P > 0.05) in overlying water of Jinshan Lake. Nitrogen concentrations showed strong seasonal variation trends. The ranked order of TN was as follows: spring > summer > autumn > winter; the order of NH4+-N was as follows: spring > autumn > summer > winter, whereas NO3--N concentrations revealed an inverse seasonal pattern, with maxima occurring in winter and minimal values occurring in spring. Nitrogen concentrations had dramatic spatial changes in 18 sampling points of Jinshan Lake. Physicochemical parameter difference, domestic wastes pollution, and rainfall runoff source may have led to seasonal and spatial fluctuation variations of nitrogen in overlying water of Jinshan Lake, China.

Seasonal variation in activity and nearshore habitat use of Lake Trout in a subarctic lake	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												BackgroundIn lake ecosystems, predatory fish can move and forage across both nearshore and offshore habitats. This coupling of sub-habitats, which is important in stabilizing lake food webs, has largely been assessed from a dietary perspective and has not included movement data. As such, empirical estimates of the seasonal dynamics of these coupling movements by fish are rarely quantified, especially for northern lakes. Here we collect fine-scale fish movement data on Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a predatory cold-water fish known to link nearshore and offshore habitats, to test for seasonal drivers of activity, habitat use and diet in a subarctic lake.MethodsWe used an acoustic telemetry positioning array to track the depth and spatial movements of 43 Lake Trout in a subarctic lake over two years. From these data we estimated seasonal 50% home ranges, movements rates, tail beat activity, depth use, and nearshore habitat use. Additionally, we examined stomach contents to quantify seasonal diet. Data from water temperature and light loggers were used to monitor abiotic lake conditions and compare to telemetry data.ResultsLake Trout showed repeatable seasonal patterns of nearshore habitat use that peaked each spring and fall, were lower throughout the long winter, and least in summer when this habitat was above preferred temperatures. Stomach content data showed that Lake Trout acquired the most nearshore prey during the brief spring season, followed by fall, and winter, supporting telemetry results. Activity rates were highest in spring when feeding on invertebrates and least in summer when foraging offshore, presumably on large-bodied prey fish. High rates of nearshore activity in fall were associated with spawning. Nearshore habitat use was widespread and not localized to specific regions of the lake, although there was high overlap of winter nearshore core areas between years.ConclusionsWe provide empirical demonstrations of the seasonal extent to which a mobile top predator links nearshore and offshore habitats in a subarctic lake. Our findings suggest that the nearshore is an important foraging area for Lake Trout for much of the year, and the role of this zone for feeding should be considered in addition to its traditional importance as spawning habitat.																			2051-3933					AUG 31	2023	11	1							54	10.1186/s40462-023-00417-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40462-023-00417-x								37653451					WOS:001056182100001

However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the interference with some envi-ronmental dynamics, such as the leaf litter decomposition, which represents a key process in freshwater eco-systems. The work presented herein analyzed the leaf litter decomposition in a lotic ecosystem, in relation to water physicochemical parameters, macrobenthic invertebrate functional feeding guilds (FFG) and, as a novelty, the microplastics as additional factor. Physicochemical features were monitored every 15 days for one year. Phragmites australis decomposition rates were investigated during four seasons (summer, autumn, winter, and spring) using the leaf bag technique. Microplastic items were also collected within the leaf bags (used as retaining tool) and within macrobenthic invertebrate colonizers. Shredders were the most contaminated FFG in summer and autumn, while scrapers showed high microplastics levels in autumn and winter. Decomposition rates significantly differed among seasons (0.007 < k < 0.022) and water temperature was the main driver of the decomposition dynamics (relative importance = 70.3 %), positively affecting the decay rates, followed by pH (9.7 %), which showed a negative contribution. Microplastics showed a negative effect (3.1 %), with a relative importance similar and opposite to that observed for the shredders (3.9 %), which value was similar to those recorded for scarpers (2.7 %). This study represents a field investigation regarding the microplastic effects on the organic matter decomposition rates in freshwater environments carried out directly on field. Our results provide new insights about the microplastic interference on environmental dynamics and could represent a starting point for further studies.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS OF WATER QUALITY AND WATER LEVEL CHANGES IN POYANG LAKE BASED ON 5 CONSECUTIVE YEARS' MONITORING	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Quarterly water quality monitoring data from 15 monitoring sites in Poyang Lake and the water level data from the Xingzi monitoring station in Poyang Lake from 2012 to 2016 were analyzed to determine (1) how the water quality changed both spatially and temporally and (2) how the changes of the water quality and eutrophication were related to variations in the water level. The results indicated that there were seasonal and interannual variations in the water quality of Poyang Lake. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and Total Nitrogen (TN) reached maximum and minimum values in winter and summer, respectively. The maximum and minimum concentrations of Total Phosphorus (TP) were found in spring and summer, respectively. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was slightly lower in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. Over the entire sampling period, the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), TP, and TN were highest in 2015. COD concentrations varied little interannually Chlorophyll a concentrations were relatively uniform and did not show obvious seasonal variation. There was little spatial variation in the NH4-N concentrations in spring and summer, but there was considerable variation between sites in autumn and winter; COD varied considerably between sites in spring and winter. COD and TP were not significantly correlated, but NH4-N, TN, and the degree of eutrophication were negatively correlated, with water level changes in Poyang Lake.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	5					11687	11699		10.15666/aeer/1705_1168711699	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1705_1168711699													WOS:000490563900095

The results showed that the highest zooplankton biomass was recorded in summer and the lowest in spring. Water depth, transparency (SD), electric conductivity, and total nitrogen were the highest in spring, while temperature and total phosphorus were the highest in summer. The values of pH and turbidity were the highest in autumn, while chloride ion and chlorophyll a were the highest in winter. During the spring period, Protozoa were positively correlated with conductivity, transparency (SD), and total nitrogen. While Rotifera demonstrated a strong correlation with turbidity, pH, temperature, and total phosphorus in summer and autumn seasons, and Cladocera were correlated with water depth. There were negative correlations of chlorophyll a and chlorine on Copepoda during the winter.

Determining the temporal and spatial distribution of suspended solid concentrations has important significance in lake water environmental management; this is particularly urgent for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. In this study, suspended solid concentration inversion models for Poyang Lake were created using a semi-empirical method with regression analysis between continuously measured suspended solid concentration data and multi-band moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer images for spring, summer, autumn, and winter from 2009 to 2012. The coefficient of determination (R-2) is from 0.6 to 0.9 and the average relative error for the accuracy verification was between 10 and 30%. The seasonal distributions of suspended solid concentrations in Poyang Lake from 2000 to 2013 were then obtained using optimal reversal models. The results showed that the seasonal variation in suspended solid concentrations had a "W" shape in which high spring and autumn and low summer and winter values. The suspended solid concentrations increased annually from 2000 to 2013 and were mainly distributed in the northern and central portions of the lake, with lower values along the shorelines. Further analysis indicated that the large difference in water level between the wet and dry seasons is an important factor in explaining these seasonal variations. Moreover, the suspended solid concentrations were poorly correlated with water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration but more highly correlated with the deferred chlorophyll-a concentration.

The Impact of Biophysical Processes on Sediment Transport in the Wax Lake Delta (Louisiana, USA)	WATER												Sediment transport in coastal regions is regulated by the interaction of river discharge, wind, waves, and tides, yet the role of vegetation in this interaction is not well understood. Here, we evaluated these variables using multiple acoustic and optical sensors deployed for 30-60 days in spring and summer/fall 2015 at upstream and downstream stations in Mike Island, a deltaic island within the Wax Lake Delta, LA, USA. During a flooding stage, semidiurnal and diurnal tidal impact was minimal on an adjacent river channel, but significant in Mike Island where vegetation biomass was low and wave influence was greater downstream. During summer/fall, a "vegetated channel" constricted the water flow, decreasing current speeds from similar to 13 cm/s upstream to nearly zero downstream. Synchrony between the upstream and downstream water levels in spring (R-2= 0.91) decreased in summer/fall (R-2= 0.84) due to dense vegetation, which also reduced the wave heights from 3-20 cm (spring) to nearly 0 cm (summer/fall). Spatial and temporal differences in total inorganic nitrogen and orthophosphate concentrations in the overlying and sediment porewater were evident as result of vegetation growth and expansion during summer/fall. This study provides key hourly/daily data and information needed to improve the parameterization of biophysical models in coastal wetland restoration projects.					; Rivera-Monroy, Victor/G-7329-2011; Xu, Kehui/D-5446-2009	Rivera-Monroy, Victor Hugo/0000-0003-2804-4139; Xu, Kehui/0000-0002-3696-6160														2073-4441				JUL	2020	12	7							2072	10.3390/w12072072	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12072072													WOS:000554147500001

The role of season and social grouping on habitat use by Mute Swans (Cygnus olor) in a lowland river catchment	BIRD STUDY												CapsuleThe Mute Swan, a large generalist herbivore, showed patterns of habitat use influenced by social grouping and season. Territorial swans showed strong preferences for river and lake habitat in all seasons, while the non-territorial birds known to cause grazing conflicts preferred river in summer-autumn and pasture in winter-spring. AimsTo quantify the habitat preferences across different seasons of two types of Mute Swan social group, territorial and non-territorial, and assess the implications for the grazing conflict between swans and valuable plant communities. MethodsRepeated surveys of the River Frome catchment, Dorset, UK, over a two-year period allowed us to record the numbers of swans in each habitat type. An electivity index was used to calculate habitat preference scores for territorial and non-territorial swans across different seasons. ResultsWe found strong seasonal switches in habitat use for both territorial and non-territorial swans, but preferences for some habitats differed between these social groupings. In particular, non-territorial swans preferred pasture in winter and spring, and river in summer and autumn, while territorial swans preferred river and lake habitats throughout the year. ConclusionThe Mute Swan, a large generalist herbivore that can cause grazing damage to river plant communities, showed patterns of habitat use influenced by social grouping and season. These seasonal patterns of habitat use suggest that the grazing conflict with the river plant community caused by flocks of non-territorial swans is currently limited to summer and autumn.

Until now, almost nothing was known about the Greylag Geese breeding on the eastern Mongolian Plateau, which we now know mostly winter in the Yangtze River floodplain. We applied GPS transmitters to 20 Greylag Geese in the Yangtze River floodplain and eastern Mongolia, providing complete tracks of their movements in summer, winter, spring and autumn (n = 6, 8, 8, 7). We overlaid these locations on GIS layers of habitat type and national-level protected areas, and modelled their habitat selection. Geese summered in Dauria Region, Huihe National Nature Reserve, and Wulagai Wetlands (from where 55% of GPS fixes were located in protected areas), wintered in Poyang Lake, Longgan Lake, and Anqing Lakes (43%), and staged around Bohai Bay, Xila Mulun River, and Wulagai Wetlands (spring, 48%; autumn, 45%). Geese mainly used natural ecosystems in summer (essentially grasslands and wetlands/water bodies), but in the other three seasons, used croplands between 17% (spring) and 46% (winter) of the time, with most of the rest of the time spent on wetlands/water bodies. Geese were frequently associated with wetlands and areas close to lakes/wetlands in all seasons, and cropland during winter and spring/autumn migration. These results suggest Greylag Geese in this biogeographical sub-population have increasingly shifted to feeding in croplands during the non-breeding season and enjoy the benefit of using protected areas throughout the year. We infer that these factors could have potentially contributed to elevated survival and reproductive success (relatively high among sampled flocks in recent years) which could explain the favourable conservation status of this population of Greylag Geese in recent years compared to other sympatric wintering goose and swan species.

We documented this anomalous spawning behavior and compared the characteristics of smallmouth bass nests built during the two distinct spawning seasons. Smallmouth bass built 463 nests (110.2 nests/km shoreline) as water temperature was rising toward 20 degrees C. During the summer spawning period, 24 nests (5.7 nests/km shoreline) were constructed between 11 August and 29 August as water temperature was falling. Nests built in summer were significantly farther from shore, in deeper water, farther from cover, larger in diameter, and built by larger males than in the spring.																			0270-5060					JUN	2010	25	2					169	177		10.1080/02705060.2010.9665066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9665066													WOS:000277983300002
J	Nicholls, JF; Toumi, R				Nicholls, James Farley; Toumi, Ralf			On the lake effects of the Caspian Sea	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The impact of the Caspian Sea on precipitation and circulation is investigated. The control regional climate model simulation accurately represents the spatial and temporal pattern of observed precipitation and the upper atmospheric jet. From a simulation without the Caspian, it can be deduced that it causes a year-round increase in evaporation and increases in precipitation in autumn and winter with little change in spring and summer. Over half of the over-lake precipitation is attributable to the lake effect. These findings are confirmed through coupled simulation with a three-dimensional lake model. The Caspian Sea's effect on surface air temperatures (an increase in winter and decrease in summer) causes an increase in cyclonicity in winter and anticyclonicity in spring and summer. These surface air temperature effects also penetrate higher up in the atmosphere, causing a perturbation of up to 25m in the geopotential height at 200 hPa, leading to an increase in the maximum speed of the subtropical jet over western Asia during summer of 6.5%. Anaccurate description of the Caspian Sea in general circulation models is thus important for both local and regional climates.																			0035-9009	1477-870X				APR	2014	140	681	B				1399	1408		10.1002/qj.2222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.2222													WOS:000337623500023

The phytoplankton of Bortepe Recai Kutan Dam Lake consisted of 20 taxa belonging to Bacillariophyta (12 taxa), Chlorophyta (1 taxa), Chrysophyta (1 taxon), Cyanobacteria (2 taxa), Dinozoa (2 taxa) and Euglenozoa (2 taxa). Members of Bacillariophyta was commonly observed in January and August whilst Chlorophyta grew well in September. Chrysophyta only occurred and recorded in high numbers in September. Cyanobacteria became dominant in spring, at the end of summer and also in autumn. However, Dinozoa was remarkably conspicuous in spring and fall as well as in winter in terms of prevalence. Excessive growth of Cyanobacteria, which is a characteristic aspect of mesotrophic lakes, was observed in lake in both April and August. Euglenozoa also occurred at the end of summer and early autumn. Phytoplankton composition was appeared to be affected mainly by temperature, phosphate and nitrate. Secchi disk depth, concentrations of plant nutrients (TN, TP), chlorophyll-a analyzed in the present study supported the view that the Bortepe Recai Kutan Dam Lake could be included in mesotrophic lake category.

J	Choi, JY; Kim, SK				Choi, Jong-Yun; Kim, Seong-Ki			The Use of Winter Water Temperature and Food Composition by the Copepod Cyclops vicinus (Uljanin, 1875) to Provide a Temporal Refuge from Fish Predation	BIOLOGY-BASEL												Simple Summary Predator avoidance mechanisms play a critical role in the survival and stable population growth of prey. Here, we describe a new defense strategy for Cyclops vicinus, which is vulnerable to fish predation. Long-term data (January 2014 to February 2019) showed that C. vicinus was abundant in winter when the foraging activity of fish was lower. This pattern was reversed in spring, summer, and autumn. C. vicinus is consumed frequently by fish because it has a body size larger than that of other cyclopoid copepods (Mescyclops leuckarti and Thermocyclop sp.). In this respect, winter formed a seasonal refuge when C. vicinus populations could grow efficiently. In addition, there was an abundant phytoplankton presence (Cyclotella sp. and Rhodomonas sp.) in winter. These species formed a food source that supported the population growth of C. vicinus. The evolution of the predator avoidance mechanisms of prey contributes significantly to the security of local biodiversity and the stability of the freshwater food web. Frequent predation induces various defense strategies in prey, including morphological changes or migration patterns in zooplankton. We hypothesized that the winter dominance of Cyclops vicinus in the Upo Wetlands, South Korea, is an evolved temporal defense mechanism to avoid fish predation. Long-term data (2014-2019) showed that fish consumed the most cyclopoid copepods from spring to autumn. Lepomis macrochirus preferentially consumed C. vicinus; thus, C. vicinus density was lower from spring to autumn. However, C. vicinus was abundant in winter when fish consumed fewer copepods. Nauplii density began to increase in late autumn (October-November), and their population growth was fueled through consumption of Cyclotella sp. and Rhodomonas sp. Culture experiments showed that Cyclotella sp. contributed more to the growth stage (copepodite or subadult) after nauplii than Rhodomonas sp. C. vicinus density was lower in the winters of 2013 and 2016 when the densities of these phytoplankton prey species were lower. In summary, although winter conditions were suitable for copepod survival and population growth, C. vicinus relied heavily on the diversity and species composition of its food sources. The winter dominance of C. vicinus could increase regional biodiversity and contribute significantly to the stability of the freshwater food web.

The results show that the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the lake fluctuate annually. They increase in autumn and winter with a peak value of 14.19 mg center dot L-1 in winter, and decrease in spring and summer with a trough value of 6.40 mg center dot L-1 in summer. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP) increase in summer, with their peak values in late summer and autumn, and decrease in winter and spring. Mean values of GPP, R and NEP are 1.75 +/- 0.06 (Mean +/- SE), 1.52 +/- 0.05, and 0.23 +/- 0.03 g O-2 m(-3)center dot d(-1), respectively. It is also found that water temperature and surface irradiance are the best predictors of GPP and R, while water temperature (wind speed) has a significantly positive (negative) relationship with NEP. The findings in this study suggest that Lake Taihu is a net autotrophic ecosystem, and water temperature and surface irradiance are the two important drivers of lake metabolism.

During the studied period, BP fluctuated from 1.9 to 138 mu g C L-1 d(-1). There were no significant correlations between BP and bacterial abundance in any season, suggesting a strong top-down regulation on BP throughout the year. On the other hand, BP was also related to bottom-up regulation factors such as water temperature, phosphorus, and primary production (PP) annually. During winter, BP was positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting that autochthonous substrates were relatively important for BP. Moreover, BP was positively correlated with heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, and copepods, suggesting higher availability of substrates for BP. In summer, although there was no significant correlation between BP and PP, rainfall amount showed significant negative correlations with both BP and PP, suggesting depressed PP from relatively lower solar irradiance coupled with unfavorable weather conditions that decreased the substrate supply for bacteria. These results suggest that temporal variation of BP was regulated not by allochthonous, but by autochthonous substrates during both the highest (summer) and lowest (winter) productive seasons, even in a shallow, eutrophic lake. PP in autumn was approximately half that of spring due to lower solar irradiance, although water temperatures during both seasons were similar and nutrient concentrations during autumn were higher. On the other hand, BP in autumn was comparable with that in spring, and the bacterial carbon demand (= BP + bacterial respiration; 1.12 +/- 0.79 g C m(-2) d(-1)) was comparable to PP (1.16 +/- 0.53 g C m(-2) d(-1)), suggesting the relative importance of higher allochthonous substrates relative to other seasons.					; 洋太, 菅井/LBA-5859-2024; Tsuchiya, Kenji/T-1541-2019; FUKUDA, Hideki/KVB-9846-2024; Tomioka, Naotaka/B-1888-2011	SUGAI, Youta/0000-0003-1982-7692; Kuwahara, Victor S./0000-0003-4171-3894; Toda, Tatsuki/0000-0001-9279-030X; Tsuchiya, Kenji/0000-0002-6644-1701													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2019	64	6					2441	2454		10.1002/lno.11196	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11196													WOS:000495506200009

Assessment the Physico-Chemical Characteristics of Sediment in Bardawil Lagoon, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												In many coastal, estuarine, and freshwater settings across the world, contaminated sediment is a serious environmental issue. Bardawil Lagoon in North Sinai, Egypt, is a remarkable Mediterranean semi-enclosed coastal water feature that has been designated a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. The current study aims to characterize the physical and chemical properties of the Bardawil Lagoon sediments. In surface sediments taken from the Bardawil Lagoon at 12 stations over the course of four seasons in 2021, chemical variables (pH, EC, CaCO3, OM, cations, and anions), porosity, water holding-capacity and grain size analyses have all been measured. In the present result, the soil classes are loamy sand (sand > silt > clay). Autumn and winter have the greatest mean values of WHC and porosity, which are 40.42 and 33.57%, respectively. In this study, the soil was slightly alkaline to alkaline at all sites, and the greatest EC value of 10.78 mS/cm was recorded in the autumn season. Additionally, most chemical variables (CaCO3, OM, HCO3-, Cl-, SO4-2, Na+, K+, Ca+2, Mg+2) had their maximum values during the autumn season, while the summer season had their lowest values. The sediment variables follow the seasonal order: autumn > spring > winter > summer. The aquatic environment depends heavily on bottom sediments, which act as significant pollutant sinks. However, a yearly investigation of the physical and chemical characteristics is necessary to determine the best management strategy for bottom sediments.

Spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton communities in a Great Lakes drowned river-mouth lake (Mona Lake, USA)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Drowned-river mouth lakes, transitional zones between a lake and an inflowing river, have unique physical and hydrological dynamics. However, our knowledge about these ecosystems and their phytoplankton communities is limited by data availability, especially how well they conform to conventional phytoplankton models, such as the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG). We sampled Mona Lake, MI, on a monthly basis between May 2002 and August 2003 to: i) describe phytoplankton community structure (species composition and functional groups) in three hydrologic zones (Great Lake-influenced, transitional, and lotic-influenced) and at four temporal scales (spring, summer, fall, and winter); and ii) assess whether the phytoplankton dynamics in Mona Lake can be explained by PEG. Distinct patterns in Mona Lake phytoplankton communities and functional groups were not evident among the three hydrologic zones, which can be explained, at least in part, by the horizontally well-mixed waters in this system. However, there was a strong seasonal change in phytoplankton composition and functional groups, with summer dominance by large filamentous cyanobacteria with aerotopes, nitrogen-fixing Nostocaleans, and diatoms. In general, seasonal changes were related to increasing levels of dissolved oxygen and pH in spring, total phosphorus and temperature in summer, and ammonia in fall. Phytoplankton dynamics in Mona Lake were partially explained by the PEG model; our observations revealed different fall (cyanobacteria and chlorophytes) and winter (chlorophytes and dinoflagellates) communities than predicted. Temporal influence resulted in distinct changes in phytoplankton dynamics, whereas the hydrologic influence tended to homogenize phytoplankton community structure in this drowned river-mouth lake. This seasonal change conformed relatively well to the PEG model, which might have predictive applications in the management (e.g., control of algal blooms) of the lake.

The Contribution of Lake-Effect Snow to Annual Snowfall Totals in the Vicinity of Lakes Erie, Michigan, and Ontario	FRONTIERS IN WATER												In the Great Lakes region, total cold-season snowfall consists of contributions from both lake-effect systems (LES) and non-LES snow events. To enhance understanding of the regional hydroclimatology, this research examined these separate contributions with a focus on the cold seasons (October-March) of 2009/2010, a time period with the number of LES days substantially less than the mean, and 2012/2013, a time period with the number of LES days notably greater than the mean, for the regions surrounding Lakes Erie, Michigan, and Ontario. In general, LES snowfall exhibited a maximum contribution in near-shoreline areas surrounding each lake while non-LES snowfall tended to provide a more widespread distribution throughout the entire study regions with maxima often located in regions of elevated terrain. The percent contribution for LES snowfall to the seasonal snowfall varied spatially near each lake with localized maxima and ranged in magnitudes from 10% to over 70%. Although total LES snowfall amounts tended to be greater during the cold season with the larger number of LES days, the percent of LES snowfall contributing to the total cold-season snowfall was not directly dependent on the number of LES days. The LES snowfall contributions to seasonal totals were found to be generally larger for Lakes Erie and Ontario during the cold season with a greater number of LES days; however, LES contributions were similar or smaller for areas in the vicinity of Lake Michigan during the cold season with a smaller number of LES days.																				2624-9375				MAR 4	2022	4								782910	10.3389/frwa.2022.782910	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2022.782910													WOS:000778354300001

Population dynamics and biology of an invasive population of mosquitofish Gambusia affinis in a temperate estuarine lake system	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												This study investigates the distribution, relative abundance, population growth and biology of the alien invasive fish Gambusia affinis in the Wilderness Lakes System, a coastal lake system in the warm-temperate region of South Africa. Fish were collected throughout the system during four seasonal sampling trips in spring (October 2010), summer (February 2011), autumn (May 2011) and winter (July 2011). Gambusia affinis were widespread and abundant in all habitats from the freshwater reaches of the inflowing Touw River to the more saline lakes and estuary. Sex ratio was generally female dominated and mean length at maturity was 14.7 mm standard length (SL) for males and 20.3 mm SL for females. Reproduction was strongly seasonal with reproductively active fish sampled in spring and summer but not in autumn and winter. Relative abundance also varied seasonally, with populations following typical boom and bust' population dynamics. By winter, the population in all habitats was lower with mortality rates as high as 85%. The stronghold of the population appears to be in the channels between the lakes, where relative abundance was more consistent and winter mortality rates were lower. The survivors, which are primarily females, then reconstitute the population in the spring and summer months.					; James, Nicola/HTP-6378-2023	Weyl, Olaf/0000-0002-8935-3296; Sloterdijk, Hans/0000-0002-8243-2100; James, Nicola/0000-0002-9472-5314; 													1562-7020	2224-073X					2015	50	1					31	40		10.1080/15627020.2015.1021169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2015.1021169													WOS:000352623200007

The TopNet hydrological model was used to simulate impacts in the Upper Waitaki Basin of the South Island for the 1990s, 2040s and 2090s. An average emissions scenario and results from 12 global circulation models were used as input. Indicators of hydrological alteration and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate flow differences. Modelled total inflows increase over time for all lakes, with most increases in winter/early spring and small decreases in summer/autumn. High flows generally increase, while low flows decrease. Although these changes may benefit hydropower and floodplain ecology, they may increase flood risk in winter and spring and drought risk in summer and autumn, causing additional challenges managing hydropower operations.

The first small lake in this region formed in 1978 and a second one, which still exists, formed in 1991. Measurements were made in the period 2010 2012, with a Hach Lange multi-parameter instrument to identify the physico-chemical parameters of the water. Two basic ecological parameters were assessed, including temperature, pH and LDO (luminiscent disolved oxygen). Cuejdel Lake acts as a dimictic reservoir with direct thermal stratification during the summer, spring and autumn, and reverse stratification during the winter. In the winter, the water freezes with an ice cover of between 25 and 90 cm thick. At the lowest depths, the temperature is constant all year (5 C). The surface water is influenced by the air temperature. In the summer, the water is between 2 and 3 C cooler than the surrounding air. The water is slightly alkaline with values that oscillate around 8. The alkalinity of the water is caused by the elements that are transported in the water as the hydrographic basin drains. The water in the upper section of the lake is very rich in oxygen. However, below 10-11 m, dissolved oxygen is not present. The temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen are correlated during the spring, summer and autumn, but not during the winter (this phenomena is induced by the ice cover). In addition, the relationships between temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen are occasionally disrupted by local factors, such as high depths, high input values, and the existence of vortex currents. The linear tendencies of these three indicators are interrupted by the presence of two thresholds, one at 2 m and one between 4 and 5 m.					; Stoleriu, Cristian/O-6224-2014; Mihu-Pintilie, Alin/I-5906-2017	Stoleriu, Cristian Constantin/0000-0001-8852-2724; Mihu-Pintilie, Alin/0000-0002-1686-9558													1842-4090	1844-489X				MAY	2014	9	2					113	123																WOS:000334903200011

INVESTIGATION AND PROTECTION STRATEGY OF PLANKTON IN THE HARBIN SECTION OF THE SONGHUA RIVER, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In order to study the structural characteristics and influencing factors of plankton communities in different seasons in the Harbin section of the Songhua River, China, we conducted a plankton sampling survey in 8 sections of the water from 2011 to 2021. During the research period, we identified a total of 101 species of phytoplankton, belonging to 7 phyla and 61 genera, of which Chlorella and Diatom phylum were mainly present in spring, summer and autumn. At the same time, a total of 30 species of zooplankton was identified in 4 categories, mainly protozoa and rotifers in spring, summer and autumn. In terms of seasons, we found that the number of species, abundance and biomass of plankton in summer was lower than that in spring and autumn; while in space, the species of plankton downstream are higher than that in the upstream, and there are significant differences between the center and shore of the Songhua River. Based on the water quality evaluation results of the Shannon-Wiener (H') and Pielou (J') biodiversity index, the water quality of the research area of the Harbin section of the Songhua River is slightly polluted. Generally speaking, in the past 11 years, the species change in the Harbin section of the Songhua River had been relatively stable, the abundance and biomass had shown a trend of rising first and then falling, and the water quality had gradually improved.

Previous studies hypothesized that the migration to deep waters was for hibernation. The findings of this study oppose this hypothesis. We showed that P. paucidens is physiologically active in deep waters during winter; that the carbon stable isotope ratio indicated that the species forages in winter and that there was a difference in food sources between summer and winter; that lipid content was highest in January; and that gene expression activity (as measured by the RNA/DNA ratio) remained constant throughout the year. Thus, P. paucidens individuals that migrate to the bottom are likely to forage in winter, but do not hibernate. Nutrients gained in winter were not reflected in individual growth but may have been allocated to gonadal growth and the production of gametes, suggesting that winter foraging by this species in deep sites contributes to obtain resources for reproductive investment. In addition, we found that both small individuals with no reproductive experience and relatively large females with reproductive experience overwintered, indicating that P. paucidens has a life-cycle that is longer than 1 yr in Lake Biwa.					; Takami, Yasuoki/T-7336-2019; Minamoto, Toshifumi/C-6453-2009; Wu, Qianqian/AIE-3397-2022	Takami, Yasuoki/0000-0002-6507-2115; Minamoto, Toshifumi/0000-0002-5379-1622; Wu, Qianqian/0000-0002-8402-4055													2150-8925					APR	2019	10	4							e02628	10.1002/ecs2.2628	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2628													WOS:000472716600003

The Aral Sea located in Central Asia, was once the fourth largest lake in the world, but gradually shrunk and lost more than 80% of its surface. As the Ara Sea dries up in last 60 years, the role of Aral Sea in regulating the regional climate dampens. However, how the Aral Sea regulates the regional climate and its mechanisms remains less understand. The climatic effect of the Aral Sea on regional climate is quantified by comparing two ideal simulations, with the Aral Sea included or excluded, using ALARO-SURFEX regional climate model under 4-km horizontal resolution. The model's performance in reproducing the 2-m temperature, precipitation and surface energy fluxes was evaluated firstly. The Aral Sea decreases (increases) the 2-m temperature in spring-summer (autumn-winter) over the Aral Sea and ambient land, which causes higher (lower) sea level pressure in spring-summer (autumn-winter) corresponding to enhanced the divergence (convergence) in spring-summer (autumn-winter). The lake-effect penetrates to the atmosphere, cools (warms) the daytime air temperature by 2.03 degrees C (0.07 degrees C) below (above) the height of 1.4-km during May to September but warming the nighttime air temperature by 0.42 degrees C below 0.6-km, leads to enhancing descent (ascent) motion in daytime (nighttime), which suppress (trigger) development of local convection in daytime (nighttime). The presence of Aral Sea increases specific humidity below 0.8-km in both daytime and nighttime. As a result, the annual precipitation, especially convective precipitation is increased by 7.08 mm and mainly occurs in nighttime-morning and open water period, but reduced precipitation occurs in 13:00-17:00 and ice frozen period. The presence of Aral Sea substantially reduces the sensible heat, enhances the latent heat, increases ground heat fluxes, but these effects depend season and diurnal variation. The temperature change induced by the Aral Sea is most contributed by the change of latent heat (ground heat) in open water period (ice frozen period), in diurnal timescale, the ground heat contributes most in both daytime and nighttime temperature change.

Acoustic fish biomass assessment in a deep Tunisian reservoir: effects of season and diel rhythm on survey results	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												To determine the best acoustic sampling period for obtaining fish biomass estimates of a Mediterranean deep reservoir in Tunisia, day and night surveys were performed in spring (April), summer (September), autumn (December) and winter (March). A Simrad EK60 echosounder, equipped with two 120 kHz split-beam transducers for simultaneous horizontal and vertical beaming, was used to sample the entire water column. Data collected in December were not usable, because fish merged with methane gas bubbles. However, fish abundance varied across the other seasons, with a peak in acoustic biomass during summer nighttime hours associated with high water temperatures. Across seasons, the fish occupied the entire water column and fish schools were rarely observed. The preferential timeframe (i.e. maximum fish detectability and low gas flux) for acoustic sampling was nighttime hours in summer and daytime hours during spring and winter. Our findings highlight the importance of collecting data across seasons and photoperiods when determining an acoustic sampling strategy.

J	Karlsson, J; Säwström, C				Karlsson, Jan; Sawstrom, Christin			Benthic algae support zooplankton growth during winter in a clear-water lake	OIKOS												We used stable carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) isotopes to assess the importance of benthic algae for the zooplankton individual growth in winter in a shallow, clear subarctic lake. The delta(13)C values of calanoid (Eudiaptomus graciloides) and cyclopoid (Cyclops scutifer) zooplankton in autumn suggest a food resource of pelagic origin during the ice-free period. The zooplankton delta(13)C values were high in spring compared to autumn. E. graciloides did not grow over winter and the change in delta(13)C was attributed to a decrease in lipid content during the winter. In contrast, the increase in delta(13)C values of C. scutifer over the winter was explained by their growth on organic carbon generated by benthic algae. The delta(15)N of the C. scutifer food resource during winter was low compared to delta(15)N of the benthic community, suggesting that organic matter generated by benthic algae was mainly channelled to zooplankton via (15)N-depleted heterotrophic bacteria. The results demonstrate that benthic algae can sustain zooplankton metabolic demands and growth during long winters, which, in turn, may promote zooplankton growth on pelagic resources during the summer. Such multi-chain omnivory challenges the view of zooplankton as mainly dependent on internal primary production and stresses the importance of benthic resources for the productivity of plankton food webs in shallow lakes.

FOOD CHEMISTRY												Goldfish (Carassius auratus L) is very diffuse in Trasimeno Lake, and show great adaptability and have become a dominant fish of the lake ecosystem. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seasonal effect on the fatty acid profile and nutritional characteristics of goldfish caught in Trasimeno Lake. Forty fillets per season were used to evaluate the respective proximate composition, fatty acid profile, nutritional indices and protein and lipid oxidative stability. Season significantly affected the chemical traits of the fillets. A lower level of SFA was observed during spring, while a higher proportion of MUFA was observed during the winter. PUFA exceeded 50% of the total fatty acids content during the autumn, spring and summer. The nutritional indices were very good in comparison to those observed in other livestock animals. Goldfish fillets are characterised by a high nutritional value and good oxidative stability; the best results of this study were obtained in autumn and spring fillets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shatwell, T; Thiery, W; Kirillin, G				Shatwell, Tom; Thiery, Wim; Kirillin, Georgiy			Future projections of temperature and mixing regime of European temperate lakes	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The physical response of lakes to climate warming is regionally variable and highly dependent on individual lake characteristics, making generalizations about their development difficult. To qualify the role of individual lake characteristics in their response to regionally homogeneous warming, we simulated temperature, ice cover, and mixing in four intensively studied German lakes of varying morphology and mixing regime with a one-dimensional lake model. We forced the model with an ensemble of 12 climate projections (RCP4.5) up to 2100. The lakes were projected to warm at 0.10-0.11 degrees C decade(-1), which is 75%-90% of the projected air temperature trend. In simulations, surface temperatures increased strongly in winter and spring, but little or not at all in summer and autumn. Mean bottom temperatures were projected to increase in all lakes, with steeper trends in winter and in shallower lakes. Modelled ice thaw and summer stratification advanced by 1.5-2.2 and 1.4-1.8 days decade(-1) respectively, whereas autumn turnover and winter freeze timing was less sensitive. The projected summer mixed-layer depth was unaffected by warming but sensitive to changes in water transparency. By midcentury, the frequency of ice and stratification-free winters was projected to increase by about 20%, making ice cover rare and shifting the two deeper dimictic lakes to a predominantly monomictic regime. The polymictic lake was unlikely to become dimictic by the end of the century. A sensitivity analysis predicted that decreasing transparency would dampen the effect of warming on mean temperature but amplify its effect on stratification. However, this interaction was only predicted to occur in clear lakes, and not in the study lakes at their historical transparency. Not only lake morphology, but also mixing regime determines how heat is stored and ultimately how lakes respond to climate warming. Seasonal differences in climate warming rates are thus important and require more attention.

To obtain more information on the correlations and the geochemical links that may exist between these forms on the one hand and between sampling stations and these forms on the other hand, we carried out a principal components analysis (PCA) and a factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) of the data collected on these phosphorus forms. The results of phosphorus extractions have shown that the sedimentary phosphorus is mainly in the inorganic forms (Fe (OOH)-P + CaCO3-P). These mineral forms represent nearly 88% on average of total phosphorus, with the predominance of the CaCO3-P fraction that represents almost 76%. However, organic forms (POSA + POR) represent only 12% of the total phosphorus. The thematic maps elaborated by the geographical information systems allow having more accurate distribution of phosphorus forms concentrations. These maps show that the different phosphorus forms are distributed in a homogeneous way at the retaining dam studied. These results raise the hypothesis of a similar behavior of each fraction concerning the physicochemical processes that take place in the environment. The principal components analysis shows that the (POR, Fe (OOH) -P) forms are highly correlated with each other (R=0.80), and that the CaCO3-P form is positively correlated with the total phosphorus (R=0.71). The factorial correspondence analysis allowed us to clearly identify three seasons (spring, autumn, and winter), with interpenetration of summer between spring and autumn.					; EL HMAIDI, Abdellah/AAH-1136-2020	EL HMAIDI, Abdellah/0000-0002-3311-9492; DEHBI, Ali/0000-0003-1283-4179; Abdallaoui, Abdelaziz/0000-0002-3778-7973													1866-7511	1866-7538				MAY	2019	12	9							302	10.1007/s12517-019-4460-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-019-4460-7													WOS:000466855000004
J	Schneider, T; Grosbois, G; Vincent, WF; Rautio, M				Schneider, Tobias; Grosbois, Guillaume; Vincent, Warwick F.; Rautio, Milla			Saving for the future: Pre-winter uptake of algal lipids supports copepod egg production in spring	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The freshwater copepod Leptodiaptomus minutus in boreal lakes has its main annual reproductive period at the end of winter. This follows months of ice cover and limited food production, yet the females transfer large quantities of algal-derived carotenoids (predominantly astaxanthin) and fatty acids (FAs) to their eggs at this time, thereby providing the offspring with antioxidant protection and energy reserves. We hypothesised that this winter transfer of carotenoid pigments and FAs is based on accumulated reserves that are reinvested into reproduction (i.e. capital breeding). This strategy would allow the animals to produce offspring in time for the nauplii to feed on the spring phytoplankton bloom, thus gaining a competitive advantage. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the seasonal production of precursor carotenoids and essential FAs by the phytoplankton, the amounts of these compounds required for egg production and the transfer rates from phytoplankton to copepod eggs. Pelagic primary production vastly outweighed the demand for copepod eggs during summer-autumn. However, the major peak of egg production in spring could not be sustained by the low phytoplankton productivity during winter, indicating reliance on previously accumulated reserves as hypothesised. High rates of lipid reserve accumulation in L.minutus in late autumn and early winter accounted for up to 128% (astaxanthin precursors) and 70% (FAs) of the daily production by the phytoplankton, further indicating the importance of pre-winter primary production for reserve building in this copepod. During winter, the sum of carotenoid pigments as well as the sum of essential FAs stocked in copepods exceeded the concentrations in the seston. Consequently, adult copepods act as a lipid storage pool linking the biosynthesis of carotenoids and FAs by primary producers in autumn to the production of copepod eggs at the end of winter.					; Grosbois, Guillaume/M-8097-2019; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Schneider, Tobias/0000-0002-4793-4762; Grosbois, Guillaume/0000-0002-1306-8528; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2017	62	6					1063	1072		10.1111/fwb.12925	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12925													WOS:000400571200009

Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured in gas samples that had been recovered from the gas space of floating chambers operated as closed systems. Sampling periods covered all seasons except winter. Scaled up to the whole lake area (320 km(2)), the diffusive emissions of spring, summer and autumn totalled to about 79,500 t CO(2)e, disregarding bubble emissions, winter emissions and plant-mediated emissions. The emission sum consisted of about 57,000 t CO2, 760 t CH4, and 12 t N2O. Approximately one-third of the methane and carbon dioxide emissions originated in the pelagic zone and two-thirds in the reed belt (without plant emissions) whereas nitrous oxide emissions were similar in these two zones. An estimate of ebullitive emissions resulted in additional 1,765 t CH4 that predominantly originated in or near the reed belt from spring to autumn.					; Kitzler, Barbara/ACM-1987-2022; Soja, Gerhard/A-9657-2008	Kitzler, Barbara/0000-0002-1617-9186; Soja, Anna-Maria/0000-0003-3672-6228; Soja, Gerhard/0000-0001-7391-4899													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2014	731	1					125	138		10.1007/s10750-013-1681-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1681-8													WOS:000334493700010

The length of summer stratified season has increased by 12 +/- 2 days since the early 1970s due to the increase in water temperature.

During July-August the daily temperature of the air and water surface were similar to 2-4 degrees C higher, the daily wind over the lake was similar to 80% weaker, and the evaporation from the lake was similar to 5% lower than the long-term July-August mean. In this study, we explore the impact of the regional and local synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions on the evaporation from the lake during exceptionally hot days in the mid-summer months (July-August). The factors that were found to be correlated with the lake evaporation are the temperatures at 850 hPa (negative) and 500 hPa (positive), the sea level pressure difference between Northern Egypt and Armenia (positive), and the height of the marine inversion (positive). Synoptic analysis indicates that two conditions are responsible for the reduction of the Mediterranean Sea Breeze (MSB) during exceptionally hot days, and consequently to the reduction of evaporation from the lake. First, the weakening of the permanent synoptic Etesian winds, which otherwise supports the inland penetration of the MSB; and second, the descent of the marine inversion to a height below the topographic ridge of the Galilee Mountains upwind of the study area, which blocks the Marine Sea Breeze from reaching Lake Kinneret.

Lake Superior summer water temperatures are increasing more rapidly than regional air temperatures: A positive ice-albedo feedback	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Lake Superior summer ( July - September) surface water temperatures have increased approximately 2.5 degrees C over the interval 1979 - 2006, equivalent to a rate of ( 11 +/- 6) x 10(-2) degrees C yr(-1), significantly in excess of regional atmospheric warming. This discrepancy is caused by declining winter ice cover, which is causing the onset of the positively stratified season to occur earlier at a rate of roughly a half day per year.

The results showed that: 1) from 2018 to 2019, the annual average TLI is 56.54, indicating that the reservoir is in a slightly eutrophic state, which is conducive to algae growth; 2) the water quality of Qingshan Reservoir has obvious temporal and spatial variability: the water environment quality commonly decreased in the order winter>spring>autumn>summer, and exit zone>buffer zone>entry zone; meanwhile, the algal biomass in summer and autumn was significantly higher than that in spring and winter, and most of the algae were concentrated in the surface water except in January and decreased with the increase of depth; And related to the water quality environment, the biomass of cyanobacteria and green algae in Qingshan Reservoir is relatively high in summer, while diatom is the dominant species in spring and winter. We come to the conclusion that targeting at region and time will be more effective for the treatment of reservoir eutrophication.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2023	32	3					2405	2416		10.15244/pjoes/158907	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/158907													WOS:000972727900037

SPECIES COMPOSITION AND QUANTITATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF LARVAE OF DRAGONFLIES (ODONATA) IN THE NEW ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE LAKE MEHMAN	ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (ESD 2019): 37TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - SOCIO ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT	International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development				37th International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development - Socio Economic Problems of Sustainable Development	FEB 14-15, 2019	Baku, AZERBAIJAN	Varazdin Dev & Entrepreneurship Agcy, Azerbaijan State Univ Econ, Univ N, Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Mohammed V Univ, Fac Law, Econ & Social Sciences Sale				The paper presents new data on species composition, number and distribution of the larvae of dragonflies (Odonata) in new environmental conditions of the different habitats of in the lake Mehman. Field works conducted in 2015 - 2017 in the lake Mehman resulted in the rearings of 25 species and forms of dragonfly larvae. Seven of these L. nympha, S. fusca, E. viridulum, pumilio, O. concellatum, L. depressa, L. quadrimaculata, Cordulia sp. are new to the lake. Species Lestes virens, and Lelegans, were found in winter, spring and autumn of 2015 and winter and autumn of 2017; C.scitulumin winter and autumn of 2015; C.hastulatum - winter, spring and autumn of 2017; E.fatimein winter and autumn of 2015 - 2017; in winter and spring . of 2015 - 2017. Species C. mercuriale, C. scitulum, L. virens, elegans, C. puella, E. najas, O. albistylum are observed in the lake in all seasons and are dominated by widespread. It should be noted that the decrease in the number of larvae of dragonflies in the summer, especially at depths of up to 0.5 m is due to their intensive consumption by fish and water birds and emergence of adult dragonflies which leave the lake. On the other hand, in summer period, the volume of oxygen in shallow water of the lake Mehman greatly reduced, and asa result of evaporation of water, the amount of salts in water is increased. In such circumstances, the probability of occurrence of freshwater organisms in the benthos is naturally decreased. The study of the distribution of larvae of dragonflies on specific habitats of the lake revealed their maximum development on plant and silty habitats, and the minimum - on black silty sand. Changes in biomass of benthic organisms as well as larvae of dragonflies, which developed very poor is analyzed. Poor development of dragonfly larvae in the lake Mehman characterized, on the one hand with their intensive consumption by fish and water birds and on the other hand - the steady worsening of the environmental conditions of the lake.																			1849-6903	1849-7535					2019							985	988																WOS:000471844300124

[USA]. The turbidity structure is primarily vertical in summer and under winter ice cover; during spring and fall mixing horizontal gradients dominate. Inflows from the large drainage area at the southern end of the lake show a Coriolis influence. Vertical mixing of this inflow correlates well with density. During most of the year turbidity seems to be associated principally with suspended inorganic material.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	3					510	517		10.4319/lo.1982.27.3.0510	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.3.0510													WOS:A1982NS48100012

Knowledge of how periphyton responds to key drivers such as climate change and nutrient enrichment is, therefore, crucial. We conducted a series of mesocosm experiments over four seasons to elucidate the responses of periphyton communities to nutrient (low and high, TN-0.33 mg L-1 TP-7.1 mu g L-1 and TN-2.40 mg L-1 TP-165 mu g L-1, respectively), temperature (ambient, IPCC A2 scenario and A2 + 50%) and plant type (two submerged macrophytes with different morphological structural complexity: Potamogeton crispus and Elodea canadensis, and their corresponding plastic imitations with similar size and structure). We found a noticeable seasonality in the abundance and composition of periphyton. In spring and summer, periphyton abundances were significantly higher in the turbid-high-nutrient state than in the clear-low-nutrient state, and in summer they were notably higher at ambient temperature than in climate scenario A2 and A2 + 50%. In contrast, periphyton abundances in autumn and winter were not influenced by nutrient and temperature, but they were notably higher on plants with a more complex morphological structure than simple ones. The genus composition of periphyton was significantly affected by nutrient-temperature interactions in all seasons and by plant type in winter. Moreover, periphyton functional composition exhibited noticeable seasonal change and responded strongly to nutrient enrichment and temperature rise in spring, summer, and autumn. Our results suggest that the effect of warming on periphyton abundance and composition in the different seasons varied with nutrient state and host plant type in these mesocosms, and similar results may likely be found under field conditions.

Linear-Circular Statistical Modeling of Lake Ice-Out Dates	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Over the past few decades, lake ice phenology in northern temperate lakes has exhibited increased interannual variability. The resulting increase in the incidence of unusually early spring lake ice-out dates has the potential to affect stability, health, and function of the lake ecosystems. Characterizing the dependency of spring lake ice-out date to winter and/or spring climate variables offers foreknowledge on the annual lake ice cover season, as the spring ice-out date is an integrated response to prevailing weather/climate conditions during winter and spring. Here a circular regression framework is presented where ice-out date regression models, conditioned on a suite of predictor winter and/or spring climate variables (i.e., degree days and snowfall), are developed for 12 Maine lakes to determine the relative import of winter and spring meteorological conditions on year-to-year variability of ice-out dates in Maine lakes. In the circular regression models, ice-out dates are expressed as points on a unit circle instead of real line, as it preserves the periodicity and order of time-of-day variables independent of the choice of reference point. Results show that (a) the magnitude and variance of seasonal spring temperatures explain more than half of the total variability in spring ice-out date for Maine lakes, (b) the modulating efficacy of spring snowfall on the timing of spring ice-out dates is the strongest in northern interior Maine lakes, (c) the role of winter degree days in determining the ice-out dates in Maine lakes is significant across all climate regions, and (d) the effect of winter snowfall on ice-out dates is significant in coastal Maine lakes. Diagnostics suggest that there are other climatic and nonclimatic variables that produce shifts in the lake ice-out dates.

J	Alcott, TI; Steenburgh, WJ; Laird, NF				Alcott, Trevor I.; Steenburgh, W. James; Laird, Neil F.			Great Salt Lake-Effect Precipitation: Observed Frequency, Characteristics, and Associated Environmental Factors	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												This climatology examines the environmental factors controlling the frequency, occurrence, and morphology of Great Salt Lake effect (GSLE) precipitation events using cool season (16 September-15 May) Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) imagery, radiosonde soundings, and MesoWest surface observations from 1997/98 to 2009/10. During this period, the frequency of GSLE events features considerable interannual variability that is more strongly correlated to large-scale circulation changes than lake-area variations. Events are most frequent in fall and spring, with a minimum in January when the climatological lake surface temperature is lowest. Although forecasters commonly use a 16 degrees C lake-700-hPa temperature difference (Delta T) as a threshold for GSLE occurrence, GSLE was found to occur in winter when Delta T was only 12.4 degrees C. Conversely. GSLE is associated with much higher values of Delta T in the fall and spring. Therefore, a seasonally varying threshold based on a quadratic fit to the monthly minimum Delta T values during GSLE events is more appropriate than a single threshold value. A probabilistic forecast method based on the difference between Delta T and this seasonally varying threshold, 850-700-hPa relative humidity, and 700-hPa wind direction offers substantial improvement over existing methods, although forecast skill is diminished by temperature and moisture errors in operational models. An important consideration for forecasting because of their higher precipitation rates, banded-features with a horizontal aspect ratio of 6:1 or greater-dominate only 20% of the time that GSLE is occurring, while widespread, nonbanded precipitation is much more common. Banded periods are associated with stronger low-level winds and a larger lake-land temperature difference.

Data and observations were made by trained citizen scientists and professional researchers. Our study shows that all monitored water bodies, with the exception of Qiandeng Lake and Fengjiang River, had elevated NO(3) over bar -N concentrations, which ranged from 0.10 to 6.83 mg/L and peaked in late winter and early spring and reached a minimum in summer and mid-autumn. Po43-P concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 025 mg/L and peaked during the winter, late-summer and late autumn. Turbidity values were highest at sites with agricultural activities, with maximums in the late winter and autumn, and the highest frequency (16% and 25%) of algae presence occurred in the spring and autumn. To better understand the characteristics and drivers of the algae occurrences, measurements of phytoplankton composition and physicochemical characteristics were conducted in three key seasons in the agricultural process, fallow, sowing and rainy season in 2016. Our focused study found that the occurrence of Bacillariophyta, Euglenophyta, Xanthophyta, Cryptophyta, Chrysophyta were positively correlated with dissolved oxygen and phosphorus concentrations, while Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta had positive correlations with turbidity, oxygen demand and nitrogen concentrations. Bacillariophyceae counted for the highest proportion of phytoplankton during the fallow season, comprising up to 60 +% of the phytoplankton among the sites. During the rainy season, Chlorophyceae species were the majority, comprising up to 90 +% of phytoplankton among the sampled sites. Our results pointed to the complexity of nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics in water bodies under multiple pressures, and to the value of using citizen scientists to determine contextual information to benefit more focused studies.

Seasonal Variation of Temperature, pH, and Dissolved Oxygen Concentration in Lake Rosu, Romania	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												Lake Rosu (Red Lake) in the Hasmas (Curmaturii) Mountains was created by the natural barrage of the Bicaz River, a tributary of the Bistrita River, in 1837. Measurements in 2009 were performed, using the Hach Lange multi-parameter meter, to determine physical and chemical parameters of water. Basic parameters for the analysis of the ecological conditions were assessed: temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH. Surface water temperature was 2-3 degrees C lower in summer and higher in winter (except during the period of ice cover) compared with spring and autumn data. At depths <7m, the temperature showed constant values of 4-6 degrees C with nearly the same values in autumn and spring. pH values lied between 7 and 8 at the surface as well as in depth. During the summer, pH values decreased from 8 to 7 in the depth. In spring and autumn, the pH values remained constant and identical. The value of dissolved oxygen was good throughout the year. The surface reached values of 10mgO(2)/L annually at depths >7-8m with a limit of 0mgO(2)/L. Lake Rosu becomes a mountain aquatorium which attracts many tourists. However, its degree of pollution is extremely low.

Abundance peaks occurred in early spring and summer/autumn, while ciliate numbers were low in late spring (clear-water phase) and winter. Prostomatida and Oligotrichida dominated in early spring. They responded immediately to the phytoplankton spring bloom, while Haptorida, Peritrichida, and large Scuticociliatida (Histiobalantium) were delayed by 1 to 2 weeks. The spring community broke down at the onset of the clear-water phase. Pelagohalteria viridis containing symbiontic algae appeared shortly after this event. A highly diverse community was recorded in summer/autumn. Peritrichida, small Oligotrichida, and large Scuticociliatida reached their maxima during this season. Small Scuticociliatida were rare throughout the year and contributed moderately to total ciliate numbers only during the cold season. The observed seasonal sequence of pelagic ciliates in Lake Constance is discussed in relation to simultaneously collected data on potential food organisms and grazers.					; Weisse, Thomas/HTQ-1404-2023	Weisse, Thomas/0000-0001-6103-6558; 													0095-3628	1432-184X					1991	21	2					119	138		10.1007/BF02539148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02539148								24194205					WOS:A1991FN75600003

Waders of Lake Cartma (The Systems of Coastal Lakes of the North Aral Sea, Kyzylorda, Kazakhstan)	HELIX												Up to the 1960's, the system of lakes in the delta of the Syr Darya River and the Large Aral Sea have been a unified system of connections for the biocenosis. Birds, nesting here, as well as migrating to Siberia from wintering in North Africa, South-West Asia, choose this territory as the area for the rest, breaks, replenishment of reserves. The rapid fall of the Aral Sea level, due to the water stress of influent rivers the Syr Darya and the AmuDarya resulted in a decrease in the water area of the single terminal basin, and deterioration of the environmental situation in the Aral Sea region. Lake systems of the Syr Darya delta in 2012 were included in the list of wetlands of universal importance, protected by the international Ramsar Convention. Lake Cartma, until the last regression of the Aral Sea, was a floodplain on the eastern part of the reservoir. The materials of bird counts of Lake Cartma are presented in the article for the spring-summer season of 2017. Specialized surveys of avifauna have been carried out by authors since 2014. The lake's avifauna is represented by species of limnophiles, which are characterized by seasonal residence during migration and nesting. Most of the limnophiles of Lake Cartmaare waders, represented by 18 species. Nesting species prevailbyseasonality; other species visit the lake during the spring-autumn migrations and summer migrations. The only species, listed in the Red Book of the Republic of Kazakhstan, is the sociable plover, transient bird, noted during the spring counts.																			2277-3495	2319-5592					2018	8	1					2254	2258		10.29042/2018-2254-2258	http://dx.doi.org/10.29042/2018-2254-2258													WOS:000427456200019

It was found that the phytoplankton of Karkamis Dam Lake consisted of 85 taxa belonging to Bacillariophyta (56 taxa), Chlorophyta (15 taxa), Chrysophyta (1 taxon), Cyanophyta (10 taxa), Dinophyta (2 taxa) and Euglenophyta (1 taxon). Members of Bacillariophyta and Chrysophyta increased well during spring, summer and also at the end of fall whilst Chlorophyta grew well only in summer and fall. Cyanophyta became dominant at the end of spring and in summer. However Dinophyta was remarkably conspicuous in winter as well as in spring and fall in terms of prevalence. Excessive reproduction of Cyanobacteria, which is a characteristic aspect of mesotrophic lakes, was observed in Karkamis Dam Lake in both May and July. Results of physical and chemical measurements and analysis indicated that the lake was mesotrophic based on PCA and Carlson trophic state index. Phytoplankton composition was found to be affected by environmental factors such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, phosphate and nitrate through the year. Using these data, a strong model was developed for sustainable management in Karkamis Dam Lake.

Nutritional status of Fuxian Lake was evaluated by means of biological evaluation method and TSIM. Results show that, there are totally 8 phylum 66 categories and 101 species of phytoplankton, green alga, diatom, and blue-green algae as major dominant species. With this year, seasonal changes happened in phytoplankton community, green alga and diatom as principals in spring, green alga and blue-green algae as principals in summer, green alga, diatom and blue-green algae as principals in autumn, green alga and blue-green alga as principals in winter. Results of redundancy analysis show that, the greatest influence water quality factor of phytoplankton community structure in Fuxian Lake is SRP concentration. Water quality factors in spring include DO and SRP concentration, TN and SRP concentration in summer, SRP concentration and pH in autumn and winter. Results of eutrophication evaluation show that, evaluation results of biological evaluation method and TSIM are basically the same but there still exist differences. It can be seen by combining with two methods that Fuxian Lake now is still in oligotrophic stage but it has characteristics of poor medium nutritional type in transition stage.					, 吴老师/AAW-9978-2020																978-1-5386-1227-9				2017							302	306		10.1109/ICRIS.2017.83	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICRIS.2017.83													WOS:000417393800076

Lines of misovortices (diameters = 40-4,000 m) have recently been documented forming over Lake Ontario during long lake-axis-parallel (LLAP)-type lake-effect storms. Using National Weather Service Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) and Doppler on Wheels radar data from the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) project, lines of misovortices (also referred to as "misovortex lines" in this study) were investigated for intensive observation period (IOP)7 (7 January 2014) and IOP9 (9 January 2014). Results revealed that the misovortex lines formed on the southern or northern side of the west-to-east-oriented LLAP band, whichever was closest to a low-level boundary nearest the corresponding south or north shoreline (northern part in IOP7, southern part in IOP9). Examination of these two IOPs in the context of a total of 23 OWLeS IOPs, 11 of which had predominantly LLAP band morphology, showed that, in 4 of the 11 LLAP IOPs, horizontal shear zones/reflectivity bands formed in preferred regions over Lake Ontario and nearby land areas where low-level boundaries (e.g., land breeze fronts) have been noted to develop near shoreline irregularities. Horizontal shear zones were predominant in approximately half of the OWLeS LLAP IOPs and were associated with storms having a well-organized, solid banded reflectivity structure. Misovortices occurred when horizontal shear zones were prevalent, supporting the idea that horizontal shearing instability was important to their formation.					; Wurman, Joshua/IYT-3689-2023	, Matthew Lynne/0009-0000-5557-2506; Mulholland, Jake/0000-0002-8829-8301													2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 16	2022	127	17							e2022JD036855	10.1029/2022JD036855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036855													WOS:000853365000001

Cyprinus carpio in this dam is characterized by a single fractional spawning that begins in the spring and ends in the late summer. The distributions of the viscerosomatic and gonadosomatic indices decrease between the spring and summer seasons. These periods correspond to the spawning period and the biological break of this species. They progressively increase between autumn and winter when the biological activity of the species returns. The hepatosomatic index progressively decreases between the spring and the summer when the hepatic reserves are used for reproduction. The repletion index shows that the trophic activity of C.carpio is intense in the spring. The condition factor varies between 1.1 and 1.35. The evolution of the biological indices of both sexes is well stressed in well-defined periods according to the seasons. The values are weak for males and high for females. The redundancy analysis allows the characterization of the influence of the physico-chemical parameters of the dam water, especially the role of the nutritious elements, in the biological seasonal cycle of C.carpio.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				MAR	2018	56	1					63	72		10.1111/aje.12417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.12417													WOS:000424713200008

In 2010, 4500 two-summer-old individually-tagged common carp were stocked to test 36 release set-ups (three seasons x three lake areas x two methods x two size groups). Anglers reported the date, location and fish size (standard length and weight) on 787 recaptures within 2 years after the release. Recapture rate was highest in summer and lowest in autumn stockings, but was not affected by the stocking area, method or fish size. Regarding space, the widest dispersals were in recaptures in autumn and in the centre of the lake, but fish movement was not influenced by the stocking method or fish size. In conclusion, in summer the stocking quotas should be evenly distributed along the entire shoreline; early spring stockings may be optimized for transport costs and concentrated by each lake basin. Late autumn stockings should be avoided, and the capacity of effective wintering ponds should be developed. This study also provides a good framework for testing fisheries management alternatives in other intensively fished habitats.

In order to read the natural record, modern varve formation was studied on the basis of (1) remotely-sensed total suspended-matter (TSMrs) concentrations; (2) time-series of particle flux and water temperatures; and (3) turbidity, temperature, and oxygen profiles. TSMrs, validated by contemporaneous water-column sampling, shows great temporal and lateral variations (whitings and turbidity plumes). From 2006 to 2009, sequential sediment traps recorded high particle fluxes during spring and fall, medium fluxes during summer, and almost zero flux during winter. The mean total mass flux of 403 mg m(-2) day(-1) comprised 33% (seasonally up to 67%) calcium carbonate, 7% aquatic organic matter, 6% biogenic opal, and 54% detrital minerals. The CaCO3 fluxes are controlled by river discharge (precipitation and snowmelt) during spring, by high productivity during summer, and by river discharge (precipitation before snowfall starts) and mixing during fall. In November 2007, an anomalously high CaCO3 flux occurred as a result of a warm water surface supersaturated with calcite coinciding with an anomalous runoff event. The results demonstrate that the couplets of light and dark laminae in the short sediment cores are true varves representing spring-summer-fall and winter conditions, respectively. Consequently, varve formation can be linked to the seasonal climate pattern, providing a calibration that can be used to interpret the partially varved paleo-record of Lake Van and related environmental processes.

J	Ye, R; Shan, K; Gao, HL; Zhang, RB; Wang, S; Qian, X				Ye, Rui; Shan, Kun; Gao, Hailong; Zhang, Ruibin; Wang, Shuai; Qian, Xin			Long-term seasonal nutrient limiting patterns at Meiliang Bay in a large, shallow and subtropical Lake Taihu, China	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Lake Taihu has undergone severe eutrophication in the past three decades, and harmful cyanobacteria blooms occur nearly every year in Meiliang Bay at the north end of the lake. To elucidate the potential relationship between seasonal nutrient limitation and phytoplankton proliferation, a 20-year (1992-2011) time series of nutrient limitation in Meiliang Bay was analysed for deviations between trophic state index (TSI) parameters. Results showed that patterns of nutrient limitation in Meiliang Bay were distinctly seasonal, where phytoplankton growth was generally phosphorus (P)-limited in winter and spring, but nitrogen (N)-limited mainly occurred in summer and fall. This general pattern, however, shifted into N limitation across the four seasons during the mid-1990s because a rapid increase in industrialization led to a significant rise in the input of N and P from inflowing tributaries. The initial patterns were restored by environmental regulation in the end of 1990s, including the Zero Actions plan. Using routine monitoring data, a generalised additive model (GAM) with time and deviations between trophic state indexes for nitrogen and phosphorus (TSIN-TSIP) as explanatory variables was used to explore which nutrient was responsible for limitation of phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in different seasons. Surprisingly, the model revealed a weak N limitation (TSIN-TSIP=-10) corresponded to peak values of Chl-a in summer-autumn season, which is probably because the phytoplankton community is co-limited by N and P during the period. The shift of nutrition limitation during winter-spring would partially explain high values of Chl-a throughout 1996. This study suggests that seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation must be considered to develop effective management measures to control cyanobacterial blooms.					zhang, ruibin/JXL-6292-2024														1129-5767	1723-8633					2015	74	3					519	529		10.4081/jlimnol.2015.1147	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2015.1147													WOS:000363903200010

Brian; Fleming, Ian A.; Power, Michael			Winter movement activity patterns of anadromous Arctic charr in two Labrador lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Anadromous Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, feed in the marine environment for several months during the summer and migrate back to fresh water in late summer to spawn and/or overwinter. While overwintering, anadromous Arctic charr are generally believed to reduce or cease feeding, and they are poorly described in their winter movement activity. This study used telemetry data collected from two locations to describe overwintering movement activity, including interindividual variation. Movement activity declined markedly during the ice-covered period, suggesting opportunistic maintenance feeding was used as an energy conservation strategy. Fall and spring movement was correlated with daylight hours, and ice break-up had a significant effect on the timing of outmigration. Movement activity was negatively correlated with body length, with smaller individuals being more active than larger fish. Although general activity patterns were evident, there were significant differences among individuals, particularly during spring immediately prior to lake departure. Lake size and individual differences in metabolic rate may account for some of this variation.					; Fleming, Ian/I-7217-2012	Mulder, Ingeborg/0000-0003-1699-9077; Fleming, Ian/0000-0002-5541-824X; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2018	27	3					785	797		10.1111/eff.12392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12392													WOS:000434638800013
J	BERTRAM, PE				BERTRAM, PE			TOTAL PHOSPHORUS AND DISSOLVED-OXYGEN TRENDS IN THE CENTRAL BASIN OF LAKE ERIE, 1970-1991	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Five yearly estimators of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the central basin of Lake Erie from 1970 to 1986 were calculated and compared to evaluate their utility in the assessment of long term trends. Data were selected from stations within a defined polygon for those years in which at least four surveys were conducted, including spring and fall isothermal conditions and at least two surveys during stratification. Included were an arithmetic average of all survey means during each year, a time-weighted average of all survey means, a spring (isothermal) average, a summer (stratified) average, and an autumn (isothermal) average. The rate of decline in TP concentrations from the spring-only estimator (-0.276 mug TP L-1 yr-1) was similar to that of the time-weighted multiple survey estimator (-0.214 mug TP L-1 yr-1). Additional spring survey data from 1987 through 1991 confirmed that the negative trend continued. The stratified season and the autumn-only estimators exhibited no significant trends, but were biased low and high, respectively, relative to the spring and multiple survey estimators. Despite the reductions in TP concentrations since 1970, the annual normalized rate o oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion of the central basin showed only a slight downward trend (-0.03 mg L-1 mo-1). In 1988 and 1989, however, the depletion rates were lower than any reported during the previous 20 years.																			0380-1330						1993	19	2					224	236		10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71213-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71213-7													WOS:A1993LN30700005

Phytoplankton Development in a Highly Eutrophic man-made Lake From the Pampa plain of Argentina-a functional Approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The phytoplankton structure and dynamics were analysed in relation to abiotic variables in Paso de las Piedras Reservoir, Argentina. Phytoplankton driving forces were explored using a functional approach. A total of 15 functional groups were identified among which D, P, H1, F, J and C were the most important. A Canonical variate analysis indicated that the categorization of the species in functional groups and its relationship with the temporal species clustering was not a random result. In the redundancy analysis, temporal ordination dynamics of functional groups was well described by the distribution of samples. Remarkable shifts in composition and biomass of phytoplankton occurred in agreement with changes in temperature, N:P ratio and transparency. The group succession could be summarized as: P/J (early summer)-> P/H1 (late summer)-> P (early autumn)-> P/F (late autumn)-> C (early winter)-> D (late winter)-> Y (early spring)-> D (early spring)-> P (late spring). The majority of the associations detected were typical of eutrophic-hypertrophic systems. With the exception of H1, the groups that most contribute to biovolume were those characteristics of mixed aquatic environments, i.e., non-stratifying lakes or deep, well-mixed epilimnia of stratifying lakes. The diversity indices, in terms of functional groups, were low, meaning that a small number of traits were present and/or that there was an inequitable distribution.																			1735-6865	2008-2304				WIN	2014	8	1					1	14																WOS:000328872100001

There were significant spatial differences in the COD concentration, which gradually decreased from Zhushan Bay in the northwest, to the north, the lake center, and the southeast of the lake. The COD concentration was significantly higher at near-shore sites than that at open water sites. The mean COD concentrations were significantly higher in the spring and summer than in the winter and autumn. The lowest annual mean COD concentration appeared in 2009, which could be attributed to improvements in water quality management and high rainfall. The COD concentrations in all four seasons were strongly correlated with phytoplankton pigment, suggesting that extracellular release of COD from phytoplankton was an important COD source. The correlation coefficients between the COD and phytoplankton pigment concentrations were higher in the spring, summer, and autumn than in the winter, showing a more important contribution of phytoplankton degradation to COD in the algal bloom season than in the non-algal bloom season. These new data on the temporal and spatial characteristics of the COD in Lake Taihu will be crucial for developing future strategies for water quality management.

J	Salmaso, N				Salmaso, Nico			Influence of atmospheric modes of variability on a deep lake south of the Alps	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Limnological measurements and winter air temperatures recorded in a deep lake south of the Alps (Lake Garda) have been analysed and related to temporal variations in 5 teleconnection patterns, i.e. the East Atlantic pattern (EA), the Eastern Mediterranean Pattern (EMP), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Scandinavia pattern (SCAND) and the East Atlantic/West Russia Pattern (EA/WR). The EA and EMP played a significant role in winter in the large-scale atmospheric circulation over the Mediterranean region. Positive and negative EA, and negative and positive EMP phases were closely connected with the development of mild and harsh winters, respectively. In turn, harsh winters had a strong positive impact on the development of diatoms in spring and cyanobacteria in summer and autumn. These modifications were controlled through a linked chain of factors, which included lower winter lake water temperatures, deep lake circulation episodes, and higher replenishment of epilimnetic phosphorus at spring overturn. This work demonstrates the existence of a strong connection between large-scale climatic fluctuations over the Mediterranean area and the temporal variations in the limnological characteristics of the large lakes located between the Alps and the northern border of the Mediterranean region. Conversely, the NAO, SCAND and EA/WR did not show any relationship with the winter climate and the limnological characteristics of Lake Garda.

A 2000 year long seasonal record of floods in the southern European Alps	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Knowledge of past natural flood variability and controlling climate factors is of high value since it can be useful to refine projections of the future flood behavior under climate warming. In this context, we present a seasonally resolved 2000 year long flood frequency and intensity reconstruction from the southern Alpine slope (North Italy) using annually laminated (varved) lake sediments. Floods occurred predominantly during summer and autumn, whereas winter and spring events were rare. The all-season flood frequency and, particularly, the occurrence of summer events increased during solar minima, suggesting solar-induced circulation changes resembling negative conditions of the North Atlantic Oscillation as controlling atmospheric mechanism. Furthermore, the most extreme autumn events occurred during a period of warm Mediterranean sea surface temperature. Interpreting these results in regard to present climate change, our data set proposes for a warming scenario, a decrease in summer floods, but an increase in the intensity of autumn floods at the South-Alpine slope.

Here, we examine the trends and drivers of 18 lakes across the Northern Hemisphere, with 156-204 years of data, starting in the 1810s. We show that: (a) trends in ice phenology are faster than found by previous studies. Ice-on is 11 days later per century, ice-off is 9 days earlier per century, and ice cover duration is 19 days shorter per century; (b) there are significant breakpoints in the 1850s, 1870s, mid-1890s, and mid-1990s, after which trends in ice phenology are even faster, and associated with changing weather and climate; and (c) local air temperatures explain the most variation in ice phenology, on average 36.5%, followed by progressive climate change explaining around 17.5% on average, with teleconnection patterns explaining the least variation. Our findings support the assertion that broad-scale climatic changes have led to more rapid lake ice loss in lakes distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, with potential widespread impacts on critical ecosystem services that lake ice provides.

Both of the parasite species are new record for the host fish species in Turkey. N. bravicaudatus infection prevalence was highest during winter and spring, and minimum during summer and autumn, with smaller host fish specimens having more parasites than bigger.

In this shallow lake (270 km(2), mean depth 2.8 m), where the annual water level amplitude is 1.4 m and the absolute range is 3.2 m, hydrology is the main driving force for the ecosystem. Control of phytoplankton growth was mediated by ice conditions in spring, and by water level in summer and autumn. Winter air temperature similarly influenced the biomass of cyanobacteria and diatoms in spring; while the effect of the ice-cover duration was more pronounced on cyanobacteria. Mean depth of the lake did not affect the phytoplankton biomass in spring, but clearly controlled it in summer and autumn. The direct impact of winter conditions on biological processes was restricted to a short post-winter period, but extended indirectly as the water level for the entire growing season depended strongly on the height of the spring flood peak.

Characterising the variations in phytoplankton communities and the factors affecting these variations in a fluctuating environment are central issues in ecology and essential to developing appropriate conservation strategies. In the present study, seasonal variations in the phytoplankton community and the driving environmental factors were analysed based on data from Lake Nansihu in 2013. In all, 138 phytoplankton species were identified. The phytoplankton community exhibited seasonal variations, with a mean abundance that ranged from 5.00 x 10(5) cells L-1 in winter to 4.57 x 10(6) cells L-1 in summer and a mean biomass that varied from 0.44 mg L-1 in winter to 3.75 mg L-1 in summer. A spring algal bloom did not appear in this warm, temperate monsoon lake, but an algal bloom did appear in summer when the temperature and nutrient concentrations were high. There were substantial seasonal variations in the dominant phytoplankton taxa, from Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Euglenophyta in spring to Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta in summer, followed by dominance of Chlorophyta in autumn and Bacillariophyta in winter. Results of canonical correspondence analysis indicated that although the environmental factors affecting the seasonal variations in different phytoplankton species varied, water temperature, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen appeared to be the most dominant. These four variables were also the main environmental factors driving the seasonal variations in the phytoplankton community in the lake. The results of the present study will be useful in guaranteeing the water quality and ecological security of Lake Nansihu.					; Zhao, Lei/F-4258-2018	Tian, Wang/0009-0006-2741-140X; Zhao, Lei/0000-0003-1643-4981													1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	10					1877	1886		10.1071/MF16331	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF16331													WOS:000411826800009

The harmful algal bloom can destroy aquatic natural life by reducing dissolved oxygen concentration. This study aimed to evaluate the eutrophication status at the Boseong county, Beolgyo village estuary, considering different water quality parameters. Furthermore, this study also investigated the effect of land use activates the estuarine water environment. The date of the acquisition for the Landsat 8 high-resolution satellite images were four different events i.e., 11th March, 2019, 15th June, 2019, 19th September, 2019, and 8th December, 2019 in four different seasons such as Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter respectively for selected study region. Land use and land cover were extracted on the basis of accuracy's percentage and the Kappa coefficient. Concentrations of water quality parameters such as Chlorophyll-a (Chi-a), Total Phosphorous (TP), Transparency of Sechi Depth (TSD) were extracted using Carlson Trophic State Index (CTSI). The study found that the overall value of the CTSI is classified under the medium eutrophication state in summer and autumn season (CTSI-60-70). While it falls in the light eutrophic state in winter and spring seasons (CTSI-50-60). The value of TSI for all studied nutrients is the higher nearby cropping area as well as land settlements. The spatial variation of the trophic index in the study region aided strong evidence to be detected over the area's adjutant to agrarian farming and urban habitats. The study concludes that the TSI could be used as a simple management tool to classify individual water ecosystems into broad classification that represent their water quality health.

Therefore, sampling including some water quality parameters was conducted twice in the four seasons: autumn, summer, spring, and winter, from September 2020 to August 2021, in the first week of September, December, February, March, May, June, and August. Most of the physicochemical parameter values recorded in this study indicated that they were within the range of standards for zooplankton community requirements. Of the 14 species identified, Mesocyclops aequatorialis similis, Thermodiaptomus galebi, and Bra-chionus angularis had the first, second, and lowest records, respectively. Species abundance showed a decrease from autumn to winter and then to spring and summer. Species richness (14), abundance (6736), Margalef's diversity index (1.48), Menhinick's diversity index (0.17), Simpson index (0.098), dominance index (0.902), Shannon index (2.47), equality index (0.934), and reciprocal Simpson index (10.2) of the species were calculated in the reservoir. Some of the proposed management measures include reservoir buffering, impact assessment of over-abstraction of water for irrigation, time series of water quality data, and the reservoir water level should be above the conduit.					; Tesema, Dagnew/ABF-2827-2021; Getahun, Abebe/NTR-3079-2025; Mingist, Minwyelet/AGZ-9342-2022	Mequanent Tesema, Dagnew/0000-0002-4985-8310; 														2405-8440				SEP	2022	8	9							e10533	10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10533		SEP 2022						36105462					WOS:000863299900003

In such shallow, eutrophic lakes, the remote sensing of phycocyanin (PC), a characteristic pigment of cyanobacteria, is dependent on the estimation precision of phytoplankton absorption. For Lake Taihu, we monitored the seasonal-spatial variation of phytoplankton absorption, and a three-band model was calibrated and validated to estimate phytoplankton absorption (a(ph)(665)) from a dataset of the spatial and temporal patterns of the bio-optical properties collected, during five cruises in January (winter), April (spring), July (summer), and October (autumn) in 2006 to 2007. Two distinct situations prevailed; in winter tripton strongly predominated over particulate matter, and in spring-summer-autumn phytoplankton made an important contribution. In winter, meteorology mainly determined the bio-optical properties of the water column, whereas in the spring-summer-autumn the biological activity was an additional active factor. The three-band remote sensing model >: remote sensing reflectance) of a(ph)(665) was calibrated and validated, and its performance was compared and assessed with the published band-ratio method. With the three-band model, the root mean square error and mean relative error were 0.150 m(-1) (50.5% accounting for the mean value) and 45.7% respectively; with the published band-ratio method, the values were 0.290 m(-1) (97.3% accounting for the mean value) and 213.0% respectively, based on an independent validation dataset. Furthermore, the three-band and band-ratio models worked well in estimating phytoplankton absorption with simulated MERIS bands data with higher precision for the three-band model in Lake Taihu. The result showed that the three-band model was superior to the published band-ratio method, and thus the former can be used to improve the estimation precision of remote sensing of PC.

Determination of the seasonal changes on total fatty acid composition and ω3/ω6 ratios of carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) muscle lipids in Beysehir Lake (Turkey)	FOOD CHEMISTRY												The muscle lipid and fatty acid composition of carp, Cyprinus carpio in Beysehir Lake the largest freshwater lake in Turkey, was determined. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of carp, the most abundant fish species in Beysehir Lake, were found to be higher than those of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in spring, summer and autumn and also the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in spring and summer. Palmitic acid was the major SFA (14.6-16.6%) in all seasons. Oleic acid was identified as the major MUFA (15.1-20.3%). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was the major PUFA in summer and winter, whereas linoleic acid (LA) was the major PUFA in spring and autumn. The percentages of total omega 3 fatty acid were higher than those of total omega 6 fatty acid in the fatty acid composition of carp in winter. It was shown that the fatty acid composition in the muscle of carp was significantly influenced by feeding period and seasons. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Copepods were particularly prominent in the diet in spring and autumn, with ephemeropteran nymphs prominent in summer. Chironomid pupae and stickleback eggs were also elements of the diet in summer; algae, plant material and debris were more important in autumn and winter. Chironomid larvae and ostracods were present throughout the year, but there was some doubt as to the importance of ostracods as digestible food items. Stomach contents were heaviest in spring and late summer and lightest in late autumn and winter. Samples for the diel samples were taken 4 times, once in each season. These diel samples largely reflected the seasonal changes in diet noted in the monthly samples. There were few cases of a clear switch in the composition of the diet during a 24 h period. Feeding occurred during daylight, the weight of the stomach contents declined during darkness. Several methods provided estimates of the daily rate of food consumption which ranged from 3.5 mg in Dec. (4.degree. C), to 19.0 mg in May (15.degree. C). These estimates and others obtained independently suggest that the annual rate of food consumption for a stickleback in Llyn Frongoch is between 2000 and 5000 mg wet weight.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1984	14	4					335	346		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00158.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00158.x													WOS:A1984TD49100001
J	Zhao, K; Dong, A; Wang, SW; Yu, XF				Zhao, Ke; Dong, Ang; Wang, Shuwei; Yu, Xiangfei			Ecological Health Status of the Yitong River, China, Assessed with the Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity	WATER												The Yitong River Basin is the main northern urban river basin in China, and its ecological health has become an important issue of public interest. In 2021, the plankton community and main water quality parameters of the Yitong River were monitored quarterly. An evaluation system was established based on the Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) to assess the spatial and temporal variability in river health. To verify the feasibility of the P-IBI, its assessment results were compared with those of the water quality index (WQI), and the main factors affecting the P-IBI in different seasons were analyzed using correlation analysis between P-IBI metrics and environmental factors. Seasonal comparisons showed that most sampling sites exceeded the "moderate" level in spring and autumn, followed by winter. The worst assessment results occurred in summer. Urban river reaches were more polluted than reaches in rural areas. Regarding driving factors, hydraulic effects on the P-IBI in spring and autumn were significantly stronger than other environmental factors. In summer and winter, special attention should be paid to the input of nitrogen compounds and organic pollutants. Trends based on the P-IBI and the WQI differed in winter, but site patterns were consistent between both indices. The results provide a theoretical basis and data support for the health maintenance of the Yitong River.					; zhao, ke/NRA-9166-2025	Yu, Xiangfei/0000-0002-9863-6853; 														2073-4441				OCT	2022	14	19							3191	10.3390/w14193191	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14193191													WOS:000867193200001

Changing Intrasynoptic Type Characteristics and Interannual Frequencies of Circulation Patterns Conducive to Lake-Effect Snowfall	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Using a temporal synoptic index, synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns suitable for lake-effect snow downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario are identified and analyzed from 1950 to 2009. In response to prior research noting a trend reversal of snowfall in this region, changes in the inherent meteorological characteristics and winter-season frequencies of lake-effect synoptic weather types are evaluated as possible forcing mechanisms. Four atmospheric patterns are identified during the December-February winter season as lake-effect synoptic types. Changes in inherent meteorological characteristics and winter frequencies of these types are attributed to between 88% and 95% of the observed snowfall changes during the study period. Decreasing air temperatures and surface pressures, increasing boundary layer instability, and changes toward stronger zonal flow are noted for multiple lake-effect synoptic types from 1950 to 1979 as likely forcing mechanisms of observed snowfall increases, on the order of nearly 1.0 cm yr(-1) downwind of Lake Ontario per individual synoptic type. Similarly, the significant increases in the winter frequency of multiple lake-effect synoptic types also are attributed to some of the increases in snowfall. From 1980 to 2009, however, the lake-effect synoptic types remained relatively unchanged or decreased in frequency, as did snowfall totals. The results of this study indicate that changes in the synoptic-scale environment are a viable mechanism forcing snowfall trends, in addition to the more commonly considered seasonal temperature and lake-ice considerations, and should be incorporated into future discussions of lake-effect snowfall projections.

FRONTIERS IN WATER												The Laurentian Great Lakes have substantial influences on regional climatology, particularly with impactful lake-effect snow events. This study examines the snowfall, cloud-inferred snow band morphology, and environment of lake-effect snow days along the southern shore of Lake Michigan for the 1997-2017 period. Suitable days for study were identified based on the presence of lake-effect clouds assessed in a previous study and extended through 2017, combined with an independent classification of likely lake-effect snow days based on independent snowfall data and weather map assessments. The primary goals are to identify lake-effect snow days and evaluate the snowfall distribution and modes of variability, the sensitivity to thermodynamic and flow characteristics within the upstream sounding at Green Bay, WI, and the influences of snowband morphology. Over 300 lake-effect days are identified during the study period, with peak mean snowfall within the lake belt extending from southwest Michigan to northern Indiana. Although multiple lake-effect morphological types are often observed on the same day, the most common snow band morphology is wind parallel bands. Relative to days with wind parallel bands, the shoreline band morphology is more common with a reduced lower-tropospheric zonal wind component within the upstream sounding at Green Bay, WI, as well as higher sea-level pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies to the north of the Great Lakes. Snowfall is sensitive to band morphology, with higher snowfall for shoreline band structures than for wind parallel bands, especially due south of Lake Michigan. Snowfall is also sensitive to thermodynamic and flow properties, with a greater sensitivity to temperature in southwest Michigan and to flow properties in northwest Indiana.

This study is the third in a sequence of the Great Lakes Runoff Intercomparison Projects. The densely populated Lake Erie watershed studied here is an important international lake that has experienced recent flooding and shoreline erosion alongside excessive nutrient loads that have contributed to lake eutrophication. Understanding the sources and pathways of flows is critical to solve the complex issues facing this watershed. Seventeen hydrologic and land-surface models of different complexity are set up over this domain using the same meteorological forcings, and their simulated streamflows at 46 calibration and seven independent validation stations are compared. Results show that: (1) the good performance of Machine Learning models during calibration decreases significantly in validation due to the limited amount of training data; (2) models calibrated at individual stations perform equally well in validation; and (3) most distributed models calibrated over the entire domain have problems in simulating urban areas but outperform the other models in validation.

The physicochemical parameters of surface water quality were determined at 20 sampling sites in Taihu Lake region, China in spring, summer, autumn, and winter seasons of 2005-2006 to assess the effect of human activities on the surface water quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used to identify characteristics of the water quality in the studied water bodies. PCA extracted the first,three principal components (PCs), explaining 80.84% of the total variance of the raw data. Especially, PC1 (38.91%) was associated with NH4-N, total N, soluble reactive phosphorus, and total P. PC2 (22.70%) was characterized by NO3-N and temperature. PC3 (19.23%) was mainly associated with pH and dissolved organic carbon. CA showed that streams were influenced by urban residential subsistence and livestock farming contributed significantly to PC1 throughout the year. The streams influenced by farmland runoff contributed most to PC2 in spring and winter compared with other streams. PC3 was affected mainly by aquiculture in spring, rural residential subsistence in summer, and livestock farming in fall and winter seasons. Further analyses showed that farmlands contributed significantly to nitrogen pollution of Taihu Lake, while urban residential subsistence and livestock farming also polluted water quality of Taihu Lake in rainy season. The results would be helpful for the authorities to take sound actions for an effective management of water quality in Taihu Lake region.																			1002-0160	2210-5107				DEC	2009	19	6					765	778		10.1016/S1002-0160(09)60172-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(09)60172-7													WOS:000272023700010

THE RESPONSE OF PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS AND CELL-SIZE	OECOLOGIA												Phytoplankton biomass and species composition were measured with a relatively high temporal resolution (once or twice a week during the growing season) from 1979 to 1989 in Lake Constance/Uberlingersee. Over this period soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations during winter mixing were reduced by ca. 50 % from, 104 to 47 mug 1-1, which caused a prolongation and amplification of the epilimnetic P depletion during the growth period. Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton reacted to the decrease of SRP in the following ways: (1) Algal biomass decreased at least proportionally to the winter SRP concentrations in summer, but not in spring and autumn when biomass fluctuated irregularly. (2) The peak of biomass concentration changed from summer to spring. (3) The earlier onset of epilimnetic P depletion during the season in recent years promoted a stronger growth of some pennate diatoms in spring. It caused an amplification of the silicon depletion in summer, which may cause still greater reduction of diatoms and total algal biomass in summer. (4) Reduction of algal biomass during the clear-water phase proper became shorter and less pronounced. (5) The temporal variability of algal biomass decreased in summer and autumn but not in spring. (6) Average cell sizes remained unchanged in summer and autumn but increased in spring during the beginning of oligotrophication. These results are largely in agreement with other studies on lake restoration and expectations derived from the PEG (Plankton Ecology Group) model (Sommer et al. 1986). They show that a 50% reduction of SRP concentrations during homothermy may have pronounced effects on seasonal dynamics of algal biomass in a large and deep lake. The algal response to the external change of SRP concentrations can be described by the Le Chatelier principle, implying that the internal structure of the system (e.g. species composition) changes in order to minimize the effect of the external pressure (e.g. reduction of total biomass). Suggestions are made as to how this system behaviour may emerge from local interactions.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				MAR	1993	93	2					268	275		10.1007/BF00317681	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317681								28313617					WOS:A1993KR75300019

Seasonal distribution, aggregation, and habitat selection of common carp in Clear Lake, Iowa	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The common carp Cyprinus carpio is widely distributed and frequently considered a nuisance species outside its native range. Common carp are abundant in Clear Lake., Iowa, where their presence is both a symptom of degradation and an impediment to improving water quality and the sport fishery. We used radiotelemetry to quantify seasonal distribution, aggregation, and habitat selection of adult and subadult common carp in Clear Lake during 2005-2006 in an effort to guide future control strategies. Over a 22-month period, we recorded 1,951 locations of 54 adults and 60 subadults implanted with radio transmitters. Adults demonstrated a clear tendency to aggregate in an offshore area during the late fall and winter and in shallow, vegetated areas before and during spring spawning. Late-fall and winter aggregations were estimated to include a larger percentage of the tracked adults than spring aggregations. Subadults aggregated in shallow, vegetated areas during the spring and early summer. Our study, when considered in combination with previous research, suggests repeatable patterns of distribution, aggregation, and habitat selection that should facilitate common carp reduction programs in Clear Lake and similar systems.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2008	137	4					1050	1062		10.1577/T07-112.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-112.1													WOS:000258163500010

In this study, the pollutant removal efficiencies, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and chemical and microbial community properties of the sediment in a large-scale SFCW established beside a plateau lake (Qilu Lake) in southwestern China to treat agricultural runoff were evaluated over a year. The SFCW performed best in terms of nitrogen removal in autumn (average efficiency of 63.5% at influent concentrations of 9.3-35.4 mg L-1) and demonstrated comparable efficiency in other seasons (23.7-40.0%). The removal rates of total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were limited (18.6% and 12.4% at influent concentrations of 1.1 and 45.5 mg L-1 on average, respectively). The SFCW was a hotspot of CH4 emissions, with an average flux of 31.6 mg m(-2).h(-1); moreover, CH4 emissions contributed the most to the global warming potential (GWP) of the SFCW. Higher CH4 and N2O fluxes were detected in winter and in the front-end section of the SFCW with high pollutant concentrations, and plant presence increased CH4 emissions. Significant positive relationships between nutrient and heavy metal contents in the SFCW sediment were detected. The microbial community compositions were similar in autumn and winter, with Thiobacillus , Lysobacter , Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas dominating, and this distribution pattern was clearly distinct from those in spring and summer, with high proportions of Spirochaeta_2 and Denitratisoma. The microbial co-occurrence network in spring was more complex with stronger positive correlations than those in winter and autumn, while it was more stable in autumn with more keystone taxa. Optimization of the construction, operation and management of SFCWs treating NPSP in lake watersheds is necessary to promote their environmental benefits.					; Chang, Junjun/Y-3917-2019	Ji, Bohua/0000-0003-1503-9541; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV 1	2023	345								118871	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118871	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118871		AUG 2023						37657292					WOS:001080043500001

New Insights from Field Data on Climate Change Impacts on Cyanobacteria Abundance	ECOSYSTEMS												Climate warming is likely to impact phytoplankton communities by providing a habitat in which cyanobacteria have competitive advantage over other phytoplankton taxa. We used extreme hot weather periods to investigate the potential impact of climate change on cyanobacteria abundance in three large and deep peri-alpine lakes, Lakes Geneva, Annecy, and Bourget. Between 2000 and 2011, there were four extreme warm weather periods: spring and summer 2003, autumn 2006 and winter 2007. We found that the consequences of extreme air temperatures on cyanobacteria abundance and phytoplankton composition depend on the time of year in which the extreme temperatures occur. In all three lakes studied, a warm summer did not clearly promote cyanobacteria blooms, whereas a warm autumn promoted cyanobacteria growth in the mesotrophic Lakes Geneva and Bourget, but not in the oligotrophic Lake Annecy. A warm winter was associated with high cyanobacteria abundance and a high contribution of cyanobacteria to total phytoplankton biomass. Our results reinforce the idea that lakes have an ecological memory by showing that a warm winter can influence subsequent seasonal succession in the cyanobacteria community. In both mesotrophic lakes studied, cyanobacteria abundance was strongly influenced by phosphorus concentrations and winter air temperatures. We conclude that although extreme hot weather periods can be used to analyze various aspects of the impacts of climate change, they are of limited value in forecasting the structure of phytoplankton communities in a warmer future.

J	Iwaki, M; Hayakawa, K; Goto, N				Iwaki, Maho; Hayakawa, Kazuhide; Goto, Naoshige			An Estimation of Precipitation Retention Time Using Depth Metres in the Northern Basin of Lake Biwa	ATMOSPHERE												To facilitate climate change adaptations and water management, estimates of precipitation retention time (time required for precipitation to reach a lake) can help to accurately determine a water body's terrestrial water storage capacity and water cycle. Although estimating the precipitation retention time on land is difficult, estimating the lag between precipitation on land and a rise in lake water levels is possible. In this study, the delay times (using a depth metre installed in the mooring system in the northern basin of Lake Biwa from August 2017 to October 2018) were calculated using response functions, and it evaluated the precipitation retention time in the catchment. However, as several delays between the river surface flow (<1 d) and shallow subsurface flow (approximate to 45 d) remained unidentified, the delay times resulting from direct precipitation on the lake as well as from internal seiches were determined. The results suggest that delay times of approximately 20 d correspond to the paddy-waterway system between the river inflow and the subsurface flow, and that this effect corresponds to that of large rivers such as the Ane River. These findings can enhance water management strategies regarding the regulation of river flows, adapting to climate change-induced fluctuations in precipitation.

The highest value of phytoplankton biomass (78 mg l(-1)) was observed in October 1990, during a bloom of the desmid Closterium limneticum var. fallax, while the lowest (0.15 mg l(-1)) was measured in April 1991. During spring, autumn and winter 1990, species of the genus Closterium dominated the community, in the sequence: C. aciculare, C. limneticum var. fallax, C. limneticum. The summer community was more diverse with the predominance of organisms belonging to Chlorophyceae (Chlamydomonas, Eudorina, Coelastrum) and Cyanophyceae (Microcystis, Anabaena). In spring 1991, there was a long clear-water phase during which small green algae (Ankyra, Oocystis) and cryptomonads dominated. Subsequently, the summer season was characterized by a clear sequence of dominants, drawn, in turns, from species belonging to: Bacillariophyceae, Dinophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Euglenophyceae. The physics of the reservoir and its depth, owing to filling/draining constraints in a summer-arid climate, appeared to play a key role in the dynamics of phytoplankton community.

J	Nicholson, SE; Hartman, AT; Klotter, DA				Nicholson, Sharon E.; Hartman, Adam T.; Klotter, Douglas A.			On the Diurnal Cycle of Rainfall and Convection over Lake Victoria and Its Catchment. Part I: Rainfall and Mesoscale Convective Systems	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												This article examines the diurnal cycle of lake-effect rains over Lake Victoria and of rainfall in the surrounding catchment. The analysis focuses on four months, which represent the two wet seasons (April and November) and the two dry seasons (February and July). Lake-effect rains are strongest in April and weakest in July. In all cases there is a nocturnal rainfall maximum over the lake and a daytime maximum over the catchment, with the transition between rainfall over the lake and over the catchment occurring between 1200 and 1500 local standard time (LST). During the night the surrounding catchment is mostly dry. Conversely, little to no rain falls over the lake during the afternoon and early evening. Inmost cases the maximum over the lake occurs at either 0600 or 0900 LST and the maximum over the catchment occurs around 1500-1800 LST. The diurnal cycle of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) parallels that of overlake rainfall. MCS initiation generally begins over the catchment around 1500 LST and increases at 1800 LST. MCS initiation over the lake begins around 0300 LST and continues until 1200 LST. While some MCSs originate over the highlands to the east of the lake, most originate in situ over the lake. Maximum MCS activity over the lake occurs at 0600 LST and is associated with the systems that initiate in situ.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				NOV	2021	22	11					3037	3047		10.1175/JHM-D-21-0083.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-21-0083.1													WOS:000755188200012
J	Brown, LJ; Taleban, V; Gharabaghi, B; Weiss, L				Brown, Laura J.; Taleban, Vahid; Gharabaghi, Bahram; Weiss, Lee			Seasonal and spatial distribution patterns of atmospheric phosphorus deposition to Lake Simcoe, ON	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A decline in the water quality of Lake Simcoe, Ontario has been observed over the past few decades. This decline has been attributed to excessive loading of the limiting nutrient phosphorus. Atmospheric deposition of phosphorus is a major non-point source contributing 25-50% of the total phosphorus (TP) load entering Lake Simcoe. The objectives of this study were to quantify seasonal variability of atmospheric TP deposition on Lake Simcoe and to estimate spatial distribution patterns of atmospheric TP deposition on Lake Simcoe. Based on the 1995-2007 period of records, on average 35% of the annual bulk atmospheric TP load occurs in the spring, while the summer, autumn and winter account for 45%, 13% and 7%, respectively. The autumn and winter loads are more or less consistent and exhibit little change much from year to year; however, the summer load can vary greatly. Spatially, the Northwest and Southeast quadrants of the lake show the highest atmospheric TP deposition during the spring and summer months. Most of the soils with the highest vulnerability for wind erosion are located in these quadrants and the dominant winds blow in the NW-SE direction.

Nutritional value of freshwater mesozooplankton assemblages from Hanna Dam Lake, Iran, during a one-year study	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Nutritional value of freshwater mesozooplankton, fatty acid (FA) and amino acid (AA) compositions were determined in the middle of each season for a one-year period from May 2009 to February 2010 in Hanna Dam Lake, Isfahan, Iran. FA and AA composition significantly (P<0.05) varied in relation to the seasonal changes of water quality, phytoplankton and zooplankton community. The content of saturated fatty acids (SAFA), mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ranged from 22.4-29.0%, 30.9-40.4%, 11.8-20.9% of dry weight (DW), respectively. The major SAFA were 16: 0 (13.7-17.0% DW) and 18: 0 (4.9-7.0% DW), whereas contents of MUFA were mainly 18: 1n-9 (13.8-16.2% DW), 16: 1n-7 (6.9-13.6% DW), and 18: 1n-7 (5.7-10.6% DW). The major PUFA were 18: 2n-6 (2.6-11.7% DW), 18: 3n-3 (2.4-3.1% DW), 20: 5n-3 (3.94.8% DW), 22: 6n-3 (0.73-0.99% DW), and 20: 4n-6 (0.56-0.73% DW). As for the ratios of n-3: n-6, the values were 0.70:1, 2.54:1, 2.10:1, and 1.73:1 in spring, summer, autumn and winter respectively. The mean essential amino acid (EAA) and non-essential amino acid (NEAA) were 28.7 and 71.3%; 31.0 and 69.0%; 31.63 and 68.4%; 34.5 and 67.0% of total amino acid in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. The amount of tyrosin, isolucine, lucine, arginine, cysteine, aspartic acid, glycine and proline were higher in mesozooplankton population at summer and autumn compared to winter and spring.																			1562-2916						2013	12	2					301	319																WOS:000323556400005
J	Suriano, ZJ; Leathers, DJ				Suriano, Zachary J.; Leathers, Daniel J.			Synoptically classified lake-effect snowfall trends to the lee of Lakes Erie and Ontario	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Recent research has indicated that snowfall in portions of the North American Great Lakes region subject to lake-effect snow has undergone a trend reversal, with snowfall declining in recent decades. This study examines the seasonal variability and trends specifically in synoptically classified lake-effect snow across the eastern Great Lakes region, and investigates the mechanisms responsible for observed changes. Using a synoptic climatological approach, days are identified where the synoptic-scale conditions are conducive to lake-effect snowfall and the associated snowfall is analyzed. Seven synoptic types over the November to March snowfall season are identified with characteristics of lake-effect conditions. Snowfall from these 7 lake-effect synoptic types represents between 45 and 53% of the seasonal snowfall total along the eastern shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario, with snowfall totals being highest during January. Lake-effect snowfall exhibits a 60 yr increasing trend downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario; however, through examination over shorter 30 yr periods, a change in the trend of snowfall is observed around 1980. While a true trend reversal is not detected, lake-effect snowfall significantly increases from 1950-1979 before exhibiting no significant trend from 1980-2009. The inter-annual variability of seasonal lake-effect snowfall is highly related to the frequency of lake-effect synoptic types where an increase (decrease) in synoptic type occurrence leads to enhanced (diminished) lake-effect snowfall totals. Depending on the period examined, long-term changes in the frequency of lake-effect synoptic types and snowfall rates represent between 89 and 95% of the observed changes in lake-effect snow.					; Leathers, Daniel/A-3665-2010	Leathers, Daniel/0000-0001-9002-9031; Suriano, Zachary/0000-0001-7574-0191; 													0936-577X	1616-1572					2018	74	1					1	13		10.3354/cr01480	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr01480													WOS:000418809700001
J	Suriano, ZJ; Wortman, RD				Suriano, Zachary J.; Wortman, Reggie D.			Temporal trends in snowfall contribution induced by lake-effect synoptic types	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Using a synoptic classification technique and gridded snow dataset, snowfall was evaluated in the eastern Great Lakes region from 1950-2009 during atmospheric conditions suitable for the development of lake-effect snow. Specific emphases were placed on detailing the long-term changes to snowfall magnitude and frequency, and quantifying changes in the contribution of total snowfall from lake-effect synoptic types. For Lakes Erie and Ontario, snowfall from lake-effect synoptic types represented approximately 48% of total snowfall, and 42% of snowfall days are synoptically lake-effect in nature. Over time, the percentage of total early-season snowfall from lake-effect synoptic types significantly increased downwind of the Lakes, by approximately 0.4% yr(-1), corresponding to an increase from approximately 40% lake-effect in the 1950s, to over 60% in the 2000s. This was due, in part, to changes in the frequency of snowfall-producing synoptic types, decreases in the percentage of precipitation falling as snow during non-lake-effect events, and increases in the magnitude of snowfall per lake-effect event. Changes in the proportion of total snowfall from lake-effect processes carries implications to water resources due to differences in snow-water-equivalent between lake-effect snow and snowfall from other mechanisms, such as mid-latitude cyclones.

The ground surface temperature (GST) is also regarded as a significant upper boundary condition when simulating permafrost distribution. In this study, the newest Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for the Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA2) reanalysis GST from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) is compared with GST data from 69 meteorological stations over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Then, elevation correction of the MERRA2 GST was performed for different altitudes on seasonal scales. The correction indicates that the accuracy of raw MERRA2 GST data has been greatly improved after the elevation calibration. The decreased proportions of root mean square error (RMSE) for calibrated GST in winter, autumn, summer, and spring are 88.4, 92.8, 95.7, and 92.8%, respectively. The improvements in the mean bias error (MBE) in winter, autumn, summer, and spring are 88.4, 92.8, 95.7, and 92.8%, respectively. Most of the QTP presents a statistically increasing tendency of 0.2 to 0.5 degrees C/10a for GST at a significance level of 0.01 from 1980 to 2013. Then, the elevation corrected MERRA2 GST was applied in the surface frost number semi-physical permafrost model. The simulated results show that the permafrost area on the QTP is approximately 1.02 x 10(6) km(2) in the early 21st century, excluding lakes and glaciers. The permafrost degradation was characterized by the disappearance of permafrost which mainly occurred in the eastern QTP.

J	Lenters, JD				Lenters, JD			Trends in the Lake Superior water budget since 1948: A weakening seasonal cycle	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												An analysis of Lake Superior water levels from 1948-1999 reveals that the seasonal cycle has decreased in amplitude by 20% (from 40 cm to 32 cm). This change is manifested as a downward trend in summer and autumn lake levels (when levels are typically highest) accompanied by roughly no change in winter and spring lake levels (and an overall 4-cm drop in annual mean levels). The decreased rates of seasonal rise and fall in lake level over the 51-year interval reflect a large decrease in the net monthly influx of water during the late spring (up to -1,360 m(3)/s) coupled with a nearly compensating increase in net influx during late autumn (up to +1,100 m(3)/s). Analysis of the Lake Superior water budget indicates that these changes are primarily the result of trends in runoff and over-lake precipitation. A systematic decrease in outflow through the St. Marys River is also evident during July-December (in association with the lower lake levels), as well as a moderate shift in the seasonal pattern of lake evaporation (but not the annual mean). The observed water budget trends are primarily related to variations in climate, rather than lake regulation. Land surface effects are also important, as suggested by a 20% increase in annual mean evapotranspiration during the 51-year interval and large changes in monthly storage (e.g., snowmelt, groundwater, etc.). Significant uncertainties are present in the calculated water budget,						Lenters, John/0000-0002-6895-7592													0380-1330						2004	30			1			20	40		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70375-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70375-5													WOS:000227991500003

Improvements to Lake-Effect Snow Forecasts Using a One-Way Air-Lake Model Coupling Approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Lake-effect convective snowstorms frequently produce high-impact, hazardous winter weather conditions downwind of the North American Great Lakes. During lake-effect snow events, the lake surfaces can cool rapidly, and in some cases, notable development of ice cover occurs. Such rapid changes in the lake-surface conditions are not accounted for in existing operational weather forecast models, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, resulting in reduced performance of lake-effect snow forecasts. As a milestone to future implementations in the Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS) and HRRR, this study examines the one-way linkage between the hydrodynamic-ice model [the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model coupled with the unstructured grid version of the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (FVCOM-CICE), the physical core model of GLOFS] and the atmospheric model [the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, the physical core model of HRRR]. The realistic representation of lake-surface cooling and ice development or its fractional coverage during three lake-effect snow events was achieved by feeding the FVCOM-CICE simulated lake-surface conditions to WRF (using a regional configuration of HRRR), resulting in the improved simulation of the turbulent heat fluxes over the lakes and resulting snow water equivalent in the downwind areas. This study shows that the one-way coupling is a practical approach that is well suited to the operational environment, as it requires little to no increase in computational resources yet can result in improved forecasts of regional weather and lake conditions.					; Benjamin, Stanley/C-5818-2015; Benjamin, Stan/C-5818-2015; Smirnova, Tatiana/D-3350-2015; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024; James, Eric/C-7713-2015	Fitzpatrick, Lindsay/0000-0002-7570-6142; Benjamin, Stan/0000-0002-5751-8236; Chu, Philip/0000-0002-3089-0353; James, Eric/0000-0002-6507-4997; Mann, Greg/0000-0001-9200-3601; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383													1525-755X	1525-7541				DEC	2020	21	12					2813	2828		10.1175/JHM-D-20-0079.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0079.1													WOS:000617314400006

However, the mechanisms of DOM cycling in the water column during different seasons have not been fully elucidated to date. The differences in DOM degradation in summer, autumn, and winter water columns were evaluated in this study. The results showed that bacteria played an essential role in the degradation of DOM in the summer water column. Photochemical degradation was the primary degradation pathway of DOM in the autumn and winter water columns. Notably, while DOM is degraded, photosynthetic bacteria produce organic matter through photosynthesis to replenish the water column. EEM-PARAFAC analysis indicated more tryptophan component C1 in summer, but the contents of humic substance component C2 and terrestrial substance C3 were higher in autumn and winter. In summer, more tryptophan-like components were consumed by bacteria, and Cyanobacteria produced more organic matter through photosynthesis to replenish the water column. Moreover, a similar bacterial community structure and a more active tryptophan biosynthesis pathway were found in autumn and winter. Random forest models identified representative bacteria involved in the DOM transformation process in different seasons. The above findings may be helpful to explore the degradation characteristics of DOM in different seasons and predict the fate of DOM in the water column in the future.					wei, zimin/V-1475-2019; Yang, Hong-Yu/AAH-4859-2021														0045-6535	1879-1298				MAY	2022	295								133923	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133923	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133923		FEB 2022						35143859					WOS:000765279600002

V vimba fed on ostracods, gastropods, Dreissena polymorpha (mollusks), fish larvae, macrophytes, oligochaetes, chironomids, phytoplankton, and detritus. The gut fullness index (GFI) indicated that vimbas increased their feeding activity in summer and decreased it in winter. The correlation between GFI and temperature was significant (0.839, P < 0.01). The water temperature shift was one of the critical environmental factors affecting the feeding of vimbas in Lake Sapanca. The lowest similarity of diet composition was between the juvenile vimbas in autumn and the adult vimbas in spring (cluster analysis), while the highest similarity of diet composition was between adult individuals in autumn and winter (cluster analysis). In both size groups and in all seasons, the main food items were macrophytes, D. polymorpha, and phytoplankton (particularly bacillariophytes). Of animal food items, adult individuals fed mostly on D. polymorpha, while ostracods were consumed only by juvenile fish in spring, summer, and autumn. The benthic-omnivorous strategy of vimba is demonstrated by the high abundance of plant foods in their guts, confirming this mixed type of diet.

We quantified fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) abundances (Escherichia coli and enterococci) from water and sediment samples over one-year survey. Then we measured biological (bacterial abundance, chlorophyll -a), physico-chemical (dissolved nutrients and oxygen, salinity, pH ...) and climatic (temperatures, rainfall and tidal coefficient) parameters. Results showed that FIB abundances were occasionally higher than the European regulatory threshold during winter, summer and fall. The "poor quality " of the bathing water was due to high enterococci abundance. We found negative significant correlations between FIB and water temperature and salinity, and positive significant correlations between FIB and rainfall, PO4, NO3, NO2, and SiO2 mainly in water.

The seasonal mean concentration of individual 3-6-ring PAHs in precipitation varied from 1 to 54 ng l(-1) and from 3 to 350 ng l(-1) in summer and winter, respectively. In the atmospheric aerosol samples the seasonal mean concentration of PAHs varied from 4 to 880 pg m(-3), from 4 to 300 pg m(-3), from ii to 1050 pg m(-3) and from 36 to 5000 pg m(-3) in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. Wet (412 mug m(-2) year(-1)) and aerosol (190-300 mug m(2) year(-1)) deposition rates were also estimated indicating that the two processes are of comparable importance in the removal of 3-6-ring PAHs from the atmosphere.

Two, 2.9 m long thermistor chain sensors (Snow and Ice Mass Balance Apparatuses), were used to remotely measure air, snow, ice, and water temperatures every 15-min between December 2021 and March 2022. Results showed that freeze-up occurred later in the deeper lake (Ryan Lake) and earlier in the shallow lake (Landing Lake). Ice growth was significantly faster in Ryan Lake than in Landing Lake, due to cold water temperatures (mean (Tw) =0.65 to 0.96 degrees C) persisting beneath the ice. In Landing Lake, basal ice growth was hindered because of warm water temperatures (Tw=1.5 to 2.1 degrees C) caused by heat released from lake sediments. Variability in air temperatures at both lakes had significant influences on the thermal regimes of ice and snow, particularly in Ryan Lake, where ice temperatures were more sensitive to rapid changes in air temperatures. This finding suggests that conductive heat transfer through the air-water continuum may be more sensitive to variability in air temperatures in deeper lakes with colder water temperatures than in shallow lakes with warmer water temperatures, if snow depths and densities are comparable. This study highlights the significance of lake morphology and rapid air temperature variability on influencing ice growth processes. Conclusions drawn aim to improve the representation of ice growth processes in regional and global climate models, and to improve ice safety for northern communities.																			0165-232X	1872-7441				JUN	2023	210								103808	10.1016/j.coldregions.2023.103808	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2023.103808		MAR 2023											WOS:000957528100001

To explore the differences in lake-atmosphere interaction parameters, meteorological variables and turbulent heat fluxes in small and large water bodies, we collected eddy covariance observations and meteorological data during ice-free periods of the Lake small Nam-Co ("small lake") in 2012-2013 and Lake Nam-Co ("large lake") in 2015-2016 on the Tibetan Plateau. Significant differences exist in their lake-atmosphere interaction processes due to differences in their inherent attributes and environmental backgrounds. Relative to the "small lake", the maximum surface temperature of the "large lake" in summer is approximately 3 degrees C lower; "large lake" also has a larger wind speed, a higher monthly average air temperature and delayed peaks of the seasonal variation of water and air temperature. The typical values of the roughness length and standard bulk transfer coefficient for momentum are approximately 80% and 21% higher, respectively, for the "large lake". The typical values of the roughness lengths for heat and water are one order of magnitude lower in the "large lake" while the corresponding standard bulk transfer coefficients are only 7% lower. The latent and sensible heat fluxes of the two lakes have quite different seasonal variations, with evaporation peaking in November for the "large lake" and in June for the "small lake". The estimated evaporation during the ice-free season of the "large lake" (approximately 981 +/- 18 mm) is also higher than that (812 mm) of the "small lake" and this is mainly related to the observed lower Bowen ratio in the "large lake".					; Wang, Binbin/GPX-5567-2022; Ma, Yaoming/AAA-3248-2021; Ma, Weiqiang/AFK-3927-2022; Su, Z./D-4383-2009; yan, wang/JRW-9981-2023	Su, Zhongbo/0000-0003-2096-1733; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2019	573						220	234		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.066													WOS:000474327800017

Remote sensing of chlorophyll-a can help provide a time series to allow an assessment of the ecological implications of this. Non-parametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) was used to visualize and understand the changes that have occurred between 2003-2018 in Lakes Garda, Como, Iseo, and Maggiore. In all four deep subalpine lakes, there has been a disruption from a traditional pattern of a significant spring chlorophyll-a peak followed by a clear water phase and summer/autumn peaks. This was replaced after 2010-2012, with lower spring peaks and a tendency for annual maxima to occur in summer. There was a tendency for this switch to be interspersed by a two-year period of low chlorophyll-a. Variables that were significant in NPMR included time, air temperature, total phosphorus, winter temperature, and winter values for the North Atlantic Oscillation. The change from spring to summer chlorophyll-a maxima, relatively sudden in an ecological context, could be interpreted as a regime shift. The cause was probably cascading effects from increased winter temperatures, reduced winter mixing, and altered nutrient dynamics. Future trends will depend on climate change and inter-decadal climate drivers.					; Free, Gary/IUO-8431-2023; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013	LUCIANI, GIULIA/0000-0003-1458-314X; Ghirardi, Nicola/0000-0002-5006-9853; Giardino, Claudia/0000-0002-3937-4988; Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; Pinardi, Monica/0000-0001-5289-8842; 														2073-4441				MAR	2021	13	6							866	10.3390/w13060866	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13060866													WOS:000651938800001

This paper examines the problems and challenges of forecasting lake effect snows. The climatology of lake-induced snowfall is reviewed, and an overview of the characteristics and evolution of these mesoscale precipitation bands is presented. The atmospheric conditions associated with five different types of lake snow bands are discussed. The abilities of remote sensors to resolve, and dynamical models to simulate, these mesoscale events are also explored. Finally, several techniques designed to improve operational forecasts of lake effect snow are described in detail, along with representative case studies.																			0882-8156					MAR	1995	10	1					61	77		10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010<0061:WWFTTE>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010<0061:WWFTTE>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1995QU38500005
J	SOMMER, U				SOMMER, U			THE PERIODICITY OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN LAKE CONSTANCE (BODENSEE) IN COMPARISON TO OTHER DEEP LAKES OF CENTRAL-EUROPE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Phytoplankton periodicity has been fairly regular during the years 1979 to 1982 in Lake Constance. Algal mass growth starts with the vernal onset of stratification; Cryptophyceae and small centric diatoms are the dominant algae of the spring bloom. In June grazing by zooplankton leads to a ''clear-water phase'' dominated by Cryptophyceae. Algal summer growth starts under nutrient-saturated conditions with a dominance of Cryptomonas spp. and Pandorina morum. Depletion of soluble reactive phosphorus is followed by a dominance of pennate and filamentous centric diatoms, which are replaced by Ceratium hirundinella when dissolved silicate becomes depleted. Under calm conditions there is a diverse late-summer plankton dominated by Cyanophyceae and Dinobryon spp.; more turbulent conditions and silicon resupply enable a second summer diatom growth phase in August. The autumnal development leads from a Mougeotia-desmid assemblage to a diatom plankton in late autumn and winter. Inter-lake comparison of algal seasonality includes in ascending order of P-richness Konigsee, Attersee, Walensee, Lake Lucerne, Lago Maggiore, Ammersee, Lake Zurich, Lake Geneva, Lake Constance. The oligotrophic lakes have one or two annual maxima of biomass; after the vernal maximum there is a slowly developing summer depression and sometimes a second maximum in autumn. The more eutrophic lakes have an additional maximum in summer. The number of floristically determined successional stages increases with increasing eutrophy, from three in Konigsee and Attersee to eight in Lake Geneva and Lake Constance.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 5	1986	138						1	7		10.1007/BF00027228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027228													WOS:A1986E070900002

R.; Borges, Hugo; Schallenberg, Marc			Nuisance mucilage produced by Lindavia intermedia (Bacillariophyceae) in New Zealand lakes	INLAND WATERS												The invasive centric diatom Lindavia intermedia arrived in New Zealand in recent decades. It produces a pelagic mucilage, which forms an adhesive substance known as lake snow. While determining cell concentrations of L. intermedia is relatively straightforward, methods to estimate mucilage concentration in lake water have not yet been developed. Two methods for lake snow quantification are reported here: a dragged line, or "snow tow," and in situ filtration. A chemical assay for hexosamine, as an estimate of chitin content, and an atomic absorption method, which measures silicon, were used to measure these components of lake snow. Samples from 4 lakes revealed a correlation between snow tow and filtration data; in principle, the snow tow method (used by municipal authorities) could be calibrated and made quantifiable using the filtration method. Expression of the chitin synthase gene in summer/autumn (but not in winter/spring) correlated with abundance of the chitin component of lake snow, aligning with anecdotal evidence for the timing of its development in lakes. By contrast, cell densities correlated poorly with lake snow abundance. Cell concentrations relative to chitin concentrations were also higher in winter/spring than in summer/autumn across lakes. Dry weight and silicate in lake snow relative to chitin varied by lake and season. The quantification of lake snow and its adhesiveness are important parameters for assessing its nuisance value and fouling characteristics and for developing measures to prevent and remediate its incursion in lakes.

(2016-2024)	GEOGRAPHIA POLONICA												The first multi-year examination of the phenological phases of lake ice cover in this area utilized a two-source method to address the constraints of this environment. Higher air temperatures impacted the reduction in ice cover duration, while its fluctuation and windiness influenced the occurrence of repeated freeze-thaw events, ultimately extending these periods. The extended duration of ice cover at higher elevation lake (CID +56 days, IP +75 days) can be attributed to later and prolonged break-ups (BUS +48 days, BUE +64 days, BUD +16 days). Studying these factors' interaction with the lake's characteristics (such as their morphology and the presence of flow) and their surroundings (including topography) has enhanced our understanding of the dynamics of this crucial component of the high mountain cryosphere.																			0016-7282	2300-7362					2025	98	1					79	95		10.7163/GPol.0293	http://dx.doi.org/10.7163/GPol.0293													WOS:001464575700004
J	Wang, Y; Mi, CR; Guo, YM				Wang, Ye; Mi, Chunrong; Guo, Yumin			Satellite tracking reveals a new migration route of black-necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	PEERJ												Background. The black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis) is a vulnerable species and the only species that lives in the plateau. Five migration routes of different populations have been identified, but for cranes wintering in Nyingchi Prefecture, Tibet, the migration route and breeding/summering area are still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatio-temporal migration patterns of black-necked cranes in this area and to identify important areas for conservation. Methods. In 2016, we fitted seven black-necked cranes in Nyingchi with GPS-GSM satellite transmitters to record their migration routes. We used ArcGIS 10.2 to visualize important stopover sites and the `ggplof function in R to analyze the migration patterns. Results. From March 2016 to May 2019, we recorded nine spring migration and four autumn migration tracks from five individuals. Four individuals spent the breeding/summering season in Qinghai Lake, while the other spent the breeding/summering season in the Jinzihai Wetland of Dulan County, Qinghai Province. Detailed spatiotemporal information showed that the spring migration lasted 8.7 +/- 4.6 days and covered 1,182.5 +/- 90.4 km, while the autumn migration lasted 30 +/- 10.6 days and covered 1,455.7 +/- 138 km. Basom Lake and the Shazhuyu River were the most important stopover sites during the spring and autumn migrations, respectively. The cranes spent 4.4 +/- 3.7 days in Basom Lake and 26.3 +/- 10.7 days in the Shazhuyu River. The black-necked cranes mainly migrated during the daytime (>85 % of the fly points), and 81 % (17/21) of all stopover and roosting sites were in the valley or at lakeside swamps. Only 17.7% (516 / 2,914) of the data points for stopover and roosting sites were in protected areas. Main conclusions. Our study revealed the breeding/summering areas and migration routes of the black-necked cranes wintering in Nyingchi. These results contribute to a better understanding of the annual spatio-temporal migration patterns and the development of conservation plans for this vulnerable species.																			2167-8359					AUG 19	2020	8								e9715	10.7717/peerj.9715	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9715								32879798					WOS:000560602800006

The number of planktonic colonies of this species decreased from early autumn to early spring, but increased in the sediment during late summer and autumn. The overwintering colonies in the sediment were .apprx. 100-1000 times greater per unit than those in lake water. No photo-inhibition of photosynthesis could be observed in overwintering Microcystis. The values of the initial slopes of photosynthesis-light (P-I) curves were similar to those of the summer population, although the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax) measured at 20.degree. C was lower than that of the summer planktonic population. In winter the values of Pmax, initial slope of the P-I curve, and the ratio of phycobilin to chlorophyll a sorted from sediment were higher than in colonies from the plankton.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1984	6	6					1019	1029		10.1093/plankt/6.6.1019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/6.6.1019													WOS:A1984TR10400008
J	ROGERS, KH; BREEN, CM				ROGERS, KH; BREEN, CM			GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION OF POTAMOGETON-CRISPUS IN A SOUTH-AFRICAN LAKE	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												P. crispus L. is common in lakes (pans) on the floodplain of the Pongolo river in South Africa. The pans are flushed by the river during summer but isolated during the winter. Growth of Potamogeton was markedly seasonal, starting in autumn (April) and reaching maximum above-substrate standing crop (43 g m-2) in early spring (Sept.). No plants were present during summer. Of the 1129 m-2 of the vegetative buds (turions) on the sediment surface in April, 60% germinated. Although seed density was high (1445 m-2), only 0.001% germinated during the study period. Under experimental conditions, turion germination was significantly inhibited at a temperature of 25.degree. C and above. In the field, turions germinated only in autumn, when the water temperature had dropped below 25.degree. C. Individual plants have a short life (about 5 mo.), but because turion germination occurs over a period of about 3 mo. and newly-produced turions do not germinate until the following year, the population persists for 8-9 mo. each year. Leaf chlorophyll concentration and the rate of O2 production by shoot tips declined during spring, but plants that developed late in the season, and which were present during early summer, had a high rate of shoot-tip O2 production. The decline in standing crop is not caused by high summer temperature. The factors initiating turion development on the mature plant are not clear. Turion production accounted for 23% of the maximum standing crop. Development and decline of the standing crop had a marked effect on the nutrient dynamics of the pan. N may be the nutrient in least supply during growth, and may have been limiting. The disappearance of P. crispus in spring was associated with a release of nutrients into the water at a rate which exceeded uptake by other components of the system. These nutrients may be flushed from the pan during the summer floods.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1980	68	2					561	571		10.2307/2259422	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259422													WOS:A1980KF49500013

The paper, through using the continuous wavelet time series, analyzed the Dianchi Lake water quality indicators as each indicator has different emergence of the extreme time at different periods of time during the past 7a. Results showed that the Dianchi Lake water quality indicators had different change cycles at different time scales near 7a, with pH being low in spring and summer, high in autumn and winter, DO being high in spring and summer, low in autumn and winter, CODMn being low in autumn and winter, high in spring and summer, and NH3-N being low in spring and summer and high in autumn and winter. Although the overall water quality in Dianchi Lake has been improved, the pollution sometimes still gets worse at certain sections of the Dianchi Lake. Therefore, using the wavelet to study the law of water pollution is not only effective but also applicable to the study of other pollutants time series evolution. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the recycling of nutrients such as nitrate and ammonium, this problem has been difficult to eradicate. Sediment flux, a product of diagenesis, explains the recycling of nutrients. The objective was to simulate the seasonal spatial variations of nitrate and ammonium flux. In this paper, sediment diagenesis modeling was applied to Taihu with Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). Latin hypercube sampling was used to create an input file from twelve (12) nitrogen related parameters of sediment diagenesis and incorporated into the EFDC. The results were analyzed under four seasons: summer, autumn, winter, and spring. The concentration of NH4-N in the sediment-water column increased from 2.744903 to 22.38613 (g/m(3)). In summer, there was an accumulation of ammonium in the water column. In autumn and winter, the sediment was progressively oxidized. In spring, low-oxygen conditions intensify denitrification. This allows algal blooms to continue to thrive, creating a threat to water quality sustainability. The sediment diagenesis model, coupled with water quality measured data, showed an average relative error for Total Nitrogen (TN) of 38.137%, making the model suitable. Future studies should simulate phosphate flux and measure sediment fluxes on the lake.

Temperature drives variability in recent satellite-derived ice cover trends in Nebraska Sand Hill lakes	INLAND WATERS												The timing and duration of lake ice cover is a critical driver of lake ecosystem dynamics and an important indicator of climatic change. While much research has focused on lake ice dynamics at high latitudes and in north-temperate lakes, few studies have considered ice dynamics in lakes at lower latitudes. Here we use high-resolution satellite imagery to determine patterns of lake ice cover for 128 Sand Hill lakes from 2016 to 2023. Average ice duration was 112 days and varied between 74 and 158 days. The average dates for ice-on and ice-off were 25 November and 17 March. Ice cover duration for Sand Hill lakes was long compared to lakes at higher latitudes. October-November-December and February-March-April mean atmospheric temperatures were strong drivers of lake ice cover compared to lake-specific factors (e.g., lake area, shoreline complexity). To our knowledge, this represents the first study of lake ice cover in Nebraska Sand Hills and provides baseline data to help determine the effect of climatic changes on lake ecosystems in the Nebraska Sand Hills.

The lake has undergone cultural eutrophication over the past 40 years and is currently eutrophic (annual averages of FRP=0.07 mg P l(-1), TP=0.11 mg P l(-1), NH(4)(+)=0.25 mg N l(-1), NO(3)(-)=0.56 mg N l(-1)). FRP and NH(4)(+) levels are correlated to external loading from streams during the winter and spring, and to internal loading during multi-day periods of summer stratification. Algal blooms occurred in summer (July-August green algae, August-September blue-green algae), autumn (October blue-green algae and diatoms), and winter (February diatoms), but not in the spring (March-June). The phytoplankton underwent brief periods of N- and P-limitation, though persistent low transparency (secchi depth of 60-80 cm) also suggests periods of light limitation. Rotifers counts were highest from mid-summer to early autumn whereas copepods were high in the spring and cladocerans were low in the summer. Removal of industrial and sewage point sources a decade ago resulted in a decrease in FRP. A phosphorus mass balance identified further reductions in external loading from the predominately agricultural catchment will decrease FRP levels further. The commercial fishery and lake hatchery also provides opportunities to control algal biomass through biomanipulation measures.

J	Veals, PG; Steenburgh, WJ				Veals, Peter G.; Steenburgh, W. James			Climatological Characteristics and Orographic Enhancement of Lake-Effect Precipitation East of Lake Ontario and over the Tug Hill Plateau	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Lake-effect snowstorms east of Lake Ontario are frequently intense and contribute to substantial seasonal accumulations, especially over the Tug Hill Plateau (hereafter Tug Hill), which rises at a gentle 1.25% slope to similar to 500 m above lake level. Using a variety of datasets including radar imagery from the KTYX (Fort Drum, New York) WSR-88D, this paper examines the characteristics of lake-effect precipitation east of Lake Ontario over 13 cool seasons (16 September 2001-15 May 2014). During this period, days with at least 2 h of lake effect account for 61%-76% of the mean cool-season snowfall and 24%-37% of the mean cool-season liquid precipitation. Mean monthly lake-effect frequency and snowfall peak in December and January. The highest lake-effect frequency and snowfall occur over the western and upper Tug Hill, with an arm of relatively high lake-effect frequency and snowfall extending to the southeast shore of Lake Ontario. To the east (lee), lake-effect frequency and snowfall decrease abruptly over the Black River valley, although relatively high frequency and snowfall extend downstream into the western Adirondack Mountains. Broad coverage and long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) bands dominate the lake-effect morphology throughout the region. There is no diurnal modulation of lake-effect frequency during winter, but weak modulation in fall and spring, especially of LLAP bands. Collectively, these results quantify the role that lake effect plays in the cool-season hydroclimate east of Lake Ontario. The increase in lake-effect frequency and snowfall over Tug Hill suggest an inland/orographic intensification of many lake-effect systems, with evidence for shadowing in the lee.

J	Jiang, JK; Wu, J; Liu, XH				Jiang Jian-kai; Wu Jing; Liu Xue-hua			Fluorescence Properties of Lake Water	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												Fluorescence spectrum technique has advantages of high sensitivity, high selectivity and quick-and-easy detection, and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) can provide abundant information. Fluorescence spectrum is unique for each water sample and is named as "fluorescence fingerprint". In the present paper, excitation-emission matrix was used to study the variability of water quality from spring to winter of two neighboring lakes in an urban park in Beijing. There was typical protein-like and humic-like fluorescence in the EEMs of the two lakes and the intensity of the protein-like fluorescence was significantly stronger. The close relationships between the fluorescence intensities and natural/anthropogenic activities showed that the water quality changed obviously with the season: the water quality in spring and summer was better than in autumn and winter. Natural factor like the growth of algae and plants etc was the major impact factor for the lake for pleasure boats, and anthropogenic factor such as planting was significantly important for the lake with ornamental plants. So the variability of water quality of lake is determined by the function of lake. To remove the remains of algae and plants in spring and autumn benefits the water quality of the lakes.																			1000-0593					JUN	2010	30	6					1525	1529		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2010)06-1525-05	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2010)06-1525-05								20707143					WOS:000278580200019

HNAN abundance peaked in spring. summer and autumn. falling to lowest num bers during the winter. Numbers ranged between 0 and 50.9 x 10(4) l(-1). Bacterioplankton abundance was highest during the late summer and then fell progressively towards winter and autumn (range 1.19-4.46 x 10(8) I-1). In contrast to numbers, mean cell volumes (MCV) of the bacteria reached their highest in spring, and consequently highest bacterial biomass occurred at this lime. MCV ranged between 0.052 and 0.224 mu m(3). Bacterial production measurements following the incorporation of [H-3]thymidine into DNA and [C-14]leucine into protein using a doubling-labelling procedure were undertaken in January, June, August, October and November. Rates varied between 2,8 and 52 ng C I-1 h(-1). On occasions, a significant difference in production rates based on the uptake of leucine and thymidine was observed, suggesting unbalanced growth. Highest rates of production coincided with times of high dissolved organic carbon levels in the water column and lowest production with low levels of DOG. HNAN grazing rates were measured by following the uptake of fluorescently labelled bacteria and averaged 4.8 bacterial cells individual(-1) day(-1) at 2 and 4 degrees C. Specific growth rates (h(-1)) ranged around 0.00070-0.00077 in both the field and laboratory, giving doubling times of 37.3 and 41.0 days, respectively. These low rates of grazing and growth indicate that there is no adaptation to low temperatures in these freshwater protists. Based on these data, the gross production efficiency is 24%. HNAN removed between 0.1 and 9.7% of bacterial production per day.																			0142-7873					SEP	1995	17	9					1835	1850		10.1093/plankt/17.9.1835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/17.9.1835													WOS:A1995RZ33000008

The results showed that the internal re-lease of As from the reservoir sediments is mainly due to the reduction of iron oxide and the release of adsorbed As(V). The average proportion of As(III) increased from 27.2% in autumn to 46.5% in summer, 68.9% in winter, and up to 70.8% in spring. In spring and summer, the high concentration of As(III) and organic arsenic in the epilimnion under phosphorus restriction was caused by the reductive metabolism of phytoplankton after intake of As(V). The arsenic species in the metalimnion were mainly affected by the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). In summer and autumn, As-oxidizing bacteria used As(III) as an electron donor, and nitrate played an im-portant role as an electron acceptor, maintaining the dominance of As(V) in the hypolimnion. However, in winter and spring, temperature-controlled ORP was the main process, which was dominated by As(III). In conclusion, As species show annual cycles in different layers of seasonally thermal stratified reservoirs. It provides a systematic mechanism of As species transformation in reservoirs, especially the effect of biological transformation mechanism. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A total of 8,419 specimens weighting 182.3 kg and belonging to 9 species were caught. Catch composition differed with season. Thus, Rhodeus meridionalis dominated in terms of NPUE the spring, Perca fluviatilis the summer and Alburnus macedonicus the autumn and winter catches. Cyprinids were generally the most abundant, with the cyprinids:percids biomass ratio ranging from 1.7 in summer to 14.8 in winter, supporting the eutrophic character of the lake. Richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity and evenness indices differed seasonally (ANOVA,.p < 0.05). The abundance-biomass comparative (ABC) curves showed that fish communities were dominated by one or a few opportunistic species (e.g. Rhodeus meridionalis, Alburnus macedonicus), which while dominated in number did not dominate in biomass, being small bodied.

Large mixotrophic ciliates (Stentor araucanus, S. amethystinus and Ophrydium naumanni) were a characteristic component of a temperate, oligotrophic take in North Patagonia. During a 1-year study, the abundance, biomass and primary production of these large Chlorella-bearing ciliates were compared with those of the total plankton community. 2. Mixotrophic ciliates peaked in spring and from late summer to autumn, accounting for 1.6-43% (annual average: 16.3%) and 67-99% (annual average: 92%) of total ciliate abundance and biomass, respectively. Their contribution to total zooplankton biomass, including flagellates, rotifers, ciliates and crustaceans, was 14-76%, or 47% as an annual average. Endosymbiotic algae accounted for up to 25% of total autotrophic biomass (annual mean: 3.9%). 3. Maximum cell-specific photosynthetic rates of S. araucanus and S. amethystinus at light saturation varied between 80 and 4400 pg C ciliate(-1) h(-1) with high values during autumn and winter, and low values during summer. The depth-integrated rates of photosynthesis (0-40 m) of algal endosymbionts contributed 1-25% to total photosynthesis (annual mean: 6.5%). 4. A comparison of calculated ingestion rates with photosynthetic rates of Stentor indicates that photosynthate produced by endosymbionts generally exceeded heterotrophic food supply of Stentor during autumn and winter, but was much lower during summer, when food supply was high. 5. The mixotrophic ciliates represent an important 'link' between nanoplankton and higher trophic levels within the plankton community because of their high heterotrophic biomass and considerable contribution to total photosynthesis.

The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that the abundance of planktonic groups of organisms in temperate lakes can be higher during winter under ice cover than during the ice-free seasons. Physical (ice/snow cover, temperature), chemical (organic carbon, chlorophyll a, phosphorus, nitrogen) and biological parameters (phytoplankton, protozooplankton, zooplankton) were investigated in three eutrophic lakes during two consecutive years in winter, spring, summer and autumn. The results of this study showed that in all lakes chlorophyll a concentrations were usually lower in winter than in other seasons, while total nitrogen concentrations were higher in winter than in autumn. All groups of planktonic organisms were able to reach similar or even higher abundances in winter under-ice than in other ice-free periods, depending on the lake morphometry and the year of the study. Winter taxonomic structure of phytoplankton was similar to the spring (medium-sized Lake Dga Wielki with the dominance of cryptophytes), summer (small-sized Lake Dga May with cyanobacteria as a dominant group) or autumn (the shallow lake with the dominance of diatoms) structure, depending on the lake. In all lakes, the structure of the ciliate community was the most similar to that of the spring with the clear dominance of Oligotrichida. Our results show that some species among all the studied groups of organisms can lead an active and dynamic life under the ice cover.

J	Aquilina, L; Ladouche, B; Dörfliger, N				Aquilina, L; Ladouche, B; Dörfliger, N			Recharge processes in karstic systems investigated through the correlation of chemical and isotopic composition of rain and spring-waters	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Four karstic springs in southern France, along with rainwater in the same area, were monitored during two hydrological cycles. Stable isotopic ratios (delta O-18 and delta D) allow the contribution of the rain waters from the previous periods (discretised as winter or summer period) to the spring water to be estimated. These Computations indicate that heavy rainfall events during the autumn season contribute for 56 +/- 7% and 68 +/- 9% of the spring water discharge during the following winter and summer seasons, respectively. During the low flow period, residence time does not exceed 1 hydrological cycle, for a large part of the water. Stable isotopic ratios (delta O-18 and delta D) combined with Cl concentration allow the evapotranspiration coefficients to be estimated although the recharge surface is not known and hydrological balance can not be computed. Except for one spring, the evapotranspiration coefficients range from 0.54 to 0.38 (46-62% volume reduction), even during the high flow period. The short residence times, and the strong evapotranspiration coefficients whatever the period (winter or summer) are interpreted as the result of the major role of the epikarst reservoir in the karst recharge functioning over direct or diffuse infiltration.

However, it is generally not easy to illustrate the interactions between phytoplankton biomass and related environmental variables given their high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. To elucidate relationships between them, in a eutrophic shallow lake, Taihu Lake, relative long-term data set of biotic and abiotic parameters of water quality in the lake were conducted using multivariate statistical analysis within seasonal periodicity. The results indicate that water temperature and total phosphorus (TP) played governing roles in phytoplankton dynamics in most seasons (i.e. temperature in winter, spring and summer; TP in spring, summer and autumn); COD (chemical oxygen demand) and BOD (biological oxygen demand) presented significant positive relationships with phytoplankton biomass in spring, summer and autumn. However, a complex interplay was found between phytoplankton biomass and nitrogen considering significant positive relationships occurring between them in spring and autumn, and conversely negative ones in summer. As the predatory factor, zooplankton presented significant grazing-pressure on phytoplankton biomass during surnmer in view of negative relationship between them in the season. Significant feedback effects of phytoplankton development were identified in summer and autumn in view that significant relationships were observed between phytoplankton biomass and pH, Trans (transparency of water) and DO. The results indicate that interactions between phytoplankton biomass and related environmental variables are highly sensitive to seasonal periodicity, which improves understanding of different roles of biotic and abiotic variables upon phytoplankton variability, and hence, advances management methods for eutrophic lakes.

The changes in abundance of Asterionella formosa in the South Basin of Windermere between 1946 and 1990 are described and analysed. The average seasonal cycle for the 45-year period shows an overwintering population of about 10 cell ml(-1) which increases with an exponential rate of 0.09 log(e) day(-1) to an annual maximum of 4000 cell ml(-1) by about Day 124. There is then a rapid decline at an exponential rate of loss of 0.29 log(e) day(-1) to values which typically are less than 0.01 cell ml(-1) in mid-summer. By about Day 240 a second period of rapid increase occurs with an exponential rate of increase of 0.18 log(e) day(-1) to a plateau of about 7 cell ml(-1) in late autumn and early winter. 2. This average pattern is subject to considerable year-to-year variation. The timing and extent of the increase in the autumn was particularly variable. The rate of increase in the spring was strongly positively correlated, and that in the autumn strongly negatively correlated, with the day at which the exponential phase started. Rates for these two phases of increase were not statistically different when expressed in terms of time from mid-summer, which reinforces earlier conclusions that light availability is the main factor governing the rate of spring increase and suggests that this is also the case for the autumn increase. 3. Eight descriptors of seasonal development showed statistically significant changes over the 45 years. Early winter populations declined from 27 to 4 cell ml(-1), and linked to this the day at which cell concentrations exceeded 50 cell ml(-1) occurred later by 24 days from Day 54 in 1946 to 78 in 1990. The lower early winter population appears to be linked to a lower end of year population as this decreased between 1946 and 1968 from 46 to 2 cell ml(-1), and then increased slightly to 7 cell ml(-1) in 1990. The start of the spring exponential increase occurred on Day 57 in 1946 and started earlier by 19 days in 1968 but then occurred later, at Day 76, in 1990. The duration of the spring increase got shorter by 23 days, from 67 days in 1946 to 44 days in 1990. The maximum rate of increase rose from 0.065 log(e) day(-1) in 1946 to 0.112 log(e) day(-1) in 1990. The annual maximum declined from 9863 cell ml(-1) in 1946 to 2278 cell ml(-1) in 1968 and then increased to 6159 cell ml(-1) in 1990. The annual geometric mean decreased from 61 cell ml(-1) in 1946 to 5 cell ml(-1) in 1968 and remained nearly constant subsequently. 4. In many cases, the precise underlying causes of these changes were not apparent. However, the increase with time of rate of increase in the spring appeared to be linked to a later start and hence growth under higher light. There was no significant cyclical change in any of the descriptors studied.

Gut length, adjusted for total body length, was significantly higher in spring than in other seasons for all the three species. Seasonal changes in gut length were not associated with changes in food quality. Weight of fore-gut contents, adjusted for body weight, was significantly higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn in H. swinhonis and C. giurinus, and significantly higher in autumn than in spring and summer for P. parva. Percentage of empty fore-guts was highest in summer and lowest in spring for I-I. swinhonis and C. giurinus, and highest in winter and lowest in autumn for P. parva. Diet of the three small fishes showed apparent seasonal changes, and these changes reflected partly the seasonal fluctuations of food resources in environment. Diet breadth was high in winter and low in autumn for H. swinhonis, high in winter and low in spring and summer for C. giurinus, and high in autumn and low in spring for P. parva. Diet overlaps between pairs of species were biologically significant in most cases, except between H. swinhonis and P. parva in summer and autumn and between C. giurinus and P. parva in autumn.

Drought and flood events are the primary disasters in Heilongjiang Province and have considerable impacts on agriculture. In this study, relatively complete monthly precipitation data from 26 meteorological stations in Heilongjiang Province during the period of 1958-2013 were analyzed using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) combined with principal component analysis, Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Morlet wavelet analysis to determine the spatial and temporal distributions of drought and flood events in this province. The results were as follows: (1) the whole of Heilongjiang exhibited an aridity trend. In northern Heilongjiang, spring and summer experienced a wetting trend, and autumn and winter experienced an aridity trend. (2) The SPI3 exhibited 8- and 16-year periodic variation characteristics in spring, 10- and 22-year periodic variation characteristics in summer, and 10- and 32-year periodic variation characteristics in autumn. In addition to the 10-year periodic variation characteristics in winter, other periodic variation characteristics were observed. (3) The increasing trend in the percentage of stations affected by flood was more obvious than that affected by drought. Therefore, Heilongjiang Province is more vulnerable to flooding. (4) The influence of drought and flood disasters in Heilongjiang Province showed a growth trend, but the flood effect was more remarkable. (5) The agricultural area affected by drought and flood disasters in Heilongjiang Province showed an increasing trend. Although there was a greater increase in flood disaster area, the main types of disasters were drought-dominated.					; CUI, SONG/P-5328-2018	Fu, Qiang/0000-0003-4100-2777; 													1436-3240	1436-3259				OCT	2018	32	10					2913	2931		10.1007/s00477-018-1543-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-018-1543-z													WOS:000446064000012

This is a serious problem since the water area represents one-third of the drainage basin. Here, satellite-based rain estimates were combined with min gauge measurements to estimate summer lake rainfall. Hourly estimates were made from GOES imagery for the summers of 1988, 1989, and 1990, and accumulated over monthly and summer-seasons. Area-averaged gauge-measured rainfall from local rain gauge networks were used to adjust the satellite-based estimates. Resulting best estimates of mean-summer rainfall for Lakes Michigan, Superior, and Huron were 22.66, 23.83, and 18.80 cm, respectively. These mean-summer values were 1 to 5% different from those computed using the shoreline-gauge technique, which is the current operational method for estimating lake rainfall. Estimates for individual summers were 1 to 17% different from those computed using shoreline gauges. Considering the gauge measurements as the standard, the mean absolute error of monthly gauge-adjusted lake rainfall was 21%, whereas the mean monthly error was only 2%. These results suggest that gauge-adjusted satellite estimates of rainfall could provide a useful measure of summer lake rainfall that may improve input to Great Lakes water balance and hydrologic prediction models. Other analyses were used to quantify the effects of the lakes on summer rainfall. Generally, they revealed lake-induced rain minima over and downwind of the lakes.					; Augustine, John/AAG-8203-2019	Augustine, John/0000-0002-6645-7404; 													0380-1330						1994	20	4					683	700		10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71187-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71187-4													WOS:A1994PX45300008

The picophytoplankton were composed of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs), phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-cells) and singlecell Microcystis. They accounted for a maximum of 70% of the total plankton chlorophyll a concentrations during a period of non-cyanobacterial blooms in winter and spring. The PPEs were the most abundant group ranging from 2.2 to 199.5 x 10(3) cells mL(-1) in the two lakes. The PC-cells were less abundant (average abundance: 1.6 x 10(4) cells mL(-1)). Pronounced temporal and spatial patterns of picophytoplankton composition and abundance were observed and PPEs were dominant in winter and spring while PC-cells prevailed in summer and autumn. The statistical analysis demonstrated that this population succession was explained by different environmental factors. PPEs were more correlated with physical parameters (temperature, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen and pH) and less linked to nutrient changes, whereas PC-cells were closely related to nutrient conditions and disappeared with high nutrient concentrations. Ultimately, Microcystis single cells were detected mainly in the late spring and autumn, and thus, the detection of these Microcystis forms by flow cytometry suggests a potential method to monitor cyanobacterial blooms in these lakes for early warning signals.

Their increase in abundance followed a high egg ratio, suggesting that the increase in abundance was caused by a high reproductive rate. Major contributors to mysid population decreases include fish predation and commercial fisheries and possible horizontal migration of the mysids. N. intermedia showed 2 types of life history in the lake. One type (overwintering generation) has a life span of about 6-7 mo. and produces about 27 eggs/brood. Another, appearing from spring-autumn, matures in 3-6 wk at a smaller size, and produces 12 eggs/brood.

J	Hejduková, E; Elster, J; Nedbalová, L				Hejdukova, Eva; Elster, Josef; Nedbalova, Linda			Annual Cycle of Freshwater Diatoms in the High Arctic Revealed by Multiparameter Fluorescent Staining	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) are important primary producers in a wide range of hydro-terrestrial habitats in polar regions that are characterized by many extreme environmental conditions. Nevertheless, how they survive periods of drought and/or freeze remains unknown. A general strategy of microorganisms to overcome adverse conditions is dormancy, but morphologically distinct diatom resting stages are rare. This study aimed to evaluate the annual cycle of freshwater diatoms in the High Arctic (Central Spitsbergen) and provide an insight into their physiological cell status variability. The diversity and viability of diatom cells were studied in samples collected five times at four study sites, tracing the key events for survival (summer vegetative season, autumn dry-freezing, winter freezing, spring melting, summer vegetative season [again]). For viability evaluation, a multiparameter fluorescent staining was used in combination with light microscopy and allowed to reveal the physiological status at a single-cell level. The proportions of the cell categories were seasonally and locality dependent. The results suggested that a significant portion of vegetative cells survive winter and provide an inoculum for the following vegetative season. The ice thickness significantly influenced spring survival. The thicker the ice layer was, the more dead cells and fewer other stages were observed. The influence of the average week max-min temperature differences in autumn and winter was not proven.

It is well accepted that fish, if abundant, can have a major impact on the zooplankton community structure during summer, which, particularly in eutrophic lakes, may cascade to phytoplankton and ultimately influence water clarity. Fish predation affects mean size of cladocerans and the zooplankton grazing pressure on phytoplankton. Little is, however, known about the role of fish during winter. 2. We analysed data from 34 lakes studied for 8-9 years divided into three seasons: summer, autumn/spring and winter, and four lake classes: all lakes, shallow lakes without submerged plants, shallow lakes with submerged plants and deep lakes. We recorded how body weight of Daphnia and then cladocerans varied among the three seasons. For all lake types there was a significant positive correlation in the mean body weight of Daphnia and all cladocerans between the different seasons, and only in lakes with macrophytes did the slope differ significantly from one (winter versus summer for Daphnia). 3. These results suggest that the fish predation pressure during autumn/spring and winter is as high as during summer, and maybe even higher during winter in macrophyte-rich lakes. It could be argued that the winter zooplankton community structure resembles that of the summer community because of low specimen turnover during winter mediated by low fecundity, which, in turn, reflects food shortage, low temperatures and low winter hatching from resting eggs. However, we found frequent major changes in mean body weight of Daphnia and cladocerans in three fish-biomanipulated lakes during the winter season. 4. The seasonal pattern of zooplankton : phytoplankton biomass ratio showed no correlation between summer and winter for shallow lakes with abundant vegetation or for deep lakes. For the shallow lakes, the ratio was substantially higher during summer than in winter and autumn/spring, suggesting a higher zooplankton grazing potential during summer, while the ratio was often higher in winter in deep lakes. Direct and indirect effects of macrophytes, and internal P loading and mixing, all varying over the season, might weaken the fish signal on this ratio. 5. Overall, our data indicate that release of fish predation may have strong cascading effects on zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton and water clarity in temperate, coastal situated eutrophic lakes, not only during summer but also during winter.

Cell numbers varied seasonally and vertically over four orders of magnitude (10(2) to 10(6) cells ml-1). A horizontal variation by a factor of 3 in abundance and biomass across the different parts of the lake was found during summer stratification. Picoplankton peaks occurred during the phytoplankton spring bloom and in late summer. Low values were characteristic for the clear-water phase in early summer and for autumn-winter. This seasonal pattern differed from that of larger phytoplankton in Lake Constance and from the seasonal distribution of picoplankton known from other lakes and marine environments. Picoplankton was predominated by chroococcoid cyanobacteia of about 0.6-mu-m3 biovolume. The average cell size increased from winter until early summer. Using HPLC pigment analysis, we identified zeaxanthin and beta-carotene as typical picoplankton pigments. Results of the pigment analyses suggest that algae others than picocyano-bacteria may be more prominent in the picoplankton size class than derived from routine epifluorescence counting.

However, studies specific to the effects of water level fluctuations on distribution and composition of macrophytes are limited in sub-tropical floodplain wetlands of Nepal. This study aimed to examine the association between macrophytes and water levels in the floodplain wetlands of Koshi Tappu, in south-eastern Nepal. Sixty-four samples of macrophyte, along with twelve water quality parameters, five soil parameters and weekly water level information were collected from four shallow wetlands during summer, autumn, winter and spring over 2018 and 2019. Altogether, 52 macrophyte species belonging to 25 families were documented. Of them, 15, 6, 5 and 26 were emergent, submerged, floating and amphibian species, respectively. 10 species (5 emergent, 2 submerged, 2 floating and 1 amphibian species) were common across seasons. Regression analysis showed the decreasing trend in diversity, richness and evenness with increased water levels while at the same time overall macrophyte biomass increased. During summer, high water level supported the growth of floating invasive macrophytes, while medium and low water level during autumn and winter, respectively, supported submerged macrophytes. However, low-water level during spring supported emergent and amphibian macrophyte species. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that water depth and physico-chemical parameters such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, nitrate-nitrogen, and phosphate were highly correlated with macrophyte assemblages across the wetlands. The study elucidated that management of water levels can ensure ecological integrity of wetlands and hence maintain biodiversity, and provide key indicators of water quality change.					; Doody, Tanya M/C-6890-2011; doody, tanya/C-6890-2011; Cuddy, Susan/B-5788-2011	Cuddy, Susan/0000-0003-3905-9491; Doody, Tanya M/0000-0001-6359-5329; Regmi, Tika/0000-0001-9209-7572; Shah, Deep Narayan/0000-0001-8436-7560													0304-3770	1879-1522				JUL	2021	173								103413	10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.103413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.103413		JUN 2021											WOS:000672446500010

This analysis suggests that open-water Lake Superior summer temperatures have increased by roughly 3.5 degrees C over the last century, most of that warming occurring in the last three decades. Correspondingly, the length of the positively stratified season has increased from 145 d to 170 d. The observed amount of warming is greater than the observed change in regional temperature over the same time period by roughly a factor of two. The discrepancy can be understood in the context of reduced winter ice cover, and implies that spatially and temporally averaged ice cover in Lake Superior has decreased from 23% to 12% over the last century.					; Colman, Steven/E-4658-2012	Colman, Steve/0000-0002-0564-9576; Austin, Jay/0000-0002-3580-1794; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2008	53	6					2724	2730		10.4319/lo.2008.53.6.2724	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2008.53.6.2724													WOS:000261355500033

Trends and abrupt changes in 104 years of ice cover and water temperature in a dimictic lake in response to air temperature, wind speed, and water clarity drivers	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The one-dimensional hydrodynamic ice model, DYRESM-WQ-I, was modified to simulate ice cover and thermal structure of dimictic Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, over a continuous 104-year period (1911-2014). The model results were then used to examine the drivers of changes in ice cover and water temperature, focusing on the responses to shifts in air temperature, wind speed, and water clarity at multiyear timescales. Observations of the drivers include a change in the trend of warming air temperatures from 0.081 degrees C per decade before 1981 to 0.334 degrees C per decade thereafter, as well as a shift in mean wind speed from 4.44 ms(-1) before 1994 to 3.74 ms(-1) thereafter. Observations show that Lake Mendota has experienced significant changes in ice cover: later ice-on date(9.0 days later per century), earlier ice-off date (12.3 days per century), decreasing ice cover duration (21.3 days per century), while model simulations indicate a change in maximum ice thickness (12.7 cm decrease per century). Model simulations also show changes in the lake thermal regime of earlier stratification onset (12.3 days per century), later fall turnover (14.6 days per century), longer stratification duration (26.8 days per century), and decreasing summer hypolimnetic temperatures (-1.4 degrees C per century). Correlation analysis of lake variables and driving variables revealed ice cover variables, stratification onset, epilimnetic temperature, and hypolimnetic temperature were most closely correlated with air temperature, whereas freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic heating, and fall turnover date were more closely correlated with wind speed. Each lake variable (i.e., ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover duration, maximum ice thickness, freeze-over water temperature, stratification onset, fall turnover date, stratification duration, epilimnion temperature, hypolimnion temperature, and hypolimnetic heating) was averaged for the three periods (1911-1980, 1981-1993, and 1994-2014) delineated by abrupt changes in air temperature and wind speed. Average summer hypolimnetic temperature and fall turnover date exhibit significant differences between the third period and the first two periods. Changes in ice cover (ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover duration, and maximum ice thickness) exhibit an abrupt change after 1994, which was related in part to the warm El Nino winter of 1997-1998. Under-ice water temperature, freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic temperature, fall turnover date, and stratification duration demonstrate a significant difference in the third period (1994-2014), when air temperature was warmest and wind speeds decreased rather abruptly. The trends in ice cover and water temperature demonstrate responses to both long-term and abrupt changes in meteorological conditions that can be complemented with numerical modeling to better understand how these variables will respond in a future climate.

We examined the magnitude and changes of E and its drivers over Lake Erie-the shallowest and most southern lake of the Laurentian Great Lakes. We deployed two eddy-covariance tower sites in the western Lake Erie Basin-one located nearshore (CB) and one offshore (LI)-from September 2011 through May 2016. Monthly E varied from 5 to 120 mm, with maximum E occurring in August-October. The annual E was 635 +/- 42 (+/- SD) mm at CB and 604 +/- 32 mm at LI. Mean winter (October-March) E was 189 +/- 61 mm at CB and 178 +/- 25 mm at LI, accounting for 29.8% and 29.4% of annual E. Mean daily E was 1.8 mm during the coldest month (January) and 7.4 mm in the warmest month (July). Monthly E exhibited a strong positive linear relationship to the product of wind speed and vapor pressure deficit. Pronounced seasonal patterns in surface energy fluxes were observed with a 2-month lag in E from R-n, due to the lake's heat storage. This lag was shorter than reports regarding other Great Lakes. Difference in E between the offshore and nearshore sites reflected within-lake spatial heterogeneity, likely attributable to climatic and bathymetric differences between them. These findings suggest that predictive models need to consider lake-specific heat storage and spatial heterogeneity in order to accurately simulate lake E and its seasonal dynamics.					shao, changliang/ACG-3396-2022; Chu, Housen/Q-6517-2016; Yang, Zutao/LSL-2505-2024; Chen, Jiquan/D-1955-2009; Stepien, Carol/GWU-8631-2022	Chu, Housen/0000-0002-8131-4938; Yang, Zutao/0000-0002-6919-569X; Chen, Jiquan/0000-0003-0761-9458; 														2333-5084				NOV	2020	7	11							e2020EA001091	10.1029/2020EA001091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001091								33381614					WOS:000595886000014
J	Laird, NF; Kristovich, DAR				Laird, NF; Kristovich, DAR			Comparison of observations with idealized model results for a method to resolve winter lake-effect mesoscale morphology	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Forecasters in the Great Lakes region have for several decades recognized a general relationship of wind speed and overlake fetch to lake-effect snowstorm morphology. A recent study using idealized mesoscale model simulations of lake-effect conditions over circular and elliptical lakes showed the ratio of wind speed to maximum fetch distance (U/L) may be used to effectively predict lake-effect snowstorm morphology. The current investigation provides an assessment of the U/L criteria using observational datasets. Previously published Great Lakes lake-effect snowstorm observational studies were used to identify events of known mesoscale morphology. Hindcasts of nearly 640 lake-effect events were performed using historical observations with U/L as the predictor. Results show that the quantity U/L contains important information on the different mesoscale lake-effect morphologies; however, it provides only a limited benefit when being used to predict mesoscale morphology in real lake-effect situations. The U/L criteria exhibited the greatest probability of detecting lake-effect shoreline band events, often the most intense, but also experienced a relatively large number of false hindcasts. For Lakes Erie and Ontario the false hindcasts and biases were reduced and shoreline band events that occurred under higher wind speed conditions were better identified. In addition, the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory ice cover digital dataset was used in combination with observations from past events to assess the impact of ice cover on the use of U/L as a predictor of lake-effect morphology. Results show that hindcasts using the U/L criteria were slightly improved when the reduction of open-water areas due to lake ice cover was taken into account.

Herein the authors investigate the enhancement of lake-effect snowfall over Tug Hill during IOP2b of the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign. During the 24-h study period, total liquid precipitation equivalent along the axis of maximum precipitation increased from 33.5 mm at a lowland (145 m MSL) site to 62.5 mm at an upland (385 m MSL) site, the latter yielding 101.5 cm of snow. However, the ratio of upland to lowland precipitation, or orographic ratio, varied with the mode of lake-effect precipitation. Strongly organized long-lake-axis parallel bands, some of which formed in association with the approach or passage of upper-level short-wave troughs, produced the highest precipitation rates but the smallest orographic ratios. Within these bands, radar echoes were deepest and strongest over Lake Ontario and the coastal lowlands and decreased in depth and median intensity over Tug Hill. In contrast, nonbanded broad-coverage periods exhibited the smallest precipitation rates and the largest orographic ratios, the latter reflecting an increase in the coverage and frequency of radar echoes over Tug Hill. These findings should aid operational forecasts and, given the predominance of broad-coverage lake-effect periods during the cool season, help explain the climatological snowfall maximum found over the Tug Hill Plateau.					; Minder, Justin/K-5813-2017	Campbell, Leah/0000-0001-6601-8770; Steenburgh, Jim/0000-0003-1028-4230; Minder, Justin/0000-0001-7182-7898													0027-0644	1520-0493				MAY	2016	144	5					1729	1748		10.1175/MWR-D-15-0412.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-15-0412.1													WOS:000376127300002

Water samples were collected in winter (January), spring (March), summer (July) and fall (November) in 2011. The study revealed that physicochemical parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), NH4+-N and nitrate as nitrogen were closely related with the distribution of AB and DNB. Seasonally, the levels of AB presents gradually upward trend from winter to summer, and declines in fall and DNB were higher in spring and fall than summer and lowest in winter. Spatially, the annual average of AB among 10 lakes and reservoirs showed insignificant difference (P>0.05), for DNB, Udalianchi and Lianhuan Lake were lower than others (P<0.05). Regression correlation analysis showed that the levels of AB and DNB had a close relationship with nitrogen nutrition. Three principal components were identified of total variances which are conditionally classified by the natural' factor (PC1) and nitrogen nutrients' (PC2, PC3). According the principal component scores, cluster analysis detected two distinct groups: (C1) mainly affected by nitrogen nutrients and (C2) natural environmental factors.

SEASONAL INFLUENCE OF REED (PHRAGMITES AUSTRALIS) AND LOTUS (NELUMBO NUCIFERA) ON URBAN WETLAND OF YI RIVER	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Our research objective was to compare the eutrophication inhibition of reeds and lotuses on water body of wetland system of Yi River, evaluate ecological benefits of the two wetland systems, and reveal the response mechanism of water environmental factors, which not only has ecological theoretical significance, but also has extensive practical application value in the management and evaluation of wetland water ecosystem of Yi River. Three research sample plots were set up in Yimeng Lake of Yi River: reed water area, lotus water area and natural water area. In August (summer), October (autumn), December (winter) of 2018 and February 2019 (spring), subsurface water samples were collected and analyzed by laboratory detection for pH, chromaticity, total hardness, dissolved oxygen, BOD, COD, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrate and chlorophyll a. Research results were as follows: 1) pH appeared as that of lotus water area > natural water area > reed water area, chromaticity appeared as that of natural water area > reed water area > lotus water area. Total hardness appeared as that of natural water area > lotus water area > reed water area, dissolved oxygen appeared as reed water area > lotus water area > natural water area. BOD appeared as that of lotus water area > natural water area > reed water area, COD appeared as that of lotus water area > natural water area > reed water area Ammonia nitrogen appeared as that of reed water area > lotus water area > natural water area, total nitrogen appeared as that of natural water area > lotus water area > reed water area, total phosphorus appeared as that of reed water area > natural water area > lotus water area, nitrate appeared as that of natural water area > lotus water area > reed water area, and chlorophyll a appeared as that of lotus water area > natural water area > reed water area. 2) pH appeared as that of winter > spring > summer > autumn, chromaticity appeared as that of summer > autumn > winter > spring. Total hardness appeared as that of winter > autumn > spring > summer, dissolved oxygen appeared as that of spring > summer > winter > autumn. BOD appeared as that of spring > winter > autumn > summer, COD appeared as that of autumn > summer > winter > spring Ammonia nitrogen appeared as that of winter > spring > autumn > summer, total nitrogen appeared as that of spring > summer > autumn > winter, total phosphorus appeared as that of winter > spring > autumn > summer, nitrate appeared as that of spring > summer > autumn > winter, and chlorophyll a appeared as that of autumn > summer > spring > winter. Our research conclusion is that reed can effectively increase dissolved oxygen and greatly reduce BOD, COD, total nitrogen, nitrate and chlorophyll a. Lotus can effectively increase pH, BOD, COD, chlorophyll a, and greatly reduce total phosphorus. It is recommended to increase reed community area and try to expand lotus community in the water areas with severe phosphorus load.					; GAO, YUAN/W-9920-2019	Gao, Yuan/0000-0001-8018-058X; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	4					7891	7900		10.15666/aeer/1704_78917900	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1704_78917900													WOS:000478066700047

R.; Bard, Luke; Stoecker, Leslie; Geerts, Bart			Influence of Lake Erie on a Lake Ontario Lake-Effect Snowstorm	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Annual lake-effect snowstorms, which develop through surface buoyant instability and upward moisture transport from the Laurentian Great Lakes, lead to important local increases in snowfall to the south and east. Surface wind patterns during cold-air outbreaks often result in areas where the air is modified by more than one Great Lake. While it is known that boundary layer air that has crossed multiple lakes can produce particularly intense snow, few observations are available on the process by which this occurs. This study examines unique observations taken during the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field project to document the process by which Lake Erie influenced snowfall that was produced over Lake Ontario on 28 January 2014. During the event, lake-effect clouds and snow that developed over Lake Erie extended northeastward toward Lake Ontario. OWLeS and operational observations showed that the clouds from Lake Erie disappeared (and snow greatly decreased) as they approached the Lake Ontario shoreline. This clear-air zone was due to mesoscale subsidence, apparently due to the divergence of winds moving from land to the smoother lake surface. However, the influence of Lake Erie in producing a deeper lake-effect boundary layer, thicker clouds, increased turbulence magnitudes, and heavier snow was identified farther downwind over Lake Ontario. It is hypothesized that the combination of a low-stability, high-moisture boundary layer as well as convective eddies and limited snow particles crossing the mesoscale subsidence region locally enhanced the lake-effect system over Lake Ontario within the plume of air originating over Lake Erie.

Trophic overlap between native and invasive stream crayfish	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We examined trophic dynamics of a stream food web where invasive Orconectes neglectus appear to be displacing native O. eupunctus in the Spring River drainage of the Ozark Highlands, Missouri and Arkansas, USA. We collected crayfish species and possible food sources seasonally from a site of sympatry on the South Fork Spring River. We determined diet overlap and potential for competition between O. eupunctus and O. neglectus, and investigated seasonal variation using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses and gut content analyses. Gut content analysis showed both species of crayfish consumed mainly detritus during summer and spring, with other prey categories varying by species and season. Stable isotope analysis showed that O. eupunctus and O. neglectus relied on invertebrates as a major energy and nutrient source throughout summer, autumn, and spring, and the two species showed differences in their stable isotope signatures during spring and summer, but not autumn. Given the trophic overlap between O. eupunctus and O. neglectus, there is a potential for the two species to compete for food and to be ecologically redundant. Ecological redundancy can lead to reduced effects on ecosystem function post-invasion, and therefore examining ecological redundancy of potential invaders should be a conservation priority.					; Magoulick, Daniel/AAG-1556-2020	Magoulick, Daniel/0000-0001-9665-5957; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2016	766	1					237	246		10.1007/s10750-015-2457-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2457-0													WOS:000367196900018

Home ranges were significantly smaller in winter than during summer for both males and females combined. Neither fish size or sex influenced home range size. Flathead catfish used substrates with a hard bottom, such as gravel, rocks, and large boulders, during all seasons and woody cover, such as standing timber and artificial structures, during all seasons except winter. Flathead catfish were found at shallower depths in spring and summer (1.0-4.9 m) than during late fall and winter (>5.0 m). Flathead catfish moved to deeper water in late fall when mean surface temperatures were between 14.0 and 22.0degreesC. Our results suggest that flathead catfish movement decreased during winter and that hard substrates are important habitat for this species.																			0275-5947					NOV	2001	21	4					792	800		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0792:SVIHRS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0792:SVIHRS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289300009

Seasonal and decadal patterns in Discostella (Bacillariophyceae) species from bi-weekly records of two boreal lakes (Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario, Canada)	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												A recent rise in the relative abundance of Discostella species (D.stelligera and D.pseudostelligera) has been well documented from sedimentary diatom assemblages across the Northern Hemisphere. This unprecedented change over the last similar to 150years has been linked to rises in atmospheric temperatures, changes in ice cover, and/or increases in thermal stability, among other factors. The bi-weekly monitoring data from two boreal lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in northwestern Ontario were analyzed across seasons (spring, summer, and fall) and decades (1970s-2000s). We found that Discostella species are primarily spring/early summer bloomers (i.e., late April to June) in these lakes and changes in concentrations of Discostella over time were most pronounced in the spring or early summer months. Increases in Discostella abundance over time may be linked to earlier ice-off and a longer period of spring turnover, resulting from increased winter and spring temperatures. It is also possible that a trophic mismatch between the spring diatom bloom and zooplankton is occurring, thus reducing diatom loss rates, and resulting in greater overall abundance. Moreover, the spring dominance of Discostella in our study lakes occurred at a time of the year when nutrient concentrations were at their highest seasonally, suggesting that these taxa are neither limited directly by nutrients, nor responding to enhanced stratification during the summer months in these lakes.																			0022-3646	1529-8817				OCT	2016	52	5					817	826		10.1111/jpy.12443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.12443								27364993					WOS:000387414800011

A study of the diets of the two predatory fish coexisting in a prairie lake, showed overlap in the food items selected in July. Food density did not apepar to be limited. Walleye food consumption rose from about 1% bodyweight in the spring to 2% in late summer and was less than 1% in the late autumn and early winter. Pike food consumption was similar except it rose to over 3% in the early winter when the lake froze over and the water cleared. High turbidity in the prairie lake during the open water period may have reduced the ability of pike to feed.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				SEP	1989	46	9					1581	1586		10.1139/f89-201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-201													WOS:A1989AP88800015

Seasonal and diel effects on acoustic fish biomass estimates: application to a shallow reservoir with untargeted common carp (Cyprinus carpio)	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The aim of the present study was to understand how seasonal fish distributions affect acoustically derived fish biomass estimates in a shallow reservoir in a semi-arid country (Tunisia). To that end, sampling events were performed during four seasons (spring (June), summer (September), autumn (December) and winter (March)) that included day and night surveys. A Simrad EK60 echosounder, equipped with two 120-kHz split-beam transducers for simultaneous horizontal and vertical beaming, was used to sample the entire water column. Surveys during spring and summer and daytime hours of winter were deemed unusable owing to high methane flux from the sediment, and during the day survey of autumn, fish were close to the reservoir bottom leading to low detectability. It follows that acoustic surveys should be conducted only at night during the cold season (December-March) for shallow reservoirs having carp Cyprinus carpio (L.) as the dominant species. Further, night-time biomass estimates during the cold season declined significantly (P < 0.001) from autumn to winter. Based on our autumn night-time survey, overall fish biomass in the Bir-Mcherga Reservoir was high (mean (+/- s.d.) 185 +/- 98 tonnes (Mg)), but annual fishery exploitation is low (19.3-24.1 Mg) because the fish biomass is likely dominated by invasive carp not targeted by fishers. The results suggest that controlling carp would help improve the fishery.

This classification method was used to study the temporal and spatial changes in the phytoplankton communities of Gaozhou Reservoir, which is a large municipal water source in South China. Between January 2015 and December 2017, a total of 155 taxa of phytoplankton that belong to seven phyla were identified. The phytoplankton communities were classified into 28 functional groups, nine of which were considered to be representative functional groups (relative biomass > 10%). Phytoplankton species richness was greater in the summer and autumn than in the winter and spring; cyanobacterial blooms occurred in the spring. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton functional groups was characterized by the occurrence of functional groups P (Staurastrum sp. and Closterium acerosum) and Y (Cryptomonas ovata and Cryptomonas erosa) in the winter and spring, and functional groups NA (Cosmarium sp. and Staurodesmus sp.) and P (Staurastrum sp. and Closterium acerosum) in the summer and autumn. The temperature, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels were the main factors driving seasonal changes in the phytoplankton communities of Gaozhou Reservoir. The functional group M (Microcystis aeruginosa) dominated the community during the cyanobacterial blooms in spring 2016, with the maximum algal cell density of 3.12 x 10(8) cells L-1. Relatively low temperature (20.8 degrees C), high concentrations of phosphorus (0.080-0.110 mg L-1), suitable hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions (e.g., relatively long retention time), and relatively closed geographic location in the reservoir were the key factors that stimulated the cyanobacterial blooms during the early stages.

In order to explore the significance of phytoplankton in protecting ecosystem integrity, the wetland ecosystem in Zhalong wetland, one of the most important international wetlands, was selected as the research area. For the study, 81 sampling sites were set up in the whole wetland, and phytoplankton samples and water quality environmental factors were measured in spring, summer, and autumn of 2019. The phytoplankton community structure and water environmental factors were evaluated by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The main research findings are as follows: a total of 292 species and variants of phytoplankton belonging to 8 phyla and 110 genera were identified within Zhalong wetland in spring, summer, and autumn 2019. The total phytoplankton abundance and biomass in summer were higher than in spring and autumn, and Cyclotella meneghiniana was the most dominant species in three seasons and three areas. The results of random forest are generally consistent with the results of CCA in spring, when the main environmental factors affecting phytoplankton were NTU and WT; the result in summer and autumn agreed with those of CCA, which awaits further study. In addition, the phytoplankton is mainly affected by WT, depth, and DO in the lake area, TP, DO, and NTU in the river area, and WT in the wetland area.

Vertical deposition of Pb through the water column was most pronounced during stratification periods (winter and summer), while during high flow (spring and autumn) Pb was more conservative within the lake. Deposition of particulate Pb was strongly correlated with Al and organic carbon deposition. Increases in metal (Pb and Al) deposition occurred during periods of increasing pH.

Rainbow trout smaller than 250 mm (fork length) ate primarily Daphnia pulicaria during summer and autumn; larger fish were piscivorous throughout the year. Longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys made up the largest fraction of fish prey in the diet of rainbow trout from the nearshore zone during autumn and winter, whereas prickly sculpin Cottus asper (in 1984) and yellow perch Perca flavescens (in 1985) were most important in spring and summer. Rainbow trout in the offshore zone (> 15 m deep) ate mostly longfin smelt in spring and summer. Longfin smelt exhibited a 2-year cycle of abundance that appeared to influence the feeding habits of rainbow trout. During 1984, the adult longfin smelt population was large and provided the major prey of rainbow trout. When adult longfin smelt were less abundant during the 1985 winter, the fish fraction of the rainbow trout diet and the apparent ration size was roughly half the levels observed the previous winter.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	1990	119	3					475	482		10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0475:SADFHO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0475:SADFHO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1990EH46000009

Ciliates dominated the biomass in late spring, summer and autumn, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (<15 mu m, HNF) were most important in late summer and in winter, whereas large heterotrophic flagellates (LHF) were dominant in early spring. Ciliates (mainly oligotrichs, less important were peritrichs, prostomatids and heterotrichs) formed 50 % of protozoan biomass on annual average, HNF (mainly chrysomonads, less important were kathablepharids and choanoflagellates) 29 %, LHF (mainly dinoflagellates, less important were chrysomonads) 19 % and sarcodines (mainly heliozoans and testacean, less important were naked amoebae) 2 %, respectively. Protozooplankton percentage contribution to total zooplankton biovolume ranged between 3 % and 78 % and was about 21 % of annual average total biovolume. Maximum percentage contributions of protozoans were registered in early spring and during summer. Since the metabolic rates of protozoans are several times higher than those of metazooplankton protozooplankton should be considered as important within the pelagic material flux of Lake Neumuhler See as the metazooplankton. The seasonal dynamics of the protozoan community may well be explained by changes in the impact of bottom-up and top-down effects. Small centric diatoms may have supported the growth of protozoans in early spring; copepods and daphnids probably exerted a strong grazing pressure during late spring. High temperatures and low predation pressure may have supported a protozoan peak during summer which was then probably reduced by metazoan predation (rotifers). Small cryptomonades should have supported a short-term maximum of protozoans in autumn. Protozoan herbivory probably had an important impact on phytoplankton mortality during the early spring bloom.

J	Oberkircher, MC; Pagano, SS				Oberkircher, Meghan C.; Pagano, Susan Smith			Seasonal variation in chronic stress and energetic condition in Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia)	AUK												Migration and the breeding season are periods in which birds face many physical and energetic challenges that may cause changes in stress levels and body condition. Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) were captured in 3 consecutive seasons-spring migration, the summer breeding period, and fall migration-in 2014 at a long-term bird-banding station located on the south shore of Lake Ontario to determine patterns of chronic stress and physiological condition related to seasonal shifts in their annual cycles. The heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio was used to assess chronic stress; and plasma metabolite concentrations (triglyceride and uric acid), along with a scaled body mass index, were used as indicators of the physiological condition and fuel utilization of Gray Catbirds and Song Sparrows. Plasma triglycerides were highest during migration periods for Gray Catbirds, while plasma uric acid was greater in spring and summer than in fall, indicating a seasonal shift in diet, possibly related to seasonal fruit availability. Gray Catbirds had elevated H/L ratios during spring, which suggests that spring migration is a period of modest stress for this species, and this spring stress seemed to be predominantly associated with earlier migration passage through the area. Our results suggest that physiological and immune function can vary across seasons in these species, perhaps in parallel with factors related to food availability at stopover or breeding sites during different times of the year.																			0004-8038	1938-4254				JAN	2018	135	1					83	90		10.1642/AUK-17-79.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-17-79.1													WOS:000422868600008

Our analysis indicates that except spring, PET in summer, autumn and winter shows long term decreasing trend, with the largest in summer and the least in winter. The decrease of annual PET in the Poyang Lake basin is mostly affected by the decline of summer PET. On catchment scale, although the calculated PET at all the Metero-stations shows decrease trend, the trends are not significant at some stations. Further analysis indicates that the Most important predictor for the decreasing trend in potential evapotranspiration is sunshine duration and wind speed, followed by relative humidity and air temperature.

J	Yavuzatmaca, M				Yavuzatmaca, Mehinet			Diversity analyses of nonmarine ostracods (Crustacea, Ostracoda) in streams and lakes in Turkey	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												In order to compare species compositions of ostracods, 25 streams and 15 lakes were sampled in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons of 2018. A total of 26 ostracod species were found in lakes (18 spp.) and streams (12 spp.). The Shannon index (H') and evenness values of streams were higher than in lakes in all seasons. The highest H' values for all combined (lakes + streams) and lake data were reported in the autumn season, and in spring the highest values were in streams. According to the beta-diversity (beta) index values, the variability of ostracod species composition in lakes was higher than in streams, and its value was highest in spring (0.40) and lowest in summer (0.34) among all seasons for combined data. Pairwise comparison of spring and autumn displayed higher beta-diversity values than other comparisons, while its value was 0.41 between lakes and streams. According to canonical correspondence analysis results, elevation had a significant (P = 0.006) effect on distribution of species. All results suggested the importance of seasonality for evaluating the biodiversity of a region rather than the number of sampling sites, and the autumn season seems to be richer than other seasons in terms of species diversity.

Synoptic climatology of lake-effect snowfall conditions in the eastern Great Lakes region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The characteristics of overlying synoptic conditions play an important role in the production of lake-effect snowfall within the Great Lakes region of North America. With a synoptic climatological approach, the synoptic-scale patterns conducive to lake-effect snowfall are identified for the eastern Great Lakes region during the November-March seasons of 1950-2009. Seven synoptic types identified as lake effect are combined with daily snowfall observations to examine the role of individual synoptic types on seasonal snowfall. The types exhibit a wide range of surface and 850 hPa temperatures and winds, sea-level pressures, snowfall intensities, and inter-annual frequencies. These factors result in substantial differences in the location and magnitude of seasonal lake-effect snowfall. Recent research has revealed that snowfall within portions of the Great Lakes region subject to lake-effect snow has undergone a trend reversal, declining in recent decades. Examining the inter-annual frequency of the seven lake-effect synoptic types, a majority of types increased in frequency prior to 1980, before becoming less frequent thereafter. The variability in frequency of lake-effect synoptic types can partially be explained by relationships to large-scale atmospheric and oceanic modes of variability. The majority of lake-effect synoptic types occur in association with an upper-level trough over the eastern United States. This trough is consistent with the upper-level pattern associated with a negative phase Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), or positive Pacific/North American pattern (PNA), such that when the AO, NAO, and/or PNA pattern are in those respective phases, there is a significant increase in the frequency of lake-effect synoptic types.					; Leathers, Daniel/A-3665-2010	Leathers, Daniel/0000-0001-9002-9031; Suriano, Zachary/0000-0001-7574-0191													0899-8418	1097-0088				OCT	2017	37	12					4377	4389		10.1002/joc.5093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5093													WOS:000412095400012

Daphnia lumholtzi accounted for up to 70% of the Daphnia assemblage during the summer months (June-August), while D.ambigua accounted for up to 97% of the Daphnia assemblage from fall to spring (October-April). The densities of the two species were inversely correlated. The exotic species was mostly concentrated in the shallower, warmer, north and south ends of the lake during the summer. It also was present, but at much lower densities, in the central lake region during the fall. The native species displayed a ubiquitous distribution throughout the lake during spring and winter, but was concentrated in the deeper, cooler, central region during the summer. Relationships of the two species with environmental conditions indicate that water column temperature might affect the seasonal and spatial distribution of the two Daphnia species. The results also indicate that D.lumholtzi may be filling a 'vacant' seasonal or spatial niche when conditions are unfavorable for D.ambigua.					east, t/KVY-8260-2024														0142-7873	1464-3774				AUG	1999	21	8					1537	1551		10.1093/plankt/21.8.1537	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.8.1537													WOS:000081994200009

Spatial segregation between species and seasonal habitat shifts were investigated by means of monthly surface and bottom samples. During the summer there was clear spatial segregation; both sexes of the benthic species were inshore, reproductive males of the limnetic species were also in the littoral zone, and adult limnetic females and nonbreeding males were at the surface. There were also seasonal habitat shifts. Benthics of both sexes moved onshore in the spring and remained throughout the summer. In the autumn, after the lake turned over, large numbers moved offshore to deep water and appeared to disperse. This shift in the benthic species is an adaptation to the seasonal O2 cycle in the hypolimnion. The limnetic species appeared at the surface in spring and remained there throughout the summer and early autumn. In late autumn they dissappeared from the surface and did not reappear until next spring. During the winter small numbers were taken in bottom traps. Apparently limnetics move away from the surface during the winter. The adaptive significance of this shift remains unclear.

CyanoHABs adapt to varying climatic changes, which explains why the problem on Taihu still thrives. One major drive that keeps the algae is Sediment Oxygen Demand (SOD). In this paper, seasonal and spatial variations of SOD that contribute immensely to nutrient growth in Lake Taihu were done using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). The results were analyzed based on Nitrogenous SOD (NSOD) and Total SOD (TSOD). Summer results ranged from - 0.05754 to - 0.0826 (- 0.75658 to - 0.83902) (g/m(2)/day) and Winter values ranged from - 0.3022 to - 0.40171 (- 1.34486 to - 1.48856) (g/m(2)/day) indicate a gradual decrease in NSOD (TSOD) values respectively. Relatively higher values in summer are attributed to warmer surface water which sets up thermal stratification to increase the internal loading of nitrogen. Lower winter values are related to inverse stratification, where lower oxygen concentration decreases the SOD to trigger ammonium accumulation in the water column. NSOD (TSOD) values for Autumn results ranged from - 0.1039 to - 0.24786 (- 0.96251 to - 1.39454) (g/m(2)/day) and Spring values of - 0.43019 to - 0.35959 (- 1.48297 to - 0.54089) (g/m(2)/day). Transition seasons (i.e., Autumn and Spring) results are impacted by wind mixing that allows dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the whole water column. However, spring values depict a gradual increase in SOD value attributed to spring turnover and gradual stratification, which decrease nutrient concentration. In contrast, decreasing SOD values in autumn are related to mixing, but temperature decreases tend to increase nutrient concentrations. Carbonaceous sediment oxygen demand (CSOD), due to sulfide oxidation, presents high values from the difference between TSOD and NSOD. Based on the high values of CSOD, it is highly recommended that more research on eutrophic Taihu lakes would consider delving into CSOD.

Rotifers and Cladocerans showed high densities during spring and summer, while copepods were densest in autumn. The vertical distribution study showed that rotifers prefer upper levels of the water column, while cladocerans and copepods prefer lower levels, especially during thermal stratification. Boeckella gracilipes had a sex ratio biassed toward female, though changes in the sex ratio were observed. The clutch size was high in winter when the proportion of ovigerous females was low. The instantaneous birth rates were low during winter and high in summer. This result is related to the thermal cycle of the lake, by the influence of temperature on egg development time. The mortality rates showed a similar pattern, and maximum values were registered in spring and summer.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; 													0020-9309						1990	75	4					475	491		10.1002/iroh.19900750405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19900750405													WOS:A1990FR60200004

THERMAL DIFFERENTIATION AMONG SEASONAL CLONES	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												(1) In natural populations of Daphnia magna, clonal frequencies may change markedly between seasons. The range of seasonal variation in thermal response was investigated by comparing the effect of temperature (5-30 C at 5.degree.C intervals) on electrophoretically distinct clones that dominated a shallow lake in spring, summer, autumn and winter. (2) Four females sharing the same electrophoretic phenotype and representing the abundant clones of each season (seasonal clones) were obtained. Genetically identical lineages of each female were acclimated to a constant environment (15 .+-. 5.degree.C, L:D 24:0) for several parthenogenetic generations. (3) There were significant differences in the thermal response (viability and fecundity) of seasonal clones. The preferred temperature ranges generally corresponded to those of the season at which clones were most abundant, demonstrating genetic adaptation to ambient temperature. Differences between clone temperature preferenda of 5-10.degree.C were greatest between summer and winter clones. Spring and autumn clones, though thermally distinct from those of summer and winter, were less clearly differentiated from each other. (4) The four females comprising a seasonal clone were thermally distinct, when taken collectively over the entire temperature range, though variation in fitness was significantly greater between, than within seasonal clones. (5) These results demonstrate marked thermal differentiation among D. magna clones from a single population. Major clonal frequency changes between seasons were directly related to differences in the thermal tolerance of specific genotypes. Daphnia must therefore be examined from several seasons to obtain realistic limits to environmental stress.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				JUN	1987	56	2					469	478		10.2307/5061	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/5061													WOS:A1987H552300008

The Great Lakes Runoff Intercomparison Project Phase 4: the Great Lakes (GRIP-GL)	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Model intercomparison studies are carried out to test and compare the simulated outputs of various model setups over the same study domain. The Great Lakes region is such a domain of high public interest as it not only resembles a challenging region to model with its transboundary location, strong lake effects, and regions of strong human impact but is also one of the most densely populated areas in the USA and Canada. This study brought together a wide range of researchers setting up their models of choice in a highly standardized experimental setup using the same geophysical datasets, forcings, common routing product, and locations of performance evaluation across the 1 x 10(6) km(2) study domain. The study comprises 13 models covering a wide range of model types from machine-learning-based, basin-wise, subbasin-based, and gridded models that are either locally or globally calibrated or calibrated for one of each of the six predefined regions of the watershed. Unlike most hydrologically focused model intercomparisons, this study not only compares models regarding their capability to simulate streamflow (Q) but also evaluates the quality of simulated actual evapotranspiration (AET), surface soil moisture (SSM), and snow water equivalent (SWE). The latter three outputs are compared against gridded reference datasets. The comparisons are performed in two ways - either by aggregating model outputs and the reference to basin level or by regridding all model outputs to the reference grid and comparing the model simulations at each grid-cell. The main results of this study are as follows: 1. The comparison of models regarding streamflow reveals the superior quality of the machine-learning-based model in the performance of all experiments; even for the most challenging spatiotemporal validation, the machine learning (ML) model outperforms any other physically based model. 2. While the locally calibrated models lead to good performance in calibration and temporal validation (even outperforming several regionally calibrated models), they lose performance when they are transferred to locations that the model has not been calibrated on. This is likely to be improved with more advanced strategies to transfer these models in space. 3. The regionally calibrated models - while losing less performance in spatial and spatiotemporal validation than locally calibrated models - exhibit low performances in highly regulated and urban areas and agricultural regions in the USA. 4. Comparisons of additional model outputs (AET, SSM, and SWE) against gridded reference datasets show that aggregating model outputs and the reference dataset to the basin scale can lead to different conclusions than a comparison at the native grid scale. The latter is deemed preferable, especially for variables with large spatial variability such as SWE. 5. A multi-objective-based analysis of the model performances across all variables (Q, AET, SSM, and SWE) reveals overall well-performing locally calibrated models (i.e., HYMOD2-lumped) and regionally calibrated models (i.e., MESH-SVS-Raven and GEM-Hydro-Watroute) due to varying reasons. The machine-learning-based model was not included here as it is not set up to simulate AET, SSM, and SWE. 6.

Based on the max-stable, impacts of El Ni (n) over tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on the annual and seasonal Rx1 day and Rx5 day regimes in the Poyang Lake basin were evaluated. Results indicated that annual Rx1 day and Rx5 day were influenced mainly by the ENSO events a year earlier and the relations between annual Rx1 day and Rx5 day and ENSO were statistically positive. However, influences of climate indices on the seasonal Rx1 day and Rx5 day are complicated when compared with the influences on annual Rx1 day and Rx5 day regimes. ENSO and PDO can enhance the spring Rx1 day regime of the subsequent year and the same year, respectively, but IOD weakens spring Rx1 day in the same year. In summer, ENSO can enhance Rx1 day of the subsequent year. However, Rx1 day in summer had a decreasing tendency. IOD and NAO influenced the autumn Rx1 day in another way, i.e., IOD decreases autumn Rx1 day of the subsequent year; while NAO enhances autumn Rx1 day of the same year. Meanwhile, ENSO can amplify the summer Rx1 day in terms of variability, while IOD and NAO can, respectively, influence autumn and winter Rx1 day in terms of mean. Influences of climate indices on annual and seasonal Rx5 day are similar to those on Rx1 day. Results of this study are of great theoretical as well as practical merit in terms of evaluation of droughts and floods under the influences of climate indices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We satellite-tracked the migration of 16 tundra swans that winter in Japan. The objectives of this study were 1) to show the migration pattern of the EP flyway of tundra swans; 2) to compare this pattern with the migration pattern of whooper swans; and 3) to identify stopover sites that are important for these swans' conservation. Tundra swans were captured at Kutcharo Lake, Hokkaido, in 2009-2012 and satellite-tracked. A new method called the "MATCHED (Migratory Analytical Time Change Easy Detection) method" was developed. Based on median, the spring migration began on 18 April and ended on 27 May. Autumn migration began on 9 September and ended on 2 November. The median duration of the spring and autumn migrations were 48 and 50 days, respectively. The mean duration at one stopover site was 5.5 days and 6.8 days for the spring and autumn migrations, respectively. The number of stopover sites was 3.0 and 2.5 for the spring and autumn migrations, respectively. The mean travel distances for the spring and autumn migrations were 6471 and 6331 km, respectively. Seven migration routes passing Sakhalin, the Amur River, and/or Kamchatka were identified. There were 15, 32, and eight wintering, stopover, and breeding sites, respectively. The migration routes and staging areas of tundra swans partially overlap with those of whooper swans, whose migration patterns have been previously documented. The migration patterns of these two swan species that winter in Japan confirm the importance of the Amur River, Udyl' Lake, Shchastya Bay, Aniva Bay, zaliv Chayvo Lake, zal Piltun Lake, zaliv Baykal Lake, Kolyma River, Buyunda River, Sen-kyuyel' Lake, and northern coastal areas of the Sea of Okhotsk.

As one of the most concentrated regions for freshwater lakes, the Yangtze-Huaihe region plays a significant role in monitoring TP concentrations for the sustainable utilisation of China's water resources. In this study, a TP concentration estimation model suitable for large-sized lake groups was developed using a combination of measured and remote sensing data powered by advanced machine learning algorithms. Compared to traditional empirical models, the model developed in this study demonstrates significant accuracy in fitting (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.08 mg/L, MAPE = 34.20%). Moreover, the application of this model to lakes in the Yangtze-Huaihe region from 2017 to 2022 has been conducted. The multi-year average TP concentration was 0.18 mg/L. Spatial distribution analyses showed that total phosphorus concentrations were higher in small lakes. In terms of temporal changes, the interannual decreases in total phosphorus concentrations were 0.02 mg/L, 0.01 mg/L, and 0.01 mg/L for small, medium, and large lakes, respectively. We also found that large lakes typically exhibited a "high in spring and summer, low in autumn and winter" pattern until 2020, but transitioned to a "high in summer and autumn, low in spring and winter" pattern after 2020 due to the removal of closed fish nets, which were having a significant impact on the lake ecosystem. Other lakes in the area consistently showed a pattern of "high in spring and summer, low in autumn and winter" during the six-year period. These findings may provide useful references and suggestions for the environmental protection and management of lakes in China.					; Jiang, Mingliang/GXG-4039-2022; ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022; Cao, Zhigang/L-5337-2017; Xiong, Junfeng/LJM-0365-2024; Xu, Ligang/HHZ-1943-2022; Cao, Zhigang/L-5336-2017	Jiang, Mingliang/0000-0002-5027-2931; Xiong, Junfeng/0000-0002-9409-5797; Ma, Ronghua/0000-0002-4485-4636; Cao, Zhigang/0000-0001-5329-2906														2072-4292				SEP	2023	15	18							4487	10.3390/rs15184487	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15184487													WOS:001074467900001
J	Cardoso, LD; Marques, DD				Cardoso, LD; Marques, DD			Structure of the zooplankton community in a subtropical shallow lake (Itapeva Lake South of Brazil) and its relationship to hydrodynamic aspects	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The structure of the zooplankton community in Itapeva Lake was formed by four groups and more than 127 zooplankton species, in which microplankton was the predominant size structure. The largest richness recorded was of the protists group and in autumn seasonal campaign. Protists were characteristic of the lake, regarding density, except during spring at the Center point (copepods) and autumn at the South point (rotifers). The seasonal distribution revealed that during summer, mean density increased in the zooplankton community, exactly the opposite of phytoplankton (that blooms during the cold season). However, the maximum density was recorded during autumn. High density was recorded for the ciliate Codonella sp. at all points and during all seasons. The abundance of the tecamoeba Difflugia tuberculata was strongly associated with the maximum effects of fetch in the lake. Rotifers were generally the second most representative groups in terms of density. Rotifers and Cladocera were more abundant in summer, whereas copepods were in spring and winter/98. The Shannon-Wiener index showed that the smallest zooplankton diversity average occurred during the winter/98 (H = 1.44), while in autumn the largest zooplankton diversity average (H = 2.36) was observed. Correlations (r-Pearson, p < 0.05) with wind velocity were significant for zooplankton density (groups and/or abundant species), diversity, and richness. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a seasonally significant spatial-temporal variation for the factors sampling point, day and shift (p < 0.01). Temporal alterations in density, diversity and richness were closely dependent on the hydrodynamic action induced by the wind on the spatial distribution of the zooplankton community in the Itapeva Lake.					; de S Cardoso, Luciana/D-9523-2013	da Motta Marques, David/0000-0002-3809-8053; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2004	518	1-3					123	134		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000025062.08366.1b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000025062.08366.1b													WOS:000220977100011

Fish constituted 51% of food biomass consumed by otters in spring-summer and 40% in autumn-winter, with common fish (perch Perca fluviatilis, pike Esox lucius, and roach Rutilus rutilus) being captured most frequently by the otters. Amphibians (mainly Rana temporaria, which also dominated in the living community) made up 34% of otters' food biomass in spring-summer and 58% in autumn-winter. American mink relied on three prey groups: fish (40% in spring-summer, and 10% in autumn-winter), frogs (32% and 51%, respectively), and small mammals (21% and 36%). Out of available Micromammalia, mink strongly selected the root vole Microtus oeconomus. The cold season diet of both otter and mink depended on river size. On small rivers with forested valleys, otters and mink fed nearly exclusively on amphibians (72-90% of food biomass). With size of a river increasing and riverside habitat becoming more open (sedge and reed marshes instead of forests), otters shifted to catching predominantly fish (up to 76% in diet) and mink to preying on small mammals (up to 65% in diet). Review of literature on otter and mink in Eurasia showed that their diets did not change with latitude (as indicators of climate severity and duration of water freezing) but they depended on habitats. In otter diet, the mean share of fish declined from 94% (SE 1.7) on sea shores, to 71% (SE 2.9) on lakes and fish ponds, to 64% (SE 2.8) on rivers and streams. The roles of amphibians and crustaceans increased in the same gradient (from 0 to 15%, and from 3 to 7%, respectively). On inland waters, the abundance of crayfish was the essential factor differentiating otters' diet composition. In Eurasia, the staple food types of American mink on rivers and streams were fish (on average, 27% in diet, SE 3.9), mammals (30%, SE 5.0), and amphibians (17%, SE 4.8), whereas on lakes and ponds mink fed predominantly on birds (on average, 33% in diet, SE 10.1) and fish (28%, SE 9.5). In the Palaearctic region, over a wide gradient of habitats, otters appeared strongly specialised on prey taken from water, whereas American mink was a typical generalist capable of utilising several prey groups originating from both water and land.

J	Bozó, L; Anisimov, Y; Csörgo, T				Bozo, Laszlo; Anisimov, Yury; Csorgo, Tibor			Moult, sex and food are the most important factors regulated the timing of migration of north Asian Passerines	ORNITHOLOGY RESEARCH												Bird migration is a highly complex, regulated process, of which timing is an essential element. The timing of migration is influenced by moult, age, sex and food of the birds, as well as the distance between the breeding and wintering sites. In this study, we used data from a ringing station on the shores of Lake Baikal to investigate factors influencing migration timing for species with different migration and moulting strategies, wintering sites and feeding habits. In general, we found that the migration of Passerine across Lake Baikal is influenced by similar factors to those of other migratory species in other migratory flyways. For most species, adult birds migrated through the area earlier in both spring and autumn. In spring, protandrous migration was detected for most of the species, while in autumn, differences in migration timing were less common. Migratory birds migrate later in spring and earlier in autumn, the longer the distance between nesting and wintering sites. It is important to highlight, however, that in both seasons only moulting, sex and food type had an equal influence on the timing of migration, while migration distance and age regulated migration in only one season or the other. In both spring and autumn, we observed differences in the timing of the migration of different species. Studies on the migration of north Asian Passerines are important in the future as the populations of several once common species have declined dramatically in recent times.

Concentrations of phosphorus, nitrogen and silica and alkalinity were monitored in eight shallow and four deep Danish lakes for 13 years following a phosphorus loading reduction. The aim was to elucidate the seasonal changes in nutrient concentrations during recovery. Samples were taken biweekly during summer and monthly during winter. 2. Overall, the most substantive changes in lake water concentrations were seen in the early phase of recovery. However, phosphorus continued to decline during summer as long as 10 years after the loading reduction, indicating a significant, albeit slow, decline in internal loading. 3. Shallow and deep lakes responded differently to reduced loading. In shallow lakes the internal phosphorus release declined significantly in spring, early summer and autumn, and only non-significantly so in July and August. In contrast, in deep lakes the largest reduction occurred from May to August. This difference may reflect the much stronger benthic pelagic-coupling and the lack of stratification in shallow lakes. 4. Nitrogen only showed minor changes during the recovery period, while alkalinity increased in late summer, probably conditioned by the reduced primary production, as also indicated by the lower pH. Silica tended to decline in winter and spring during the study period, probably reflecting a reduced release of silica from the sediment because of enhanced uptake by benthic diatoms following the improved water transparency. 5. These results clearly indicate that internal loading of phosphorus can delay lake recovery for many years after phosphorus loading reduction, and that lake morphometry (i.e. deep versus shallow basins) influences the patterns of change in nutrient concentrations on both a seasonal and interannual basis.

In this study, we provide detailed information on the seasonal sedimentation of different varve components and palaeolimnological indicators (diatoms, chrysophycaean cysts) using near-bottom sediment-trap monitoring. The monitoring results confirm previous interpretations of the formation of clastic-biogenic varves in Fennoscandian lakes. The results also indicate that seasonal sediment fluxes correspond with environmental changes. Higher snow storage in winter and the discharge intensity during the following spring snowmelt clearly increase the suspended sediment load, transportation and net accumulation of detrital mineral matter during spring and early summer. A prolonged autumn and subsequent freezing and thawing cycles in winter, conversely, result in an incremental but slow accumulation of assorted mineral matter and organic particles during winter, whereas the subsequent spring flooding and detrital sediment yield are diminished and thinner clastic laminae are formed. The accumulation rates of diatoms and chrysophyte cysts suggest that these algal groups are more dependent on seasonal processes (e.g. spring and autumnal overturn) than on rapid, short-lived environmental episodes such as the spring discharge peak.

Composition, distribution, and seasonal dynamics of large planktonic tintinnids and foraminifera at 12 stations in the lagoon were studied in 2009 and 2010. Fifteen species of Ciliophora (Tintinnina) and two species of Foraminifera were identified The occurrence of different species varied greatly in the study period: two species were found in 42% to 49% of all samples, two species in 21% to 23%, 4 species in 10% to 20%, and 10 species in 1% to 5%. Only three species were found throughout the year. 'Ihe average total number of all recorded protozoa varied from 2333 ind./m(3) (spring) to 13,733 ind./m(3) (winter): Tintinnina from 1250 ind./m(3) (spring) to 12,867 ind./m(3) (winter) and Foraminifera from 200 ind./m(3) (autumn) to 1083 ind./m(3) (spring). The distribution of total abundance of tintinnids and foraminifers in the lagoon area was close to random in summer and spring; during autumn and winter, it was aggregated Tintinnid and foraminifera studies in Lagoon Bardawil were carried out previously (1985-2010); summarizing all data, it was found that interannual differences may be explained by stochastic causes and nondirected climate fluctuations.

In the low-NAO years, the large (270 km(2)), shallow (mean depth 2.8 m), polymictic lake, Vortsjarv, was significantly shallower than in the high-NAO years. Phytoplankton biomass was higher in the springs after high-NAO winters, and it was inversely related with the depth of the lake in summer and autumn but not in spring. In Vortsjarv, the North Atlantic Oscillation directly influences spring phytoplankton via its effects on the ice cover dynamics. The climate signal 'recorded' in the water levels results in lower summer/autumn phytoplankton biomass in the years when the water level remains high throughout the year. The effects of light and phosphorus limitation on phytoplankton at higher water levels are discussed.

The Influence of a Lake-to-Lake Connection from Lake Huron on the Lake-Effect Snowfall in the Vicinity of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Lake-effect storms (LES) produce substantial snowfall in the vicinity of the downwind shores of the Great Lakes. These storms may take many forms; one type of LES event, lake to lake (L2L), occurs when LES clouds/snowbands develop over an upstream lake (e.g., Lake Huron), extend across an intervening landmass, and continue over a downstream lake (e.g., Lake Ontario). The current study examined LES snowfall in the vicinity of Lake Ontario and the atmospheric conditions during Lake Huron-to-Lake Ontario L2L days as compared with LES days on which an L2L connection was not present [i.e., only Lake Ontario (OLO)] for the cold seasons (October-March) from 2003/04 through 2013/14. Analyses of snowfall demonstrate that, on average, significantly greater LES snowfall totals occur downstream of Lake Ontario on L2L days than on OLO days. The difference in mean snowfall between L2L and OLO days approaches 200% in some areas near the Tug Hill Plateau and central New York State. Analyses of atmospheric conditions found more-favorable LES environments on L2L days relative to OLO days that included greater instability over the upwind lake, more near-surface moisture available, faster wind speeds, and larger surface heat fluxes over the upstream lake. Last, despite significant snowfalls on L2L days, their average contribution to the annual accumulated LES snowfall in the vicinity of Lake Ontario was found to be small (i.e., 25%-30%) because of the relatively infrequent occurrence of L2L days.					; Gaudet, Lauriana/AAA-8528-2019	McDonald, Jessica/0000-0001-7648-7968; Gaudet, Lauriana/0000-0003-4679-4507													1558-8424	1558-8432				JUL	2018	57	7					1423	1439		10.1175/JAMC-D-17-0225.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-17-0225.1													WOS:000437724600002

The diversity and community composition of gut fungi are driven by multiple factors, including diet, environmental exposure, habitat type, and seasonal migration. Migratory birds have a peculiar life cycle, so it is interesting to understand the ecological function of their "gut fungal microbiome." Birds are exposed to variable diets, environments, and habitats amid seasonal migration. The hooded crane is known as a long-distance migratory bird, inhabiting both wintering and stopover grounds during seasonal migration. During migratory seasons, it inhabits various habitats and is exposed to variable environments. This study analyzed the shifts between gut fungal diversity and the community composition of the hooded crane at both wintering and stopover sites amid seasonal migration. The gut fungal alpha diversity exhibited a more significant change during winter than in fall and spring. The gut fungal community composition exhibited significant shifts across winter, fall, and spring (ANOSIM, p = 0.001). The pathogenic diversity and relative abundance showed significant differences during winter at the wintering site relative to fall and spring at the stopover site. Moreover, the pathogenic fungal community composition was significantly different during fall, winter, and spring. This work contributes to present essential knowledge about the gut fungal microbiome of hooded cranes amid seasonal migration. This study also implicated that conservation measures for hooded crane conservation should be applied, as the risk of cross-transmission of potential fungal pathogens might increase during seasonal migration. The "gut fungal microbiome" maintains the immune system, homeostasis, and various physiological functions of an organism. Different factors shape and affect gut fungal diversity and community composition, such as environment, habitat type, food resources, and seasons during migration. Wild birds amid migration are exposed to different habitats with different environments, available food resources, and seasons, which may substantially impact their gut fungal community composition and diversity. The hooded crane (Grus monacha) is a known migratory bird that migrates over long distances and is exposed to varied habitats with different environments and food types. We investigated the differences in gut fungal diversity and community composition between wintering and stopover sites amid three migratory seasons. We deduced the gut fungal pathogenic diversity and community composition during winter, fall, and spring by using high throughput sequencing (Illumina Mi-seq), and the internal transcribed region 2 (ITS2) was examined. Samples were collected from Shengjin Lake in the winter and Lindian during the fall and spring. The dominant fungal phyla found across the three seasons were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota, and Rozellomycota. The gut fungal alpha diversity showed significant shifts during winter at the wintering site compared with the fall and spring seasons at the stopover site. The fungal community composition exhibited a significant change across the three seasons (ANOSIM p = 0.001). The results also demonstrated that the diversity and relative abundance of potential pathogens also showed divergence in winter compared to fall and spring. This study provides the basis for understanding the discrepancy in gut fungal diversity and community composition during migratory seasons at both wintering and stopover grounds. It also suggests that conservation measures should be applied to the conservation of hooded cranes and other wild birds, as the risk of cross-infection increases during seasonal migration.

The heavy metal analysis of samples were carried out using ICP-OES. The results of heavy metal analysis in Kovada Lake's water, Fe in all seasons, Zn in Spring-2005 and Winter-2006, Al in only Summer-2005 and Ni in only Spring-2005 were determined. Although this, Mn in Summer-2005 and, Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb in all seasons were below detection limit of ICP-OES. It was determined that Fe was the highest metal in water. Heavy metal levels in water were increased in summer and spring months. The results of heavy metal analysis of sediment, while Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, al and Ni were determined in all seasons, Cd was below detection limit in summer-2005 and autumn-2005. It was determined that al was the highest metal in sediment. The metal concentrations reached the maximum level in summer months. There is not any danger according to acceptable levels of heavy metal in water given by Ministry of agriculture and Rural affairs in Kovada Lake's water except Fe in Summer-2005 and Zn in Spring-2005 and Winter-2005.																			1300-1590	2148-3140					2007	24	1-2					155	158																WOS:000440322500027
J	Bodnár, E; Hlavay, J				Bodnár, E; Hlavay, J			Atmospheric deposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on the Lake Balaton, Hungary	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL					11th Italian-Hungarian Symposium on Spectrochemistry	OCT 20-24, 2003	Venice, ITALY					The concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in atmospheric precipitation and aerosol samples was monitored on the Lake Balaton to examine the seasonal variations and depositions. Samples were collected at Tihany located on the north part of the Lake Balaton between April 2002 and April 2003. Aerosol particles were sampled on quartz fiber filters using low volume sampler (1.2 m(3)/h). For the determination of the size distribution of PAHs, aerosol was collected on aluminium foils by an eight-stage Berner-type low-pressure impactor (31.2 m(3)/h, cutoff diameters: 0.0625-8 mum). The dry deposition velocities on water surface as a function of the particle diameter were estimated. The collection of rain and snow samples was performed by an automatic wet-only sampler. The seasonal mean concentration of the SigmaPAHs in precipitation was found as 149, 96, 586, and 1136 ng/l in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. In the atmospheric aerosol samples, the seasonal mean concentration of the SigmaPAHs varied from 3.2, 1.7, 6.2, and 31 ng/m(3) in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. It was found that PAHs generally showed the maximum concentration in the 0.25- to 1.0-mum size range in every season. Wet (280 mug/m(2) x year) and dry (70 mug/m(2) xyear) deposition rates were calculated, and pollution loading of PAHs from the atmosphere to the Lake Balaton was obtained as 170 kg/year of wet and 40 kg/year of dry deposition.

Over 50,000 10-min spectra in the size range 3-500 nm were obtained by two parallel DMPSs. The spectra were fitted with two or three lognormal distributions. The occurrence and evolution of different size modes are described, and the seasonal variation of the modes are discussed. Particle formation with subsequent growth is observed to Lake place in the vicinity of the site mostly during spring time. Particle growth leads to a strong connection between the mean sizes and concentrations of nucleation and Aitken mode particles in spring. During winter time, the modes are more separate and stable in particle size. Also the average concentration of nucleation mode particles (D-p < 20 nm) is usually less in winter time, but still a clear nucleation mode is frequently observed. The characteristic features of summer and autumn are not as distinguishable as they are for winter and spring. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Extreme events, trends, and variability in Northern Hemisphere lake-ice phenology (1855-2005)	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Often extreme events, more than changes in mean conditions, have the greatest impact on the environment and human well-being. Here we examine changes in the occurrence of extremes in the timing of the annual formation and disappearance of lake ice in the Northern Hemisphere. Both changes in the mean condition and in variability around the mean condition can alter the probability of extreme events. Using long-term ice phenology data covering two periods 1855-6 to 2004-5 and 1905-6 to 2004-5 for a total of 75 lakes, we examined patterns in long-term trends and variability in the context of understanding the occurrence of extreme events. We also examined patterns in trends for a 30-year subset (1975-6 to 2004-5) of the 100-year data set. Trends for ice variables in the recent 30-year period were steeper than those in the 100- and 150-year periods, and trends in the 150-year period were steeper than in the 100-year period. Ranges of rates of change (days per decade) among time periods based on linear regression were 0.3-1.6 later for freeze, 0.5-1.9 earlier for breakup, and 0.7-4.3 shorter for duration. Mostly, standard deviation did not change, or it decreased in the 150-year and 100-year periods. During the recent 50-year period, standard deviation calculated in 10-year windows increased for all ice measures. For the 150-year and 100-year periods changes in the mean ice dates rather than changes in variability most strongly influenced the significant increases in the frequency of extreme lake ice events associated with warmer conditions and decreases in the frequency of extreme events associated with cooler conditions.

Holocene seasonal variability inferred from multiple proxy records from Crevice Lake, Yellowstone National Park, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A 9400-yr-old record from Crevice Lake, a semi-closed alkaline lake in northern Yellowstone National Park, was analyzed for pollen, charcoal, geochemistry, mineralogy, diatoms, and stable isotopes to develop a nuanced understanding of Holocene environmental history in a region of northern Rocky Mountains that receives both summer and winter precipitation. The limited surface area, conical bathymetry, and deep water (> 31 m) of Crevice Lake create oxygen-deficient conditions in the hypolimnion and preserve annually laminated sediment (varves) for much of the record. Pollen data indicate that the watershed supported a closed Pinus-dominated forest and low fire frequency prior to 8200 cal yr BP, followed by open parkland until 2600 cal yr BP, and open mixed-conifer forest thereafter. Fire activity shifted from infrequent stand-replacing fires initially to frequent surface fires in the middle Holocene and stand-replacing events in recent centuries. Low values of delta O-18 suggest high winter precipitation in the early Holocene, followed by steadily drier conditions after 8500 cal yr BP. Carbonate-rich sediments before 5000 cal yr BP imply warmer summer conditions than after 5000 cal yr BP. High values of molybdenum (Mo), uranium (U), and sulfur (S) indicate anoxic bottom-waters before 8000 cal yr BP, between 4400 and 3900 cal yr BP, and after 2400 cal yr BP. The diatom record indicates extensive water-column mixing in spring and early summer through much of the Holocene, but a period between 2200 and 800 cal yr BP had strong summer stratification, phosphate limitation, and oxygen-deficient bottom waters. Together, the proxy data suggest wet winters, protracted springs, and warm effectively wet summers in the early Holocene and less snowpack, cool springs, warm dry summers in the middle Holocene. In the late Holocene, the region and lake experienced extreme changes in winter, spring, and summer conditions, with particularly short springs and dry summers and winters during the Roman Warm Period (similar to 2000 cal yr BP) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (1200-800 cal yr BP). Long springs and mild summers occurred during the Little Ice Age, and these conditions persist to the present. Although the proxy data indicate effectively wet summer conditions in the early Holocene and drier conditions in the middle and late Holocene, none point specifically to changes in summer precipitation as the cause. Instead, summer conditions were governed by multi-seasonal controls on effective moisture that operated over multiple time scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hodgkins, GA				Hodgkins, Glenn A.			The importance of record length in estimating the magnitude of climatic changes: an example using 175 years of lake ice-out dates in New England	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Many studies have shown that lake ice-out (break-up) dates in the Northern Hemisphere are useful indicators of late winter/early spring climate change. Trends in lake ice-out dates in New England, USA, were analyzed for 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, and 175 year periods ending in 2008. More than 100 years of ice-out data were available for 19 of the 28 lakes in this study. The magnitude of trends over time depends on the length of the period considered. For the recent 25-year period, there was a mix of earlier and later ice-out dates. Lake ice-outs during the last 50 years became earlier by 1.8 days/decade (median change for all lakes with adequate data). This is a much higher rate than for longer historical periods; ice-outs became earlier by 0.6 days/decade during the last 75 years, 0.4 days/decade during the last 100 years, and 0.6 days/decade during the last 125 years. The significance of trends was assessed under the assumption of serial independence of historical ice-out dates and under the assumption of short and long term persistence. Hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (DO) levels are an important factor in lake eutrophication and coldwater fish survival. Based on historical data available at three lakes, 32 to 46 % of the interannual variability of late summer hypolimnion DO levels was related to ice-out dates; earlier ice-outs were associated with lower DO levels.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				AUG	2013	119	3-4					705	718		10.1007/s10584-013-0766-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-013-0766-8													WOS:000321955300014

The maximum value of total chlorophyll content observed was 2.40 +/- 0.034 mg/g in October, while the minimum was 1.22 +/- 0.028 mg/g in June. On the other hand, maximum chlorophyll a content was 1.58 +/- 0.020 mg/g in October and the minimum was 0.76 +/- 0.036 mg/g in March. The highest and lowest chlorophyll b content was 0.83 +/- 0.016 mg/g in October and 0.40 +/- 0.005 mg/g in January, respectively. Finally, carotenoid was highest at 0.39 +/- 0.006 mg/g in January and least at 0.13 +/- 0.004 mg/g in April. Based on seasonal analysis, chlorophyll content was higher during the late-autumn and early-winter, and lower in the summer; while carotenoid content was higher during the late-autumn and winter, and lower in early-spring and late-summer.

J	Nesteruk, T				Nesteruk, Teresa			Seasonal changes in the diversity and abundance of epiphytic Gastrotricha	PROCEEDINGS OF THE BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in abundance, species richness, and diversity of epiphytic Gastrotricha in the littoral of a mesotrophic lake. The influence of pH and oxygen on their occurrence was also investigated. Gastrotricha occurred throughout the year: 27 species were identified together, and species richness varied at different seasons. The highest number of species on water vegetation was found in the summer (26 species), while in the winter season only 7 species were present. Species diversity expressed by the Shannon index, in spring, summer, and autumn was high and amounted 2.10, 2.37, and 2.31, respectively. In winter, the value of the index was significantly lower and amounted 0.59. Three species were found to be dominant from spring to autumn with the dominance over 9.0%: Heterolepidoderma macrops Kisielewski, 1981, H. ocellatum (Me. cnikow, 1865), and Lepidodermella squamata (Dujardin, 1841). The GLM analysis revealed that number of collected species in spring, summer, and autumn does not depend either on season or on pH and oxygen content. The lowest density of gastrotrichs was found in winter (average of 33x10(-3) indiv. m(-2)), whereas the highest was found in summer (average of 1392x10(-3) indiv. m(-2)). The density differed with season and neither pH nor oxygen content had an effect upon gastrotrich densities.

We acquired time series of lake ice breakup and freeze up, local weather conditions, and large-scale climate oscillations from 1981-2015 for seven lakes in northern Wisconsin, USA, and two lakes in Ontario, Canada. Multiple linear regression models were developed to understand the drivers of lake ice phenology. We used projected air temperature and precipitation from 126 climate change scenarios to forecast the day of year of ice breakup and freeze up in 2050 and 2070. Lake ice melted 5 days earlier and froze 8 days later over the past 35 years. Warmer spring and winter air temperatures contributed to earlier ice breakup; whereas warmer November temperatures delayed lake freeze. Lake ice breakup is projected to be 13 days earlier on average by 2070, but could vary by 3 days later to 43 days earlier depending upon the degree of climatic warming by late century. Similarly, the timing of lake freeze up is projected to be delayed by 11 days on average by 2070, but could be 1 to 28 days later. Shortened seasonality of ice cover by 24 days could increase risk of algal blooms, reduce habitat for coldwater fisheries, and jeopardize survival of northern communities reliant on ice roads.					; Higgins, Scott/F-5700-2016	Yao, Huaxia/0000-0001-5875-7215; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Rusak, James/0000-0002-4939-6478; Higgins, Scott/0000-0001-9427-7024														2073-4441				JAN	2018	10	1							70	10.3390/w10010070	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10010070													WOS:000424397400067
J	Argyilan, EP; Forman, SL				Argyilan, EP; Forman, SL			Lake level response to seasonal climatic variability in the Lake Michigan-Huron system from 1920 to 1995	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recent research indicates a shift in the timing and range of the seasonal lake-level cycle of Lake Michigan-Huron since 1860. The largest changes occur during the winter-spring transition. The objectives of this study are to (1) quantitatively assess seasonal variations in precipitation, runoff, and evaporation, (2) evaluate long-term trends in seasonal water supply to Lake Michigan-Huron, and (3) understand how variations in net basin supply at a seasonal timescale contributed to development of extreme lake levels recorded in Lake Michigan-Huron between 1920 and 1995. Total water input, which is the sum of overlake precipitation and runoff, has increased during autumn and winter seasons at rates of 14.6 and 9.3 mm/decade, respectively. A rise in autumn total input reflects an increase in overlake precipitation (6.3 mm/decade) and runoff (8.3 mm/decade). The increase in winter input was driven by runoff (7.5 mm/decade) at the expense of decreasing spring runoff (7.8 mm/decade). This shift to an increasing dominance of winter runoff at the apparent expense of spring runoff is most pronounced post 1965 and suggests a hydrologic response to a warming climate. Extreme lake levels principally reflect either anomalies occurring in one or more seasons or a directional shift over many years, but often with seasonal bias. Seasonal changes in overlake precipitation, runoff, and overlake evaporation lead to the formation and persistence of extreme lake levels. The effects of seasonal water supply anomalies depend on the coincidence to long-term decadal-scale variation in lake level.

Heavy metal contents of fishes changed depending on seasons. The highest Al (20.894 mg/kg) in tench was established in winter, and the lowest Al (1.605 mg/kg) was determined in summer. Fe content of tench fish changed between 112.906 mg/kg (autumn) and 31.207 mg/kg (spring). In addition, Zn contents of tench were found between 36.0323 mg/kg (summer) and 430.586 mg/kg (winter). The results indicate that concentrations of Cu of tench varied from 0.1934 mg/kg (winter) to 15.422 mg/kg (autumn). Results indicate that concentrations varied from 2.923 mg/kg (autumn) to 32.078 mg/kg (summer) with a mean of 11.1893 mg/kg for Al; 0.2483 mg/kg (spring) to 3.3088 mg/kg (autumn) with a mean of 1.6189 mg/kg for Ni; 0.5325 mg/kg (spring) to 0.845 mg/kg (autumn) with a mean of 0.7234 for Pb; and 7.0464 mg/kg (winter) to 253.686 mg/kg (summer) with a mean of 133.6348 for Zn.

Classification of Lake Michigan snow days for estimation of the lake-effect contribution to the downward trend in November snowfall	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The substantial impact of Lake-effect snow in the Laurentian Great Lakes has led to interest in the impact of climate change on snowfall in the region. A recent assessment of Lake Michigan snowfall revealed a marked decrease in November snowfall since the 1950s, associated with a warming-induced reduction in the fraction of precipitation days occurring as snowfall. Herein, in order to identify the trend contribution from Lake-effect snowfall, snow days from the November 1950-2012 study period are classified as primarily System or Lake-effect, with additional options of Insignificant, Both, Remnant, and Unclear. The classification is based on the snowfall distribution and visual map inspection for synoptic-scale forcing, and results are compared with an objective classification based on clustering of daily snowfall. The regional snowfall patterns of Lake-effect and System snow days are markedly different, with Lake-effect snow days exhibiting a clear Lake-effect signature downwind of Lake Michigan. The larger-scale environments also differ, with much colder conditions in the Great Lakes and higher sea-level pressure in the Great Plains on Lake-effect days. With snowfall projected onto the classifications, the decrease of snowfall east of the lake is attributable to both reductions in Lake-effect and System snowfall, while System snowfall changes are dominant west of the lake. The trends are consistent with the sensitivity to regional temperature, as well as an increasing prevalence of rain reports (within other sub-regions) during snow days. Results based on the objective classification are largely congruent.

By applying impulse response functions to Lake Biwa and its catchment, we demonstrated that it is possible to (1) identify the effects of natural oscillations governed by the shape of the lake, (2) determine the precipitation retention time at the surface (above the impermeable layer) of the catchment, and (3) estimate how long it takes precipitation falling in catchment areas to reach the lake. Between 2010 and 2012 we recorded water levels at high frequency in the South Basin of Lake Biwa and calculated response functions between precipitation and water levels. We categorized the delay time determined from the calculated response functions as direct precipitation on the lake, seiches, and river inflow (surface flow, return inflow). We then identified the runoff patterns of surface and return flows by considering the time scale of the delay. The method used in this study enables flood predictions in cases involving heavy rain and appropriate planning of preventive measures against flood damage. These results will be valuable for the development of management strategies to respond to climate change in lake catchment systems.					; Iwaki, Maho/IYJ-5893-2023	Muraoka, Kohji/0000-0001-9086-0407; Iwaki, Maho/0000-0001-6639-8873													2044-2041	2044-205X				APR 2	2020	10	2					283	294		10.1080/20442041.2020.1712952	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2020.1712952		JUL 2020											WOS:000558213900001

Meanwhile, simulation experiments were carried out to better understand the degradation of DON. The pollution of Lake Qingnian was more serious than that of Wetland Qilihai. Total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA-N), accounting for about 40% of DON, was the dominant nitrogen species in the sediment. Bacterial residues were the most important source of organic nitrogen in the sediment of Wetland Qilihai, where DON more highly degraded than Lake Qingnian. Degradative Index (DI) was successfully applied to examine the degradation status of sedimentary organic matter in different seasons. That DI decreased in spring and summer whereas increased in autumn and winter, illustrated that more degraded organic matter in summer and autumn than spring and winter in the cores. By principal component analysis, that a higher loading of Leu, Glu, Ile, Gly, Ser and Thr in the first principal component reflect the degradability of sedimentary organic nitrogen. As to natural shallow anoxic sediments, the decomposition rate of organic nitrogen in anoxic condition was slightly higher than that of aerobic condition, whereas aerobic condition conducive to the degradation of amino sugar (HA-N). The degradation of DON was major in terms of THAA-N which accounting for about 45% of the DON degradation in control. In the degradation of the THAA-N by microbe, THAA-N were absorbed and utilized in terms of polypeptide before decomposed into free amino acids.																			1018-4619						2012	21	2					282	289																WOS:000302925100008

Diurnal changes of DGM concentrations in two periods (morning increase vs afternoon decrease with an around-noon peak) were observed, and the changes closely followed daily solar radiation variation trends. The diurnal patterns prevailed in the late spring and summer, but became vague in the late fall and winter. The monthly mean DGM concentrations peaked at 40.8 pg L-1 in July and reached the lowest at 14.2 pg L-1 in December and 21.9 pg L-1 in January; this DGM concentration change closely followed the monthly mean solar radiation variation trend. The increase of the lake DGM concentration from January to July and its decrease from July to December mirror the typical daily rhythm of DGM concentration variations in the two periods. This finding supports the following hypothesis: The natural phenomenon of daily oscillation of freshwater DGM concentrations that follows diurnal solar radiation variation would manifest on a seasonal scale. High DGM concentrations were found in the spring and summer and low in the fall and winter (seasonal mean: 34.2, 37.5, 20.0, 24.4 pg L-1, respectively). This seems to suggest an annual occurrence of two periods of the seasonal DGM level fluctuation (spring and summer high vs fall and winter low DGM levels). Linear relationships of the monthly mean DGM concentrations were found with the monthly mean global solar radiation (R-2 = 0.82, P < 0.05) and UVA radiation (R-2 = 0.84, P < 0.05). Linear relationships of the seasonal mean DGM concentrations were also found with the seasonal mean global solar radiation (R-2 = 0.85, P = 0.08) and UVA radiation (R-2 = 0.93, P < 0.05).

J	Lei, CG; Wang, YF; Xu, YP				Lei, Chaogui; Wang, Yuefeng; Xu, Youpeng			Spatiotemporal characteristics of different-grade extreme precipitation evolution detected by innovative trend analysis	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Understanding the changing characteristics of extreme precipitation (EP) events is essential for formulating effective adaptive measures for water resource and flood hazard management. Although much research focused on annual extreme precipitation variations, there has been little comparison of changing characteristics of extreme precipitation in different grades and seasons. To this end, this study investigated extreme precipitation variations from multiple perspectives in Tai Lake Plain (TLP) during 1966-2015 at spatial (36 stations) and temporal (4 seasons) scales, using an innovative trend analysis (ITA) method with a significant test. Meanwhile, the trends were evaluated separately for low (< 30th), medium (30th-70th), and high (> 70th) grades of extreme precipitation. The ITA method was compared with two traditional trend analysis methods of linear regression (LR) analysis and Mann-Kendall (MK) test. The results indicate that (1) ITA detected a significant upward trend in annual EP indices (except consecutive dry days (CDD)) at the 99% confidence level and similar significant upward trends in summer and winter EPs, while downward trends in spring and autumn in most stations; (2) a relatively stronger intensifying trend of EPs occurred in the southeast and northeast of TLP in summer and winter; (3) from low to high grade, the annual and summer upward trends have continuously strengthened, whereas the downward trends in spring or autumn became weaker to an extent; and (4) significant trends (in three to eight EP indices) that cannot be observed by LR and MK can be effectively identified using ITA. So ITA showed advantages of revealing the hidden trends in climatic time series. These results by ITA can provide an informed reference for flood (or drought) risk management in different seasons and areas across the TLP region.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				2023 AUG 31	2023										10.1007/s00704-023-04611-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-023-04611-0		AUG 2023											WOS:001065250800002

We hypothesise that impacts of climate change can be distinguished from other environmental constraints controlling its population dynamics. During thermal stratification, P. rubescens formed a deep chlorophyll maximum in the metalimnion. Seasonal and diurnal depth distributions indicated that Planktothrix lived well below the euphotic zone, at low light levels and moderate temperatures. Photosynthetic parameters indicated a shade adapted population. The eutrophication and rehabilitation periods of Mondsee were characterised by fluctuations controlled by phosphorus, with periods below the P-threshold associated with low biovolumes and relatively stable populations. Positive net changes of Planktothrix biovolume occurred during the spring-summer transition and in autumn. During summer, the population usually declined to an annual minimum. The standardised residuals of annual biovolumes responded positively to the climate signal of the Winter North Atlantic Oscillation and the timing of the onset of stratification. An inverse relationship existed between off-set and persistence of stratification. P. rubescens only benefits from climate warming early in the year, during late spring overturn and early summer. Longer periods of summer stratification did not favour biovolume development.					; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021	Teubner, Katrin/0000-0002-3699-2043; Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2012	698	1					29	46		10.1007/s10750-012-1020-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1020-5													WOS:000309345700004
J	Lopez, LS; Hewitt, BA; Sharma, S				Lopez, Lianna S.; Hewitt, Bailey A.; Sharma, Sapna			Reaching a breaking point: How is climate change influencing the timing of ice breakup in lakes across the northern hemisphere?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The duration of seasonal winter ice cover has declined in many mid- and high-latitude regions around the world as climate continues to warm. We obtained data on lake ice breakup dates, air temperature, precipitation, and large-scale climate oscillations for 152 lakes across the northern hemisphere from 1951 to 2014. Ninety-seven percent of study lakes exhibited earlier ice breakup trends. Forty-six percent of the variation in ice breakup trends was driven by spring air temperatures and elevation across the northern hemisphere. However, changes in ice breakup have not always been in a gradual or linear pattern. Using the sequential T-test analysis of regime shifts, we found evidence of abrupt changes in mean ice breakup for 53% of lakes with shift years identified between 1970 and 2002. Concurrently, we found abrupt changes in mean spring and winter air temperatures, winter precipitation, and large-scale climate oscillations that occurred either the same year or 1 yr prior. Earlier ice breakup and the shortening of the ice season will have consequences for winter heritage, local economies, and lake ecosystems around the world.

Here, we updated ice phenology records for 60 lakes with time-series ranging from 107-204 years to provide the first re-assessment of Northern Hemispheric ice trends since 2004 by adding 15 additional years of ice phenology records and 40 lakes to our study. We found that, on average, ice-on was 11.0 days later, ice-off was 6.8 days earlier, and ice duration was 17.0 days shorter per century over the entire record for each lake. Trends in ice-on and ice duration were six times faster in the last 25-year period (1992-2016) than previous quarter centuries. More extreme events in recent decades, including late ice-on, early ice-off, shorter periods of ice cover, or no ice cover at all, contribute to the increasing rate of lake ice loss. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could limit increases in air temperature and abate losses in lake ice cover that would subsequently limit ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic consequences, such as increased evaporation rates, warmer water temperatures, degraded water quality, and the formation of toxic algal blooms.					; Marszelewski, Wlodzimierz/D-4630-2014; Perry, William/J-1355-2014; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Robertson, Dale/O-1913-2018	Imrit, Mohammad Arshad/0000-0001-9760-4625; Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Perry, William/0000-0001-6614-5526; Richardson, David/0000-0001-9374-9624; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281; Daly, Julia/0000-0003-4926-4720													2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT	2021	126	10							e2021JG006348	10.1029/2021JG006348	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006348													WOS:000711969900009
J	Guan, RZ; Wiles, PR				Guan, RZ; Wiles, PR			Feeding ecology of the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus in a British lowland river	AQUACULTURE												The feeding ecology of the introduced signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana) was studied in the River Great Ouse, the major lowland river in mid- to eastern England. A total of 22 food groups were categorized from the gut contents. They showed that P. leniusculus is an omnivorous species. In terms of frequency of occurrence or gravimetric composition, the top five main diets for all sizes of crayfish in four seasons were similar. They were vascular detritus, filamentous green algae Cladophora, crayfish fragments, Chironomidae, and Ephemeroptera. Signal crayfish showed season-related feeding habits. Vascular detritus and Cladophora were ingested most frequently by all sizes of crayfish throughout the year, especially in the autumn and winter. Adult crayfish (> 45 mm in carapace length) consumed more Chironomidae in the spring while consumed more Tricoptera in the summer. Coleoptera were consumed more by the young-of-the-year (YOY) in the spring. Signal crayfish also had size-related feeding habits. The larger the crayfish, the more vascular detritus was ingested. The frequency of occurrence of Cladophora was increased with crayfish size in the winter while that was higher for the median sized crayfish (20-45 mm in carapace length) in the summer. Fish were predated mainly by adult crayfish in the summer and autumn. Cannibalism occurred mainly in the summer and autumn and increased with crayfish size. Epheroptera were increasingly consumed with crayfish size in the summer while Coleoptera were consumed only by the YOY. The rations estimated for three g-h periods of a day showed that P. leniusculus is a typical nocturnal feeder. The estimated daily ration ranged from 0.22 to 6.02% of crayfish body wet weight with higher rations in the adults than juveniles and in the summer and autumn than other seasons. The,gross efficiency of food conversion decreased rapidly with increase in crayfish size. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

A modeling study of ice-water processes for Lake Erie applying coupled ice-circulation models	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A hydrodynamic model that includes ice processes and is optimized for parallel processing was configured for Lake Erie in order to study the ice-water coupling processes in the lake. A hindcast from April 2003 to December 2004 with hourly atmospheric forcing was conducted. The model reproduced the seasonal variation of ice cover, but the development of ice extent in January and its decay in March somewhat preceded the observations. Modeled lake circulation in ice-free seasons is consistent with previous studies for Lake Erie. Thermal structure of the lake was reasonably comparable to both satellite-derived observations and in-situ measurements, with mean differences ranging from -2 degrees C to 4 degrees C, depending on the season. The impacts of ice-water stress coupling and basal melting of ice were examined based on numerical experiments. The results show that: 1) ice-water stress coupling significantly dampens the subjacent lake circulation ill winter due to packed ice cover that slows down the surface water, and 2) basal melting of ice contributes to widespread ice cover in the lake. The demonstrated model validity could lead to further studies of ice-water processes in the lake, including interannual variation and impacts on ecosystems.

It is globally threatened, showing long-term major range contractions and declining abundance, linked to habitat loss and degradation. We remain ignorant about the biogeographical subpopulation structure of the species and potential differences in their migration timing, stopovers and schedules, information that could be vital to effective conservation of different elements of the species population, which we address here with results from a telemetry study. Methods In 2017-2018, we attached GPS/GSM telemetry devices to 238 Swan Geese on moulting sites in three discrete parts of their summering area (Dauria International Protected Area, Central Mongolia and Western Mongolia), generating 104 complete spring and autumn migration episodes to compare migration speed and nature between birds of different summer provenances. Results Birds from all three breeding areas used almost completely separate migration routes to winter sympatrically in the Yangtze River floodplain. Although many features of the spring and autumn migrations of the three groups were similar, despite the significantly longer migration routes taken by Western Mongolian tagged birds, birds from Dauria Region arrived significantly later in winter due to prolonged staging in coastal areas and took longer to reach their breeding areas in spring. Among birds of all breeding provenances, spring migration was approximately twice as fast as autumn migration. Areas used by staging Swan Geese (mainly wetlands) in autumn and spring almost never fell within national level protected areas, suggesting major site safeguard is necessary to protect these critical areas. Conclusions This study showed the discreteness of migration routes taken by birds of different summer provenances and differences in their migratory patterns, highlighting key staging areas (Yalu River Estuary in China/North Korea for Dauria Region breeding birds, Daihai Lake for Central Mongolian and Ordos Basin for Western Mongolian birds). Based on this new knowledge of the biogeographical subpopulation structure of the Swan Goose, we need to combine data on subpopulation size, their distribution throughout the annual life cycle and conservation status, to develop more effective conservation strategies and measures to reverse population decline throughout the range.					; Yi, Kun/ODK-5753-2025; Davaasuren, Batmunkh/HGB-1791-2022; Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-7066-2015; Damba, Iderbat/I-5018-2018	Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; Zhang, Junjian/0009-0006-0643-6579; Davaasuren, Batmunkh/0000-0002-8496-1508; Batbayar, Nyambayar/0000-0002-9138-9626; Damba, Iderbat/0000-0001-7274-3960													2053-7166					DEC 16	2021	12	1							73	10.1186/s40657-021-00308-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-021-00308-y													WOS:000730925100001

J	DAVIS, CC				DAVIS, CC			PLANKTON OF CLEVELAND HARBOR AREA OF LAKE ERIE IN 1956-1957	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												From September 1956 to October 1957, quantitative phytoplankton and zooplankton samples were obtained from 3 open water stations in Lake Erie in the vicinity of Cleveland Harbor. Certain chemical and physical determinations were made concomitantly. A total of 62 categories of phytoplankton and 53 categories of zooplankton are listed and discussed. The volume of the phytoplankton species was determined in terms of cubic decimillimeters per liter (dmm3/l), as was the number per liter of the species of zooplankton. The total phytoplankton volume ranged from 200 dmm3/l in mid-June to 17,800 dmm3A in mid- March. There was a massive vernal pulse followed by a summer minimum in mid-June. During each autumn the phytoplankton volume was high, but not so high as in the spring. Early winter volumes were low, but by no means as low as in June. During the autumn of 1956 the blue-green algae were dominant, with diatoms and green algae secondary. During early winter the diatom became overwhelmingly dominant, a position they maintained throughout the vernal pulse of 1957. In mid-June, however, the meager phytoplankton was dominated by phytoflagellates. In July, diatoms again became important, but during the fall of 1957 they became subordinate to an enormous pulse of green algae. Each category of phytoplankton is considered separately. The progress of dominant phytoplankton species through the year is discussed. In the autumn of 1956 the zooplankton was dominated by copepods and cladocerans, then later by cladocerans alone. In early winter the most important zooplankters were the copepods and the rotifers. The vernal period was characterized by the dominance of rotifers mainly. The summer dominants were large numbers of Cladocera and Copepoda, which were at their highest development at the time of the estival phytoplankton minimum. During the fall of 1957, copepods and cladocerans were most abundant at first, but later 2 species of rotifers dominated. The individual categories of the zooplankton also are discussed separately. The plankton is considered in relation to the ecosystem, and the changes over the years, as shown by the literature, is discussed. Long range changes in the phytoplankton are not clearly shown by the published accounts because of differing methods of collection and analysis performed by the individual authors. Among the zooplankters, however, the apparent increase of Diaptomus siciloides, from its absence (or near absence) in 1929 to its present condition as one of the 2 most abundant diaptomids may well be an indication of eutrophication.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1962	32	3					209	+		10.2307/1942399	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942399													WOS:A19621167B00001

Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton in a lagoon-type lake Izmenchivoye (Southeast Sakhalin)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE BIOLOGY												The seasonal changes in taxonomic structure, dynamics of number, and biomass of phytoplankton in the Izmenchivoye lagoon lake (southeast Sakhalin) were studied. In all, 266 species and intraspecies taxa of microalgae were revealed. The greatest species diversity (according to the Shannon index) was observed in May, August and October (H = 2.76-2.89), the least (H = 0.5-0.86), in April and January of 2006. The monthly average number varied from 997 up to 84 282 cells/l, and biomass from 18.98 up to 878.62 mg/m(3). The average annual number of phytoplankton and its biomass were 32 650 cells/l and biomass 172.13 mg/m(3) respectively. The maximum number was registered in August, 2005, and maximum biomass was recorded in January, 2006. Winter, spring and summer peaks of number coinciding with those of biomass were registered. For the first time, winter bloom of phytoplankton was registered in inland waters of the Sakhalin Island. In the winter and spring the basic input to formation of the parameters was composed of diatoms; in summer and autumn it was composed of by flagellates (dinophyta and cryptophyta).

J	Warren, RJ II; Vermette, S				Warren, Robert James, II; Vermette, Stephen			Laurentian Great Lakes warming threatens northern fruit belt refugia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Climate refugia are anomalous "pockets" of spatially or temporally disjunct environmental conditions that buffer distinct flora and fauna against prevailing climatic conditions. Physiographic landscape features, such as large water bodies, can create these micro-to-macro-scale terrestrial habitats, such as the prevailing westerly winds across the Laurentian Great Lakes that create relatively cooler leeward conditions in spring and relatively warmer leeward conditions in autumn. The leeward Great Lakes climate effects create refugia (popularly known as a "fruit belt") favorable for fruit-bearing trees and shrubs. These fruit belt refugia owe their existence to seasonal inversions whereby spring cooling prevents early flower budding that leaves fruit trees susceptible to late spring killing frosts, and autumn warming prevents early killing frosts. With global climate change, however, warmer summers and milder winters, and corresponding warmer waters, might erode the leeward delaying effect on spring flowering, creating a paradoxical situation in which warming increases the risk of frost damage to plants. We evaluated the success of regional agriculture in the Great Lakes fruit belt to test our hypothesis that warmer spring climate (and concomitant warmer lake waters) correspond with degraded fruit production. We also examined long-term trends in Great Lakes climate conditions. We found that the cold-sensitive fruit tree (apple, grape, peach, and cherry) refugia were destabilized by relatively warmer springs. Moreover, we found several indicators that lake waters are warming across the Great Lakes, which portends negative consequences for agricultural and natural plant communities in the Great Lakes region and in similar "fruit belt" refugia worldwide.

Lake-effect storms that form parallel to the major axes of these lakes can strongly impact communities by depositing more than 100 cm of snowfall in less than 24 h. Long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) storms are significantly different in structure and dynamics compared to the much more studied wind-parallel roll storms that typically form over the western Great Lakes. A Doppler on Wheels (DOW) mobile radar sampled several of these storms at fine spatial and temporal resolutions (and close to the surface) during the winter of 2010-11 over and downwind of Lake Ontario to document and improve understanding of how these storms develop. Over 1100 observations of vortices were catalogued within the 16 December 2010 and 4-5 January 2011 events. The majority of these vortices were less than 1 km in diameter with a statistical modal difference in Doppler velocity (delta-V) value across the vortex of 11 m s(-1). Vortices developed along boundaries, which formed within the bands, suggesting horizontal shear instability was the main cause. Other features noted in the DOW observations included bounded weak echo regions, anvils, and horizontal vortices, typically on the south side of west-east-oriented LLAP bands. The reflectivity and velocity structure of LLAP bands were found to be much more complex than previously thought, which may impact localized precipitation amounts and errors in forecast location/intensity.

In South America, the aquaculture of the native zooplanktivorous fish Odontesthes bonariensis (" pejerrey") has some constraints that could be overcome by applying extensive culture systems following an ecosystemic approach. This study represents the first attempt to develop ecological aquaculture in the region. An experiment of extensive cage culturewas carried out in La Salada de Monasterio Lake to answer how seasonal changes, both in physico-chemical and zooplankton features, affect the performance of pejerrey culture. Three successive rearing trials were carried out in spring, summer and autumn. The cageswere stockedwith pejerrey; whereas others (controls) were left without fish. Lake zooplankton abundance, biomass and species composition were different among seasons, with maximum abundance mean values during summer and maximum biomass mean values during spring. The zooplankton abundance found in cageswithout fish was higher than that registered in cages with fish, but no differences in species composition among those cages were detected. The pejerrey showed selective feeding habits throughout the entire experiment, and they fed mostly on copepods and cladocerans of N0.7 mm during spring and summer, especially after reaching 4 cm in total length, and on smaller copepods and cladocerans during autumn. The contribution of the different sizes of zooplankton to the gut contents was related to availability and to fish size, and the access to bigger zooplankton appeared to be a critical factor to promote better growth performance. The bigger fish were obtained in spring, when zooplankton biomass was maximum in the lake with greater representation of large cladocerans, with final fish weight eight times higher than that obtained in summer and fifty times greater than that obtained in autumn. The production obtained in spring was one and two orders of magnitude higher than that found in summer and autumn. The multiple linear regressions selected support the inference that seasonal temperature and zooplankton variations have effects on pejerrey growth in floating cages. Pampean lakes could be suitable environments to support pejerrey ecological aquaculture, and spring emerges as the better season to start an extensive culture that takes advantage of the zooplankton composition and dynamics.

We sampled during the austral autumn-winter of 2006 and in the spring-summer of 2006-2007, using three sampling stations for each system. We used canonical correspondence analysis to establish relations between frequency of taxa and environmental variables. We demonstrate that the structure and composition of the aquatic biota in humid areas of the Altiplano is determined by physical and chemical variables of the water. The most relevant one is total nitrogen, which is also the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton production in tropical systems. Benthos and zooplankton showed significant associations with the set of environmental variables (Monte Carlo test, p<0.05); however, the association was not significant for phytoplankton. Lake Chungara showed the greatest variation in composition and abundance of zooplankton between autumn-winter and spring-summer, while in the Huasco salar the physical and chemical characteristics were related to the composition and abundance of the benthonic fauna. Thus, changes in the water volume of these systems would have repercussions in chemical and physical variables, altering the species assemblage and possibly the efficiency and stability of ecosystem functions.

J	Quinn, FH				Quinn, FH			Secular changes in Great Lakes water level seasonal cycles	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The three primary scales of Great Lakes water level fluctuations are interannual, seasonal, and episodic. Of these three, the seasonal water level fluctuations have received relatively little attention. The Great Lakes water levels have a well defined seasonal cycle driven primarily by snowmelt in the spring and summer and lake evaporation in the fall and winter. The present average seasonal cycle ranges from 26 cm on Lake Superior to 38 cm on Lake Ontario. Great Lakes monthly water levels from 1860 to 2000 were used to assess changes in the seasonal cycle of each of the Great Lakes and Lake St. Clair over the past 140 years. Changes are found on all of the lakes during the period of record. They usually resulted in a decrease in seasonal range and a time shift in the months of seasonal maximum and minimum. The effects of lake regulation were found to be negligible in the case of Lake Superior and significant for Lake Ontario. The major changes on Lakes St. Clair and Erie are likely a result of changes in the connecting channels ice retardation rather than changes in seasonal hydrometeorology. Seasonal cycle regimes are delineated for each of the lakes and possible rationale for the changes discussed.																			0380-1330						2002	28	3					451	465		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70597-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70597-2													WOS:000178250700012

Annual water fluctuations in Rainy Lake and Kabetogama Lake average 1.0 and 2.7 m respectively, with high water in summer and early fall followed by a winter drawdown. During 1985-1987, significantly greater Muskrat density was indicated in Rainy Lake based on spring 1986 sign survey, fall 1986 trapnight success and house counts for 1985-86 and 1986-1987. All other density estimates indicated greater numbers in Rainy Lake. Muskrat weights differed significantly between areas in spring 1986; other body measurements did not differ significantly. Survival of radio-marked Muskrats was very low in both areas, especially during freeze-up in early winter.																			0008-3550					JAN-MAR	1991	105	1					34	40																WOS:A1991FR49600005

This allowed the annual cycle of water temperatures and ice cover in these lakes to be described quantitatively, and their dependence on lake altitude above sea level to be investigated. LSWTs in the Tatra Mountains are found to decrease approximately linearly with increasing altitude from late spring to autumn. LSWT in summer can be modelled well in terms of exponentially smoothed ambient air temperature. Although the timing of ice-off is dependent on altitude, the timing of ice-on is not; the dependence of the duration of ice cover on altitude is therefore wholly due to the altitudinal dependence of the timing of ice-off. The temperature profile measurements allow quantitative characterization of summer and winter stagnation, and spring and autumn turnover.

A Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) polarity reversal in 1977 significantly affected winter air and summer water temperatures in Castle Lake. The timing of lake ice-out was explained by spring air temperature and winter total precipitation (r(2) = 0.72) and significantly affected water temperature (r(2) = 0.74). Primary productivity was negatively correlated with ice-out date and positively correlated with primary productivity during the previous year (r(2) = 0.47). Alternatively, primary productivity was positively correlated with water temperature and primary productivity during the previous year (r(2) = 0.49). Ammonium availability immediately after ice-out was significantly related to primary productivity from the previous and the current year, suggesting that nutrient availability is an important mechanism for the serial correlation. Daphnia and cyanobacteria biomass also increased during warmer years. Our results suggest that variability in air temperature and precipitation from global warming, PDO, and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influence primary productivity and plankton communities in North American dimictic lakes.					; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010	Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863; Park, Sangkyu/0000-0003-3049-0728; 													0024-3590					MAR	2004	49	2					614	619		10.4319/lo.2004.49.2.0614	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.2.0614													WOS:000224979500029
J	Zhang, H; Dill, C				Zhang, Hong; Dill, Christopher			Apparent rates of production and loss of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) in a southern reservoir lake (Tennessee, USA)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Apparent rates of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) concentration changes in a southern reservoir lake (Cane Creek Lake, Cookeville, Tennessee) were investigated using the DGM data collected in a 12-month study fromjune 2003 to May 2004. The monthly mean apparent DGM production rates rose from january (3.2 pgL(-1)/h), peaked in the summer months (June-August: 8.9, 8.0, 8.6 pg L-1/h), and fell to the lowest in December (1.6 pg L-1/h); this trend followed the monthly insolation march for both global solar radiation and UVA radiation. The monthly apparent DGM loss rates failed to show the similar trend with no consistent pattern recognizable. The spring and summer had higher seasonal mean apparent DGM production rates than the fall and winter (6.8, 9.0, 3.9, 5.0 pg L-1/h, respectively), and the seasonal trend also appeared to closely follow the solar radiation variation. The seasonal apparent DGM loss featured similar rate values for the four seasons (5.5, 4.3, 3.3, and 3.9 pg L-1/h for spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively). Correlation was found of the seasonal mean apparent DGM production rate with the seasonal mean morning solar radiation (r=0.9084, p<0.01) and with the seasonal mean morning UVA radiation (r=0.9582, p<0.01). No significant correlation was found between the seasonal apparent DGM loss rate and the corresponding afternoon solar radiation (r=0.5686 for global radiation and 0.6098 for UVA radiation). These results suggest that DGM production in the lake engaged certain photochemical processes, either primary or secondary, but the DGM loss was probably driven by some dark processes.

Contribution of warm habitat to cold-water fisheries	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												A central tenet of landscape ecology is that mobile species depend on complementary habitats, which are insufficient in isolation, but combine to support animals through the full annual cycle. However, incorporating the dynamic needs of mobile species into conservation strategies remains a challenge, particularly in the context of climate adaptation planning. For cold-water fishes, it is widely assumed that maximum temperatures are limiting and that summer data alone can predict refugia and population persistence. We tested these assumptions in populations of redband rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss newberrii) in an arid basin, where the dominance of hot, hyperproductive water in summer emulates threats of climate change predicted for cold-water fish in other basins. We used telemetry to reveal seasonal patterns of movement and habitat use. Then, we compared contributions of hot and cool water to growth with empirical indicators of diet and condition (gut contents, weight-length ratios, electric phase angle, and stable isotope signatures) and a bioenergetics model. During summer, trout occurred only in cool tributaries or springs (<20 degrees C) and avoided Upper Klamath Lake (>25 degrees C). During spring and fall, >= 65% of trout migrated to the lake (5-50 km) to forage. Spring and fall growth (mean [SD] 0.58% per day [0.80%] and 0.34 per day [0.55%], respectively) compensated for a net loss of energy in cool summer refuges (-0.56% per day [0.55%]). In winter, >= 90% of trout returned to tributaries (25-150 km) to spawn. Thus, although perennially cool tributaries supported thermal refuge and spawning, foraging opportunities in the seasonally hot lake ultimately fueled these behaviors. Current approaches to climate adaptation would prioritize the tributaries for conservation but would devalue critical foraging habitat because the lake is unsuitable and unoccupied during summer. Our results empirically demonstrate that warm water can fuel cold-water fisheries and challenge the common practice of identifying refugia based only on summer conditions.

Delayed timing of successful spawning of an estuarine dependent fish, black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In this paper, we investigate the period of successful spawning for black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri, an obligate estuarine species in southern Australia that typically spawn in spring and early summer. However, back-calculated spawning dates of juveniles sampled in Gippsland Lakes, Victoria from February to May 2016 indicated that spawning was concentrated over a short period in the Austral mid-summer (January), with a second spawning in late summer and early autumn (late February-early March). Ichthyoplankton sampling in the tributary estuaries from October to early December collected substantial numbers of fish larvae, dominated by gobiids, eleotrids and retropinnids of freshwater origin, but no A. butcheri. The lack of A. butcheri larvae was consistent with the delayed successful spawning indicated by juvenile otolith data. Freshwater flows declined from late winter to summer, with consistent salinity stratification of the water column. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were generally very low below the halocline. These conditions may have delayed the upstream spawning migration of adults or may have been unsuitable for survival of eggs and newly-hatched larvae. Longer-term predictions for climate change in southern Victoria, including the Gippsland Lakes region, are for lower winter-spring freshwater flows, potentially benefiting the reproductive success of A. butcheri through high water-column stratification, but only if DO concentrations are not compromised by a lack of high winter flows needed to flush low DO water from the system.

Seasonal variations in gonosomatic indexes were typical of this species, and RNA/DNA decreased as gonads matured during the spring. RNA/DNA and energy storage in the liver decreased during the major spawning season. Seasonal variations in food consumption may have effected seasonal growth and energy storage. A summer depression in RNA/DNA may have been more closely associated with the effects of thermal stratification and dissolved O2 stress.																				1095-8649					1981	18	3					237	244		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb03766.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb03766.x													WOS:A1981LH00700001
J	Lenters, JD; Kratz, TK; Bowser, CJ				Lenters, JD; Kratz, TK; Bowser, CJ			Effects of climate variability on lake evaporation: Results from a long-term energy budget study of Sparkling Lake, northern Wisconsin (USA)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Variations in lake evaporation have a significant impact on the energy and water budgets of lakes. Understanding these variations and the role of climate is important for water resource management as well as predicting future changes in lake hydrology as a result of climate change. This study presents a comprehensive, 10-year analysis of seasonal, intraseasonal, and interannual variations in lake evaporation for Sparkling Lake in northern Wisconsin (USA). Meteorological and lake temperature measurements are made at a raft on the lake and are supplemented by radiation measurements from a nearby airport. The data are analyzed over 14-day periods from 1989 to 1998 (during the ice-free season) to provide bi-weekly energy budget estimates of evaporation rate (along with uncertainty estimates). The mean evaporation rate for Sparkling Lake over the study period is 3.1 mm day(-1), with a coefficient of variation of 25%. Considerable variability in evaporation rates is found on a wide range of timescales, with seasonal changes having the highest coefficient of variation (18%), followed by the intraseasonal (15%) and interannual timescales (12%; for summer means). Intraseasonal changes in evaporation are primarily associated with synoptic weather variations, with high evaporation events tending to occur during incursions of cold, dry air (due, in part, to the thermal lag between air and lake temperatures). Seasonal variations in evaporation are largely driven by temperature and net radiation, but are out-of-phase with changes in wind speed. This presents challenges when calculating evaporation rates by means of the simpler mass-transfer technique. On interannual timescales, changes in summer evaporation rates are strongly associated with changes in net radiation and show only moderate connections to variations in temperature or humidity. Nonetheless, we are able to identify a simple, empirical relationship for estimating interannual evaporation rates that is more accurate than the mass transfer technique. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This study contributes to the knowledge of the long-term ecological features of Mediterranean artificial lakes based on a case study of Bidighinzu Lake in Sardinia, Italy, a warm, monomitic and hypereutrophic reservoir mainly used for drinking water. Among the different restoration actions carried out in Bidighinzu Lake to improve water quality is the reduction of nutrient loads from the watershed. To study multiannual trends of the trophic state, a long-term series (1988-2012) of both environmental variables and phytoplankton was analysed. Mann-Kendall tests revealed increasing trends for total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratios (TN:TP; significant in spring, summer, and winter) and decreasing trends for ammonium (winter and autumn), TP (all seasons), orthophosphate (spring, summer, and winter), reactive silica (autumn), and pH (summer). Among phytoplankton, significant increasing trends were assessed in biomass of Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Dinophyceae, and Chrysophyceae. Cyanobacteria did not show a clear trend, although at the order level, Chroococcales significantly increased in summer and decreased in winter. Despite these major tendencies, the lake did not show significant improvement in its eutrophic state, probably due to an inherent resistance and the insufficient and/or not well calibrated or applied recovery actions.					; Pulina, Silvia/Q-2684-2017; Luglie, Antonella/M-4321-2015; PULINA, Silvia/Q-2684-2017; Lugliè, Antonella/M-4321-2015	Padedda, Bachisio Mario/0000-0002-0988-5613; Luglie, Antonella/0000-0001-6382-4208; PULINA, Silvia/0000-0002-4861-4170; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2015	5	4					339	354		10.5268/IW-5.4.868	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-5.4.868													WOS:000362442500004
J	Lund, MA; Davis, JA				Lund, MA; Davis, JA			Seasonal dynamics of plankton communities and water chemistry in a eutrophic wetland (Lake Monger, Western Australia): implications for biomanipulation	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												In a large (70 ha) shallow (<2m deep) eutrophic wetland investigated between November 1988 and October 1989, there were marked seasonal changes in water quality and the composition of zooplankton, and to a lesser extent phytoplankton communities, with three distinct groupings evident: summer, winter-spring and autumn. Summer conditions were characterized by high levels of total P (689+/-198 mu g L-1), N limitation, blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa (mean chlorophyll a = 466+/-30 mu g L-1) and zooplankton communities dominated by cyclopoid copepods (Mesocyclops sp. and Microcyclops sp.). Winter-spring conditions were characterized by Secchi disk transparencies to the bed (chlorophyll a <50 mu g L-1), low total P (71+/-40 mu g L-1) and zooplankton communities dominated by Daphnia carinata King. Autumn conditions represented an intermediate state between these two. Significant linear relationships were recorded between chlorophyll a and total P and between chlorophyll a and D. carinata. Abundances of hemipteran predators (Anisops sp.) were correlated with D. carinata, but the relationship did not appear to be causal. The decline in D. carinata in summer was attributed to food limitation. Reductions in nutrient inputs to the lake in 1990-91, resulted in improved water quality and high abundances of D. carinata during summer.

The research results show that spring, winter and annual average air temperature has been obviously increasing, change trends of seasonal and annual precipitation were not significant. Seasonal and annual pan evaporation has been obviously decreasing, and the amplitude reduction of pan evaporation in summer and spring is larger than in autumn and winter. Annual average air temperature has presented an abrupt rising change in 1985, annual precipitation hasn't presented abrupt change, and annual pan evaporation has presented two abrupt changes in 1969 and 1985. The long-term trend of pan evaporation cannot be explained by the change of an environmental factor.																					978-0-7695-3563-0				2009							340	344		10.1109/ETTandGRS.2008.31	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ETTandGRS.2008.31													WOS:000269688700083

Bird diversity and conservation status in Isparta province (Turkey)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim : With its wetland areas, forests, high mountains and other habitat varieties, Isparta Province hosts many bird species. Furthermore, it provides birds with the opportunity of relaxation, breeding and accommodation in both the migration season and the rest of the period in a year due to its higly favourable geographical position and wetland areas. For this reason, the migration route of Northwest-South, which a part of the research area of this study is located, has great importance. Methodology : The species were determined by Line transect and Point counts method. Besides direct sighting and identification, the observations were made using some signs and traces belonging to birds such as footprints, faeces, voices, shape of wings and feathers. Results : As a result of the field surveys performed during four different seasons (Winter-Spring-Summer Autumn), total 60.120 individuals and 266 bird species were determined. The research carried out during the period between 2013 and 2014, and during the period, 85 species were identified in the fields surveys of winter season, were categorized as 63 residents, 18 winter visitors, 3 summer visitors and 1 transit- winter visitor and while 83 of them were in the category of LC (Least Concern), one was located in the category of NT (Near Threatened) and 1 has been identified as VU (Vulnerable). During field surveys of spring season, 88 species consisted of 59 residents, 25 summer visitors and 4 transits, were categorized as 84 LC, 1 NT, 2 VU and one EN (Endangered), while total 115 species comprised 69 residents, 41 summer visitors, 4 transits and 1 transit-winter visitor were categorized as 113 LC, 1 VU and 1 EN during summer season. Including 68 resident, 6 winter visitors, 9 summer visitors, 2 transits, 2 transit-winter visitors and 1 resident-summer visitors, total 88 species were determined in the field surveys of the autumn season.

J	Rolff, C				Rolff, C			Seasonal variation in δ13C and δ15N of size-fractionated plankton at a coastal station in the northern Baltic proper	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Seasonal cycles of delta(13)C and delta(15)N in dissolved organic carbon and size-fractionated plankton, ranging from bacteria to the jellyfish Aurelia aurita, were studied during a 1 yr cycle at a coastal station in the Baltic Sea. The observed isotopic changes were found with time lags in all size-fractions of plankton. The delta(13)C showed a bimodal cycle with 2 local maxima, the first coinciding with the spring bloom and the second with the autumn bloom. In delta(15)N, the annual cycle was trimodal with 3 local maxima. The first occurred in connection with the spring bloom, the second in mid-summer and the third was a broad autumn-to-winter maximum. The causes of these patterns are discussed in relation to measured oceanographic variables. In the summer, a depleted nitrogen isotopic signal was propagated through all size-classes of plankton, indicating direct or secondary utilisation of fixed nitrogen from cyanobacteria. The strength of the signal indicated that nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are more ecologically important as instantaneous nitrogen sources in the Baltic than previously assumed. Enrichment of delta(15)N in size-classes of plankton was found to be a linear function of logarithmic organism size from 20 to 500 mu m, reflecting size-related consumption patterns of marine plankton food-webs. The explanatory power of the Linear regression and the enrichment per unit size were stronger in spring and autumn than in the summer, reflecting time lags and diversity in the zooplankton community. The size-specific approach was found to be a simpler and more appropriate way of analysing trophic isotope enrichment in plankton food-webs than the assumption of a general enrichment factor per trophic level.																			0171-8630	1616-1599					2000	203						47	65		10.3354/meps203047	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps203047													WOS:000089661100004

Small ponds, whose area only occupies approximately 8.6%, comprise the bulk of CH4 efflux from lakes and ponds on a global scale. However, temporal and spatial variability, as well as consequences of CH4 fluxes from ponds, remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine using 4 field experiments diel methane (CH4) fluxes from a subtropic eutrophic pond in different seasons. For the eutrophic pond, the mean CH4 efflux for all seasons was 1.772mg/m(2)/h, and CH4 emissions in summer were approximately three-fold higher than total of winter, spring, and autumn. Methane diffusive emissions were positively correlated with water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and air temperature but negatively related to pH and to the difference between water temperature and air temperature. The diel diffusive CH4 flux among different seasons varied significantly. The CH4 bubble flux did not differ markedly in winter, spring and autumn, but the quantity in summer was significantly different from all other seasons. Bubble is the main pathway for CH4 emissions. The CH4 ebullition flux accounts for 66, 71, 97 and 98% of the total in winter, spring, summer and autumn, respectively. On an annual scale, the CH4 ebullition flux accounts for 77% of the total fluxes (diffusive+ebullitive). Our results show that further investigations need to be carried out to probe temporal variability of CH4 fluxes in ponds located in different climate zones for better understanding of the global carbon budget, which is critical to predict future climate changes.																			0277-2248	1029-0486					2018	100	4					413	424		10.1080/02772248.2018.1499231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2018.1499231													WOS:000452058400003
J	Zhang, C; Zhang, WN; Liu, HA; Gao, XP; Huang, YX				Zhang, Chen; Zhang, Wenna; Liu, Hanan; Gao, Xueping; Huang, Yixuan			A quantitative assessment of the contributions of climatic indicators to changes in nutrients and oxygen levels in a shallow reservoir in China	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Climate change has an indirect effect on water quality in freshwater ecosystems, but it is difficult to assess the contribution of climate change to the complex system. This study explored to what extent climatic indicators (air temperature, wind speed, and rainfall) influence nutrients and oxygen levels in a shallow reservoir, Yuqiao Reservoir, China. The study comprises three parts-describing the temporal trends of climatic indicators and water quality parameters during the period 1992-2011, analyzing the potential impacts of climate on water quality, and finally developing a quantitative assessment to evaluate how climatic factors govern nutrient levels in the reservoir. Our analyses showed that the reservoir experienced substantial cold periods (1992-2001) followed by a warm period (2002-2011). The results showed that increasing air temperature in spring, autumn, and winter and increasing annual wind speed decrease total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the reservoir in spring, summer, and winter. According to the quantitative assessment, the increase in air temperature in spring and winter had a larger contribution to the decrease in TP concentration (47.2 and 64.1%), compared with the influence from decreased wind speed and rainfall. The field data suggest that nutrients decline due to enhanced uptake by macrophytes in years when spring was warmer and the macrophytes started to grow earlier in the season. The increasing wind speed and air temperature in spring also significantly contribute to the increase in dissolved oxygen concentration. This study helps managers to foresee how potential future climate change might influence water quality in similar lake ecosystems.

The fish were acclimated to 12 degrees C and a natural photoperiod before measurements. Fish were tested in autumn (September-October), winter (January February), spring (April-May) and summer (June-August). (2) Arctic charr showed a stable preference temperature of 11.5-11.8 degrees C from spring to autumn and a drop in preference temperature to 8.7 degrees C in winter. (3) In summer, the preference temperature of the charr coincided with environmental temperatures in their native lake, whereas during the other seasons, the preference temperatures were higher. (4) Overall, there was a positive correlation between individual fish growth rate and preference temperature, suggesting that the seasonal variation in preference temperature may be connected to seasonal variation in food intake and feeding motivation.

J	Wang, LM; Wang, JX; Wang, LC; Zhu, LP; Li, XO				Wang, Liuming; Wang, Junxiao; Wang, Lachun; Zhu, Liping; Li, Xingong			Terrestrial water storage regime and its change in the endorheic Tibetan Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Analogous to flow regime, this study proposed a new statistical framework to assess inter-annual and intra-annual terrestrial water storage (TWS) regime and its changes from the aspects of magnitude, variability, duration and components. The framework was applied to two endorheic basins, Inner Basin (IB) and Qaidam Basin (QB), in the Tibetan Plateau and their eight sub-regions. Our major findings are as follows: (1) TWS in the IB (2.09-2.35 mm/a, P < 0.05) and QB (0.05-0.52 mm/a, P > 0.1) increased in all seasons from 1989 to 2019 with regional climate warming and wetting. TWS showed high increase rates (>4.50 mm/a, P < 0.05) in northeastern IB but decrease rates (<-0.90mm/a) in southern IB. Seasonal total storage in groundwater, lake, permafrost and glacier (GLPIA) also increased in both the IB (2.55-2.68 mm/a, P < 0.05) and QB (0.05-0.43 mm/a). Seasonal soil water storage (SWA) decreased in the IB (-0.39 to -0.26 mm/a) and slightly increased in the QB (0.002-0.08 mm/a); (2) Intra-annual TWS followed approximately a cosine curve. After mutation, monthly TWS showed a higher positive magnitude change (>50 mm), accompanied by a longer duration and higher variability in the IB and its northeastern subregions. There was a large reduction in low storage (-18.25 mm) combined with higher variability in southeastern IB; (3) SWA change dominated the storage surplus in summer (82%) and storage deficit in autumn (-78%) and winter (-51%) in the IB, while GLPIA change dominated the storage surplus in spring (57%). In the QB, TWS change was mainly contributed by SWA change in spring (94%) and by GLPIA change in summer (73%), autumn (-62%) and winter (-58%). Component contribution rates showed a significant change in spring and winter but not much change in summer and autumn, indicating that the TWS components were more sensitive to climate change in the cold season.

Migration routes were indistinct, distances averaged 46 km. Caribou also lived on islands in 2 other lakes, but 2 bands showed no seasonal migrations and did not use available islands. All caribou aggregated in large, traditional wintering areas or small, temporary ones (.chi. = 66 km2) similar to the "yards" of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). The reasons for carbiou choosing these areas were undetermined but recognition of regularly used wintering areas open new possibilities for caribou management.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				JAN	1987	51	1					69	79		10.2307/3801634	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3801634													WOS:A1987H134900016

Growth of Elodea canadensis in boreal lakes	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Many invasive species are expanding northwards into boreal and subarctic habitats, but research on the factors favoring their establishment in these regions remains limited. In three Swedish lakes we investigated the growth of Elodea canadensis Michx, a highly invasive macrophyte that is spreading northwards in Europe and Alaska. We conducted an in situ growth experiment, maintained for ten months, in concert with two field macrophyte surveys, undertaken in summer and spring. We further compared the performance of propagules established during summer with those established under less favorable conditions in late autumn. We found that E. canadensis grew throughout the autumn, followed by winter dieback, with regrowth occurring early in the spring when water temperatures remained under 5 degrees C. Elodea canadensis plants were frequently found in our spring field survey, soon after ice melt, when almost all other species were still dormant. In the growth experiment, growth of individual shoots was positively associated with key abiotic variables (especially alkalinity) and also with increasing cover of E. canadensis. The tendency of propagule shoots to fragment from the main stems was also positively associated with increasing E. canadensis length and ambient population cover. Although propagules established in November initially did worse the following spring than those established in August, by the start of the following summer both groups were growing equally well, and had converged in morphology. The growth of E. canadensis throughout autumn and its early re-growth in spring, the capacity of propagules established even in late autumn to regrow well the following year, and the apparently self-reinforcing effect of increasing local population size on shoot growth all have the potential to benefit E. canadensis as it spreads north into boreal and subarctic regions.

J	Handley, RJ; Davy, AJ				Handley, RJ; Davy, AJ			Temperature effects on seed maturity and dormancy cycles in an aquatic annual, Najas marina, at the edge of its range	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Najas marina is a summer annual of shallow lakes that reaches its distributional limit in the Norfolk Broads of eastern England. Seeds are shed in autumn and overwinter in lake sediments. 2 We investigated the influence of growing-season length on seed maturity and germinability and the cumulative effects of winter temperatures on patterns of germinability. Seeds were stratified for up to 1 year and tested for germinability at 4-week intervals. Data-loggers recorded temperatures simultaneously at the field site and in the cold room. Cumulative temperature below a threshold (thermal time) was used to relate behaviour in cold storage to phenology. 3 Most seeds were dormant at collection. Cold storage of imbibed seed resulted in loss of dormancy. The proportion of non-dormant seeds peaked after a cold treatment equivalent to one winter, i.e. coinciding with favourable temperatures for germination in the field. Continued cold stratification resulted in a cycle of secondary dormancy and its subsequent relief; the thermal time characterizing the second, lower, peak in germinability coincided approximately with that attained in the field in the second spring after collection. 4 Shortening the growing season of Najas marina, by collecting material before natural senescence was complete, reduced the proportion of mature seeds, lowered average germinability and increased germination times. 5 The thermal capacity of water bodies causes a lag in spring warming, whereas declining light becomes limiting in autumn. Najas marina is crucially dependent on the length of growing season to produce sufficient viable seed. A low-temperature requirement to break seed dormancy prevents inappropriate autumn germination. In a prolonged winter (necessarily followed by a shorter growing season), a significant proportion of seed would go into secondary dormancy and remain in the seed bank until the second spring. 6 In annual plants, such requirements for warm summers and cold winters could contribute to a continental-climate distribution in northern Europe. In the case of Najas marina this might explain its limit at the eastern extremity of England and thus its rarity.

J	Bergmaier, PT; Geerts, B				Bergmaier, Philip T.; Geerts, Bart			Airborne Radar Observations of Lake-Effect Snowbands over the New York Finger Lakes	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The vast majority of lake-effect snow research throughout the years has focused on the North American Great Lakes since they are often associated with strong lake-effect events that produce heavy downstream snowfall. This study investigates a lake-effect snow event that instead occurred over two smaller lakes, the New York Finger Lakes, which are just 0(5) km wide and 0(50) km long. A pair of well-defined snow bands that formed over Seneca and Cayuga Lakes, the two largest of the Finger Lakes, were sampled from above by a vertically pointing Doppler radar and lidar on board the University of Wyoming King Air (UWKA). With typical widths matching the widths of the lakes, and depths of less than 1000 m, the long lake-axis-parallel bands were actually quite intense for their size. For example, updrafts of 2-3 m s(-1) or greater within the band cores were common, and reflectivity occasionally exceeded 5 dBZ. Airborne dual Doppler data show that both bands were sometimes accompanied by a well-defined thermally driven secondary circulation. Lidar data reveal that the Cayuga Lake band contained significantly more liquid water than the band over Seneca Lake, which was composed mainly of ice. Dissipating lake-effect ice clouds, carried downstream from Lake Ontario toward Seneca Lake, likely seeded the emerging convection over Seneca Lake, resulting in an accelerated depletion of liquid in the Seneca Lake band via more efficient snow growth.

In winter and in summer the bottom sediments released net phosphates into the water (3.4 -5.6 and 5.2-16.6 mg P .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. 24 hrs.-1, respectively), in spring and in autumn they took them up from the water (0.2 and 0.1-4.5 mg P .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. 24 hrs.-1). Phosphate release rate varied more widely between consecutive study years than between the two lake basins. Because of oxygen condition differences, the annual phosphate load per lake unit surface area was in the culture basin 10-50% higher than in the distant basin.																			0070-9557						1987	35	1					219	236																WOS:A1987M778400011

Time series analyses of most variables showed trends consistent with a further deterioration in trophic status. Significant rising trends were recorded for water temperature, oxygen saturation, chlorophyll a (mean of the 0-4 m water layer) and hypolimnetic SRP and TP, whereas SRP (mean of 0-4 m) and SD transparency showed significant falling trends. Most of these trends began in 1988/89 and winter and spring months were usually the most affected. Between 1989 and 1992 algal mass remained on high levels during winter (9-63 mu g l(-1)) compared to earlier years (5-12 mu g(-1)). Starting in 1990 diatoms and cryptophytes, usually dominant during winter and spring, were outcompeted by cyanophytes The recorded changes happened to occur during a five year period of consecutive mild winters between 1988 and 1992. Basically changes have been triggered by a 1-3 weeks earlier onset of thermal stratification and the absence of longer ice cover periods, which obviously affected the amount of available light for overwintering algae. The earlier onset of thermal stratification affected the system in two major respects: (i) Epilimnetic SRSi limitation started early, and higher sedimentary losses for diatoms are assumed. (ii) It led to an altogether prolongation of the summer stagnation period with repercussion on nutrient dynamics. As hypolimnetic phosphorus accumulated at a constant rate in 9 out of 11 years, the prolongation of the stagnation period is one likely explanation for rising internal phosphorus contents by the end of the summer stagnation period. Sixty-nine percent and 46% of the variation in maximal algal mass in fall can be explained by maximal hypolimnetic SRP content and the duration of the summer stagnation period. Overall, possible implications of thermal stress on stratified eutrophic lake ecosystems are proposed.

The main body of the lake was ice-free between June 20 and December 13, 1997, and June 1, 1998, and January 8, 1999, with the extended ice-free season in 1997-1998 coinciding with 4 degrees C above normal air temperatures and an abnormally strong El Nino. Measurements extending roughly 5.0 to 8.5 km across the lake were made from a small rock outcrop located near the main body of the lake. The lake was thermally stratified between mid-July and September, with the thermocline extending down to approximately 15 m. High winds were effective in mixing warm surface waters downward and, when accompanied by cold fronts, resulted in large, episodic evaporation events typically lasting 45 hours. The daily total evaporation was best described as a function of the product of the horizontal wind speed and vapor pressure difference between the water surface and atmosphere. Seasonally, the latent heat flux was initially negative (directed toward the surface) followed by a steady increase to positive values (directed away from the surface) shortly after ice breakup. The latent heat flux then remained positive for the remainder of the ice-free period, decreasing midsummer and then steadily increasing until freeze-up. The sensible heat flux was small and often negative most of the spring and summer yet switched to positive and began to increase in the early fall. Extrapolation of evaporation measurements for the entire ice-free periods gave totals of 386 and 485 mm in 1997 and 1998-1999, respectively.

The concentration of total nitrogen (TN) in overlying water was high in spring and autumn, but that of NO3--N reached its peak in autumn. From summer to autumn and from winter to spring, the concentration of phosphorus in overlying water decreased, while it increased from autumn to winter. Vertical characteristic forms of phosphorus in sediment cores are total phosphorus (TP), labile phosphorus (LP), Fe-P and Al-P, obviously enriched in the surface layer (0-10 cm), but their concentrations are observably reduced along with the depth of sediment. The research is of important theoretical and practical value to understand the status and to control the developmental trend of eutrophication in Donghu Lake.

Experiments conducted in the fall, winter and spring indicated that rotifers dominated the grazing on nanoflagellates by metazoans in the winter (68%) and spring (92%). Rotifer grazing was not determined in the autumn. It is likely that the greater impact of rotifer grazing in the spring was due to the occurrence of abundant filamentous cyanobacteria and gelatinous colonial phytoplankton which selectively depressed feeding rates of crustaceans compared to rotifers. Crustacean predation on nanoflagellates was highest in the autumn when cladocerans (primarily Daphnia spp.) were abundant. Predation by metazoan zooplankton in this lake appeared capable of removing the total standing stock of heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoplankton in < 1 d. Impacts of ciliated protozoa on nanoplankton, calculated from abundances and literature feeding rates, ranged from approximately one-third to four times that of metazoan predation depending on season and method of calculation. The relative importance of the different groups of predators appears to vary seasonally which is expected to alter the transfer of energy, carbon and nutrients from bacteria to higher trophic levels.

The wintertime outflow limit is set as 2410 m(3)/s by Lake Superior Regulation Plan 1977-A as a result of ice jam flooding during the 1916-1917 winter. This paper presents a numerical model study on the ice conditions in the St. Marys River to assess the maximum allowable Lake Superior wintertime outflow. Freeze-up, frazil transport and accumulation, and breakup were simulated with a thermal-ice dynamic model. The highest potential for flooding exists during ice breakup and simulations were run to determine a safe discharge limit for the breakup period. Simulations indicated the winter flow limit may be increased to 2690 m(3)/s if flow regulation is managed with care to prevent premature ice cover breakup.

Mesoscale boundary layer and heat flux variations over pack ice-covered Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The development of extensive pack ice fields on the Great Lakes significantly influences lake-effect storms and local airmass modification, as well as the regional hydrologic cycle and lake water levels. The evolution of the ice fields and their impacts on the atmospheric boundary layer complicates weather forecasters' ability to accurately predict late-season lake-effect snows. The Great Lakes Ice Cover-Atmospheric Flux (GLICAF) experiment was conducted over Lake Erie during February 2004 to investigate the surface-atmosphere exchanges that occur over midlatitude ice-covered lakes. GLICAF observations taken by the University of Wyoming King Air on 26 February 2004 show a strong mesoscale thermal link between the lake surface and the overlying atmospheric boundary layer. Mesoscale atmospheric variations that developed over the lake in turn influenced heat exchanges with the surface. Boundary layer sensible and latent heat fluxes exhibited different relationships to variations in surface pack ice concentration. Turbulent sensible heat fluxes decreased nonlinearly with increases in underlying lake-surface ice concentration such that the largest decreases occurred when ice concentrations were greater than 70%. Latent heat fluxes tended to decrease linearly with increasing ice concentration and had a reduced correlation. Most current operational numerical weather prediction models use simple algorithms to represent the influence of heterogeneous ice cover on heat and moisture fluxes. The GLICAF findings from 26 February 2004 suggest that some currently used and planned approaches in numerical weather prediction models may significantly underestimate sensible heat fluxes in regions of high-concentration ice cover, leading to underpredictions of the local modification of air masses and lake-effect snows.

A hypolimnetic O2 deficit (0.4 ppm, 3.5% saturation) in late summer and the rate of O2 depletion from Aug. 1 to Sept. 19 (0.13 mg/ml per day), indicated eutrophic conditions. Of the 3 groups considered (Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Cyanophyta), the Cyanophyta were less diverse in terms of relative numbers of genera but produced the largest blooms. Chlorophyta had the largest number of genera. Diatoms dominated in winter and spring, Chlorophyta in summer and fall and blue greens in late summer, fall and winter. Spirogyra and Oscillatoria were the most prominent members of the algal flora. Important perennials included Oscillatoria, Spirogyra, Closterium, Fragilaria, Meridion, Tabellaria and Cymbella. No unialgal blooms occurred. The accelerated rate of eutrophication in recent years is due to excess nutrient loading resulting from input of raw domestic sewage. The completion of a sanitary sewer system is expected to alleviate the excessive nutrient loading and so slow the eutrophication process.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1977	54	2					99	108		10.1007/BF00034983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00034983													WOS:A1977DK18000001

The lakes are small (5.6-56 ha), low productivity, headwater drainage or seepage lakes. They are acid-sensitive (ANC less than or equal to 200 mu eq/L) but not low pH lakes (average pH 6.6). The lakes ranged in color from 8.5 to 70 PCU. Statistical analysis of the water chemistry variables and mercury species support the conclusion that these were a homogeneous set of lakes; therefore, seasonality of mercury forms was analyzed on combined (mean) data from the 12 lakes. Methyl-Hg in water declined throughout the growing season. Hg-T also declined sharply from spring to summer but increased again in the fall. In contrast to the methyl-Hg and Hg in water, concentrations in plankton were at the lowest levels in spring and rose to higher levels in summer. The mass of mercury in plankton increased from spring to fall, as did the methyl-Hg fraction, which increased from 20% of Hg-T in spring to 52% in autumn. Bioaccumulation factors (BAF) for methyl-Hg in net plankton increased over the growing season. Overall, log BAF for Hg-T in net plankton (wet wt.) was 4.45. Log BAF for methyl-Hg in plankton was 4.90 to 5.43 depending on the analytical form of methyl-Hg in water (labile or total). Seasonal patterns of methyl-Hg and Hg-T did not covary in water, but did covary in plankton. These results support the conclusion that measurement of Hg in water is not adequate in itself to determine the amount of bioavailable Hg (i.e., methyl-Hg) in a lake. Labile (unextracted) methyl-Hg could be a useful measurement of bioavailable Hg. Labile methyl-Hg exhibits the same seasonal patterns as total methyl-Hg, but does not require the extraction steps necessary for measuring total methyl-Hg.

Of the dominant species, cyanophycean algae (Lyngbya diguetii and Calothrix sp.) developed best in the 25 cm region below the water surface, while the chlorophycean alga, Stigeoclonium nanum and the diatoms (Cocconeis placentula, Gomphonema parvulum and Rhoicosphenia curvata) did so in the 50 and 75 cm regions, respectively. Certain dominant species persisted throughout, interrupted by shock periods which created spring, summer and autumn peaks. Species diversity indices increased with depth, and generally decreased spring through winter. Standing crop maxima occurred within the top 25 cm of the host stems, and showed spring and larger autumn peaks before declining to low, yet significant winter levels. Productivity, too, was greatest in the top 25 cm region, and again peaked in the spring and autumn. Cross incubation studies elucidated vertical and seasonal relationships among productivity, photosynthetic index and efficiency, and productivity efficiency. An interplay of sun and shade adapted populations within the community was found. The epiphytic algae displayed but a muted seasonal response to physico-chemical fluctuations; however, there was an association with overall nutrient changes as determined by meq HCO3- 1-1.																			0105-9327						1983	6	1					41	58																WOS:A1983QD90800006

A GIS-Based Assessment of Lake-Effect Snow Warnings in Upstate New York	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL METEOROLOGY												Lake-effect snow (LES) occurs downwind of the Great Lakes every late autumn and winter. This phenomenon often generates significant localized snowfall that can cripple one section of a community while the remainder is spared. Detrimental impacts on travel from snowfall rates of. 2.5 cm h(-1) (1 in h(-1)) are not uncommon. Storm-total snowfall gradients of. 12.5 cm km(-1) (8 in mi(-1)) also have been documented. Twenty-four-hour snowfall measurements taken by National Weather Service (NWS) observers during Lake Ontario LES events were collected. Utilizing a geographic information system, snowfall was interpolated from spotter reports with the kriging method. Then, the area of warning-criteria snowfall was compared to the area of the corresponding county-based LES warning for calculation of false alarm percentage. This warning performance evaluator identified the proportion of a county-based LES warning that received sub-warning-criteria snowfall. Percent of false alarm was calculated using temporally comparable snowfall reports and all available reports from each event. A total of 13 events from the 2009-2010 through 2011-2012 LES seasons were analyzed. The average percent of false alarm was approximately 90%. This suggests the NWS should consider smaller warning polygons. Limited-size warnings would enable meteorologists to provide greater specificity regarding the location of anticipated significant snowfall, while simultaneously reducing the number of people who are unnecessarily warned.																			2325-6184					MAR 20	2014	2	6					59	70		10.15191/nwajom.2014.0206	http://dx.doi.org/10.15191/nwajom.2014.0206													WOS:000215977700001

Oligosarcus jenynsii, Oligosarcus robustus, Hoplosternum littorale, Loricariichthys anus, Parapimelodus nigribarbis, Trachelyopterus lucenai, Pachyurus bonariensis). Data were derived from monthly samples in Casamento Lake (northern Patos Lagoon; Nov. 2002 to Apr. 2004) and Guaiba Lake (Jun. 2005 to May. 2006). The reproductive period was determined according to the monthly variation of the gonadosomatic index (GSI). Fish reproduction was identified during all months of the year. Oligosarcus jenynsii started reproduction in winter, but extended spawning to spring (early warming-water reproduction). Three species also presented reproduction during warming water months, but beginning in spring and finishing in summer (late warm-water reproduction): P nigribarbis, T lucenai and P. bonariensis. Three species presented relatively short reproduction periods on summer (spotted warm-water reproduction): H. malabaricus, H. littorale and L. anus, and only one species reproduces almost continuously during warmer waters (long-season warm-water reproduction): A. fasciatus. Finally, two other species presented a very distinct reproductive pattern, starting reproduction on late summer but increasing GSI values along autumn and winter (long-season cooling-water reproducers): C. voga and O. robustus.

J	Kristovich, DAR; Laird, NF; Hjelmfelt, MR				Kristovich, DAR; Laird, NF; Hjelmfelt, MR			Convective evolution across Lake Michigan during a widespread lake-effect snow event	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Lake-effect snowstorms generally develop within convective boundary layers, which are induced when cold air flows over relatively warm lakes in fall and winter. Mesoscale circulations within the boundary layers largely control which communities near the downwind shores of the lakes receive the most intense snow. The lack of quantitative observations over the lakes during lake-effect storms limits the ability to fully understand and predict these mesoscale circulations. This study provides the first observations of the concurrent spatial and temporal evolution of the thermodynamic and microphysical boundary layer structure and mesoscale convective patterns across Lake Michigan during an intense lake-effect event. Observations analyzed in this study were taken during the Lake-Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE). Aircraft and sounding observations indicate that the lake-effect snows of 13 January 1998 developed within a convective boundary layer that grew rapidly across Lake Michigan. Boundary layer clouds developed within 15 km and snow developed within 30 km of the upwind (western) shoreline. Near the downwind shore, cloud cover was extensive and snow nearly filled the boundary layer. Extensive sea smoke in the surface layer, with disorganized (or cellular) and linear features, was observed visually across the entire lake. Over portions of northern Lake Michigan, where airborne dual-Doppler radar observations were obtained, the mesoscale circulation structure remained disorganized (random or cellular) across the lake. Given observed shear and stability conditions in this region, this structure is consistent with past theoretical and numerical modeling results. To the south, where surface winds were slightly stronger and lake-air temperature differences were less, wind-parallel bands indicative of rolls were often present. The horizontal scale of the observed mesoscale convective structures grew across Lake Michigan, in agreement with most previous studies, but less rapidly than the increase of the boundary layer depth. The decreasing ratio of convective horizontal size to boundary layer depth (aspect ratio) is contrary to many recent studies that found a positive correlation between boundary layer depth and aspect ratio.

Space-for-time proxy for climate change in deep lakes in the Canadian cordillera: Seasonality along a latitudinal climate gradient	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A comparison of the annual thermal histories in seven deep, intermontane lakes in western Canada along a north-south transect from 49.67 degrees to 61.25 degrees N reveals latitudinal trends in thermal structure; specifically: I) summer maximum and winter minimum mean temperatures decrease similar to 0.2 degrees C per degree latitude, 2) the dates of maximum and minimum heat content lag similar to 1 and similar to 6 days per degree latitude, respectively, 3) the lengths of summer and winter stratification lag similar to 8 days per degree latitude, 4) the timing of the spring and autumn turnovers lags similar to 4 days per degree latitude, 5) the timing of the onset and break-up of ice cover lags similar to 6 days per degree latitude, and 6) the rate of response to atmospheric heating and cooling is similar to 1MJ m(-2) day(-1) per degree latitude. We propose that insight into the response of a lake at a specific latitude to climate change can be acquired by examining the present conditions of a morphologically and dynamically similar lake at an appropriate latitude and altitude further south. Of interest is the potential transition of a lake from one mictic state to another, with consequences to the resupply of nutrients to the euphotic zone and to the phenology of spring and fall phytoplankton blooms. The absence or presence of ice cover and timing of freeze-up and break-up also affect a lake's heat budget and thermal history. The full interpretation of climate signals in lake systems requires an understanding of lake-specific physical forcing and response mechanisms.

Small (or the order of several 0,01 mu g/l) variations in concentration of uranium in different lakes were noted. The study has also shown a seasonal variation - in a similar range - in concentrations of the above species of uranium, as well as total uranium. The content of dissolved uranium was highest in the autumn and winter, lower in the spring and summer. Overall, total uranium was found in greatest concentrations during the fall, in other seasons concentrations were lower and similar to each other. Suspended uranium was found in largest concentrations in autumn and summer, in lower ones in spring and winter. Concentrations of the different species of uranium during the study period showed a small variation - variation coefficient below 10% for total uranium and dissolved uranium, and about 25% for suspended uranium. The observed concentrations of uranium were typical of uncontaminated unpolluted water.

Model results are compared to available observations of currents and temperature and previous modeling work. Maps of climatological circulation for all five Great lakes are presented. Winter currents show a two-gyre type circulation in Lakes Ontario and Erie and one large-scale cyclonic circulation in Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior. During the summer, a cyclonic circulation remains in Lakes Superior; a primarily cyclonic circulation dominates upper and central Lake Huron; Lake Ontario has a single cyclonic circulation, while circulation in the central basin of Lake Erie remains two-gyre type; Lake Michigan has a cyclonic gyre in the north and an anticyclonic one in the south. The temperature profile during the summer is well simulated when a surface wind-wave mixing scheme is included in the model. Main features of the seasonal evolution of water temperature, such as inverse temperature stratification during the winter, the spring and autumn overturn, the thermal bar, and the stratification during summer are well reproduced. The lakes exhibit significant annual and interannual variations in current speed and temperature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy content of young yellow perch and walleye in Saginaw Bay	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We evaluated seasonal energy content of age-0 yellow perch Perca flavescens and walleye Sander vitreus in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron in 2009 and 2010. We also determined the energy content of age-1 fish from the 2009 and 2010 cohorts the following spring (i.e., for fish that had survived one winter) to evaluate overwinter energy losses. As expected, larger fish within each species had disproportionately higher energy content (i.e., slope relating length and energy >3.0) than smaller conspecifics. By contrast to expectations, allometric slopes were >3.0 in nearly all months, not just the fall, and were higher for age-0 yellow perch than for walleye, even though increased allocation to growth would have seemingly been beneficial to even the largest yellow perch during summer. Seasonal energy allocation patterns differed between years. In 2009, length specific energy content increased from late summer to fall for both species. However, for the 2010 cohorts of fish, length specific energy content decreased between late summer and fall for yellow perch and did not change for walleye. There were 13-17% overwinter declines in length specific energy content between the fall (October or November) and the spring (May) with no major differences between cohorts within a species or between species for a given year. Because young yellow perch and walleye are similar physiologically but differ in size (i.e., yellow perch are smaller), it is possible that overwinter energy losses are more important for yellow perch than for walleye.

The boundary-layer development over the surrounding land can be very important for generating a horizontal pressure difference which drives the lake breeze, Diurnal and seasonal variations of lake breezes are investigated on the basis of repeated passes from the different aircraft at different altitudes from late spring to early fall of 1994. The lake breeze divergence increases with time during the day and reaches a maximum around 1300 LST. The latent heat flux over 10-km-wide Candle Lake increases steadily from spring to fall as the lake temperature increases, The latent heat flux over the land reaches a maximum during the summer due to evapotranspiration. The lake effect on area-averaged fluxes sometimes leads to a negative heat transfer coefficient for an averaging scale of several times the lake width.

The seasonal patterns of the total abundance, which were lowest in summer and highest in spring, were found at all sites. Total densities of diatom assemblages were significantly higher at hyper-eutrophic sites than at moderately eutrophic sites. Melosira varians was the most abundant species and dominant contributor to total abundance at all sites during spring, autumn and winter, whereas Achnanthes exigua dominated benthic diatom assemblages at the site with the highest nutrient concentrations during the summer. Achnanthes lanceolata var. dubia, Gomphonema parvulum, Navicula similis, Navicula verecunda and Nitzschia amphibia were generally observed at all sites throughout the year and were dominant at higher-nutrient sites. The abundance of ambient nutrients was probably responsible for the spatial variation in biomass, composition and diversity of benthic diatom assemblages, and lake water temperature was the major factor that controlled seasonal distribution.					; Liu, Guoxiang/L-7413-2019	Liu, Guoxiang/0000-0001-8565-2363; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2006	21	2					277	284		10.1080/02705060.2006.9664996	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2006.9664996													WOS:000237400000011
J	Schröder, A				Schroeder, Arne			Density- and Size-Dependent Winter Mortality and Growth of Late Chaoborus flavicans Larvae	PLOS ONE												Winter processes such as overwinter survival and growth of individuals can have wide-ranging consequences for population dynamics and communities within and across seasons. In freshwater organisms winter processes have been mainly studied in fish despite that invertebrates also have substantial impacts on lake and pond food webs. One of the major invertebrate consumers in lake and ponds is the planktonic larvae of the dipteran insect Chaoborus spec. However, while much is known about Chaoborus feeding ecology, behaviour and structuring role in food webs, its winter ecology and how it affects its populations are poorly understood. Here size-and density-dependent winter mortality and body growth of late Chaoborus flavicans larvae were quantified over naturally occurring size and density ranges in autumn and under natural winter conditions using two field enclosure experiments. Winter mortality increased with autumn density but decreased with autumn body size while winter growth rates decreased with autumn density and body sizes. There was also a density-and size-independent background mortality component. The proportion of pupae found in spring decreased strongly and exponentially with autumn density. These results may explain the commonly observed univoltine life cycle and multi-annual density fluctuations in northern Chaoborus populations. They further demonstrate the relevance of winter processes and conditions for freshwater invertebrates and ecosystems.																			1932-6203					OCT 4	2013	8	10							e75839	10.1371/journal.pone.0075839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0075839								24124517					WOS:000325489100074

The results are shown as follows: (1) The tropical Pacific SSH takes on a "V" pattern in the climatic field with an eastward opening, and it is higher in the western part (in the northwestern part) than in the eastern part (in the southwestern part). The high-value areas are more stable in the northwest, and the value range (greater than 0.8 m) is larger in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. The high-value area in the southwestern part is the largest (smallest) and more northerly (southerly) in spring (summer). SSH is higher in spring and autumn than in summer and winter over the equatorial zone. (2) The interannual anomalies of the SSH are the strongest over the tropical western and southwestern Pacific and are stronger in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. The interannual anomalies are also strong over the equatorial middle and eastern Pacific. The distribution ranges are larger and the intensities are stronger in the autumn and winter. There is a close relationship between the SSH interannual anomalies and ENSO events in autumn, winter and spring. (3) When ENSO events take place in winter, according to the simultaneous relationship among the tropic Pacific SSH, 850 hPa wind fields and the summer precipitation of China, it can be predicted that the precipitation will be significantly more than normal over the south of the Yangtze River, especially over Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake region, eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Yangtze-Huai River Valley, eastern part of Inner Mongolia and less than normal over the area of Great Band of Yellow River, North China and South China in successive summers.

Migration patterns and wintering distribution of common loons breeding in the Upper Midwest	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Identification of geographic linkages among breeding, migratory and wintering common loon Gavia immer populations is needed to inform regional and national conservation planning efforts and compensation of loons lost during marine oil spill events. Satellite telemetry and archival geolocator tags were used to determine the migration patterns and wintering locations of breeding adult and young of the year juvenile common loons captured and marked on lakes in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Adult loons typically traveled from breeding lakes, often via larger staging lakes, to the Great Lakes (primarily Lake Michigan) and then on to wintering areas. Most radiomarked juvenile common loons utilized natal lakes or local lakes through mid-November. Subsequently, the first fall migration of juvenile loons was generally initiated later, and more direct and quicker to wintering areas relative to adults. Among adult (n = 103) and juvenile (n = 23) loons that completed fall migration, most wintered in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), with smaller proportions wintering off the southern Atlantic Coast or impoundments in the southeastern United States. Spring migration of adults to breeding lakes was less prolonged than fall migration, with adult male loons tending to depart wintering areas earlier than adult females. Juvenile common loons migrated during their first spring from wintering sites in the GOM to summer in the Gulf of St Lawrence/Nova Scotia Coastal region. Juvenile mortality was largely linked to parasitic infection and emaciation; spring appeared to be a survival bottleneck among juvenile loons monitored in our study. Our results identify several areas where common loon conservation efforts could be directed to protect key habitats and minimize stressors during the non-breeding period.

J	RODIONOV, SN				RODIONOV, SN			ASSOCIATION BETWEEN WINTER PRECIPITATION AND WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GREAT-LAKES AND ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PATTERNS	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Atmospheric precipitation in the Great Lakes basin, as a major mediating variable between atmospheric circulation and lake levels, is analyzed relative to both. The effect of cumulative winter precipitation on lake levels varies from lake to lake and depends on both the state of the lake level itself and air temperature. For periods with a quasi-stable temperature regime, the correlation coefficient between winter precipitation and changes in lake levels from November to spring months reaches 0.8. An analysis of composite maps of mean winter 700-mb heights and sea level pressure for the years with well-above and well-below normal precipitation in the lower Great Lakes basin (Lakes Michigan-Huron, St. Clair, Erie, and Ontario) has shown that changes in precipitation are associated with the wave train structure in the lower and midtroposphere that is similar to the Pacific/North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern. During the positive phase of the PNA-like pattern, when the upper-atmospheric ridge/trough system is amplified, cyclones passing over the Great Lakes basin are frequently of Alberta (Canada) origin and carry relatively small amounts of precipitation. As a result, lake levels tend to decline. On the contrary, during the negative phase of the pattern when the atmospheric circulation is more zonal, the main storm track is oriented from the southwest to the northeast and cyclones bring enough precipitation to induce a rise in lake levels. The effect of the position of the upper-atmospheric trough over the east coast of North America on the precipitation regime in the Great Lakes basin is also demonstrated.					; Rodionov, Sergei/KJL-0449-2024	Rodionov, Sergei/0000-0002-5318-9746; 													0894-8755					NOV	1994	7	11					1693	1706		10.1175/1520-0442(1994)007<1693:ABWPAW>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(1994)007<1693:ABWPAW>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1994PR94200005
J	HAKALA, I				HAKALA, I			DISTRIBUTION, POPULATION-DYNAMICS AND PRODUCTION OF MYSIS-RELICTA (LOVEN) IN SOUTHERN FINLAND	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												In Paeaejaervi, an oligotrophic lake in southern Finland, M. relicta has a life span of 1 or 2 yr. Young liberated in late April and early May attain maturity during the 1st summer and autumn and start breeding in early Dec., while those liberated in late May and June remain immature till the next spring and then breed earlier than the offspring of the former group. The members of the latter group start to release their young in late April, offspring of the former group not until May-June. Thus the 2 groups show a regular alternation of early and late breeding. Most of the population lives within the 20 m isobath. A small proportion migrates to shallower parts after the autumn circulation. During the summer the mysids are almost totally pelagic, but in the autumn they shift to a benthic life. The population reaches its maximum size (about 300-400 million individuals) in early July. In winter there are only 20-40 million mysids in the lake. Biomass (B) is maximal in Sept.-Oct. and minimal in spring at the time when the embryos are liberated. Great annual variation was observed, 200-600 kg ash-free dry weight (AFDW). The growth of M. relicta seems to fit the logistic model. It ceases during the winter and begins again in May. The mysids attain a mean weight of about 4.0 mg (AFDW) in the 1st yr and 8.0 mg in the 2nd. Annual production (P) varies from about 500-800 kg (AFDW). The P/B ratio varies between 3.0 and 3.8, depending on the year and the method of calculating production.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1978	15	3					243	258																WOS:A1978FV02100012

Before biomanipulation no submerged vegetation was present in the lake, but in summer 1987, directly after the measure, submerged macrophyte stands developed following a clear-water phase caused by high zooplankton grazing in spring. During the summers of 1988 and 1989 Elodea nuttallii was the most dominant species and reached a high biomass, but in the summers of 1990 and 1991 Ceratophyllum demersum became dominant. The total macrophyte biomass decreased in 1990 and 1991. In 1992 and 1993 C. demersum and E. nuttallii were nearly absent and Potamogeton berchtholdii became the dominant species, declining to very low abundance during late summer. Successively algal blooms appeared in autumn of those years reaching chlorophyll-a concentrations between 60-130 mu g l(-1). However, in experimental cages placed on the lake bottom, serving as exclosures for larger fish and birds, E. nuttallii still reached a high abundance during 1992 and 1993. Herbivory by coots (Fulica atra) in autumn/winter, and by rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) in summer, most probably caused the decrease in total abundance of macrophytes and the shift in species composition.					van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936													0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC 6	1996	340	1-3					285	290		10.1007/BF00012769	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00012769													WOS:A1996WJ83800046

It is found that lake-effect precipitation occurs approximately one out of every five days with a diurnal peak in precipitation intensity during the afternoon and evening. The greatest number of lake-effect days occurs in October followed by November and then September. Comparison of these results to regional precipitation climatologies strongly suggests that the season of lake enhanced precipitation begins in late summer. Precipitation is predominantly rain throughout September and October and snow after the first week of November. A transition period of both rain and snow occurs in early November. Analysis of thunder events for the 7-yr period show a late September to mid-October peak with a decline in frequency by November. The decline in thunder events is due to a seasonal decrease in the depth of the conditionally unstable layer. As might be expected, the mean atmospheric conditions during rain events are similar to those found during lake-effect snow events. This is particularly true with regard to the overall positions of transient synoptic features. Differences are most apparent in the thermodynamic profile of the lower troposphere. Extreme low-level instabilities typically observed in lake-effect snow events are absent from lake-effect rain events. However, in contrast to most snow events, a much deeper layer of conditionally unstable air is usually present during rain events.																			0027-0644					DEC	1997	125	12					3231	3248		10.1175/1520-0493(1997)125<3231:LERE>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1997)125<3231:LERE>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1997YJ55500010
J	KROG, J				KROG, J			THE INFLUENCE OF SEASONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES UPON THE METABOLISM, LETHAL TEMPERATURE AND RATE OF HEART BEAT OF GAMMARUS-LIMNAEUS (SMITH) TAKEN FROM AN ALASKAN LAKE	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												The amphipod G. limnaeus living in a typical shallow, mud-bottomed Alaskan lake which is ice-covered for 7 mos., was studied throughout the year in an effort to find if its O2 consumption was elevated at low winter temperature (temp.) over that in higher summer temp. O2 concentration (conc.) was measured at 4 temps. from 0[degree] to 22[degree]C in Scholander micro- and semi-micro-respirometers, O2 tension by Winkler method, lethal temperature by immersion in water, and "heart" beat by observation on a water-cooled microscope stand. Wet, dry, and hydrolyzable material weights were determined. Temp. in the lake varied from 0[degree]C (Nov.-Mar.) to 22[degree]C in July; O2 content of water reached 8-9 ppm in summer and fell to undetectable levels in Mar. O2 conc. of Gammarus was found to parallel the fall in O2 content of water, being lowest in Feb.-Mar. and elevated in summer. This is contrary to previous investigations, which indicated an elevation of metabolism with lower temperature. Apparently the fall in O2 content of lake was a more critical factor than the lowered temperature. Upper lethal temp. was 26[degree] C for winter animals and 30-32[degree] C for summer animals, as determined by 100% survival for one hr. The "heart" rate of winter animals showed irregularity above 19[degree] C, of summer animals above 23[degree] C, the average below 20[degree] C being higher in winter than in summer. Fall of O2 consumption in response to fall of O2 content of lake, rather than elevation of O2 conc. in response to lowered temp. of lake, is regarded as an instance of adaptation to the most critical environmental factor.																			0006-3185	1939-8697					1954	107	3					397	410		10.2307/1538588	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1538588													WOS:A1954UJ58200007
J	Gerten, D; Adrian, R				Gerten, D; Adrian, R			Species-specific changes in the phenology and peak abundance of freshwater copepods in response to warm summers	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Climate warming is now widely recognised as a major factor influencing ecological processes in terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats. Here, we investigated how a recent period of warm springs and summers has affected the population dynamics of various cyclopoid copepods in a central European lake. We compared (i) the duration of the period when the species were present in the water column, and (ii) their annual peak density in a period dominated by cool summers (1980-91) and one dominated by warm summers (1992-99). 2. The copepods under investigation were (i) Thermocyclops oithonoides, (ii) Mesocyclops leuckarti and (iii) Acanthocyclops robustus. These species differ in their thermal demand and seasonal phenology. Therefore, we hypothesised that enhanced summer warming would produce species-specific responses. 3. The active phase of the copepods was usually prolonged both in spring and autumn. The earlier emergence of T. oithonoides (May in the warm years, July in the cool years) was probably related to high water temperature in late spring. The later onset of winter diapause in all species may have been coupled to raised temperature in late summer and autumn. 4. The annual peak abundance of the two thermophiles M. leuckarti and T. oithonoides increased significantly in the warm period. In the latter case, the increase was probably because of the early start to population growth. In contrast, M. leuckarti probably responded primarily to mid-summer heat waves, in that its development time was likely to be short. We speculate that the increase in population size of both species resulted from the development of an additional generation (three instead of two cohorts per year). In contrast to these thermophiles, the coexisting A. robustus, which is adapted to a broader temperature range, did not respond noticeably to the warming trend. 5. In general, the nature of these responses to summer warming varied substantially among species, and depended on the detailed seasonal patterning of the warming. Our findings thus support the hypotheses that single species are sensitive indicators of climate change, and that the seasonal timing of warming is crucial in the context of climate-ecosystem relationships. 6. Moreover, our results add to the body of evidence that climate warming produces shifts in the seasonal phenology of aquatic and terrestrial organisms.

Lake flooding and synoptic weather-type frequency at Devils Lake, North Dakota, USA, between 1965 and 2010	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Since the spring of 1993, the water surface elevation at Devils Lake, a terminal lake in eastern North Dakota, USA, has risen by 8.8 m, producing more than 1 billion USD in direct flood damages. We examine the relationship between weather-type frequencies at Bismarck, North Dakota, and lake volume changes from 1965 to 2010 using the Spatial Synoptic Classification (SSC) system. First, we find statistically significant changes in the frequency of selected weather types over both annual and seasonal time periods. This indicates a trend toward in creased advection of more humid weather types that is consistent with the historical rise in lake level. Second, a comparison of weather type frequencies between a subset of years with extreme large and small lake surges, and extreme large and small lake drawdowns, shows that weather-type frequency plays an important role in explaining annual lake volume fluctuations. The results support a climatic explanation for the historical lake rise at Devils Lake, but the relationships are not as strong as might have been anticipated given the unprecedented lake rise that occurred during the study period. A more detailed examination of the complex and non-linear nature of the lake water balance may be needed to further clarify how precipitation input is translated into lake volume changes.

J	Verburg, P; Hecky, RE				Verburg, P; Hecky, RE			Wind patterns, evaporation, and related physical variables in Lake Tanganyika, east Africa	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Diel changes in wind speed, wind components, and evaporation at Lake Tanganyika were analyzed with several automatic sampling stations around the lake and meteorological buoys on the lake with high sampling frequency. Evaporation was calculated with aerodynamic and energy balance methods for the south and north ends of the lake. Winds of thermal origin blew from the lake during the day and land winds occurred at night. The onshore- offshore air temperature gradient during the day was highest, and winds were generally strongest, in the dry season. High evaporation was associated with south winds because wind speed at both ends of the lake was generally highest from the south, in part due to the southeast trade winds during the dry season. Evaporation was, therefore, influenced by the diel pattern of land and take winds, highest at night in the south and highest during the day in the north. The annual evaporation rates increased by 43% from north to south. Mean lake wide evaporation was 1,821 mm/yr (range 1,536 to 2,022 mm/yr determined with three techniques), 120 nun more than previously estimated. Nocturnal mixing in the south is more dependent on wind forcing and evaporation while heat loss from the surface by sensible heat transfer and outgoing longwave radiation plays a more important role at the north end of the lake.						verburg, piet/0000-0001-7574-9161													0380-1330						2003	29			2			48	61		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70538-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70538-3													WOS:000221126800005

All species were univoltine, but have adopted different life cycle strategies. L. vespertina had small body size, high density, its main nymphal growth period during late summer and autumn, a short emergence period during mid-summer, low fecundity and low mortality. In contrast S. aestivalis had large body size, very low density, its main nymphal growth period during winter and spring, a very short emergence period during mid-summer and high fecundity, S. lacustris displayed large size, low density (compared to L. vespertina), its main nymphal growth period between ice break and emergence, a long emergence period during summer and autumn, high fecundity and high mortality. The life cycle strategies of L vespertina, S. aestivalis and S. lacustris in Myrkdalsvatn appear to be influenced by interspecific competition and their coexistence is maintained by ecological segregation.																			0003-9136					OCT	1993	128	4					401	408																WOS:A1993MJ18500002

Oligotrophic lakes displayed abundance peaks during fall mixis and biomass peaks in late winter and fall. Mesotrophic systems exhibited a spring-fall bimodality in ciliate abundance with a biomass maxima occurring during fall. Eutrophic/hypereutrophic lakes had pronounced abundance and biomass maxima during summer, with the large ciliates Plagiopyla nasuta and Paramecium trichium often contributing heavity to the midsummer biomass peak. Members of the Oligotrichida numerically dominated abundance and biomass peaks in oligotrophic lakes while the Scuticociliatida dominated the communities of higher trophic states. Total ciliate abundance and biomass were strongly correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations as were various ciliate taxonomic groups. The relationship between ciliate seasonal distribution in these subtropical lakes with lake thermal regimes and trophic state is discussed.

Gillnets with multi-mesh were designed for sampling fish in lakes while acoustic surveys were performed with a split beam Simrad EK60 echosounder. Sampling events were carried out during summer (September 2015), autumn (December 2015), winter (March 2016) and spring (June 2016) in two Tunisian reservoirs (Kasseb and Siliana) with different depths and shapes. Gillnet catches showed a high proportion of barbell whatever the seasons in Kasseb Reservoir, while at Siliana Reservoir, significant seasonal changes in relative abundances have been evidenced. The highest fish biomass of the entire water column was observed in winter daytime (103kg/ha) in Kasseb Reservoir and in summer daytime (283kg/ha) in Siliana Reservoir. Average biomass observed in autumn (December) for the two reservoirs were lower than the other seasons. During spring, density daytime values in Kasseb were higher than during nighttime while it was the opposite in summer and autumn. Fish densities detected in Kasseb Reservoir in vertical beaming was higher than those detected in horizontal beaming (p<.05). The longitudinal distribution of fish in the reservoirs showed that there is no clear trend in fish densities according to strata. High numbers of fish were detected in deep strata and big fish were located in the surface water near the dam of Kasseb Reservoir. A significant linear correlation was showed between acoustic density/NPUE and acoustic biomass/BPUE but the perfect correlation with the 1:1 fit was showed only between acoustic biomass/BPUE.					; Laouar, Houcine/NBX-9486-2025	Laouar, Houcine/0000-0001-8768-502X; 													0175-8659	1439-0426				AUG	2018	34	4					850	860		10.1111/jai.13696	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13696													WOS:000439931500008

We performed culture experiments in six rivers in the Taihu Basin using a custom made in-situ experimental apparatus. We investigated spatio-temporal differences in reduce processes and rates of different N forms and assessed the contribution of biological processes to dissolved inorganic N (DIN) reduce. Results showed that biological processes played a major role in N reduction in summer, while non-microbial processes were dominant in winter. We observed significant spatial and temporal differences in the studied mechanisms, with reduction rates of different N compounds being significantly higher in summer and autumn than spring and winter. Reduction rates ranged from 105.4 +/- 25.3 to 1458.8 +/- 98.4 mg.(m(3).d)(-1) for total N, 33.1 +/- 12.3 to 440.9 +/- 33.1 mg.(m(3).d)(-1) for ammonium, 56.3 +/- 22.7 to 332.1 +/- 61.9 mg.(m(3).d)(-1) for nitrate and 0.4 +/- 0.3 to 31.8 +/- 9.0 mg.(m(3).d)(-1) for nitrite across four seasons. Mean DIN reduction rates with and without microbial activity were 96.0 +/- 46.4 mg.(m(3).d)(-1) and 288.1 +/- 67.8 mg.(m(3).d)(-1), respectively, with microbial activity rates accounting for 29.7% of the DIN load and 2.2% of the N load. Results of correlation and principal component analysis showed that the main factors influencing N processing were the concentrations of different N forms and multiple environmental factors in spring, N concentrations, DO and pH in summer, N concentrations and water velocity in autumn and N concentrations in winter.																				1660-4601				NOV	2018	15	11							2568	10.3390/ijerph15112568	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15112568								30453562					WOS:000451640500242

J	Dirnberger, JM; Weinberger, J				Dirnberger, JM; Weinberger, J			Influences of lake level changes on reservoir water clarity in Allatoona Lake, Georgia	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												In Allatoona Lake (Georgia USA), secchi transparency (measured every 2 to 4 weeks during a Phase I U.S. EPA Clean Lakes Study) was typically 5- to 8- fold greater in summer than late autumn and winter. The intensity of storms increased in late autumn and winter resulting in high sediment loads from the watershed, but lake level was also drawn down, confounding the influence of external sediment load with that of resuspended lake sediments. For 4 of the 5 years studied, decreases in water clarity were more closely synchronized with lowering of lake level than with storms. Continuous automated sampling of turbidity and other water quality parameters at 15-minute intervals allowed us to assess whether turbidity increases were derived from erosion of the exposed shoreline (i.e., by rain and runoff), or wave-driven resuspension. Regular increases in turbidity and decreases in pH occurred each weekend during the summer, suggesting increased mixing by boat traffic. Increases in turbidity on weekends and after rain events were greater after initiation of drawdown and were particularly strong when lake surface elevation approached that of the summer metalimnion depth. It appears that sediment focused (deposited) in deeper areas during the spring and summer is resuspended by wave action as lake levels drop in autumn.																			1040-2381					MAR	2005	21	1					24	29		10.1080/07438140509354409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140509354409													WOS:000228568300003

Large-scale meteorology included influence from a record ENSO extending from 1997 to mid-1998. Meteorological variables varied across the lake especially during the lake-heating phase after ice breakup. Generally higher over-lake air temperature and surface water temperatures occurred in 1998, but larger vapor pressure gradients over water and similar to8% higher solar radiation was observed in 1999. Although wind speed averages were similar in both years, nearly 30% more over-lake storms with winds >10 m s(-1) occurred in 1998. High sensitivity of the lake temperatures to surface wind forcing was observed in 1998 in the spring warming phase. Passive microwave imagery [ from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I)] at 85 GHz showed a record 213 ice-free days in 1998 compared to 186 days in 1999. The extended ice-free period in 1998 significantly influenced lake temperature and heat content. Maximum heat content occurred on 5 August in 1998 (2.61 x 10(19) J) compared to 23 August in 1999 (2.22 x 10(19) J). The daily heat content formed the basis for deriving a bulk heat exchange. Five-day-averaged bulk heat exchange generally fluctuated between means of 282 ( spring) to -225 ( fall) W m(-2) in 1998, compared to a smaller range of 171 (spring) to -202 (fall) W m(-2) in 1999. Good correspondence between the bulk heat exchange based on lakewide heat content and computed heat flux at Inner Whaleback Island gives confidence in the seasonal heat flux and the heat content methodology. The seasonal trend and magnitudes of heat contents and bulk exchanges derived in this analysis form the basis for future research on the interannual variability in lakewide heat budgets and for developments leading to coupled climate - lake models.

Movement data are needed to effectively use tumor prevalence as an indicator of habitat quality. We used ultrasonic telemetry to verify the residency of 40 adult brown bullheads (250-310 mm total length) in the Anacostia River during summer 2000, spring 2001, and fall-winter 2001-2002. During summer (10 fish tagged), fish remained within 500 m of their capture-release location, and their mean 95% minimum area polygon (MAP) and linear home ranges were 4.5 ha and 0.50 km. During spring (12 fish tagged), most fish traveled upstream of the capture-release location as water temperatures increased; they were approximately 1 km upriver by the end of the season. Mean 95% MAP and linear home ranges in spring were 19.7 ha and 2.1 km. During fall-winter (IS fish tagged), fish released in the river remained within 4.2 km upstream and 3.1 km downstream of their capture-release location, and their mean 95% MAP and linear home ranges were 15.9 ha and 2.1 km. In comparison, the 95% MAP and linear home ranges of fish released in Lake Kingman (a tidal freshwater impoundment of the Anacostia) were 5.8 ha and 0.58 km. No fish were located outside of the Anacostia River. We conclude that adult brown bullheads were resident in the system throughout the year.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2005	134	5					1262	1270		10.1577/T04-086.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T04-086.1													WOS:000232737300016

Stability of swimming performance and activity hierarchies among wild largemouth bass at multiple temporal scales: evidence for context-dependent shuffling between seasons	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Laboratory-based studies of locomotory performance in many taxa have noted that individuals form stable hierarchies of organismal performance. Though laboratory studies of teleost fishes have consistently demonstrated individual repeatability of swimming performance, this phenomenon has rarely been studied in the field and never across multiple years. Using a whole-lake acoustic telemetry array with submetre accuracy, we assessed the individual repeatability of two metrics of swimming performance (daily distance traveled and mean daily swimming speed) within four seasons during a year (fall, winter, spring, and summer), among these seasons, and between winters of 2 years. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802)) formed stable performance hierarchies within seasons except spring and no sexspecific differences in rankings were noted. Individual swimming performance was not repeatable among seasons during 1 year or across multiple winters. Seasonal changes in environmental and intrinsic biological conditions appear to result in a reshuffling of performance hierarchies, perhaps reflecting individual differences in organismal physiology.

J	George, SS				George, Scott St.			Streamflow in the Winnipeg River basin, Canada: Trends, extremes and climate linkages	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study uses a network of Long-term discharge gauges to examine how river flow in the Winnipeg River basin, Canada has behaved during the last one hundred years. The Winnipeg River influences the production of over 4600 MW of hydroelectricity, and is the most important component of the hydrological system used to generate power in Manitoba. Extreme low annual flows are caused by severe reductions in runoff from spring snowmelt, and follow dry weather during the previous summer and autumn over much of the basin. These conditions are associated with enhanced meridional flow across western Canada, and geopotential height anomalies during the previous autumn and winter that are very similar to the positive phase of the Pacific/North American (PNA) pattern. The winter PNA index appears to be an important control on streamflow in the Winnipeg River at both interannual and decadal time-scales, but may be modulated by conditions in the North Atlantic sector. Mean annual flows have increased by 58% since 1924, primarily because of Large increases in winter discharge. Because similar trends are observed for both regulated and unregulated rivers, these increases are not artefacts caused by direct anthropogenic interference in the hydrological system. Increasing summer and autumn precipitation is the most probable cause of the changes in streamflow. The observed trends toward higher flows, combined with recent model projections, suggest that the potential threats to water supply faced by the Canadian Prairie provinces over the next few decades will not include decreasing streamflow in the Winnipeg River basin.

Mean daily displacement rates were significantly higher between 0830 and 1130 h than between 2230 and 0500 h during spring, summer and fall. Displacement rates of individual fish were highly variable, ranging from 0-28 m/min. Home ranges of lake trout were larger during spring, summer and fall (mean area 199.0, 161.8 and 172.6 ha, respectively) than during winter (61.9 ha). There was no apparent relationship between fish size and home range size. Tagged fish utilized 11-40% of the suitable habitat during different seasons.																			0165-7836	1872-6763					1982	1	4					311	318																WOS:A1982PY85900004
J	SPENCER, DF; YEUNG, HY; GREENE, RW				SPENCER, DF; YEUNG, HY; GREENE, RW			ALTERATIONS IN THE ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY OF A FLY-ASH TREATED LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The zooplankton community in Lake Charles East, Indiana [USA] was sampled form June, 1974 to Sept. 1977 as part of a lake restoration study. About 1.8 .times. 104 kg of lime and 1.8 .times. 106 kg of ponded fly ash were added to the lake during May-Aug. 1975 to precipitate PO4 and seal the sediments. Annual mean species number (5.2-11.3) and annual mean species diversity (H'', 0.9-1.3) were highest in 1976, the 1st year after treatment. By the 2nd post-treatment year these variables had returned to pretreatment levels. Prior to treatment Cladocera were dominant during fall and early winter (Sept.-Dec. 1974), with Copepoda dominant in late winter and spring (Jan.-May 1975). After treatment Cladocera were dominant throughut the fall and winter (Nov. 1975 to May 1976). Copepoda were again dominant in Aug. 1976. The short-term effect of the treatment appeared to be termination of the latter part of the copepod annual cycle through elimination of aestivating copepodites in the summer and increased abundance of Cladocera during the winter and spring immediately following treatment. Community composition 1 yr after treatment was similar to that observed prior to treatment.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1983	107	2					123	130		10.1007/BF00017427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017427													WOS:A1983RT27700003

J	Larson, GL				Larson, GL			Overview of the limnology of Crater Lake	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Crater Lake occupies the collapsed caldera of volcanic Mount Mazama in Crater Lake National Park, Oregon. It is the deepest lake (589 m) in the United States and the 7th deepest lake in the world. The water column mixes to a depth of about 200 m in winter and spring from wind energy and cooling. The deep lake is mixed in winter and early spring each year when relatively cold water near the surface sinks and exchanges positions with water in the deep basins of the lake. The lake becomes thermally stratified in summer and early fall. The metalimnion extends to a depth of about 100 m; thus most of the water column is a cold hypolimnion. Secchi disk clarity measurements typically are in the upper-20-m range to the low-30-m range in summer and early fall. Concentrations of nutrients are low, although conductivity is relatively high owing to the inflow of hydrothermal fluids. Total chlorophyll is low in concentration, but typically maximal at a depth of 120 m during periods of thermal stratification. Primary production also is low, with the maximum levels occurring between the depth of 40 and 80 m. Phytoplankton taxa are spatially segregated from each other within the water column to a depth of 200 m in summer and early fall. The same generalization applies to the zooplankton taxa. Water level, clarity, concentrations of total chlorophyll, primary production, and abundances of zooplankton and introduced kokanee salmon exhibit long-term fluctuations. Based primarily on a recent 10-year study of the lake, the lake is considered to be pristine, except for the consequences of fish introductions.																			0029-344X						1996	70				2		39	47																WOS:A1996VY39600005
J	Chigbu, P; Sibley, TH; Beauchamp, DA				Chigbu, P; Sibley, TH; Beauchamp, DA			Abundance and distribution of Neomysis mercedis and a major predator, longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) in Lake Washington	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal variations in the horizontal and depth distributions of Neomysis mercedis and longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) were examined using night-time mid-water trawl and Bongo net samples collected in Lake Washington from July 1989 to February 1992. Mysid density varied spatially, seasonally and yearly. For example, during summer, and fall (odd years), mysid abundance was highest in the northern, and lowest in the southern sections of the lake, except in December 1991 when they were uniformly distributed. In fall (November 1990), mysid density was highest in the central basin of the lake, Furthermore, in winter of even years, highest mysid density occurred in the southern region of the lake, but in the central region in winter (February) of odd year. Longfin smelt horizontal distribution also varied seasonally. For example, density of the 1988 YC smelt (1+) was highest in the northern area of Lake Washington in summer but highest in the southern area in fall. During winter, distribution seemed random. The abundance of the 1990 YC smelt (YoY) was also highest in the northern section of the lake in summer, but highest in the southern section in fall; density remained high in the southern section in winter. But, by late spring when they were more than one year old, the distribution had changed such that highest abundance occurred in the northern and mid-section of the lake. By winter when they were about two years old and about to begin spawning, density had become highest again in the southern section. These suggest extensive movement of mysids and smelt from one area to another, perhaps driven by wind-induced water currents in the lake. Depth distribution patterns of mysids and smelt are discussed. Smelt were captured mainly in the shallow strata (8 m) of the lake during all seasons except during winter when they predominated at 50 m. Mysids were also mainly caught in the shallow strata of the lake during all seasons, although a significant proportion occurred at greater depths (> 30 m). The abundance of both species was positively correlated in spring and summer but negatively correlated in fall. A poor correlation was observed in winter. Negative correlation in fall was primarily due to the occurrence of mysids and smelt in different areas of the lake whereas poor correlation in winter was particularly due to their occurrence at different depths. Because of considerable overlap in the distribution of both species in the lake, mysids face a high risk of predation by smelt. This piece of information is consistent with the hypothesis that smelt control mysid abundance in Lake Washington.																			0018-8158						1998	386						167	182		10.1023/A:1003537122340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003537122340													WOS:000079719900016

In BSL, the average concentrations of MCLR were 1.78 +/- 1.43 mu g/L (mean +/- SD; range, 0.177-4.914 mu g/L) in spring, 0.41 +/- 0.096 mu g/L (range, 0.191-0.502 mu g/L) in summer, 0.46 +/- 0.41 mu g/L (range, 0.205-1.598 mu g/L) in fall, and 1.04 +/- 0.71 mu g/L (range, 0.096-2.428 mu g/L) in winter. In LRC. the corresponding concentrations were 1.08 +/- 1.29 mu g/L (range, 0.2-5.83 mu g/L) in spring, 0.83 +/- 0.46 mu g/L (range, 0.315-1.671 mu g/L) in summer, 0.44 +/- 0.03 mu g/L (range, 0.368-0.555 mu g/L) in fall, and 0.78 +/- 0.52 mu g/L (range, 0.225-2.130 mu g/L) in winter.

J	ALDOUS, SE				ALDOUS, SE			MUSKRAT TRAPPING ON SAND-LAKE-NATIONAL-WILDLIFE-REFUGE, SOUTH-DAKOTA	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The study shows that effective fall trapping is limited to a short period before the freeze-up. Trapper efficiency is much lower than winter trapping in houses or spring trapping. Fall skins are smaller and less prime, thus reducing their market value. Winter house trapping is an efficient method of harvesting where trapper technics can be controlled. It permits a long period over which trapping can be continued, and the skins obtained are largely prime, of good size and demand good prices. House trapping, when properly done in this climatic zone, is not harmful to the muskrat population. Freezing out of houses is caused more by their location in shallow water and areas of poor food than by disturbance when house trapping. Healthy muskrats with a good food supply and access to it will not permit their houses to freeze up. Spring trapping is very productive, and the skins are both large and prime. However, a large proportion of the skins are damaged by fighting animals, and proper spring trapping is limited to less than a month''s duration. The muskrat population was in direct proportion to the abundance and distribution of good food plants. The winter house count is an excellent indicator of the muskrat population. The number of muskrats caught during both yrs. under heavy trapping pressure was directly proportional to the number of houses present. Male musk-rats were more numerous than [female][female] both in summer and in winter. Wt. and measurement of the 2 sexes showed no significant differences. Tagging studies indicated that muskrat movements were quite restricted between early fall and late winter.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1947	11	1					77	90		10.2307/3796042	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3796042													WOS:A1947XS08300008

The seasonal cycle of ice cover was constructed for all the lakes, including Lake St. Clair. A unique feature found in the seasonal cycle is that the standard deviations (i.e., variability) of ice cover are larger than the climatological means for each lake. This indicates that Great Lakes ice cover experiences large variability in response to predominant natural climate forcing and has poor predictability. Spectral analysis shows that lake ice has both quasi-decadal and interannual periodicities of similar to 8 and similar to 4 yr. There was a significant downward trend in ice coverage from 1973 to the present for all of the lakes, with Lake Ontario having the largest, and Lakes Erie and St. Clair having the smallest. The translated total loss in lake ice over the entire 38-yr record varies from 37% in Lake St. Clair (least) to 88% in Lake Ontario (most). The total loss for overall Great Lakes ice coverage is 71%, while Lake Superior places second with a 79% loss. An empirical orthogonal function analysis indicates that a major response of ice cover to atmospheric forcing is in phase in all six lakes, accounting for 80.8% of the total variance. The second mode shows an out-of-phase spatial variability between the upper and lower lakes, accounting for 10.7% of the total variance. The regression of the first EOF-mode time series to sea level pressure, surface air temperature, and surface wind shows that lake ice mainly responds to the combined Arctic Oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation patterns.

J	Willis, KJ; Van den Brink, PJ; Green, JD				Willis, KJ; Van den Brink, PJ; Green, JD			Seasonal variation in plankton community responses of mesocosms dosed with pentachlorophenol	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Seasonal variations in plankton community response to pentachlorophenol (PCP) were studied in four mesocosm experiments using enclosures in a small lake. The mesocosms (860 1) were dosed with single applications of technical grade PCP (0, 4, 10, 24, 36, 54, 81 and 121 mug/l PCP) and monitored for 20 days. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that plankton community taxonomic composition varied with season. In winter and spring, communities were most stable in time; species diversity and abundance were lowest in winter. Seasonally, the communities varied little with respect to the dominant species, which were the copepod Calamoecia lucasi, the alga Peridinium sp. and the rotifer Ascomorpha ovalis. The direct effects of the PCP additions varied little between seasons, but indirect effects were evident at lower treatment levels in autumn. Indirect effects were not evident in winter. Minor variations in plankton community responses to PCP with season were apparent in the following order of decreasing sensitivity; autumn greater than or equal to winter/spring greater than or equal to summer. At the species level, C. lucasi showed the largest response. The responses observed were greatest in autumn, with decreased abundance at PCP concentrations greater than or equal to 24 mug/l. In the other seasons, effects were observed at levels of 54 or 81 mug/l and higher. Ascomorpha ovalis was the most responding rotifer in winter and spring, whereas Anuraeopsis fissa responded more strongly in autumn and summer. The dinoflagellate alga Peridinium sp. had the largest negative response in all but winter, when Dinobryon cylindricum did. Cryptomonas sp. responded positively to PCP in all seasons, increasing in abundance in the highest treatments, possibly due to reduced grazing pressure, reduced competition, or increased decomposition. The plankton community no-observed effect-concentration (NOEC) was 2436 mug/l PCP. Results reported here suggest that the Australian and New Zealand water quality guideline values for PCP are sufficient to protect plankton communities against adverse effects.					van den Brink, Paul/E-8315-2013	van den brink, Paul/0000-0002-7241-4347													0963-9292	1573-3017				OCT	2004	13	7					707	720		10.1007/s10646-003-4430-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-003-4430-3								15673219					WOS:000226285500009

Climate-driven shifts in diatom assemblages recorded in annually laminated sediments of Sacrower See (NE Germany)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Sacrower See is a eutrophic lake with annually laminated sediments extending back to A.D. 1868. Analysis of annual layers revealed multi-decadal periods of distinct diatom assemblages at A.D. 1868-1875, 1876-1940, 1941-1978, and 1979-2000. Detrended correspondence analysis performed on individual seasonal sediment layers showed decadal-scale patterns of turnover in the diatom flora. The spring-summer layers showed higher sample scores until the early 1960s, after which the differences with the autumn-winter layers became smaller. Rates-of-change analysis revealed that the seasonal variability in diatom assemblages was higher than the annual changes. Summer diatom rates of change over the period A.D. 1894-1960 was on average higher than for winter, whereas between the 1960s and 1970s the winter rates of change became higher than the summer ones. Redundancy Analyses showed that seasonal temperatures and wind strength were significant explanatory variables for diatom assemblages in both annual and seasonal layers. These results suggest that meteorological changes indirectly affected diatom assemblages via the mixing regime of the lake. A comparison of the diatom rates of change with the amplitude of inter-annual climate change shows a statistically significant correlation for the spring-summer layers in the period of A.D. 1963-2000, showing that the sensitivity of diatom assemblages to meteorological changes has varied over the past century, with a stronger effect on diatoms registered during the past 40 years.					; Zolitschka, Bernd/P-1487-2019; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Kirilova, Emiliya/C-2517-2011; Lotter, Andre F./C-3477-2008; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Lotter, Andre F./0000-0002-2954-8809; Zolitschka, Bernd/0000-0001-8256-0420													1015-1621	1420-9055				MAY	2011	73	2					201	210		10.1007/s00027-010-0169-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-010-0169-0													WOS:000289793900002
J	Schaffler, JJ; Isely, JJ; Hayes, WE				Schaffler, JJ; Isely, JJ; Hayes, WE			Habitat use by striped bass in relation to seasonal changes in water quality in a southern reservoir	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Adult striped bass Morone saxatilis (n = 6 1; 597-914 mm total length) were captured by hook and line throughout Lake Murray, South Carolina, and by electrofishing in the Greenwood Dam tailrace and upper Saluda River above Lake Murray, implanted with temperature-sensitive radio transmitters, and tracked biweekly. During late winter-early spring, striped bass were concentrated in the upstream portions of the reservoir. By midsummer, they were primarily located in the lower embayment of the reservoir, but several fish remained in the tailrace of the upstream dam as well as in a thermal refuge in the Saluda River. After the reservoir began to cool in fall, fish dispersed from the lower embayment and moved upstream toward the headwaters of the reservoir, where they had been captured the previous spring. Several fish returned to locations within 10 m of their original capture locations. Mean movement rates were lowest in winter and summer and highest in spring and fall. Low movement rates in summer were associated with a severe reduction of suitable habitat. In addition to the standard biweekly sampling, a 7.5-km(2) section of the lower embayment of Lake Murray was searched every 2 h over a continuous 48-h period from 10 to 12 August 2000. During this period, striped bass were observed to use the same areas on a seasonal basis as they did on a diel basis. However, mean hourly rates of movement were greater than the movement rates calculated for the normal 2-week interval between samples. Changes in location between biweekly samples may not indicate displacement but rather only randomly chosen locations in normal use areas.																			0002-8487					SEP	2002	131	5					817	827		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0817:HUBSBI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0817:HUBSBI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177740600002

No coastal and lakeland Gyrfalcons traveled more than 7.5 km to reach areas with plenty of waterfowl or seabirds (average 3.4 km in winter). Heathland falcons traveled farther to reach equally rich areas for these kinds of prey, e.g. in winter 13-33 km (average 12.9 km). Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus mutus was the main prey for all Gyrfalcons constituting 61% of total pellet volume. Rock Ptarmigan was most important during the early phase of the breeding season (April-June) and in autumn and early winter (August-December). Factors determining high vulnerability in spring seem to be behaviour and coloration of males and in later summer, the large number of naive young. Importance of Rock Ptarmigan on heathland territories as measured by pellet volume ranged from 61-100% for the different collection periods, and 8-85% and 13-91% on coastal and lakeland territores respectively. Other prey groups of importance on heathland territories were waders (max. 12%) in summer and wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus (max. 20%) and waterfowl (max. 20%) in winter. Lakeland Gyrfalcons increased their take of waterfowl (max. 56%) and waders (max. 13%)in summer and passerines (max. 19%) and wood mice (max. 43%) in winter. Coastal Gyrfalcons had the most variable diet; they increased their take of waterfowl (max. 42%) and waders (max. 21%) in summer and waterfowl (max. 68%) and alcids (max. 38%) in winter. Switching from Rock Ptarmigan to alternate preyinvolved in most cases a change of hunting habitat. from upland areas to wetland or coastal areas.

J	Liu, AQ; Moore, GWK				Liu, AQ; Moore, GWK			Lake-effect snowstorms over southern Ontario, Canada, and their associated synoptic-scale environment	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Lake-effect snowstorms are an important source of severe winter weather over the Great Lakes region and are often triggered by the passage of synoptic-scale low pressure systems. In this paper, a climatology of lake-effect snowstorms over southern Ontario, Canada, for the period 1992-99 is developed. The distinguishing characteristics of the synoptic-scale environment associated with intense lake-effect snowstorms in the region are identified through the study of individual events and through composite analysis. In particular, it is found that a low pressure and a cold-temperature anomaly situated over Hudson Bay, north of the Great Lakes, is a favorable environment for the development of intense lake-effect snowstorms over southern Ontario. It is also found that the track of the low pressure system can have a significant impact on the development or lack thereof of lake-effect snowstorms over southern Ontario. It is found that the low pressure systems that trigger intense lake-effect snowstorms tend to have an anomalous northeastward track as compared to the eastward track of most low pressure systems that transit the region.

Mortality increased as mean length of pikeperch in the first autumn decreased. The size-dependent mortality was analysed as correlation between mean lengths at age 0 in autumn and changes in mean lengths between age 1 and age 0. When the varying lengths at age 0 were taken into account, the duration of winter also affected mortality; longer durations of ice cover resulted in less size-dependent winter mortality. Since mean length at age 0 in autumn correlated positively with summer water temperature, winter mortality can be expected to decrease the warmer the summer.					; Lappalainen, Jyrki/IAM-3496-2023	Lappalainen, Jyrki/0000-0002-4631-3788; 													0706-652X					FEB	2000	57	2					451	458		10.1139/cjfas-57-2-451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-2-451													WOS:000085323600019

Gas phase, particulate phase and dust fall concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The distribution and partitioning of atmospheric PAHs were studied, and the major sources were identified; the backward trajectories of air masses starting from the center of Lake Small Baiyangdian were calculated for the entire year. The following results were obtained: (1) The total concentration of 16 priority controlled PAHs (PAH16) in the gas phase was 417.2 +/- 299.8 ng.m(-3), in the particulate phase was 150.9 +/- 99.2 ng.m(-3), and in dust fall was 6930.2 +/- 3206.5 ng.g(-1). (2) Vehicle emission, coal combustion, and biomass combustion were the major sources in the Small Baiyangdian atmosphere and accounted for 28.9%, 45.1% and 26.0% of the total PAHs, respectively.

Summer showed a dominant relatively clean southern pathway, whereas the trajectories in autumn and spring might be associated with high pollution from Shanxi or Henan province.

J	Petrie, SA; Badzinski, SS; Wilcox, KL				Petrie, SA; Badzinski, SS; Wilcox, KL			Population trends and habitat use of Tundra Swans staging at Long Point, Lake Erie	WATERBIRDS					4th International Swan Symposium/18th Trumpeter-Swan-Society Conference	FEB 13-18, 2001	WARRENTON, VA	Trumpeteer Swan Soc				Long Point, Lake Erie, is an important spring and autumn staging area for Eastern Population Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus). Habitat use and trend in numbers of Tundra Swans at Long Point were assessed using data from twelve Tundra Swans fitted with satellite transmitters and tracked locally, aerial surveys of swans on water (1971-1999), and roadside surveys of swans in fields (1998-2000). Mean peak autumn aquatic counts at Long Point increased from 442 Tundra Swans in the 1970s to 7,177 in the 1990s. The proportion of the Eastern Population of Tundra Swans rising Long Point during peak one-day autumn counts increased from <1% in the 1970s to nearly 8% in the 1990s. In contrast, there was no change in peak spring aquatic counts. Tundra Swans were located in agricultural fields more often in spring (74% of diurnal satellite locations) than in autumn (9%). During spring, most (65%) swans using terrestrial habitats were observed in corn (Zea mays) fields, whereas during autumn, most (67%) were in winter wheat (Triticum duriem) fields. Seasonal differences in use of fields appeared to influence wetland habitat use; during spring, when agricultural fields were used extensively, Tundra Swans were located in those aquatic habitats that were closest to fields. However, during autumn, when aquatic plants were their primary forage, swans tended to use aquatic habitats closer to the tip of Long Point. Given the potential for Tundra Swans to influence the structure of waterfowl communities and aquatic habitats, and the overall lack of information about staging Tundra Swans, further research into the ecological importance and use of spring and autumn stopover sites is warranted.																			1524-4695	1938-5390					2002	25			1			143	149																WOS:000180160100020

SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF ZOOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS AND RELATIONSHIP WITH ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN A EUTROPHIC RESERVOIR FROM COLD REGION	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In this study, the concept of functional feeding groups was used to classify zooplankton community into functional groups among three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). A total of 30 zooplankton species were sampled in the Tuanjie Reservoir and identified into seven functional groups. Environmental factors and zooplankton functional group biomass were both varied in spatially and seasonally. Water transparency (SD), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, N:P and dissolved iron (Fe3+) were higher in autumn while total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and dissolved copper (Cu2+) were higher in spring, and temperature (T) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) were higher in summer. Zooplankton functional groups biomass was higher in summer, followed by spring and autumn. In spring, zooplankton functional group only dominated by group PF, while in summer and autumn dominated by group PF and RF. Spearman and RDA results showed that SD, conductivity (COND), DO, NR4+-N, nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and CODMn were the major factors influencing zooplankton functional groups in Tuanjie Reservoir.

To study the spatio-temporal dynamics of phytoplankton functional groups and the main driving factors in this large subtropical reservoir, field samplings were conducted in five sections along the longitudinal axis of the TGR in summer (August 2012), autumn (December 2012), winter (January2013), and spring (April 2013), respectively. Twenty-nine phytoplankton functional groups were identified among 246 phytoplankton species. There were obvious seasonal and spatial differences in both the biomass and composition of the phytoplankton functional groups. The algal biomass in the mainstream was at low level during the study period and the dominant functional groups included groups B, D, P, and MP, which adapted to mixed and turbid water condition. In comparison with the mainstream, the algal biomass in the tributaries was higher in during the flood seasons (spring and summer) and the dominant groups switched to X2, L-O, and P, which prefer meso-eutrophic environments and standing water. In the dry seasons (autumn and winter), the dominant groups in the tributaries were B, D, P, L-O, and Y. Group L-O and Y can swim to optimal light and nutrients layers with the help of flagella. The study suggests that hydrological regimes such as mixing, water flow, water temperature, and thermal structure played an important role in determining the biomass and community structure of phytoplankton, and shows the value of phytoplankton functional groups in studying algal spatio-temporal dynamics in the TGR.

J	Lofgren, BM				Lofgren, BM			Simulated effects of idealized Laurentian Great Lakes on regional and large-scale climate	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Comparison is made between general circulation model (GCM) cases with and without the inclusion of idealized Great Lakes, in the form of four rectangular bodies of water, each occupying a single grid cell of the GCM at R30 resolution. The presence of idealized Great Lakes, as opposed to land, results in a phase shift in the annual cycle of latent and sensible heat flux. Very high upward sensible heat flux occurs over these idealized Great Lakes during the early winter. On the average over a region encompassing these idealized Great Lakes, evaporation and precipitation increase during the autumn and winter and decrease during the late spring and summer due to the lakes. Annual average water vapor flux convergence increases. The Great Lakes also alter the meridional air temperature gradient. During the autumn and winter, the meridional temperature gradient is intensified to the north of the Great Lakes and diminished to the south. This intensifies the mean jet stream core and displaces it toward the north. This effect is reduced during the winter compared to the autumn because air temperature changes due to the lakes are unable to penetrate as deeply into the strongly stably stratified winter atmosphere. The increase in jet stream speed seems to increase synoptic wave activity to the northeast of the Great Lakes. As an additional experimental case, a swamp surface (saturated surface with no thermal capacity) is used to represent the Great Lakes. In this case there is little effect on the thermal state of the surface and atmosphere and on the fluxes between them. However, there is increased evaporation during the late summer and early autumn and increased precipitation throughout the summer and autumn. Annual water vapor flux convergence in this experimental case is greater than in the case with no lakes.

These lakes are shallow, turbid and pan-shaped, having relatively unstable and fluid substrates. Water levels of these lakes are high in the summer and low or dry in the winter. These lakes usually contain fresh to slightly saline water during the rainy season (summer-fall) and slightly saline water during the dry season (winter-spring), and have a solute composition that is dominated by Na+, HCO3--CO32-, Cl- ions. The regional climate is characterized as humid temperate with mild equitable temperatures throughout the year. Winter temperatures are usually > 0.degree. C; summer temperatures are commonly < 30.degree. C. The water temperature of the lakes containing L. bradburyi generally reflects atmospheric temperatures. The ostracod''s life cycle coincides with the climatic wet cycle and is therefore completed during the warmest period of the year, which is in marked contrast to ostracods living in lakes in the USA and Canada that usually begin their life cycle with the spring rain and snow melt in cold water and complete their life cycle in warm water. This contrasting climatic life-cycle pattern between central Mexico and the USA may be sufficient to explain why L. bradburyi occurs commonly in many Quaternary deposits in the southwestern USA, but has not been found living in the USA.																			0022-3360	1937-2337					1985	59	1					8	20																WOS:A1985TZ46400002

Geography and Morphology Affect the Ice Duration Dynamics of Northern Hemisphere Lakes Worldwide	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Climate change continues to diminish ice cover duration for Northern Hemisphere lakes. However, the differential loss of lake ice duration for various types of lakes across the globe is not well established. In this study, we used time series of ice duration data (average length = 51 years) for 220 globally distributed Northern Hemisphere lakes to determine how local climate trends, geographical location, and physical properties of lakes affect their ice cover trends. Ice duration dynamics were influenced by surface air temperature trends, lake geography, and morphology. Deeper lakes, located at lower elevations, western longitudes, and lower latitudes, experienced the greatest reductions in ice cover over their time series. These results indicate that despite widespread patterns of warming, the individual features of lakes can determine how rapidly they are losing ice cover and may prove informative for future modeling and conservation efforts. Plain Language Summary Citizen scientists and researchers alike have been visually logging the freezing and breakup dates of lake ice for hundreds of years. Studies have shown that lake ice duration (the number of days between freezing and breakup) has decreased over time due to human-induced climate change. We have used this type of data to determine how the size and geographic location of a lake influence how its ice cover length in winter has changed over time. We found that deep lakes, at lower elevations, western longitudes, and lower latitudes, are losing ice cover at relatively fast rates. Our results demonstrate that even though warming is a general pattern on our planet, these specific types of lakes are being affected disproportionately, which may help to prioritize conservation efforts to preserve freshwater biodiversity and drinking water resources.

Distribution and movement of Bay of Quinte Walleye in relation to temperature, prey availability and Dreissenid colonization	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The spatial and seasonal distribution of walleye were surveyed with gillnets in the Bay of Quinte and Lake Ontario during 1992-2008. Walleye movements were determined with tagging in the Bay of Quinte and Lake Ontario surrounding Prince Edward County during fall 1998-2003, and with recaptures from angling and other fisheries in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River during 1998-2003. Immature walleye (age < 4 yr) were abundant in the upper Bay of Quinte from April to November, moved small distances down the bay during summer, and were less frequently observed in Lake Ontario. Mature walleye (age > 4 yr) were found in the upper Bay of Quinte during spring, and farther down the bay during summer. Older mature walleye (age-7+) were observed in eastern Lake Ontario during summer. The tagging data were consistent in showing that older fish moved down the Bay of Quinte toward Lake Ontario during summer. During fall mature walleye moved back up the Bay of Quinte either from Lake Ontario or the lower bay. Immature and mature walleye moved farther up the Bay of Quinte during fall to spring, again with older walleye tending to move longer distances. Walleye migration between the Bay of Quinte and Lake Ontario during spring and fall was consistent with avoiding warm temperature in the upper bay, and foraging on alewife in the lower bay and Lake Ontario during summer and young-of the-year fishes such as gizzard shad during fall. The distribution of walleye between the Bay of Quinte and Lake Ontario did not change after dreissenid colonization.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2011	14	1					56	65		10.1080/14634988.2011.548298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2011.548298													WOS:000288197500007
J	Hembre, LK; Megard, RO				Hembre, LK; Megard, RO			Timing of predation by rainbow trout controls Daphnia demography and the trophic status of a Minnesota lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Stocking of lakes with rainbow trout is a common practice that presents a potential conflict for lake managers who must balance the interests of anglers with those concerned that zooplanktivory by trout may trigger a trophic cascade and result in decreased water clarity. 2. This study examined how the timing of trout stocking (autumn versus spring) in a Minnesota (U.S.A.) lake affected (i) the population dynamics of their zooplankton food supply (Daphnia pulicaria), (ii) phytoplankton biomass and water clarity and (iii) trout survival. Sizes of both Daphnia and trout populations were estimated acoustically with high-frequency (192 kHz) sonar. 3. Daphnia were nearly eliminated from the lake during winters after trout were stocked in autumn. In both of these years (1996 and 1997), the Daphnia population was small in the spring, and grew during the summer and into the autumn as the trout population diminished. 4. The lake was then stocked in spring for 2 years (1998 and 1999). This fisheries manipulation alleviated predation over the winter, but increased predation on D. pulicaria during the spring, summer and autumn. However, the high mortality caused by the spring-stocked trout was offset by even higher rates of reproduction by the relatively large populations of fecund Daphnia that survived the winter in 1998 and 1999. 5. Grazing by these dense populations of Daphnia produced clear-water phases during May and June that were inhibited in autumn stocking years. In addition, the large Daphnia populations present during the spring and early summer of 1998 and 1999 provided abundant forage for trout. 6. This fisheries manipulation achieved seemingly mutually exclusive management objectives: a robust planktivorous sport fishery, and clear water for other forms of recreation.																			0046-5070					JUN	2005	50	6					1064	1080		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01372.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01372.x													WOS:000229081600012

The relationship between phytoplankton functional groups and environmental factors was explored to effectively capture the responses of these taxa to environmental gradients and their effects on ecosystem function. Our results indicated that the Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta had higher relative abundance than other taxa, and their diversity and richness indices in spring were higher than those in other seasons. The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analyses detected that the potential seasonal biomarkers included Desmodesmus, Cyclotella, Pseudoschroederia, Discostella, Scenedesmus, Monoraphidium, and Nannochloropsis; the spatial biomarkers included Amphora, Neochloris, Hindakia, Pseudomuriella, Coccomyxa, Chloroidium, Scherffelia, Chromochloris, and Scotinosphaera. The systemic evolution and distribution characteristics of the first 50 representative sequences showed that the dominant genus included Desmodesmus in spring, Pseudopediastrum in summer, Mychonastes in autumn, and Monoraphidium in winter. Main seasonal variation of phytoplankton functional groups was as follows: spring (J + F + C + X1) -> summer (J + F + X1 + X2) -> autumn (J + F + X1 + C) -> winter (X1 + J + B + X2). Pearson correlation, redundancy analysis, and variance partitioning analysis showed temperature and phosphate were the determining factors causing the changes of phytoplankton functional groups and community composition in the Fenhe River.

Approximately 80% of their annual growth in length and mass was attained during late summer and autumn. Growth was minimal during winter (January-February) and spring (March-May). The number of walleye with empty stomachs was highest during the summer. Invertebrates (Cladocera, Chironomidae) were common in walleye stomachs during the summer and spring, but contributed little to the ingested biomass. Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum dominated walleye diets (per cent by mass) throughout the year. A bioenergetics model predicted that the proportion of maximum consumption (P-c) was highest during the autumn and was probably due to spatial overlap of walleye and gizzard shad once water temperatures were <22degreesC. The bioenergetics model predicted that walleye would lose up to 65% of their body mass during the summer if water temperature increased by 10% (as predicted by some global warming models). Growth during the autumn, winter and spring was enhanced up to 150% by increased temperatures. The results of this study indicate that lower condition, reduced consumption and slow growth are a generalized, response of walleye to extreme temperatures. Elevated temperatures may have a net positive effect on walleye growth if they can survive the high thermal stress during summer. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

Water was in a liquid phase throughout the year, with temperatures ranging from 0 to 10 degrees C. The maximum photosynthetically active radiation in Lake Oyako-ike was 23.16 mol m(-2) day(-1) (at 3.8 m) and Hotoke-ike was 53.01 mol m(-2) day(-1) (at 2.2 m) in summer, and chlorophyll a concentration ranged from ca. 0.5 to 2.5 mu g L-1 (Oyako-ike) and from ca. 0.1 to 0.8 mu g L-1 (Hotoke-ike) during the study period. Increase in chlorophyll a fluorescence occurred under dim-light conditions when the lakes were covered with ice in spring and autumn, but the signals were minimum in ice-free summer in both the lakes. During spring and summer, as a result of decreasing snow cover, the chlorophyll a concentration similarly decreased when PAR was relatively high, following periods of heavy winds. The autumnal and spring increase occurred under different PAR levels (ca. 20-fold and 90-fold stronger, respectively, in autumn in both the lakes). Differences in the autumn and spring increases suggest that the spring algal community is more shade-adapted than the autumn algal community. Antarctic phytoplankton appears especially adapted to low-light levels and inhibited by strong light regimes.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				JAN	2008	31	2					199	208		10.1007/s00300-007-0347-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-007-0347-2													WOS:000251231000009

Effects of changing climate on ice cover in three morphometrically different lakes	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake model (DYRESM-WQ-I) is employed to simulate ice cover and water temperatures over the period 1911-2014. The effects of climate changes (air temperature and wind speed) on ice cover (ice-on, ice-off, ice cover duration, and maximum ice thickness) are modeled and compared for the three different morphometry lakes: Fish Lake, Lake Wingra, and Lake Mendota, located in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. It is found that the ice cover period has decreased due to later ice-on dates and earlier ice-off dates, and the annual maximum ice cover thickness has decreased for the three lakes during the last century. Based upon simulated perturbations of daily mean air temperatures across the range of -10 degrees C to +10 degrees C of historical values, Fish Lake has the most occurrences of no ice cover and Lake Wingra still remains ice covered under extreme conditions (+10 degrees C). Overall, shallower lakes with larger surface areas appear more resilient to ice cover changes caused by climate changes.

POPULATION ABUNDANCE IN A SOFTWATER LAKE OVER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												Changes in population abundance of submerged Sphagnum denticulatun Brid. were studied in an acidic and oligotrophic lake in NW Poland over three years. Individuals were counted in a moss carpet at a depth of 2.5 m on 4 experimental plots, 1x1 m each, every 30 days for 36 months using the SCUBA method. PAR intensity was seasonally variable (in winter higher than in summer). Changes in water pH, conductivity. HCO3- concentration, hydration and sediment pH were statistically insignificant (p>0.05). In the summer of the second study year the moss carpet disappeared almost completely due to a massive bloom of filamentous green algae. Periods of growth, regression and regeneration were observed in the population. The stabilisation of population size took 24 months and followed the pattern: slight fluctuations, then rapid growth and repetition of slight fluctuations. The first stage lasted nine, the second four and the third nine months. These stages took place irrespective of seasons, temperature or PAR intensity. Each rapid increase in abundance lasted about 30 clays, at PAR intensity >20% and water temperature ranging from 11 to 16 degrees C (in winter, spring or autumn). The regression stage brought about by the algal bloom started in the second year (in summer) and lasted six months (until the end of January in the third year). The population regeneration began in winter (in February, water temperature 3.0 degrees C, PAR about 20%, ice cover 0.15 m) and finished with the end of spring.

J	Laird, N; Sobash, R; Hodas, N				Laird, Neil; Sobash, Ryan; Hodas, Natasha			The Frequency and Characteristics of Lake-Effect Precipitation Events Associated with the New York State Finger Lakes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												This study presents a climatological analysis of the frequency and characteristics of lake-effect precipitation events that were initiated or enhanced by lakes within the New York State (NYS) Finger Lakes region for the 11 winters (October-March) from 1995/ 96 through 2005/06. Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) data from Binghamton, New York, were used to identify 125 lake-effect events. Events occurred as 1) a well-defined, isolated precipitation band over and downwind of a lake, 2) an enhancement of mesoscale lake-effect precipitation originating from Lake Ontario and extending southward over an individual Finger Lake, 3) a quasi-stationary mesoscale precipitation band positioned over a lake embedded within extensive regional precipitation from a synoptic weather system, or 4) a transition from one type to another. Results show that lake-effect precipitation routinely develops over lakes that are considerably smaller than lakes previously discussed as being associated with lake-effect precipitation, such as the Great Lakes. Lake-effect events occurred during each month (October-March) across the 11 winters studied and were identified in association with each of the six easternmost Finger Lakes examined in this study. The frequency of NYS Finger Lakes lake-effect events determined in the current investigation paired with subsequent analyses of the environmental conditions leading to these events will allow for 1) comparative analyses of necessary conditions for lake-effect development across a range of lake sizes (e.g., NYS Finger Lakes, Lake Champlain, Great Salt Lake, and Great Lakes) and 2) an informative examination of the connection between mesoscale processes and climate variability.

J	Kobari, T; Ban, S				Kobari, T; Ban, S			Life cycles of two limnetic cyclopoid copepods, Cyclops vicinus and Thermocyclops crassus, in two different habitats	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The life cycles of Cyclops vicinus and Thermocyclops crassus in two shallow eutrophic habitats, Junsainuma and Naganuma Ponds, Hokkaido, Japan, were investigated. Both ponds exhibited similar seasonal patterns of temperature, oxygen levels and pH during ice-free periods; however, oxygen levels were extremely lower under the ice in Naganuma Pond. Cyclops vicinus showed different life cycles in the two ponds; in Junsainuma Pond, it reproduced in winter and spring (January-May) and entered diapause during summer and autumn (June-October) as copepodite IV stage, while it reproduced in autumn (October-November) and spring (April-May), and entered diapause in summer (June-September) and winter (January and February) as copepodite V stage in Naganuma Pond. Thermocyclops crassus entered diapause during winter (December-April) as copepodite IV and V stages in both ponds, and egg-bearing females appeared only during the warm season, from early May to late October, when water temperatures were >10 degrees C. Summer diapause in C. vicinus was suggested to be an adaptation against fish predation, whereas C.vicinus entered winter diapause in Naganuma Pond probably to avoid low oxygen levels. Thermocyclops crassus entered diapause in both ponds to avoid low water temperature. These results suggest that biotic and abiotic factors are important for leading to specific life cycles of cyclopoid copepods in small water bodies.

Twenty adult lake whitefish were tagged with acoustic tags that had either a depth sensor or both depth and temperature sensors to assess vertical habitat use at a seasonal and daily resolution. Vertical habitat selection varied seasonally and was strongly influenced by temperature. Between December and April, when the lake was covered with ice, surface temperature was below 2 degrees C and tagged individuals occupied deep areas of the lake (similar to 15 m). After ice-out, fish ascended into shallow waters (similar to 5 m), responding to increased water temperature and possibly to greater foraging opportunity. When surface water temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C, fish descended below the developing thermocline (similar to 9 m), where they remained until surface temperatures fell below 20 degrees C; fish then ascended into shallower depths, presumably for feeding and spawning. Through the winter, fish remained in thermal habitats that were warmer than the surface temperatures; in the summer, they selected depths with thermal habitats below 15 degrees C. Though the amplitude varied greatly across seasons, lake whitefish displayed a strong diurnal pattern of activity as measured by vertical velocities. Fish were twofold more active during spring, summer, and fall than during winter. Lake whitefish exhibited diel vertical migrations, rising in the water column during nighttime and occupying deeper waters during the day. This pattern was more pronounced in the spring and fall and far less prominent during winter and summer. The strong linkage between temperature and habitat use may limit the current range of lake whitefish and may be directly impacted by climatic change.					; Gorsky, Dimitry/AGI-7846-2022	Gorsky, Dimitry/0000-0003-1708-539X; Zydlewski, Joseph/0000-0002-2255-2303													0002-8487	1548-8659					2012	141	3					761	771		10.1080/00028487.2012.675905	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2012.675905													WOS:000306462100018
J	Cordeira, JM; Laird, NF				Cordeira, Jason M.; Laird, Neil F.			The influence of ice cover on two lake-effect snow events over Lake Erie	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												It is generally understood that extensive regions of significant lake ice cover impact lake-effect ( LE) snow storms by decreasing the upward heat and moisture fluxes from the lake surface; however, it is only recently that studies have been conducted to more thoroughly examine this relationship. This study provides the first examination of Great Lakes LE snow storms that developed in association with an extensively ice-covered lake. The LE snow events that occurred downwind of Lake Erie on 12 - 14 February 2003 and 28 - 31 January 2004 produced maximum snowfall totals of 43 and 64 cm in western New York state, respectively. The presence of widespread ice cover led these snows to be less anticipated than snowfalls from Lake Ontario, which had limited ice cover. For both events, a variety of ice-cover conditions and meso- and synoptic- scale factors ( i) helped support LE snow storm development, ( ii) lead to the transitions in LE convective type, and ( iii) resulted in noteworthy snowfalls near Lake Erie. Thinner ice cover along with favorable fetch directions during the 2004 event likely aided the development of more significant snowband time periods and the resulting greater snowfall. Although Lake Erie had regions with lower ice concentration during the 2003 event, thicker ice cover was present across a greater area of the lake, fetch directions during lake- effect time periods were positioned over higher ice concentration regions, and snowbands had a shorter duration and impacted the same region to a lesser degree than the 2004 case.																			0027-0644	1520-0493				JUL	2008	136	7					2747	2763		10.1175/2007MWR2310.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2007MWR2310.1													WOS:000257968900029

Takins inhabited forests and subalpine meadows at an altitudinal range from 1,360 m to 2,890 m. Our results showed that golden takins had a complicated seasonal movement pattern and underwent altitudinal migration 4 times each year. Takins occupied a high-altitude range during summer, stayed at low-altitude ranges for short periods during spring and autumn, and resided at an intermediate-altitude range during winter. Changes in plant phenology may have caused seasonal movements. Reserves for takin conservation should incorporate lower altitude habitats than those takins use in spring and autumn, and seasonal movements by takins should be protected from disturbance by human activities.					; Skidmore, Andrew/C-7441-2011; Wang, Tiejun/A-4671-2010	Skidmore, Andrew/0000-0002-7446-8429; Wang, Tiejun/0000-0002-1138-8464; 													0022-541X	1937-2817				APR	2008	72	3					611	617		10.2193/2007-197	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2007-197													WOS:000254412800005

Variation in Body Composition and Digestive Organs of Tundra Swans during Migration at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario	WATERBIRDS												Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus) spend a substantial portion of their annual cycle at migratory staging areas. Despite the potential importance of staging areas to conservation of Eastern Population (EP) Tundra Swans, few data are available to assess life-history strategies of the species during migration. During 1999 and 2000, 48 adult Tundra Swans were collected during peak periods of spring and autumn migration at Long Point, Ontario, Canada, to establish baselines on nutrient reserve levels and morphology of digestive organs. Results were compared to nutrient reserve data for EP Tundra Swans collected at a major wintering area in North Carolina, USA. Lipid reserve levels did not differ between sexes nor varied with body size, but lipid reserves were approximately two times greater in autumn than spring. Males had greater protein reserves than females, and protein reserves were similar during autumn and spring. Although digestive organs were predicted to be longer and heavier during autumn, no seasonal variation in digestive organs was detected. Lipid reserve levels of Tundra Swans at Long Point during spring were similar to those recorded for wintering birds in North Carolina, suggesting that lipid reserves catabolized from autumn through winter were not replenished prior to arriving at this initial spring staging area. The results highlight the importance of managing quality aquatic and terrestrial foraging habitats at staging areas for conservation EP Tundra Swans.

The seasonal variations of protist and rotifer populations were monitored over 1 year in a small artificial pond. Grazing rates on fluorescently labelled bacteria were also determined. 2. The data showed population dynamics similar to other small freshwater bodies; diatoms were numerous during the spring, chlorophytes dominated during the summer months, and mixotrophs, in particular Gymnodinium, dominated during the autumn and winter. 3. The mixotrophic dinoflagellates were responsible for a high chlorophyll concentration during the autumn and winter. Mixotrophs were important consumers of bacteria, particularly during the autumn when population densities of pure heterotrophs were low. Mixotrophs were an important component of the microbial food web in this pond.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2000	43	2					231	241		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00541.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00541.x													WOS:000085242200006

Mesoscale modeling of lake effect snow over Lake Erie - sensitivity to convection, microphysics and the water temperature	ADVANCES IN SCIENCE AND RESEARCH					9th Annual Meeting of the European-Meteorological-Society (EMS) / 9th European Conference on Applications of Meteorology (ECAM)	SEP 28-OCT 02, 2009	Toulouse, FRANCE	European Meteorol Soc				Lake effect snow is a shallow convection phenomenon during cold air advection over a relatively warm lake. A severe case of lake effect snow over Lake Erie on 24 December 2001 was studied with the MM5 and WRF mesoscale models. This particular case provided over 200 cm of snow in Buffalo (NY), caused three casualties and $10 million of material damage. Hence, the need for a reliable forecast of the lake effect snow phenomenon is evident. MM5 and WRF simulate lake effect snow successfully, although the intensity of the snowbelt is underestimated. It appears that significant differences occur between using a simple and a complex microphysics scheme. In MM5, the use of the simple-ice microphysics scheme results in the triggering of the convection much earlier in time than with the more sophisticated Reisner-Graupel-scheme. Furthermore, we find a large difference in the maximum precipitation between the different nested domains: Reisner-Graupel produces larger differences in precipitation between the domains than "simple ice". In WRF, the sophisticated Thompson microphysics scheme simulates less precipitation than the simple WSM3 scheme. Increased temperature of Lake Erie results in an exponential growth in the 24-h precipitation. Regarding the convection scheme, the updated Kain-Fritsch scheme (especially designed for shallow convection during lake effect snow), gives only slight differences in precipitation between the updated and the original scheme.

J	JONSSON, E				JONSSON, E			FLIGHT PERIODS OF AQUATIC INSECTS AT LAKE ESROM, DENMARK	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In 1980 window traps, with a catching area of 800 cm2, were operated at two sites on the short of Lake Esrom, Denmark. A total of 36,419 individuals of aquatic insects (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Megaloptera, Trichoptera and Diptera) were caught. Chironomidae, which were the numerically most important group, were in both traps represented in 31,021 individuals belonging to 51 species. Trichoptera, the second most abundant group, were represented by 4,071 individuals belonging to 23 species. The main features of the flight activity of all the aquatic insects caught in the two traps are presented, and for the numerically most important species these are compared to other studies. Czekanowski''s similarity indices were calculated for the catch data. The use of similarity indices on the flight activity data confirmed a main pattern of a spring, summer and autumn periods. The similarity-dendrograms for Chironomids showed a long spring- and summer periods, extending from early May to the middle of September, but with four major subdivisions. A very distinct autumn period in flight activity of the chironomids was observed. This autumn period, extending from 15 September to 3 November, was characterised by few species and low flight activity. The seasonal flight patterns of Trichopterans and other insects showed the same main division as the Chironomids. A transition between spring and summer period was in early June. The period with summer species was divided into two halfs around late July, while the transition between the summer and autumn periods was around middle of September.																			0003-9136					AUG	1987	110	2					259	274																WOS:A1987J804700006

Body weights of male and female fawns and yearlings were postitively correlated with acorn yield the previous autumn and inversely correlated with estimated spring population density of deer. Acorn yield was postively related, and spring population density of deer inversely related, with the cumulative number of days with > 0.25 cm of precipitation during the previous 3 and 4 winters. Acorn yield and associated body weights were not related to total amount of precipitation, presumably because of the topography of the study area. Cumulative effects of winter climate should be considered in deer population models.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				APR	1989	53	2					292	295		10.2307/3801125	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3801125													WOS:A1989U245700003

J	JOHNSON, NM; MERRITT, DH				JOHNSON, NM; MERRITT, DH			CONVECTIVE AND ADVECTIVE CIRCULATION OF LAKE POWELL, UTAH-ARIZONA, DURING 1972-1975	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The water circulation in Lake Powell was documented and analyzed for the period 1972-1975 on a monthly, synoptic basis. From its inception Lake Powell has convectively mixed only during the winter cooling period. At no time during 1972-1975 did this vertical mixing extend to the lake bottom. During the winter dissolved salt becomes important in stabilizing the lake. The yearly heat budget of the lake averages 40 kcal/cm2. A dominant feature of the summer circulation of the lake is an overflow density current from the upstream Colorado River. The overflow current mechanically sets the depth and extent of the thermocline. During maximum stratification (July-Sept.) a pervasive and intense O2-depletion layer develops immediately below the epilimnion-thermocline interface. Cold, dense upstream waters intrude the lake during the winter as an underflow density current, which annually replenishes the O2 supply of the bottom waters. An integral component of the lake''s circulation througout the year is a withdrawal current at mid-depth within the lake. The configuration and extent of the withdrawal current is a function of dam operation and seasonal density stratification.																			0043-1397	1944-7973					1979	15	4					873	884		10.1029/WR015i004p00873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/WR015i004p00873													WOS:A1979HJ54800016

Strong seasonal effects of waterbirds on benthic communities in shallow lakes	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Little is known about the effects of waterbirds on benthic macroinvertebrates in nontidal habitats. We conducted 4 waterbird-exclusion experiments in a transformed marshland in Donana Natural Park (southwestern Spain) and compared benthic macroinvertebrates in 3 x 3-m control (no exclusion) and test plots from which Greater Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber or all waterbirds were excluded. The 4 experimental periods coincided with the waterbird breeding season (summer), postbreeding period (autumn), wintering period (winter), and pre- and early breeding season (spring). Densities of waterbirds were relatively low compared to densities reported in other studies, but we found strong effects of excluding flamingos and waterfowl on the structure of the benthic community in autumn, winter, and spring. In winter, numbers of polychaetes and chironomids were nearly 2x higher in exclusion than in control plots. The difference in macroinvertebrate biomass among treatments was strongest in winter when benthic dry mass was similar to 2x higher in flamingo exclosures than in control plots and similar to 2x higher in all-bird exclosures than in flamingo exclosures. Macroinvertebrate richness was 15% lower in control than in all-bird exclosures in winter and 25% lower in control than in all-bird exclosures in spring. Our results suggest that benthic macroinvertebrate communities in this wetland are affected more by predation, bioturbation, and waterbird herbivory than by competition. These findings suggest that waterfowl and the increasing population of flamingos are of great importance in structuring shallow lakes in the Mediterranean region.

Tolerance and Recovery of Kentucky Bluegrass Subjected to Seasonal Wear	CROP SCIENCE												Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) is frequently established on sports fields that receive wear during one or more seasons. Differences exist among Kentucky bluegrass cultivars for seasonal performance characteristics such as spring green-up and summer stress tolerance. The objective of this study was to determine; whether the wear tolerance and recovery of Kentucky bluegrass cultivars were dependent on season. Twenty-two Kentucky bluegrass cultivars, representing nine genetically diverse Kentucky bluegrass types, were established in September 2002 in North Brunswick, NJ on a loam. The effects of simulated wear were evaluated during spring, summer, and fall in 2004 and 2005. Generally, Kentucky bluegrass was more tolerant of wear during spring than summer or fall and recovery was more rapid after spring wear. The performance of many cultivars depended on season of wear; however, 'Julia' consistently exhibited the greatest wear tolerance as well as recovery. Compact-Midnight Type cultivars ('Midnight', 'Midnight II', and 'Liberator') had good wear tolerance during fall wear, however were slow to recover after fall wear. 'Cabernet', 'Lakeshore', 'Moon Shadow', 'Limousine', and 'Jefferson' exhibited more rapid recovery from fall wear during the next spring. 'Langara', 'Bedazzled', and 'Touchdown' had poor wear tolerance and recovery during all seasons. The season(s) of play should be considered when selecting Kentucky bluegrass cultivars for sports fields.																			0011-183X					JUL-AUG	2010	50	4					1526	1536		10.2135/cropsci2009.09.0479	http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2009.09.0479													WOS:000279138200048

Some impacts, particularly those on air and ground transportation, depend critically on the time of day that lake-effect precipitation occurs. This study utilizes hourly precipitation data collected near Lakes Superior and Michigan to determine the diurnal behavior of lake-effect precipitation frequency. Precipitation data from approximately 200 lake effect days during 1988-93, identified by a previous study based on visible satellite data, are examined. A distinct morning maximum and afternoon/evening minimum in lake-effect precipitation frequency was observed, with the largest variations at sites within the snowbelt regions. The relative importance of several factors known to influence lake-effect precipitation development was examined to gain insight into the physical mechanisms controlling the diurnal evolution of lake-effect precipitation.

The two independently inferred temperature anomalies were significantly correlated. On average, spring and autumn temperatures were lower during the two millennia B.C than during 0-1,300 A.D. Marked spring and autumn temperature minima occurred at about 1,300 and 600 B.C. At about 1,300 A.D, STanom declined again. Spring-temperature anomalies during Roman and Medieval times equaled or slightly exceeded the modern values and paralleled tree-line and glacier fluctuations. The de-coupling of autumn and spring climates, which began during the Medieval period, might indicate changes in major circulation modes. It was assumed that the North-Atlantic influence, triggering winter-rain climate in the Northern Mediterranean, became weaker during Medieval times, resulting in a trend towards warmer autumns and overall more continental climate conditions in the study area. Four pulses of land use, inferred from indicator pollen, occurred during (1) the Early to Late Bronze, (2) the transition from Late Bronze to Early Iron Age (Hallstatt), (3) Late Iron Age (La Tene, Celtic time) to Roman times, and (4) during high to late Medieval times. Climate seemed to be an important, though complex, trigger of Alpine land use.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				NOV	2007	38	4					541	554		10.1007/s10933-007-9089-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9089-y													WOS:000250238600006
J	Weyhenmeyer, GA				Weyhenmeyer, GA			Warmer winters: Are planktonic algal populations in Sweden's largest lakes affected?	AMBIO												Winters in Sweden have become warmer in the 1990s, and as a consequence the timing of ice break-up and the growth and decline of spring phytoplankton has shifted, starting earlier. Even spring temperatures have become warmer, leading to an earlier beginning of the summer phytoplankton growth. The spring-ward shift in phytoplankton population growth has resulted in an extension of the growing season by at least one month. Although mean total phytoplankton biomass from May to October has not increased, the spring and early summer biomass of temperature-sensitive phytoplankton groups, such as cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, has increased in the 1990s. No increase was noted for other phytoplankton groups. Considering that some species of cyanobacteria that commonly occur during a summer bloom, such as Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, and Microcystis, can be toxic, the effect of warmer winters on aquatic ecosystems is potentially far-reaching.

Although copepod abundances remained rather stable throughout the study period (1970-1995), the seasonal pattern changed strongly, including a seasonal shift in the timing of peak abundance from spring to late summer with increasing oligotrophication. This shift in seasonality resulted from seasonally opposing long-term trends in abundances (a reduction in abundances in spring and an increase in summer) possibly due to seasonally opposing long-term trends in naupliar mortality (an increase in late winter mortality and a decrease in early summer mortality). The changes in seasonality were most pronounced within the early copepodid stages, whereas the long duration of the adult stage seemed to buffer the adult dynamics against seasonal environmental variability. The effects of climate variability on population dynamics were more subtle and consisted of faster development in spring in years with faster vernal warming. Furthermore, the accelerated development in spring resulted in earlier occurrence of the population minimum in summer and subsequently in an earlier abundance increase in late summer/autumn. Hence, abundances in summer/autumn were still related to spring climate variability, which shows that spring environmental variability can be transferred further into the season by the cohort dynamics of continuously reproducing populations.					; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; Seebens, Hanno/I-2310-2019	Seebens, Hanno/0000-0001-8993-6419; Straile, Dietmar/0000-0002-7441-8552; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2007	52	6					2364	2372		10.4319/lo.2007.52.6.2364	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.6.2364													WOS:000251129700005

Lake Blankaart is turbid and has a high phytoplankton biomass and episodic cyanobacterial blooms, whereas biomanipulated Lake Visvijver is characterized by clearwater conditions and the establishment of a dense charophyte vegetation. Both lakes were dominated by bacterial groups commonly found in freshwater habitats (e.g. ACK4 cluster of Actinomycetes; ACK stands for clones isolated from the Adirondack mountain lakes). Yet, cluster analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that taxon composition of the bacterioplankton community of the two lakes differs substantially and consistently throughout the season. During the study year (1998), the bacterioplankton community of both lakes showed a distinct seasonal pattern. Lake Blankaart showed a clear differentiation between winter, spring, summer and autumn. In Lake Visvijver, summer samples differed greatly from spring, autumn and winter samples. We hypothesize that the contrasting bacterioplankton in the two neighbouring shallow lakes is determined largely by the presence or absence of macrophytes.

J	Yang, TB; Liao, XG				Yang, TB; Liao, XG			Seasonal population dynamics of Neoechinorhynchus qinghaiensis in the carp, Gymnocypris przewalskii prezewalskii, from Qinghai Lake, China	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY												Studies on the seasonal population dynamics of Neoechinorhynchus qinghaiensis (Acanthocephala: Neoechinorhynchidae) in its fish host Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii in the Qinghai Lake, China, were carried out with samples taken in May 1991, August 1992, November 1992 and February 1993. Prevalences were higher than 44% in all seasons. The mean intensity of infection was above 124 worms per fish. The maximum intensity of worms recovered from a single fish was 1402 in the autumn of 1992. Differences in the mean abundance, mean intensity and prevalence are not statistically significant relative to season and this is likely to be related to the stable temperatures recorded at the bottom of Qinghai Lake. Over-dispersed distributions of N. qinghaiensis in the host population, due to heterogeneity and feeding habits, were observed in all seasons. The size composition of both sexes of N. qinghaiensis showed males to be less than 3.5 mm and females between 0.5 and 4.25 mm, with the main recruitment phase in the worm populations occurring in the autumn, extending through winter and spring with the lowest recruitment occurring in the summer. The maturation and copulation of worms were mainly focused in the summer season. The sex ratio of female to male was both high in winter (1.51:1) and spring (1.48:1). The higher proportion of females and the change in the worm sex ratio in winter can be attributed to the reduced longevity of male worms. As immature male worms exhibit a higher proportion of the worm population than females in all seasons, further studies are needed to determine if such a situation compensates for the shorter life span of males.

SEASONAL AND VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES	OIKOS												The zooplankton of Osbysjon was studied from 1957-1959, with quantitative samples being taken for a year (autumn of 1957 to autumn of 1958). An annotated list of the protozoans, rotifers, cladocerans, copepods and Acarina is given. There is a great oxygen deficit during the winter, and at that time the zooplankton is reduced radically, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In spring, when the water again is oxygenated, various species of rotifers and crustaceans appear one by one, reach a peak, then decline. The distribution of species between summer and winter is discussed briefly, and comparisons are made with the rotifers previously reported in Lake Glan by Carlin (1943), the only previous thorough Scandinavian study. Core samples from the bottom were examined. Bosmina longirostris has occurred in Osbysjon since it was isolated from the Baltic.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1961	12	2					225	+		10.2307/3564698	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3564698													WOS:A19619539B00005

Rapid decline of the geographically restricted and globally threatened Eastern Palearctic Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus	WILDFOWL												The Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, which breeds across northern Eurasia from Norway to Chukotka, is globally threatened and is currently classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Eastern Palearctic population of the species was thought to breed in arctic Russia, from east of the Taimyr Peninsula to Chukotka, and to winter in East Asia, but its precise status, abundance, breeding and wintering ranges, and migration routes were largely unknown, reducing the effectiveness of conservation efforts. In this paper, we combined results from satellite tracking, field surveys, a literature review and expert knowledge, to present an updated overview of the winter distribution and abundance of Lesser White-fronted Geese in the Eastern Palearctic, highlighting their migration corridors, habitat use and the conservation status of the key sites used throughout the annual cycle. Improved count coverage puts the Eastern Palearctic Lesser White-fronted Geese population at c. 6,800 birds in 2020, which represents a rapid and worrying decline since the estimate of 16,000 in 2015, as it suggests at least a halving of numbers in just five years. East Dongting Lake (Hunan Province) in China is the most important wintering site for the species in East Asia, followed by Poyang Lake (Jiangxi Province) and Caizi Lake (Anhui Province), with one key wintering site in Miyagi County in Japan. Satellite tracking showed that eight individuals captured during summer on the Rauchua River, Chukotka, Russia wintered in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River floodplain in China. Their migration speed was slower in spring than in autumn, mainly because of longer stopover duration at staging sites in spring. The tracked geese mainly used cultivated land on migration stopovers (52% in spring; 45% in autumn), tundra habitat in summer (63%), and wetlands (66%) in winter. Overall, 87% of the GPS fixes were in protected areas during the winter, far greater than in spring (37%), autumn (28%) and summer (7%). We urge more tracking of birds of differing wintering and breeding provenance to provide a fuller understanding of the migration routes, staging sites and breeding areas used by the geese, including for the birds wintering in Japan. The most urgent requirement is to enhance effective conservation and long-term monitoring of Lesser White-fronted Geese across sites within China, and particularly to improve our understanding of the management actions needed to maintain the species. Collaboration between East Asian countries also is essential, to coordinate monitoring and to formulate effective protection measures for safeguarding this population in the future.					; 郑, 博福/JAX-5796-2023; Vartanyan, Sergey/T-4182-2017; Davaasuren, Batmunkh/HGB-1791-2022; Solovyeva, Diana/J-7302-2012	Davaasuren, Batmunkh/0000-0002-8496-1508; Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; 													0954-6324	2052-6458					2020					6		206	243																WOS:000611498400009

The distribution of Ca, Fe, S and Si in pale and dark laminae is established by energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis. The pale laminae consist primarily of CaCo3 and the dark layers contain mainly Fe, S, Si and dark organic material. The diatom composition of 16 individual light and dark laminae shows no consistent differences between light and dark layers. There are, however, higher frequencies of chrysophycean cysts in 7 of the 8 dark layers, suggesting these layers were deposited in late summer or fall. Pollen analyses of the pale and dark layers show that pollen percentages of early-flowering trees and shrubs are highest in the dark laminae and that pollen values of late-flowering plants are highest in the pale layers. The biological data indicate that the pale layers were formed in the late spring and early summer, whereas the dark laminae were deposited in late summer, fall, winter and the early spring. Seasonal supply of CaCO3 was the major variable responsible for couplet formation.					Birks, H. John B./C-3103-2008; Birks, John/C-3103-2008	Birks, H.

PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												Little is known of the normal seasonal variation in redox state and biotransformation activities in birds. In long-distance migratory birds, in particular, seasonal changes could be expected to occur because of the demands of migration and reproduction. In this study, we measured several redox parameters in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica L.) during the annual cycle. We captured the wintering barn swallows before spring migration in South Africa, and we captured the barn swallows that arrived in spring, bred in summer, and migrated in autumn in Finland. The redox status and biotransformation activities of barn swallows varied seasonally. Wintering birds in South Africa had high biotransformation activities and appeared to experience oxidative stress, whereas in spring and summer, they showed relatively low redox ( superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], and glutathione reductase [GR]) and biotransformation enzyme activities. Autumn birds had very low biotransformation enzyme activities and low indication of oxidative stress but high activity of some redox enzymes (GR and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PDH]). High activities of some redox enzymes ( SOD, GR, and G6PDH) seem to be related to migration, whereas low activities of some redox enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GR) may be associated with breeding. Barn swallows in South Africa may experience pollution-related oxidative stress, which may hamper interpretation of normal seasonal variation in redox parameters.

Plant growth was measured over periods of 44-47 days in spring, summer and autumn. Highest relative growth rates (RGR) were recorded in summer (maximum 40 mg g-1 day-1). Egeria propagules growing from a depth of 1.85 m showed positive growth responses at SS levels up to approximately 2 5 g m-3 (K(d) almost-equal-to 1. 7 5 ) in spring and autumn, and approximately 3 5 g M-3 (K(d) almost-equal-to 1.95) in summer. At SS levels up to 15 g m-3 (K(d) = 1.5 m-1), growth was little affected during summer, while during spring and autumn biomass accumulation was reduced to about 60% and RGR values to about 70% of the maximum seasonal values recorded. Egeria shoots showed maximum elongation at about 10-20 g m-3 SS (K(d) = 1.3-1.65). Plant architecture became less branched with increasing SS and the number of roots produced decreased. Implications for the establishment of Egeria in turbid waters are discussed.					; Tanner, Chris/A-4004-2010	Tanner, Chris C./0000-0001-9343-5190; 													0304-3770	1879-1522				JUN	1993	45	4					299	310		10.1016/0304-3770(93)90030-Z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(93)90030-Z													WOS:A1993LJ35800003

However, changes in some variables (e.g., climatic) can be difficult to identify from short-term monitoring (e.g., less than one year). Here, we present the study of the chrysophyte cyst assemblages from sediment traps deployed during two consecutive years (November 2011-November 2013) in 14 lakes from Northern Poland. The studied lakes are distributed along a W-E climatological gradient, with very different physical, chemical and morphological characteristics, and land-uses. Field surveys were carried out to recover the sediment trap material during autumn, along with the measurement of several environmental variables (nutrients, major water ions, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a). During the study, one year experienced mild seasonal changes in air temperature (November 2011-November 2012; TS1), typical of oceanic climate, while the other year was characterized by colder winter and spring (November 2012-November 2013; TS2), and higher summer temperatures, more characteristic of continental climate. Other environmental variables (e.g., nutrients) did not show great changes between both years. Multivariate statistical analyses (RDA and DCA) were performed on individual TS1 and TS2 datasets. Water chemistry and nutrients (pH, TN and TP) explained the largest portion of the variance of the chrysophyte data for the individual years. However, analyses of the combined TS1 and TS2 datasets show that strong changes between summer and autumn (warm period, ice-free period with thermal stratification) and winter and spring (cold period, ice-cover period) play the most important role in the inter-annual variability in the chrysophyte assemblages. We show how inter-annual sampling maximizes ecological gradients of interest, particularly in regions with large environmental diversity, and low climatic variability. This methodology could help to identify distinct seasonal and inter-annual changes of biological communities to improve its application in paleoclimate studies.

Strong seasonal effects of waterbirds on benthic communities in shallow lakes	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Little is known about the effects of waterbirds on benthic macroinvertebrates in nontidal habitats. We conducted 4 waterbird-exclusion experiments in a transformed marshland in Donana Natural Park (southwestern Spain) and compared benthic macroinvertebrates in 3 x 3-m control (no exclusion) and test plots from which Greater Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber or all waterbirds were excluded. The 4 experimental periods coincided with the waterbird breeding season (summer), postbreeding period (autumn), wintering period (winter), and pre- and early breeding season (spring). Densities of waterbirds were relatively low compared to densities reported in other studies, but we found strong effects of excluding flamingos and waterfowl on the structure of the benthic community in autumn, winter, and spring. In winter, numbers of polychaetes and chironomids were nearly 2x higher in exclusion than in control plots. The difference in macroinvertebrate biomass among treatments was strongest in winter when benthic dry mass was similar to 2x higher in flamingo exclosures than in control plots and similar to 2x higher in all-bird exclosures than in flamingo exclosures. Macroinvertebrate richness was 15% lower in control than in all-bird exclosures in winter and 25% lower in control than in all-bird exclosures in spring. Our results suggest that benthic macroinvertebrate communities in this wetland are affected more by predation, bioturbation, and waterbird herbivory than by competition. These findings suggest that waterfowl and the increasing population of flamingos are of great importance in structuring shallow lakes in the Mediterranean region.

Carlson-type trophic state indexes (TSI), including the trophic index of total phosphorus (TSITP), total nitrogen (TSITN), chlorophyll a (TSICHL,), and Secchi depth (TSISD), were used to assess trophic status of TGR. Based on TSICHL, trophic status of the mainstream was oligotrophic in the four seasons; however most of tributary bays were in eutrophic status in spring and summer and oligotrophic states in autumn and winter. Judging from TSISD, the mainstream and tributary bays were in the status of mesotrophication in winter, but hypertrophication or eutrophication in the other seasons, TSITP showed that the mainstream was in the eutrophic or hypertrophic status; the tributary bays were in the eutrophic status in spring and summer, but in the mesotrophic status in autumn and winter. TSITN revealed that mainstream and tributary bays were characterized as eutrophic status in the four seasons. Using Carlson's two-dimensional graphical approach, the deviations of TSISD, TSITP and TSITN from TSICHL, indicated that algal growth in the mainstream of TGR was limited by light other than nutrient in all year. For the tributary bays of TGR, light might be the factor limiting algal growth in autumn and winter.

In addition, Basin characteristic had a significant influence on the trophic status and limiting factors in TGR.

Parameters such as temperature, conductivity, turbidity salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, chlorophyll-a and nutrients were evaluated monthly in four transects and different depths (0, 5, 10, 20, 35 and 50 m), using multiple regression and grey relational analysis. Additionally, the long-term data (1994-2009) on the seasonal phytoplanktonic variation were included in our discussion. There was a good agreement between the observed and predicted values in the models that included the interaction effects during spring, summer, autumn and winter, with the adjusted R (2) of 0.64, 0.63, 0.60 and 0.54, respectively. Temperature and its interactions were found to be the most important factor on chlorophyll-a throughout the year. Overall, the most effective factors were seasonally categorized as: organic phosphorus, ammonium and their interactions (spring); organic phosphorus, nitrate, DO, silica and their interactions (summer); organic phosphorus, pH, DO and their interactions (autumn); pH, ammonium, DO and their interactions (winter). Thermocline, riverine transport, nitrification and the presence of Mnemiopsis leidyi and Cyanophyta were found to be the most important phenomena affecting the dynamics of nutrients and phytoplanktonic biomass in the area. In the distribution of chlorophyll-a, the interaction effects of different environmental parameters proved to be more important than their individual effects. The multiple regression and grey analyses were also found to be useful tools to understand the interactions between phytoplankton and environmental factors.

Sexually mature green sturgeon were captured with gillnets in the spring, as adults migrated upstream to spawn. In total, 49 green sturgeon were tagged with radio and/or sonic telemetry tags and tracked manually or with receiver arrays from 2002 to 2004. Tagged individuals exhibited four movement patterns: upstream spawning migration, spring outmigration to the ocean, or summer holding, and outmigration after summer holding. Spawning migrations occurred from April to June, as adults moved from the ocean upstream to spawning sites. Approximately 18% of adults, those not out mignation in the spring, made spring post-spawning outmigrations. The majority of adults, those not outmigrating in the spring, remained in discrete locations characterized as deep, low velocity pools for extended periods during the summer and early fall. Fall outmigration occurred when fish left summer holding locations, traveled rapidly downstream, and exited the river system. High river discharge due to the onset of winter rainstorms and freshets appear to be the key environmental cue instigating the fall outmigration.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUL-AUG	2007	79	3-4					269	279		10.1007/s10641-006-9023-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9023-6													WOS:000248757300008

Part V: Impacts on lake-effect precipitation	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												It is known that lake-effect snowstorms in the Great Lakes region depend on the synoptic-scale flow conditions. These conditions are determined in part by the synoptic-scale features that traverse the area. Forecasting the development of these storms has improved dramatically in the last decade. A remaining complicating aspect. however, is that the heating and moistening from all the Great Lakes (eg, the aggregate) affects the large-scale winds, temperature, moisture, and stability near the individual lakes, which in turn affect the characteristics of the lake-effect storms that develop. The effects of the Great Lakes aggregate on lake-effect precipitation is examined for a particular case in November 1982 that was characterized by a cold air outbreak followed by the approach of a weak trough into the region. Existing model output from numerical simulations that 1) included all of the lakes and that 2) excluded all of the lakes is used in conjunction with output from two additional numerical simulations that were performed and that include 3) only Lake Michigan and 4) only Lakes Erie and Ontario. The intercomparison of output from these simulations indicates that the lake aggregate enhanced lake-effect precipitation in northern lower Michigan and in southern Ontario but diminished lake-effect precipitation in regions south and east of Lakes Erie and Ontario. The effects were the result of combined changes in wind, temperature, moisture, and stability, which likely altered the morphology, intensity, locations, and orientations of the convective bands. These results indicate that understanding more completely how and when lake aggregate-scale circulations develop can enhance 1-2-day lake-effect and regional-scale precipitation forecasts, More importantly, these results suggest that aggregate-scale circulations that develop from clusters of heat sources or sinks can impact significantly the local precipitation distribution adjacent to a particular heat source or sink.

Seasonal maximum ice cover for the combined area of the Great Lakes was the lowest on record (15%) relative to winters since 1963, a distinction formerly held by winter 1982/83 (25%), which was also an exceptionally strong El Nino winter. Maximum ice covers set new lows in winter 1997/98 for Lakes Erie (5%), Ontario (6%), and Superior (11%), tied the all-time low for Lake Huron (29%), and came close to tying the all-time low on Lake Michigan (15%; all-time low is 13%). Here the authors compare seasonal progression of lake-averaged ice cover for winter 1982/83, winter 1997/98, and a 20-winter normal (1960-79) derived from the NOAA Great Lakes Ice Atlas and discuss the 1997/98 ice cover in detail. Winter air temperatures in the Great Lakes were at or near record high levels, storms were displaced farther to the south over eastern North America, and precipitation was below average in the northern portion of the Great Lakes region. The Northern Hemispheric synoptic flow patterns responsible for this winter weather, the Great Lakes winter severity over the past two centuries, and impacts of this mild winter are briefly discussed.																			0003-0007					APR	2000	81	4					703	717		10.1175/1520-0477(2000)081<0703:LGLIAW>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477(2000)081<0703:LGLIAW>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000086262400003

The results show that the concentration of TSS is the most important factor impacting PAR attenuation, followed by chlorophyll a; chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has little impact on the PAR euphotic depth. During 1993-2003, the mean yearly PAR euphotic depths of the typical lake regions ranged from 1.04 to 1.95 m with a mean value of 1.35+/-0.23 m. The PAR euphotic depth fell into 3 spatial zone types: Type I, the lowest, including the lake center and the inflows of rivers; Type II, intermediate, including Meiliang Bay, Wulihu Lake and Gonghu Bay; Type III, the greatest, including the East Lake Taihu; corresponding mean depths were approximately 1.1, 1.4, 2.0 m, respectively. The seasonal variations of euphotic depths were not quite the same in different lake regions. In the lake center, the mean values of PAR euphotic depth in summer and autumn were significantly greater than those in winter and spring; in the Meiliang Bay, winter means were significantly greater than in the other three seasons; in the East Lake Taihu, winter means were significantly less than in the other three seasons. However, no distinct seasonal change was recorded in the Wulihu Lake, Gonghu Bay and the inflows of rivers. The spectral distributions of euphotic depth present a minimal value at the blue light wave band of 400 nm, and a peak at the green light wave band of around 580 nm. In 1998 and 1999, based on the seasonal many-day continuous measurements, the PAR euphotic depths at station 2 were recorded 2.00+/-0.21, 2.52+/-0.45, 1.58+/-0.24, 2.00+/-0.15 m in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. The peak value of 440 nm absorbed by phytoplankton corresponded to a euphotic depth of only 0.81-1.47 m (mean 1.07+/-0.29 m), which was much lower than the mean PAR euphotic depth of 1.98+/-0.41 m.

Twice a month, sampling was carried out from the whole water column. Phytoplankton species composition showed seasonal dynamics following the general environmental variable trends in the study area, with variation in species abundance levels within each season characterised by the presence of different phytoplankton communities. Analysis of environmental variables indicated that phytoplankton-dominant communities were associated with various water physicochemical characteristics, especially water temperature and salinity. Accordingly, significant correlation was recorded between water temperature and dinoflagellates (r = 0.35; p < 0.05) in summer and diatoms (r = 0.69; p < 0.05) in autumn, whereas euglenophytes, cyanophytes and chlorophytes were slightly correlated with temperature in autumn. Salinity was positively correlated with dichtyophytes (r = 0.41; p < 0.05) in winter and with diatoms (r = 0.65; p < 0.05) and euglenophytes (r = 0.57; p < 0.05) in autumn. On the other hand, relationships between high nitrogen nutrient concentration and phytoplankton concentration were recorded for diatoms (r = 0.43; p < 0.05 with NO2; r = 0.49; p < 0.05 with NO3) in winter. Silicate concentration supported proliferation of diatoms (r = 0.58; p < 0.05) in autumn in our study period. In contrast, increase of dinoflagellate concentration was associated with the decrease of these parameters in spring and summer.

Total abundance was highest in summer following late winter/early spring phytoplankton blooms. At this time, metazooplankton consisted mostly of the copepod, Apocyclops dengizicus, and the rotifer, Brachionus rotundiformis. In August or September, severe crashes in the metazooplankton populations occurred each year in mid-lake due to strong wind events which increased mixing and caused low oxygen and high sulfide concentrations throughout the water column. Larvae of the polychaete worm, Neanthes succinea and the barnacle, Balanus amphitrite were present mostly in late winter and spring. Their scarcity in summer is due in part to persistent anoxic bottom conditions that decrease adult populations and in part to predation by tilapia, an omnivorous fish that has become abundant in the lake since the 1960s. Two Synchaeta species, rotifers not previously reported from the Sea, were abundant in winter and spring and predation on these may have permitted the copepod to persist at low levels through the winter. There were two major changes in metazooplankton dynamics since 1954-1956 in addition to the appearance of the two synchaetid rotifers in the fauna. First, there are now much lower densities of barnacle and polychaete larvae in the fall, probably due to the invasion of the zooplanktivorous fish, tilapia. Second the precipitous crashes now seen in metazooplankton densities, especially the copepod, in late summer-early fall did not occur in the 1950s possibly because fall overturn events did not result in such high sulfide levels.

J	Vöge, M				Voge, Margrit			The reproductive phenology of Isoetes lacustris L.:: Results of field studies in Scandinavian lakes	LIMNOLOGICA												The phenologic change of the leaf rosette structure of Isoetes lacustris L. was studied in 26 lakes of temperate, boreal, or subarctic Scandinavia between 59 degrees and 70 degrees n.l. The investigations were carried out during six defined seasons: late winter, spring, early summer, late summer, autumn, and early winter. From 640 plants, gained with the aid of SCUBA, six leaf types were distinguished: immature megasporophylls, mature megasporophylls, immature microsporophylls, mature microsporophylls, and sporophylls that had released their spores and leaves with undeveloped sporangia. Mean numbers per rosette of each leaf type were established in each study lake and study season, resulting in a common pattern embracing all lakes studied. Megasporophylls are developed throughout the year, whenever the water temperature is about 10 degrees C. Their share was always more than 30%, excepting winter. Microsporophylls are produced preferentially in spring/early summer when the days are longest; they amount to more than 50% of the rosette leaves during this period, but only to some 10% in the remaining seasons. The spores mature and are released between late summer and early winter. It is concluded that not all spores mature in the year of their birth, and those that do not mature are released in the early summer of the following year, as well as the old empty leaves become detached.

J	Barthold, FE; Kristovich, DAR				Barthold, Faye E.; Kristovich, David A. R.			Observations of the Cross-Lake Cloud and Snow Evolution in a Lake-Effect Snow Event	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												While the total snowfall produced in lake-effect storms can be considerable, little is known about how clouds and snow evolve within lake-effect boundary layers. Data collected over Lake Michigan on 10 January 1998 during the Lake-Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) are analyzed to better understand and quantify the evolution of clouds and snow. On this date, relatively cold air flowed from west to east across Lake Michigan, creating a quasi-steady-state boundary layer that increased from approximate to 675 to approximate to 910 m in depth over a distance of 80 km. Once a cloud deck formed 14-18 km from the upwind shoreline, maximum cloud particle concentrations and liquid water content increased from west to east across the lake. Correspondingly, maximum ice water contents, snowfall rates, and maximum snow particle diameters also increased across the lake. Maximum particle concentrations were found below the mean top of the boundary layer and above the cloud base for both cloud and snow particles. Surprisingly, snow particles were observed 3-7 km upwind of the upwind edge of the lake-effect cloud deck. These snow particles were observed to be rather spatially uniform throughout the boundary layer. Based on available observations, it is hypothesized that of the mechanisms that could produce this snow, the majority of it originated from transient clouds located near the upwind shore. In addition, maximum snow particle concentrations peaked near the middle of the lake before decreasing toward the downwind shore, indicating the location after which aggregation became an important snow growth mechanism. These results show that the evolution of clouds and snow within lake-effect boundary layers may not occur in the uniform manner often depicted in conceptual models.

J	SOUSOUNIS, PJ				SOUSOUNIS, PJ			A NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF WIND-SPEED EFFECTS ON LAKE-EFFECT STORMS	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												Observations of lake-effect storms that occur over the Great Lakes region during late autumn and winter indicate a high sensitivity to ambient wind speed and direction. In this paper, a two-dimensional version of the Penn State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU/NCAR) model is used to investigate the wind speed effects on lake-effect snowstorms that occur over the Great Lakes region. Theoretical initial conditions for stability, relative humidity, wind velocity, and lake/land temperature distribution are specified. Nine different experiments are performed using wind speeds of U = 0, 2, 4,..., 16 m s-1. The perturbation wind, temperature, and moisture fields for each experiment after 36 h of simulation are compared. It is determined that moderate (4-6 m s-1) wind speeds result in maximum precipitation (snowfall) on the lee shore of the model lake. Weak wind speeds (0 less-than-or-equal-to U < 4 m s-1) yield significantly higher snowfall amounts over the lake along with a spatially concentrated and intense response. Strong wind speeds (6 < U less-than-or-equal-to 16 m s-1) yield very little, if any, significant snowfall, although significant increases in cloudiness, temperature, and perturbation wind speed occur hundreds of kilometers downwind from the lake.																			0006-8314					APR	1993	64	3					261	290		10.1007/BF00708966	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00708966													WOS:A1993LH81300003
J	Pla-Rabes, S; Catalan, J				Pla-Rabes, Sergi; Catalan, Jordi			Deciphering chrysophyte responses to climate seasonality	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Climate change involves alterations in seasonality as well as shifts in mean annual temperature. Cold temperate lakes show strong seasonality, with winter ice cover and alternating mixing and stratification periods during the ice-free season. These physical changes are ultimately related to seasonal weather variation and also drive annual phytoplankton succession. Therefore, phytoplankton remains in lake sediment records are potentially useful for reconstructing past seasonal climate signals. With the exception of investigations on varved sediments, however, little research has been carried out on the subject. Here we present two lines of evidence demonstrating that chrysophyte stomatocysts can be useful for inferring past climatic seasonality. First, we show that marked seasonal stomatocyst replacement is related to periods of the main physical processes in the lake. Second, using instrumental climate data and microfossils in sediment cores, we show that two main components of stomatocyst variability over the last similar to 150 years are related to seasonal fluctuations. The first of these components is related to stomatocysts present during summer stratification that respond to general warming trends, particularly in July and August. The second component relates to stomatocysts typically present in the spring and autumn mixing periods. Numbers of these two stomatocyst types vary inversely in response to variation in spring (April-May) temperatures. The number of stomatocyst types affected by spring temperatures is much greater than those related to summer temperatures. We provide evidence that chrysophyte stomatocysts are an excellent proxy for spring air temperature reconstructions, with little influence from summer or general annual trends. We also show that with relatively little effort, it is possible to categorise the chrysophyte stomatocyst assemblage of a lake to carry out detailed investigation of the record of seasonal changes preserved within the sediment.

Although the 1st yr of study covered a period of severe drought involving the lowest water levels in 10 yr and the lake was at or near capacity during the 2nd yr, the general limnology was similar each year. The lake typically stratifies in early spring and surface temperatures reach about 22.degree. C by mid-summer. Complete mixing occurs by Sept. Anoxia develops in the hypolimnion during stratification, increasing internal nutrient loading from sediments. The annual phytoplankton cycle peaks in the spring and late summer. Diatoms dominate in early spring, green algae briefly dominates in early summer and blue-green algae dominates from mid-summer to fall. In 1977, Anabaena and Chroococcus were the most abundant algal genera. In 1978, Anabaena dominated the early summer community, but Aphanizomenon flos-aquae dominated from late summer to fall. Algal growth appears to be limited by P from winter to spring, while N is limiting in the fall. P and N loads from tributaries draining the urbanized southeast portion of the drainage are disproportionately high. Nutrient loading rates are excessive, and well into the eutrophic range. Trophic status was similar in both years. Big Bear Lake will likely remain eutrophic because of its shallow morphology, high nutrient content and basin orientation and development.																			0008-1078	2331-0405					1982	68	2					90	108																WOS:A1982PT32900003
J	Akin, S; Winemiller, KO; Gelwick, FP				Akin, S; Winemiller, KO; Gelwick, FP			Seasonal and spatial variations in fish and macrocrustacean assemblage structure in Mad Island Marsh estuary, Texas	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Fish and macrocrustacean assemblage structure was analyzed along an estuarine gradient at Mad Island Marsh (MIM), Matagorda Bay, TX, during March 1998-August 1999. Eight estuarine-dependent fish species accounted for 94% of the individual fishes collected, and three species accounted for 96% of macrocrustacean abundance. Consistent with evidence from other Gulf of Mexico estuarine studies, species richness and abundance were highest during late spring and summer, and lowest during winter and early spring. Sites near the bay supported the most individuals and species. Associations between fish abundance and environmental variables were examined with canonical correspondence analysis. The dominant gradient was associated with water depth and distance from the bay. The secondary gradient reflected seasonal variation and was associated with temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and vegetation cover. At the scales examined, estuarine biota responded to seasonal variation more than spatial variation. Estuarine-dependent species dominated the fauna and were common throughout the open waters of the shallow lake during winter-early spring when water temperature and salinity were low and dissolved oxygen high. During summer-early fall, sub-optimal environmental conditions (high temperature, low DO) in upper reaches accounted for strong spatial variation in assemblage composition. Small estuarine-resident fishes and the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) were common in warm, shallow, vegetated inland sites during summer-fall. Estuarine-dependent species were common at deeper, more saline locations near the bay during this period. During summer, freshwater species, such as gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and gars (Lepisosteus spp.), were positively associated with water depth and proximity to the bay. The distribution and abundance of fishes in MIM appear to result from the combined effects of endogenous, seasonal patterns of reproduction and migration operating on large spatial scales, and species-specific response to local environmental variation.

J	NEWBURY, RW; BEATY, KG				NEWBURY, RW; BEATY, KG			WATER RENEWAL EFFICIENCY OF WATERSHED AND LAKE COMBINATIONS IN THE ELA REGION OF THE PRECAMBRIAN SHIELD	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Individual components of lakewater budgets in the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) are highly variable through time. Direct field measurements combined with empirical relationships for unmeasurable components are required to achieve balanced lakewater budgets over short intervals of several hours or days. Annual variations in the hydrological regime are related to a few simple characteristics of the lake and surrounding watershed. In the 1969-1977 period the annual ratios of terrestrial evapotranspiration/precipitation and lake evaporation/precipitation showed little variation and were of a similar magnitude. As a result, the potential for water renewal or replacement in the lake basins annually can be characterized by only 4 factors: the annual precipitation, the tributary drainage basin area, the lake area and the lake volume. The potential was expressed as the Annual Watershed Efficiency (AWE), the reciprocal of the water renewal time, to obtain a linear relationships between the 4 variables. The AWE is a measure of the extent to which a particular watershed and lake combination can renew the lake water under various annual precipitation conditions. A general graphical relationship for the AWE was prepared for small headwater lakes similar to those of the ELA for a range of annual precipitations.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	3					335	341		10.1139/f80-047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-047													WOS:A1980JJ97200004

Iceland, and in a birch forest close to the lake Myvatn, N. Iceland. The population at Vik was studied on a 1.10 ha grid on a slope covered with Angelica archangelica L., the seeds of which constituted a major food resource for the mice. Altogether 948 individuals were caught, marked and followed during 1973-1978. No other free-living small mammals occur in Iceland, and predator pressure is low and considered non-existent on the Angelica slope. The population density was extremely high; highest autumn density recorded was 150 ind .cntdot. ha-1. Like other Apodermus populations, the one at Vik showed a typical seasonal pattern in numbers: a winter decrease, relatively stable numbers in late summer, and an autumn peak. Breeding started in late April or early May and ended in late September; no winter breeding was observed. Three or four litters were produced, and the last litter(s) of the season greatly contributed to the autumn increase. The output of young per reproductive female throughout the year was negatively correlated with spring density, and autumn peak density with the number of females in August. Also overwinter success and weight changes appeared to be associated with population density (and weather). Survival rates did not vary much between years and seasons and were consistently rather high. Autumn survival of juveniles was positively correlated with mean minimum temperatures. Juvenile survival was, at least at times, negatively affected by the presence of adult males. Trapping outside the main grid did not indicate any marked dispersal, though some immigration to the grid must have occurred, especially in spring and early summer. Among the factors governing the population density and dynamics of wood mouse at Vik we emphasize the absence of interspecific competition and predation, the rich and dependable food resources (mainly Angelica seeds), the mild (though moist and windy) climate, the shelter of dense Angelica stands, the abundance of crevices (e.g. nest-sites), and the social interactions. The birch forest in northern Iceland was low productive and the wood mouse population differed from the Vik population by exhibiting low density, short breeding season, and high vagility; characteristics we consider to be representative for most apodemus populations in Iceland.																			0105-9327					DEC	1989	12	4					351	368																WOS:A1989CJ06000003

Gas from sediments of Vallisneria beds had the highest methane concentrations (about 60-90% v/v); methane concentrations in gas from sediments of Myriophyllum beds were the lowest (falling to 17 +/- 3% v/v in May 1994), and concentrations in sediments of Eleocharis beds varied from about 25% v/v in winter to about 60-82% v/v in summer-autumn. Total water-atmosphere methane fluxes, measured with 0.8 m(3) static chambers, varied from <0.01 to 2.75 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in Eleocharis beds, <0.01 to 0.95 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in Myriophyllum beds, and <0.01 to 1.64 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in areas of open water colonised by Vallisneria. Total fluxes were highly seasonal, being greatest in summer-autumn, when sediment temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C. Strong diurnal and diel variations were also observed, especially in Eleocharis beds during the warmer months. Ebullition rates varied from <0.05 to 1.61 mmol m(-2) h(-1) and, like total water-atmosphere fluxes, fluctuated according to season, being lowest in winter and highest in summer-autumn. Ebullition seemingly accounted for 6-15% of total methane fluxes from Eleocharis beds in the cooler months, and 30-90% in the warmer months. Eleocharis shoots could generate pressures of up to 550 Pa during summer days, and the seasonal pattern to plant pressurization matched closely the seasonality of total methane emissions from Eleocharis beds. Manipulative experiments provided additional evidence that emergent shoots of Eleocharis were a significant pathway for methane transport from the benthos to the atmosphere, because cutting sheets below the water decreased emissions.

There was a general inverse relationship between lorica length and temperature, but the annual cycle of change depended upon the rate of change of the temperature, and there was considerable variation between years. There was a similar inverse relationship between posterior spine length and temperature, and a shift in both relationships depending on whether the temperature was increasing or decreasing. As the water temperature increased from winter to summer the lorica and posterior spine were longer than at the same temperature as the water cooled from summer to winter. This shift call be modified by anomalous temperatures, such as a late spring or a cool summer. The form lacking a posterior spine usually, but not consistently, had a longer lorica than the typical spined forms. It usually disappeared from the samples at the end of November and did not reappear until March, although with a mild autumn and winter it persisted until January before disappearing. Forms without posterior spines did not all have the same origins.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 1	2005	546						189	196		10.1007/s10750-005-4121-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4121-6													WOS:000233117900019

Peaks in prevalence and abundance were observed during early summer and autumn. Similar patterns were reported by others for the years 1980-1982. However, the maximum prevalence observed in 1984-1986 (75%) was lower than seen in the earlier studies (90-95%). Abundance rarely surpassed 5 worms per fish in 1984-1986, whereas in 1980-1982 it often exceeded 6 and reached as high as 8. Maximum prevalence and abundance in 1984-1986 occurred during summer, as opposed to 1980-1982 when maximum values were recorded in the fall. Cyclopoid copepods serve as intermediate hosts for B. acheilognathi. In Belews Lake, the predominant cyclopoids are Diacyclops thomasi, Mesocyclops edax, and Tropocyclops prasinus, all of which have been shown to serve as intermediate hosts in laboratory infections. The slight alterations in the seasonal dynamics of B. acheilognathi are attributed to changes in the population structure of the cyclopoid copepod community. All 3 cyclopoid species were present in late spring-early summer in comparatively high densities; whereas, only T. prasinus was abundant in the autumn. This contrasts with older zooplankton studies, which demonstrated that D. thomasi previously was abundant also in the autumn.

The data set represented a broad range of color and trophic state. The percent saturation of dissolved oxygen remained relatively constant during the fall (mean 78.4%), winter (mean 81.3%), and spring (mean 82.5%), but declined markedly during summer (mean 65.2%). Chlorophyll a concentrations were highest during the winter (mean 2.52 mg m(-3)) and lowest during the fall (mean 1.17 mg m(-3)), while color peaked during the fall (mean 30.1 mg Pt l(-1)) and was lowest during the summer (mean 12.7 mg Pt l(-1)). The relative importance of lake size, chlorophyll a, and color in explaining variation in percent oxygen saturation was examined using multiple regression. Percent oxygen saturation was negatively correlated with color during the winter, spring, and summer, and positively correlated with lake size in the winter and spring. However, percent oxygen saturation showed no relationship with chlorophyll a during any season. These results suggest that colored Florida lakes are naturally oxygen depleted and that profundal oxygen values have little relationship to lake trophic state.					; Chapman, Colin/S-1911-2019	Chapman, Colin/0000-0002-8827-8140; Crisman, Thomas L/0009-0002-2473-0510													0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	368						149	155		10.1023/A:1003289813849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003289813849													WOS:000076259700016

The 2 stocks of young (above and below waterfall) were reared in a hatchery under identical temperature, light and food conditions. Their directional response to water current was tested in a laboratory migration channel during their 1st summer and autumn, and the following spring. During tests in light, both stocks of young trout showed similar current responses, but in darkness the below falls stock showed much more downstream movement in the autumn than did the above falls stock. Below falls trout had a higher growth rate, were slightly heavier at the same length and matured earlier than the above falls stock. The adaptive significance of these differences are discussed in relation to maintenance of trout populations above waterfalls and to selective pressures faced by migratory below waterfall populations.																				1095-8649					1981	18	6					741	751		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb03815.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb03815.x													WOS:A1981LU16100012
J	Pereira, G; Muscato, M				Pereira, Gustavo; Muscato, Matthew			Multivariate Analysis of Lake-Effect Snowstorms in Western New York	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL METEOROLOGY												The Great Lakes region of the United States is subjected to a wintertime convective phenomenon known as lake-effect snow (LES). These events are capable of producing significant quantities of snow over localized areas by developing elongated bands that tap into heat and moisture exchanges between the warm lake surface and the overlying continental polar air. Several factors are believed to affect the snowfall intensity associated with LES events, including the ice coverage over the lake where the snowbands originate. Improvements in the quality of snowfall forecasts associated with these LES events require an approach that uses a larger number of events than used in previously investigated case studies. The intensity of 91 LES events was assessed using the total volume of snow (snow depth multiplied by snow coverage area) per day in western New York as reported by the National Weather Service in Buffalo, New York, from 1998-2011. These events were cross-referenced against the fetch, capping inversion height, thermodynamic instability, wind speed, and ice coverage over Lake Erie during each event. A multivariate regression revealed that only fetch, inversion height, and ice coverage were statistically significant in determining the intensity of the LES event, with ice coverage having the greatest impact. These parameters accounted for approximately 30% of the overall snowfall volume variability in our LES events. An examination of two events demonstrated that other environmental controls-such as orography and low-level moisture-may have affected the quality of the snowfall predicted by our regression.																			2325-6184					AUG 27	2013	1	14					157	167		10.15191/nwajom.2013.0114	http://dx.doi.org/10.15191/nwajom.2013.0114													WOS:000215972300001

The mechanism controlling the density and structure of the bank vole population and effects of exo- and endogenous factors on the animals' numbers were determined using a multiple-factor analysis. The intensity of reproduction in voles in spring and early summer, as well as their survival in autumn-winter, and total numbers were found to be mainly related to wintering conditions and the demographic situation that developed in the population in the autumn of the preceding year. In the breeding period reproduction and numbers of voles are determined mainly by intrapopulation factors. Other times, the population is controlled by external effects. Exogenous factors determine the high limit of optimal density of the population under given conditions, while endogenous mechanisms put the number of animals into accordance with the level corresponding to the conditions.																			0044-5134					AUG	2000	79	8					976	989																WOS:000165156600009

Significantly different levels of genetic polymorphism were found among populations. The coexistence of different electrophoretic clones and similar patterns of clonal seasonal succession have been observed in at least two different rice fields. The clone or group of clones present in fall, winter and early spring is substituted by other multilocus genotypes in late spring and summer. Different egg diapause induction mechanisms drive the clonal substitution in different clones. Here we report a new laboratory experiment designed to test the effect of temperature and photoperiod found in winter (12 degrees C 8:16 L:D), spring (24 degrees C 12:12 L:D) and summer (28 degrees C 16:8 L:D) conditions on the deposition and hatching of diapausal eggs in different multilocus genotypes.

S	Livingstone, DM; Kernan, M		Catalan, J; Curtis, CJ; Kernan, M		Livingstone, David M.; Kernan, Martin			Regional coherence and geographical variability in the surface water temperatures of Scottish Highland lochs	PATTERNS AND FACTORS OF BIOTA DISTRIBUTION IN REMOTE EUROPEAN MOUNTAIN LAKES	Advances in Limnology											In 25 lochs in the Grampians and Northwest Highlands of Scotland, miniature thermistors with integrated data loggers were employed in 2000 and 2001 to measure lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs). Results indicate that LSWTs fluctuate coherently in response to climatic forcing, and that additionally, they differ little in an absolute sense, implying that daily mean LSWTs can be upscaled easily. Regional coherence in LSWT is substantially higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring. LSWT decreases approximately linearly with increasing altitude above sea level during winter and spring, but not otherwise; this contrasts strongly with the results of studies in other mountain regions, which show the most pronounced linear decrease in LSWT with altitude to occur in summer. LSWT showed no dependence on latitude at any time of the year, but showed a significant dependence on longitude - which can be interpreted as distance from the maritime influence of the Atlantic - especially during autumn and spring. In summer, no consistent dependence of LSWT on either altitude, latitude or longitude was found, implying that any differences in LSWT that may exist among the lochs in summer are predominantly the result of lake-specific local effects. The duration of the period during which LSWT <= 4 degrees C depends on altitude and longitude, but not on latitude. The timing of the onset of this period in autumn occurs essentially simultaneously throughout northern Scotland, whereas the timing of the end of the period in spring becomes later with increasing altitude and increasing distance towards the east. This suggests that the duration of inverse stratification or circulation at temperatures less than the temperature of maximum density will tend to be less in low-lying lochs and/or lochs close to the Atlantic coastline than in high-altitude lochs and/or lochs located further from the Atlantic coast, and that this difference is entirely due to differences in climatic forcing that occur in spring.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47064-8				2009	62						367	378				10.1007/978-1-84882-229-0												WOS:000273782900016

Disappearance of planktonic colonies in autumn does not necessarily mean the end of the life cycle for cyanobacteria, and part of them sink down to the sediment. Frequency of dividing cells (FDC) of benthic M aeruginosa was measured under experimental hypolimnetic conditions in winter and in spring (darkness and temperature = 4 or 8degreesC) to show overwintering survival and difference between seasons. Enzymatic activity (viability) of benthic cyanobacteria was controlled in situ in winter and spring. Our study revealed that in winter (4degreesC), benthic colonies continued to divide, with low FDC (mean % = 13.49) and low enzymatic activity (mean ratio carboxyfluorescein diacetate [CFDA] fluorescence: autofluorescence = 1.27). In contrast, when temperature increased in spring (8degreesC), the viability values significantly increased (mean ratio = 3.78), and a rhythmic increase of FDC appeared every 8 h with maximum of ca. 27.5 %. This corresponds to an ultradian rhythm of division, which provides strong evidence that benthic cells were under the control of an endogenous component synchronized by an internal clock. Our results suggest that hypolimnetic temperature plays an important role in the return of the active form of M aeruginosa in spring.

J	Hembre, LK; Megard, RO				Hembre, Leif K.; Megard, Robert O.			Direct and indirect effects of predation on the genetic structure of a Daphnia population	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The effects of fish predation on zooplankton communities are well documented, but relatively little is known about how predation structures the genetic composition of individual populations. This study illustrates how a perturbation in the timing and strength of predation by rainbow trout directly and indirectly altered the genetic composition of a Daphnia pulicaria population in a Minnesota (USA) lake. Trout were stocked in autumn in the first 2 years of the study and in spring in the second 2 years. In autumn stocking years, predation was highest over winter and in spring but relatively low during summer stratification. In contrast, in spring stocking years, predation was low over winter and high during summer stratification. In all years, the Daphnia population became genetically differentiated with respect to depth, as summer stratification became more pronounced. In addition, allozyme analyses of trout stomach contents revealed selective predation on Daphnia in the metalimnion. In spring stocking years, when trout were abundant during the summer, this directly caused a shift in the dominant clone type from a metalimnetic to a hypolimnetic specialist. The fisheries manipulation indirectly affected the genetic composition of the Daphnia population by altering the importance of recruitment from diapausing embryos in the sediment (the egg bank). In autumn stocking years, when the over-wintering population was small, genotype frequencies in early summer indicated the recent emergence of sexually derived individuals from the egg bank. Conversely, in spring stocking years when over-wintering populations of Daphnia were large, no emergence events were detected.																			0142-7873					DEC	2006	28	12					1129	1141		10.1093/plankt/fbl043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbl043													WOS:000244840300002
J	Luo, J; Fox, BJ				Luo, J; Fox, BJ			Seasonal and successional dietary shifts of two sympatric rodents in coastal heathland: A possible mechanism for coexistence	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Using microscopic analysis of faecal pellets, we compared the seasonal and successional patterns of food resource use of two Australian native rodents, the eastern chestnut mouse (Pseudomys gracilicaudatus) and the swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus) in a coastal heathland at Myall Lakes National Park, New South Wales. Using the Mantel test, the diets of the two mammal species were significantly different in autumn and winter but not in spring and summer. Further, the two species showed differential use of resources at the young and middle-aged stages of vegetation succession following fire. The mean dietary overlaps for pairs of individuals between the two species were relatively high in all seasons and successional stages, but they were significantly lower than those for pairs of individuals within each, species in autumn and winter, and at the young and middle successional stages. Analysis of dietary niche position (gamma) and breadth (beta) showed lower gamma and larger beta for P. gracilicaudatus than for R. lutreolus, confirming previous observations that R. lutreolus is more specialized, and less opportunistic in diet than P. gracilicaudatus. Overall, the dietary separations of the two species were less marked in canonical space than they were for specific seasons and successional stages. These results, together with previous studies, indirectly suggest that while these two mammal species may be partitioning diet in autumn and winter in the middle stages, for spring and summer in the old successional stage they might need to partition habitats to facilitate their coexistence. Our results indicate that the local community is more dynamic and complex than previously thought and that other mechanisms of coexistence (e.g. temporal rotation of food resources) may be operating rather than traditional habitat and diet separation.

In winter, all three populations were more active offshore and during the day. During spring and summer-fall all were concentrated inshore, near the bottom, and were more active around dawn and dusk. Winter distributions appeared to be responses to abiotic conditions (ice cover and low oxygen availability); overall patterns during open-water periods appeared to be linked to prey availability (e.g., chironomid emergences). Although the three populations were generally similar, some aspects of habitat use differed between species, between lakes, or between dominant and subdominant populations, which the direction of differences varying seasonally. The yellow perch population was recovering from a size-selective winterkill and between spring and summer underwent an ontogenetic niche shift, first being competitors with mudminnows, then becoming predators on mudminnows. Mudminnows did not alter their vertical or diel activity patterns in the presence of these predatory perch. They did become more concentrated inshore in summer-fall, near structural refuge provided by the bog mat, and, unlike the other two populations, failed to shift their activities offshore at twilight. Our study suggested that a simple habitat in the study lakes contributed both to overall similarities in habitat use and strong interactions between co-occurring populations. However, the ecological flexibility demonstrated by mudminnows may prevent their total exclusion from lakes inhabited by perch and allow them to respond to changing biotic environments.

The influence of water temperature on occurrence and duration of a midsummer decline (MSD) of Daphnia galeata was studied in the biomanipulated Bautzen Reservoir in Germany. The proportion of piscivores in the fish community of the reservoir has been enhanced experimentally since 1981, As a consequence, Daphnia galeata has dominated the zooplankton. Over 18 years of study (1981-1998), a long-lasting MSD (longer than 30 days) occurred in 7 years, whereas a short MSD (shorter than 30 days) was observed in 6 years. During the remaining 5 years, an MSD was not observed. 2. Two hypotheses were examined to explain the observed patterns. First, we postulated that high water temperature during winter and early spring (January-April) leads to an MSD after an early and high spring peak of daphnids. On the other hand, low temperature during winter and early spring should not cause an MSD owing to a slower increase of the population, resulting in a later peak of daphnids. Second, we hypothesized that the mean water temperature during early summer (May and June) influences the occurrence of an MSD (by controlling young-of-the-year (YOY) fish predation on daphnids). 3. The water temperature during winter and early spring explains 83%, and the early summer water temperature 55%, of interannual variation in the occurrence of an MSD. 4. The interannual variation in duration of an MSD was neither explained by temperature during winter and early spring nor by early summer temperature alone, but in 14 of the 18 years (78%) by a combination of both. 5. We conclude that water temperature during winter and early spring had a strong impact on Daphnia mortality by influencing height and timing of the spring peak which, in turn, influenced the extent of overexploitation of their food resources. By contrast, the water temperature during early summer probably influenced the mortality of daphnids caused by predation of YOY fish. The relative timing of both sources of mortality, which depends on the temperature regime during the first 6 months of the year, is the key process in controlling the occurrence and duration of an MSD. A long-lasting MSD, therefore, is likely in Bautzen Reservoir only if temperatures are high during winter and early spring, as well as during early summer. 6. As a consequence of climate warming, recent climate records reveal warming during winter, spring and early summer in middle Europe, rather than an increase in mean annual temperatures. If our findings and conclusions are related to this regional and temporal pattern of climate warming, an increasing frequency of years with a long-lasting MSD and, consequently, a decreasing efficiency of biomanipulation can be predicted.

J	MARSH, P; BIGRAS, SC				MARSH, P; BIGRAS, SC			EVAPORATION FROM MACKENZIE DELTA LAKES, NWT, CANADA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Evaporation is an important component of the water balance of lakes in the Mackenzie Delta, but the amount of summer evaporation in this area is not well known. A microclimatologic and water balance study conducted over a 5-yr period demonstrated that lake evaporation ranged from 200 to 387 mm per summer. Evaporation was always greater than summer precipitation and in some cases greater than annual precipitation. Measured evaporation varied significantly from lake to lake and was considerably different from that given in standard maps of evaporation over northern Canada. Since these delta lakes receive little runoff from the surrounding basin, lakes which are not flooded by the Mackenzie River experience gradually decreasing water levels. Given sufficient time between flooding events, these lakes will completely dry up. This has important implications to the effect of flow regulation on the hydrology of lakes in the Mackenzie Delta.																			0004-0851					MAY	1988	20	2					220	229		10.2307/1551500	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551500													WOS:A1988N832000007
J	Torstensson, G				Torstensson, G			Nitrogen delivery and utilization by subsequent crops after incorporation of leys with different plant composition	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE												Leaching of nitrogen from arable land is an important factor contributing to increased nutrient loads to lakes and coastal waters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ley composition and time of incorporation on the nitrogen utilization by subsequent winter- or spring-sown crops and risks for nitrogen leaching. Therefore, a field investigation was carried out, using a split-plot design. Ten treatments with different preceding crops were used, i.e. five compositions of forage ley, three green manure treatments and two treatments with spring barley. Also three different times for incorporation of the crop residues were used (early autumn, late autumn or spring). No supplements of commercial fertilizer-N or manure were applied. The average grain yields were strongly influenced by the amounts of nitrogen in incorporated material. Early autumn incorporation gave acceptable grain yields, but rather large amounts of soil mineral nitrogen were found in late autumn which had disappeared before early spring, probably due to leaching. Late autumn and spring incorporation were both good choices with respect to reducing risks for leaching during the first winter and had positive effects on subsequent grain yields. Incorporation of ley residues in late autumn and in spring caused increased mineral-N content in soil during the following autumn.																			0144-8765						1998	16	2					129	143		10.1080/01448765.1998.9755228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.1998.9755228													WOS:000076002500003
J	Assel, RA; Janowiak, JE; Young, S; Boyce, D				Assel, RA; Janowiak, JE; Young, S; Boyce, D			Winter 1994 weather and ice conditions for the Laurentian Great Lakes	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The Laurentian Great Lakes developed their most extensive ice cover in over a decade during winter 1994 [December-February 1993/94 (DJF 94)]. Extensive midlake ice formation started the second half of January, about 2 weeks earlier than normal. Seasonal maximal ice extent occurred in early February, again about ?, weeks earlier than normal. Winter 1994 maximum (normal) ice coverages on the Great Lakes are Lake Superior 96% (75%), Lake Michigan 78% (45%), Lake Huron 95% (68%), Lake Erie 97% (90%), and Lake Ontario 67% (24%). Relative to the prior 31 winters (1963-93), the extent of seasonal maximal ice cover for winter 1994 for the Great Lakes taken as a unit is exceeded by only one other winter (1979); however, other winters for individual Great Lakes had similar maximal ice covers. Anomalously strong anticyclonic circulation over the central North Pacific (extending to the North Pole) and an abnormally strong polar vortex centered over northern Hudson Bay combined to produce a circulation pattern that brought frequent air masses of Arctic and polar origin to the eastern third of North America. New records were set for minimum temperatures on 19 January 1994 at many locations in the Great Lakes region. A winter severity index consisting of the average November-February air temperatures averaged over four sites on the perimeter of the Great Lakes (Duluth, Minnesota; Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan; Detroit, Michigan; and Buffalo, New York) indicates that winter 1994 was the 21st coldest since 1779. The unseasonably cold air temperatures produced much-above-normal ice cover over the Great Lakes and created problems for lake shipping. Numerous fatalities and injuries were attributed to the winter weather, which included several ice and snow storms. The much-below-normal air temperatures resulted in enhanced lake-effect snowfall along downwind lake shores, particularly during early to midwinter, prior to extensive ice formation in deeper lake areas. The low air temperatures were also responsible for record 1-day electrical usage and multimillion dollar costs associated with snow removal, U.S. and Canadian Coast Guard operational assistance to ships beset in ice, damage to ships by ice, damage to public and private property by river ice jams and associated flooding, frozen underground water pipes, and damage to fruit trees.																			0003-0007					JAN	1996	77	1					71	88		10.1175/1520-0477(1996)077<0071:WWAICF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477(1996)077<0071:WWAICF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1996TT95200005

To determine the effect of hydrology and sediment characteristics on plant organic matter processing, leaves of Phragmites australis at the end of its vegetative cycle and whole plants of Ruppia cirrhosa (PETAGNA) GRANDE, just abscised, were enclosed in litter bags. Two different mesh sizes (100 mum and 2 mm) were used to study the effect of macroinvertebrates on decomposition. The bags were placed in the water column and approximately 15 cm above the sediment at 6 different locations in the lagoon. The experiment was performed twice, in autumn-winter and spring-summer. The effect of macroinvertebrates on decomposition rate was not significant in Tancada lagoon. Breakdown rates showed spatial differences only in spring-summer. In the autumn-winter experiment, the effect of strong wind masked the effects of environmental variables and hydrology on decomposition rate. In the spring-summer experiment, characterised by high stability of the water column, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration in the water column and organic matter in the sediment were the main factors determining the variability of organic matter processing. A positive relationship was calculated between P. australis decomposition rate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen in spring-summer (r(2) = 0.92, p < 0.001).					; Hernandez, Oscar/HZJ-5678-2023	Menendez, Margarita/0000-0002-6590-7960; 													1434-2944						2004	89	5-6					476	483		10.1002/iroh.200410728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200410728													WOS:000226419900005

Climatology and trends in some adverse and fair weather conditions in Canada, 1953-2004	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] This study characterizes the climatology and trends of some adverse and fair weather occurrence in Canada, on the basis of reliable long-term records of hourly weather and bright sunshine observations at about 90 Canadian stations for the period 1953 - 2004. The results show that fair or no-weather (i.e., no precipitation or visibility obscuration) trends are generally consistent with the sunshine trends, showing significant increases in southern Canada, with decreases in the Canadian Arctic. The increase of no-weather is most extensive in spring and summer, while the decrease is most extensive in autumn. For the same period, freezing precipitation has become more frequent in the region north of 50 degrees N ( especially in spring and autumn) but less frequent in southern British Columbia ( BC), central Prairies, and the Great Lakes area in autumn-winter, as well as in northeastern Canada in winter. Blowing snow occurrence has decreased significantly almost everywhere across Canada, with the most significant decline in southwestern Canada in winter. In every season, fog occurrence has significantly increased in the Prairies-Yukon-Northwest Territories and northern BC but decreased in eastern Canada and southern BC. The frequency of low ceiling conditions (< 304.8 m, i.e., 1000 feet) has increased in Alberta-BC interior and the Great Lakes area, with the most significant increases in Alberta-BC interior in autumn-winter and in the Great Lakes area in spring; while the other regions have experienced a negative trend, which prevails across the country in summer.																			2169-897X					MAY 13	2006	111	D9							D09105	10.1029/2005JD006155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005JD006155													WOS:000237800700004

Reconstructing the tephra dispersal pattern from the Bronze Age eruption of Santorini using an advection-diffusion model	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The advection-diffusion model TEPHRA2 has been used in conjunction with the downhill simplex method (DSM) and one-at-a-time (OAT) inversion methods to reconstruct the eruption conditions and seasonality consistent with the deposit patterns from the Bronze Age ('Minoan') eruption of Santorini. We investigated three datasets representing different depositional environments (proximal terrestrial, distal terrestrial and deep-sea core), in order to determine source conditions such as plume height, erupted mass and grain-size and recreate the tephra fall deposit from the Plinian, co-ignimbrite and combined eruptive phases. The results of the DSM and OAT method agreed adequately well with each other for erupted mass, plume height and grain-size distribution. Both approaches were able to successfully recreate the Plinian deposit but estimating conditions that created the co-ignimbrite and deep-sea core dataset were less successful. The reduced agreement is the result of the low quantity (6 to 28 deposit points) and quality (inconsistent deposit depths at localities adjacent to each other) of the datasets, and the different dynamics between co-ignimbrite and Plinian columns, with the former not well represented in the model. Different sampling methods between archaeological and volcanological disciplines and post-depositional processes which have acted on the tephra deposits since the Bronze Age can explain the discrepancy between these computed and observed deposits. The seasonality of the Minoan eruption was investigated by using seasonal wind profiles for winter, spring, summer and autumn. We find that the Bronze Age eruption of Santorini is likely to have during the spring and summer months with a main dispersal axis aligned East. Crete would have received very little ash fall, and the eruption would not have caused much disruption to the life of the inhabitants of the island.

Experiments using controlled conditions showed that day length cues the change of leaf form which occurs in autumn and spring, and that total immersion in water affects leaf form to a lesser extent and prevents flowering.

Sampling was done once during each season of 1987, in three sampling stations at the shore with a 30 m long net (1.5 m ''hanging'', 0.8 cm aperture). Four age groups were determined (scale method). The growth rates were: spring -0.1778, summer-0.3364, fall =-0.2032 and winter -0.2869. Corresponding condition factors were 0.0170, 0.0101, 0.0071 and 0.0032, respectively. Mortalities were -2.5649, -1.2489, -1.1513 and -2.5649, respectively. Spring is the time of the highest condition factor and food abundance (the silverside is planktivorous) but also of lowest growth because resources are allocated to reproduction. Growth is concentrated in the summer. Al values are low in autumn when food is scarce and reach low peaks in winter, when nevertheless the fish is able to grow in length (but not in weight).																			0034-7744	2215-2075				MAR	1997	45	1B					573	578																WOS:A1997XF97200026

Mesoscale snowbands(10 to 200 km in size) account for most of the snowfall which can accumulate as much as 100 to 200 cm in a single event. An overview is presented on how lake effect snow (LES) is monitored in red-time by a National Weather Service Forecast Office using the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988, Doppler, (WSR-88D) and multispectral satellite imagery from GOES-g. Satellite and radar data are combined to take advantage of the strengths of each remote sensing system to produce short term predictions of LES bands. Access to frequent, high resolution satellite imagery has greatly increased forecasters' ability to detect LES bands and predict their evolution at distances beyond the effective range of the WSR-88D. Experimental techniques are under development with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to create a snowfall accumulation algorithm (SAA) for the WSR-88D. An assessment of the SAA performance for an intense LES episode from November 1996 over northeast Ohio was conducted. Snowfall estimates were compared to 28 snowfall observations using a linear least squares fit. A correlation coefficient of 0.92 was obtained.																					0-933957-21-1				1998							40	44																WOS:000084418300009

The result indicates as follows: firstly, the wind field has been greatest changed after the water storage. Except in the winter, we can found obvious lake-land breeze in the spring and the summer and the flow field is very evident; secondly, the temperature is rising or falling; except for a little change in the spring, the average temperature falls 1.27 degrees C in the summer but rises at 1.28 degrees C in the winter. In addition, the humidity around the reservoir is changed distinctly; the average humid degree rises mostly at 4.56% in the winter, moderately at 2.25% in the spring but a little change at 0.94% in the summer. It is since the climate factors have been changed that the concentration field of atmospheric pollutants which generated by the industrial and mining enterprises around the reservoir has been changed at all.																			1660-9336		978-3-03785-486-0				2012	212-213						245	252		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.212-213.245	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.212-213.245													WOS:000316717000044

Growth of all 3 cv. was positively correlated with radiation up to the highest level measured, 550 cal cm-2 day-1. Crops grown in the autumn used light 2-3 times more efficiently than crops grown in spring. Daytime air temperatures were also positively correlated with growth, and there was a significant temperature .times. radiation interaction. The best predictor of growth was the product of day temperature and the log of radiation. This variable explained much of the difference between the growth of autumn and spring crops. Autumn crops were grown under higher temperatures and thus responded more steeply to radiation than spring crops. High temperatures during the summer rainy season were associated with bolting. A general curve to predict the length of the crop cycle from radiation data alone was constructed from data for Tucson, Arizona, USA, crops and data from the literature for lettuce grown in Great Britian an the Great Lakes region of the USA.																			0304-4238	1879-1018					1984	22	1-2					9	21		10.1016/0304-4238(84)90078-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-4238(84)90078-5													WOS:A1984RY53300002

The annual seasonal average ice cover of each Great Lake is used to define three ice cycle classes: mild, typical, and severe. About half of the severe ice cycles occurred from 1977 to 1982 and about half of the mild ice cycles occurred from 1998 to 2002. The seasonal progression of daily lake-averaged ice cover, spatial differences in ice cover, and differences among the Great Lakes for mild, typical, and severe ice cycles are discussed within the context of lake bathymetry and winter air temperatures. Seasonal average ice cover is larger on Lakes Superior, Erie, and Huron relative to Lakes Michigan and Ontario, because of shallower depths ( for Erie and Huron) and lower air temperatures ( for Superior) relative to Lakes Michigan and Ontario. This ice cycle classification scheme can be used to compare future Great Lakes ice cycle severity with this 30- winter benchmark.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				NOV	2005	18	22					4895	4905		10.1175/JCLI3571.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI3571.1													WOS:000234079900020

Daily and Seasonal Variation of Nitrate Contents in Lettuce Cultivars in Hydroponic System in Southern Brazil	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES AND MANAGEMENT TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE GREENHOUSE ECOSYSTEMS: GREENSYS2011	Acta Horticulturae				International Symposium on Advanced Technologies and Management Towards Sustainable Greenhouse Ecosystems - Greensys	JUN 01, 2012	Athens, GREECE					Lettuce presents a great ability of nitrate accumulation, especially in hydroponics in which the ion availability is high. Nonetheless, nitrate accumulation depends primarily on genotype and light intensity. The aim of this work was to quantify the nitrate contents in lettuce cultivars according to the harvest time and crop-season in hydroponic system. Three experiments were conducted in three crop-seasons: spring of 2008, autumn and winter of 2009, in Pelotas RS, south of Brazil. Four cultivars were studied: 'Green Garden' (GG), 'Red Garden' (RG), 'Great Lakes Iceberg' (GLI) and 'Vera Sunny' (VS) lettuce types, at four harvest times (8:00, 14:00, 18:00 and 23:00 hr). In spring, the lowest average nitrate accumulation was found at 18:00 and 23:00 hr (2058 and 2244 mg kg(-1)) and in GLI leaves (1825 mg kg(-1)). In autumn, the lowest average accumulation was observed at 8:00 hr (1378 against 1620 mg kg(-1) obtained as average of the other harvest times) and for RG and GLI cultivars (1360 and 1448 mg kg(-1)). In winter, GG and RG presented similar nitrate accumulation (mean of 2182 mg kg(-1)) and for both cultivars the lowest nitrate accumulation was observed at 8:00 hr (1545 against the average of 2394 mg kg(-1) of the other harvest times). GLI presented lower nitrate accumulation than VS (1915 and 2679 mg kg(-1), respectively) and the harvest at 14:00 hr led to a lower accumulation than at 18:00 hr (2054 against 2454 mg kg(-1), respectively). The lowest nitrate accumulation average was obtained in autumn (1559 against 2526 and 2189 mg kg(-1) obtained in spring and winter, respectively). In general, we can recommend 'Great Lakes Iceberg' cultivar. We also recommend an early morning harvest in winter and autumn and a late afternoon harvest in spring crop-season in order to get lower nitrate accumulation in hydroponic lettuce.																			0567-7572		978-90-66053-38-0				2012	952						651	657		10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.952.82	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.952.82													WOS:000307442100082
J	BRAHAM, RR; DUNGEY, MJ				BRAHAM, RR; DUNGEY, MJ			LAKE-EFFECT SNOWFALL OVER LAKE-MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Aircraft measurements of snow particle size spectra from 36 nights on 26 snowy days are used to estimate snow precipitation rates over Lake Michigan. Results show that average rates during 14 wind-parallel-type lake-effect storms increased from the upwind shore to about midlake and then were essentially uniform (1.5-2 mm day(-1), liquid water equivalent) to the downwind shore. Snow from midlake bands and shoreline bands maximized over the lake. The position of the maximum during these types of lake-effect storms depends on meteorological conditions. In any given case it may be near either shore or anywhere between them. This study combines 12 cases of midlake and shoreline bands. The resulting cross-lake snow profile shows a broad maximum reaching over 4 mm day(-1) near midlake. The single sample maximum snow precipitation rate encountered in this study was 77.7 mm day(-1). The average cross-lake profile from combining 26 cases of lake-effect storms shows that snowfall into the lake is considerably greater than one would expect from a linear interpolation between values measured along either shore. An attempt is made to estimate the average increase in snow over lake Michigan resulting from combined lake-effect and large-scale cyclonic storms. The result is interesting but not considered very reliable because it depends upon the relative frequencies of different types of lake-effect storms as well as overtake snow rates from large-scale cyclonic storms; neither is well known.																			0894-8763					MAY	1995	34	5					1009	1019		10.1175/1520-0450(1995)034<1009:LESOLM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1995)034<1009:LESOLM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1995QW51800001
J	ADCOCK, JA				ADCOCK, JA			ENERGETICS OF A POPULATION OF THE ISOPOD ASELLUS-AQUATICUS - LIFE-HISTORY AND PRODUCTION	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												A population of A. aquaticus in Wistow Lake, England [UK], was sampled at monthly intervals from Sept. 1973 to Sept. 1974. The mean population density was 586 m-2 in autumn 1973 but it fell to 67 m-2 by autumn 1974. The lower density in autumn 1974 was due to premature mortality of gravid females. The cause of this is not known. Gravid females were present from Feb.-June and July-Sept., giving rise to spring and autumn cohorts. The larger members of the spring cohort reproduced in the autumn, the remainder in the following spring. The autumn cohort reproduced mainly in the following spring but later than the spring cohort. The bimodal length-frequency curves were analyzed to separate the 2 cohorts and to estimate growth and production of each cohort separately. The overwintering spring cohort had a faster relative growth rate than the smaller individuals of the autumn cohort. The spring cohort showed a P/B [production/biomass] ratio of 2.62 for the period Sept.-April compared with a ratio of 1.81 for the autumn cohort. The highest ratio of 6.42 was shown by the spring cohort in the summer (May-Sept.). Annual population production (P) was 3004.9 mg dry wt m-2. The P/B ratio of 3.96 is double the value reported for A. aquaticus in Sweden.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	4					343	355		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01519.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01519.x													WOS:A1979HC33500007

Phytoplankton community structure and its relationship with environmental factors including hydrological and chemical variables were explored by multi-variate analysis. In total, over 100 species of algae were identified. Total abundance ranged from 0.85 x 10(6) to 106.27 x 10(6) cells/L, and total biomass from 1.0 to 16.8 mg/L (mean 6.94 mg/L). The community was dominated by Pseudanabaena limnetica, but in spring, Synedra ulna and P. limnetica were co-dominant. The community was relatively stable, but change rates of community structure in autumn and summer were higher than in winter and spring. Ordination by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) divided all samples into four groups, distributed in the four districts formed by axes 1 and 2, corresponding to the four seasons: winter, spring, summer and autumn. Most samples were located in the summer and autumn districts. Fifty-four main species of phytoplankton were selected for CCA. Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria), Bacillariophyta and Euglenophyta were restricted to the districts at the left of axis 1, but most Chlorophyta, Chrysophyta and Cryptophyta were to the right. CCA revealed that temperature and precipitation were important in driving dynamics of species composition and phytoplankton abundance.																			0077-0639		978-94-007-2006-0				2012	91						71	84		10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_5	10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7												WOS:000301802900005

LC50 values for the examination periods in winter, spring, summer and autumn were the following: 90.9, 68.6, 75.2, 81.9 mg/l, respectively. Examinations on the spring generation showed the effective agent (2,4-D) of the herbicide and its Na-salt to be less toxic on E. gracilis (LC50 = 144.1 and 173.4 mg/l, resp.) than the commercial product (LC50 = 68.6 mg/l). The contaminant dichlorophenol with LC50 96 h of 6.3 mg/l proved to be the most toxic. The toxicity of Dikonirt containing about 2% dichlorophenol and 71.1% 2,4-D was due to the synergic effect of the two compounds. At a concentration ten times lower than LC50 i.e. at concentrations lower than the so-called harmless one, Dikonirt diminished the number of eggs of the animals of the autumn and summer generations. During the 3-week studies the females two times carried sacs of the experimental animals, which were observed. In the experiments in autumn the average number of eggs of animals living in 2.5 mg/l Dikonirt concentration was significantly smaller than in the control. During the summer investigations, at 2.5 mg/l concentration the average number of eggs was significantly smaller during both clutches than in the case of animals living in the control Balaton Lake water.																			0003-9136					APR	1986	106	2					275	286																WOS:A1986C095000010
J	Brinkmann, WAR				Brinkmann, WAR			Causes of variability in monthly Great Lakes water supplies and lake levels	CLIMATE RESEARCH												The purpose of this study was to identify those water budget components of the Great Lakes that have most frequently been a major cause of anomalous net basin supplies (NBS) and of rising and falling lake levels at the monthly time scale. Principal component analysis and a simple counting of relative frequencies revealed that on the upper lakes NBS anomalies are most sensitive to over-lake precipitation, but on the lower lakes they are most sensitive to runoff. This shift is due to a downstream increase in the magnitude and variability of runoff. Evaporation variability plays a larger role in the NBS of the upper than the lower lakes and is most important during dry months. During wet months evaporation is not as much suppressed as one might assume from the simple cloud cover/insolation/temperature/evaporation relationship; this is most likely due to an increase in wind speed. High and rising as well as low and falling lake levels are the result of anomalous NBS on all lakes and represent condition beyond the capabilities of lake-level regulations. Changing conditions-low but rising levels or high but falling levels-are the result of anomalous NBS for all of the lakes except Ontario I for which almost all such changes are achieved by regulating the outflow.																			0936-577X					JUL 20	2000	15	2					151	160		10.3354/cr015151	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr015151													WOS:000089421400006
J	WILSON, MVH				WILSON, MVH			PALEOECOLOGY OF EOCENE LACUSTRINE VARVES AT HORSEFLY, BRITISH-COLUMBIA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Middle Eocene lacustrine sediments, cropping out in the valley of the Horsefly River, British Columbia [Canada], contain abundant fossils of fishes, fish scales, fish coprolites, insects, leaves and diatoms. The fish scales, insects and leaves are preserved in at least 3 sequences of alternating light tuff and dark sapropel laminae, separated stratigraphically by coarse-grained structureless sequences. The proportions of the main types of fossils occurring in the light laminae compared with the dark laminae are significantly different, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the laminations are varves, with dark organic winter laminae and light inorganic summer laminae. Occasional graded sandy layers contain carbonized allochthonous plant remains and represent turbidity deposits caused by storms in the drainage basin. The varves were probably deposited in the deeper regions of a stratified, monomictic or meromictic lake in a warm temperate climate. The depositional environment was anaerobic, containing abundant H2S, and was free of turbulence and benthos. Fish were entombed mostly during the winter, insects during the spring and summer coprolites during the summer, and deciduous leaves during the late summer and autumn. The fish died of starvation and/or overturn-induced anoxia.

There is evidence that mercury concentrations may fluctuate seasonally, which could affect consumption advisories. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were collected from Dorena Reservoir, Oregon, in spring and summer of 1995 and spring, summer, and fall of 1996. Samples of muscle, liver, and gonad were analyzed for total mercury. There were seasonal differences for mercury in liver and gonads, but not muscle tissue. Liver mercury concentrations were higher in summer and lower in spring whereas ovarian mercury concentrations were higher in fall and lower in spring. This study shows that liver tissue was more sensitive than muscle tissue to seasonal variability of mercury, but these seasonal fluctuations may not influence consumption advisories.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				JAN	2000	38	1					78	82		10.1007/s002449910010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002449910010								10556374					WOS:000083914800010

Samples were taken at the surface and also at 20, 40, 60, 80 m depths in front of the dams in April, July, October of 2006 and January of 2007. Chemical parameters were calculated and the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC] and its isotopic composition (sigma C-13(DIC)) were determined. In surface waters, the sigma C-13(DIC) values are high in summer and autumn and low in winter and spring, while the DIC concentrations are relatively low in summer and autumn and relatively high in winter and spring. In the water column, the DIC concentrations increase while sigma C-13(DIC) values decrease with water depth. DIC in various reservoirs is significantly different in isotopic composition from that in natural rivers, but is close to that in natural lakes. In addition, in surface waters, the sigma C-13(DIC) values tend to become lower whereas the nutrition level tends to become higher with increasing age of the reservoirs. The conclusion is that after dam blocking, changes took place in the hydrochemical properties of river water, and the impounding rivers developed toward lakes and swamps. In addition, differentiation in DIC isotopic composition may be used to some extent to trace the evolution process of a reservoir.

J	WOHLSCHLAG, DE; JULIANO, RO				WOHLSCHLAG, DE; JULIANO, RO			SEASONAL CHANGES IN BLUEGILL METABOLISM	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A one-year study of bluegill metabolism in a California reservoir indicated that field determinations of oxygen uptake rates and multivariate analyses of results with respect to weight, activity, and temperature during each season were feasible in the form, Ye = constant + b1X1^ + b2X2 + b3X3, where Ye is the expected log milligrams of oxygen consumed per hour, X1 is the log weight in grams, X2 is the swimming velocity in meters per minute, X3 is the temperature in degrees centigrade, and where b1, b2, and b3 are the respective partial regression coefficients. By delimiting "seasons" on the basis of thermal and related limnological characteristics, the data yield the equations: Apr.-June Ye = -0.6954 + 0.8036X1 + 0.0250X2 + 0.0069X3 July-Aug. Ye= -2.1951 + 1.0621X1 + 0.0138X2 + 0.0567X3 Sept.-Dec. Y = -0.9242 + 0.8494X1 + 0.0142X2 + 0.0198X3 Jan.-Feb. Ye = -1.9310 + 0.8624X1 + 0.0427X2 + 0.1153Xg The multiple correlation coefficients for these equations are highly significant as are all the partial regression coefficients, excepting the low spring b3 = 0.0069. The weight relationships expressed by b1 are remarkably close to Krogh''s constant of approximately 0.85 except in the summer when the calculated higher rate may be due to the spawning condition of the larger fish and the post-spawning condition of the larger fish and the post-spawning condition of the smaller fish. There are similar relationships of respiratory rates with respect to swimming movements over the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, but during winter it appears that relatively higher oxygen consumption is required for comparable swimming activity. The respiratory rates with respect to temperature appear to be of the same order during spring and autumn when they are lower than in summer and much lower than in winter. The high respiration-temperature regressions in winter, and possibly in summer, may be due to excessive spontaneous activity not reflected as swimming motion at temperature extremes. Females during each season have higher metabolic rates than the males over the range of temperatures and activities encountered, but the differences are not statistically significant. Groups of fish during the spawning season have higher than average respiratory rates than do single fish, other conditions being equal. Limited data suggest that social facilitation exists during the summer after spawning. Variations in Felt Lake limnological conditions are considered from the standpoint of about a 50 per cent reduction in volume from spring to autumn, the absence of a well developed littoral zone, and the rather drastic spring to autumn and winter declines in bottom fauna and average weights of the larger fish. A comparison of the above regressions over average spring and autumn conditions reveals that metabolic rates would be about equal, although in spring the fish grow rapidly and spawn, while in autumn and winter they lose weight. Similarly the calculated winter metabolic rates are higher at comparable temperatures than those of spring or autumn due possibly to cold adaptation. While the potential growing season in Felt Lake would be about twice as long as that for the northern portion of the native bluegill range, the growth rates are of the same order. The biological productivity of the bluegill in Felt Lake and similar western U.S. waters is interpreted to be much poorer than in eastern areas because of the longer growing season without adequate food (especially bottom fauna) production and because there appears to be no adaptive mechanism for lowering the metabolic requirements during seasons of poor food supplies.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1959	4	2					195	209		10.4319/lo.1959.4.2.0195	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1959.4.2.0195													WOS:A1959WY36300007

The life cycle in both species is basically regulated by complete depletion of oxygen during the long winter. There is a short period of reproduction in spring followed by a rapid development during summer and autumn to advanced instars, capable of diapause when oxygen depletion starts in early winter. Both species have an exclusive 1-yr cycle. The long winter under anoxic conditions is passed in diapause as large copepodids (late developmental instars) with usually no individuals left in the plankton. Even if co-occurring in the same habitats with similar life cycles, there is a temporal and spatial segregation.																			0018-8158					DEC 10	1990	208	3					187	199		10.1007/BF00007784	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007784													WOS:A1990EX30300005

Both factors are most important for the determination of the lake's energy balance. The water balance is controlled by the rainfall on the lake watershed. The low annual rainfall on the lake itself (400 mm) with respect to its immediate surroundings (similar to 700 mm) is attributed to the unique topography of the lake, with an elevation of approximately 210 m below sea level, compared to 500 m above sea level of the mountains to the east and >1,000 m to the northwest. Ninety percent of the rainfall over North Israel and Lake Kinneret results from Cyprus lows, low-pressure systems characterizing the mid-latitudes as well as the Mediterranean basin. The Cyprus lows pass the north of Israel and therefore produce the westerly winds, which transport moist air from the Mediterranean into North Israel.																			1573-4595	2543-005X	978-94-017-8944-8; 978-94-017-8943-1				2014	6						81	96		10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_6	10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8												WOS:000459771400007

The record high discharge in WY 1997, with above average flow each month, was followed by a record high flow in May 1998, then a sharp decline. Through diagnosing these changing flows and their expression in the Beaufort Sea via synthesis of observations and model output, this study provides insight into the nature of the Arctic's freshwater system. The low discharge in WY 1995 manifests negative anomalies in P-E and precipitation, recycled summer precipitation, and dry surface conditions immediately prior to the water year. The complex hydrograph for WY 1996 reflects a combination of spring soil moisture recharge, buffering by rising lake levels, positive P-E anomalies in summer, and a massive release of water held in storage by Bennett Dam. The record high discharge in WY 1997 manifests the dual effects of reduced buffering by lakes and positive P-E anomalies for most of the year. With reduced buffering, only modest P-E the following spring led to a record discharge in May 1998. As simulated with a coupled ice-ocean model, the record low discharge in WY 1995 contributed to a negative freshwater anomaly on the Mackenzie shelf lasting throughout the winter of 1995/96. High discharge from July-October 1996 contributed approximately 20% to a positive freshwater anomaly forming in the Beaufort Sea in the autumn of that year. The remainder was associated with reduced autumn/winter ice growth, strong ice melt the previous summer, and positive P-E anomalies over the ocean itself. Starting in autumn 1997 and throughout 1998, the upper ocean became more saline owing to sea-ice growth.					; Shiklomanov, Alexander/C-5521-2014	Lammers, Richard/0000-0002-7980-5834; Rawlins, Michael/0000-0002-3323-8256; Steele, Michael/0000-0001-5083-1775; Serreze, Mark C./0000-0001-7670-0140; Shiklomanov, Alexander/0000-0001-9790-3510; Pavelsky, Tamlin/0000-0002-0613-3838; 													0705-5900	1480-9214				MAR	2009	47	1					79	97		10.3137/OC301.2009	http://dx.doi.org/10.3137/OC301.2009													WOS:000265400500005

Prevalences were above 21% in all seasons sampled and with a distinct seasonal trend, which was highest (45.81%) in the spring and decreased by degrees. The mean intensity of infection was above 4.0 worms per fish. The maximum intensity of worms recovered from a single fish was 86 in the autumn of 2002. No significant seasonal differences were found in mean intensities, and differences in the mean abundance between winter and spring, winter and autumn were significant. Over-dispersed distributions of P. (N.) celatus in the host population, due to heterogeneity and feeding habits, were observed in all seasons. The size composition of both sexes of P. (N.) celatus showed males between 2.0 mm and 14.0 mm and females between 2.2 mm and 22.2 mm, with the main recruitment phase in the worm populations occurring in the summer and autumn, especially in the autumn, with the lowest recruitment occurring in the winter. The maturation and copulation of worms were mainly focused in the spring season. The sex ratio of female to male was both high in summer (1.09:1) and autumn (1.08:1). The higher proportion of females and the change in the worm sex ratio in summer can be attributed to the reduced longevity of male worms. As immature male worms exhibit a higher proportion of the worm population than females in all seasons, further studies are needed to determine if such a situation compensates for the shorter life span of males.																			0022-149X	1475-2697				DEC	2007	81	4					415	420		10.1017/S0022149X07868799	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X07868799								18028579					WOS:000252151600014

Caribou were monitored by aerial surveys and ground searches during months with snow cover and by ground searches only during snow-free months. Two caribou were radio-collared. Caribou and caribou tracks were seen relatively more often in mature coniferous upland habitat than in other available habitats, except during Oct., Dec. and Jan. when semi-open and open bogs were used more. The increased use of bogs coincided with a seasonal change in diet and onset of the rut. Favored use of bogs continued until mid-Feb. when snow cover thickness and hardness restricted foraging. Caribou then switched back to sites with more favorable snow-cover conditions in mature coniferous uplands, especially rocky ridges with jack pine (Pinus banksiana). Caribou did not migrate. Seasonal herd ranges consisted largely of overlapping individual ranges and varied from 100-180 km2 in early spring, 175-190 km2 in late spring and summer, 115 km2 in autumn and 95-140 km2 in winter. Mean group size was 5.8 in early spring, 1.2 in late spring and summer, 6.2 in autumn and 5.5 in winter.																			0008-3550						1984	98	2					184	190																WOS:A1984TT40500006

Winter peaks were invariably dominated by algae of planktonic origin. The epipelon was light limited at the deep stations under ice cover during the winter. More correspondence than in previous studies was found between the standing crop and the nutrient status of the overlying water, but no 1 single factor could account for seasonal fluctuations of the epipelon. A combination of light levels, nutrients, temperature, physical disturbance and biotic interactions affected these fluctuations. The mean standing crop size of the epipelon was closely related to the mean bicarbonate levels. [Some bacillariophycean algae were also examined.].																			0008-4026						1978	56	8					991	1009		10.1139/b78-111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b78-111													WOS:A1978EX77900010

Trichodactylus borellianus is a common freshwater crab of the Trichodactylidae family, originary front South America. This crab is omnivorous and grazes Upon the littoral communities. The present study is the first analysis of the natural distribution and population dynamics of freshwater crabs in La Plata Basin (Argentina) and their relationship with certain abiotic and biotic parameters. It was carried out in three environments (riverine zone of streams and river) of the Parana River floodplain. Crab populations were sampled monthly front August 2001 to October 2002. The mean crab abundance among the study sites Was significantly different. being lower in samples from the environment surrounding the principal channel of the Parana River. Crab density showed two peaks: the highest occurred during late winter and early spring, and the lowest during late summer. Males were only more abundant ill late winter and spring. In spring, summer and autumn. the population showed a contagious distribution. The population displayed a regular arrangement in winter. Front mid-spring to mid-autumn juveniles, were very frequent whereas adults predominated the rest of the year. Total crab number in the stream nearest to the main channel varied according to the level and temperature of the river. In the other sites, located further front the main channel of the Parana River, crab numbers and vegetation biomass showed a more similar arrangement with a higher correlation.

J	NICHOLLS, KH				NICHOLLS, KH			NUTRIENT-PHYTOPLANKTON RELATIONSHIPS IN HOLLAND MARSH, ONTARIO	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												During a limnological investigation of the Holland River and Cook Bay of Lake Simcoe [Canada], seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass and species composition in the lower Holland River (Holland Marsh) were evaluated with reference to data collected on nutrient concentrations and other environmental factors. Over the whole year, Chlorophyceae comprised about 1/2 of the average standing crop of phytoplankton, Bacillariophyceae, about 1/3 and Cyanophyceae, < 1/10. In spring and fall, diatoms (mainly Stephanodiscus hantzschii) were dominant and constituted at times > 90% of the total phytoplankton biomass which was as high as 3.2 .times. 107 .mu.m3/ml in May of 1972. The high standing crops in summer (1.0-3.0 .times. 107 .mu.m3/ml) were dominated by chlorococcalean forms (especially Scenedesmus quadricauda), with smaller volumes of diatoms (mainly Melosira granulata and M. ambigua) and blue-green algae (Oscillatoria articulata and O. tenuis) present. Despite summer inorganic-N concentrations of < 10 .mu.g N/1, phytoplankton species succession continued with several taxa developing maximum abundance during the period of low N concentrations. Although the winter phytoplankton showed more diversity, with diatoms, chrysomonads, dinoflagellates, cryptomonads and euglenoids all prominent in the plankton, the biomass was considerably lower at 0.16-2.9 .times. 106 .mu.m/ml. Maximum chlorophyll a concentrations in the Holland Marsh (as high as 358 .mu.g/l) compare with data in the literature from highly eutrophic waters. Phaeopigment concentrations ranged as high as 81 .mu.g/l and comprised up to 58%, but averaged .apprxeq. 15% of total uncorrected chlorophyll a during the ice-free summer period. Over the year, chlorophyll a content of phytoplankton ranged from 0.14-1.65% of fresh weight. Despite almost identical species composition of the phytoplankton (.apprxeq. 90% S. hantzschii by volume) in May and Nov., the chlorophyll a content as a percentage of fresh weight was almost 3 .times. greater in Nov. than in May. According to the influence of total daily incident radiation and inorganic N concentrations as controlling factors of chlorophyll a content of phytoplankton, 3 conditions were recognized in the Holland Marsh: chlorophyll a contents were intermediate in spring under highest daily incident radiation (favoring low chlorophyll contents) and ample supplies of inorganic-N (favoring high chlorophyll contents); chlorophyll a contents were lowest in summer when inorganic N was in scarce supply and daily incident radiation was high; and contents were highest in fall and winter when supplies of inorganic-N were ample and daily incident radiation was lowest. Inorganic-N most likely limited summer phytoplankton growth. The spring phytoplankton maximum (S. hantzschii) was likely limited by SiO2 in 1971 and by P in 1972. The extent of depletion of soluble reactive P by diatoms in the autumn was controlled by silica concentration. Some evidence is presented which suggests that the initial effects of improved nutrient retention within intensively cultivated and urban areas on the Holland River watershed would be realized as a shift in the limiting nutrient for the spring phytoplankton bloom in the Holland Marsh and southern Cook Bay, from SiO2 to P.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1976	46	2					179	199		10.2307/1942250	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942250													WOS:A1976BV97700005

A total of nine parasite species were identified in a sample of 148 fishes during the study period. These comprised one ciliate, one myxosporean, one monogenean, two digeneans, one acanthocephalan, one nematode, one cestode and one branchiuran. The greatest diversity of parasites was present in autumn (March to May) while the lowest diversity was recorded in spring (September to November). The largest prevalence and seasonal abundance was observed for the Contracaecum sp. larvae in summer and for the larvae of an unidentified cestode in winter. In contrast, the lowest values were recorded in autumn for Dactylogyrus sp. and Acanthocephalus tumescens. This is the first survey of the parasites of Galaxias maculatus inhabiting estuarine zones.

J	Denlinger, JCS; Hale, RS; Stein, RA				Denlinger, JCS; Hale, RS; Stein, RA			Seasonal consumptive demand and prey use by stocked saugeyes in Ohio reservoirs	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Community structure and species composition may be strongly influenced by predator-prey interactions resulting from and leading to episodes of population abundance or scarcity. We quantified diets of stocked saugeyes (female walleye Sander vitreus X male sauger S. canadensis) and estimated biomass of their primary prey, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, in three Ohio reservoirs at quarterly intervals during July 2002-July 2003 to determine whether saugeye consumptive demand could exceed the supply of available gizzard shad prey, resulting in a shift to alternative prey. We incorporated water temperature and saugeye diet composition, growth, and mortality into walleye bioenergetics models, which allowed us to compare estimated prey-specific consumption rates by saugeyes with gizzard shad standing stocks estimated with acoustics. Spring and summer were critical seasons. During spring, gizzard shad biomass was low, saugeye consumptive demand was low, and saugeyes consumed primarily alternative prey. During summer, when age-0 gizzard shad became available as prey, saugeyes consumed similar proportions of gizzard shad and alternative prey. Saugeye cumulative consumptive demand in summer was high and approached the gizzard shad standing stock. However, during fall and winter, gizzard shad supply was adequate to support high (fall) or declining (winter) saugeye consumptive demand. Across reservoirs and seasons, saugeyes consumed alternative prey to varying degrees, primarily sunfishes Lepomis spp., yellow perch Perca flavescens, logperch Percina caprodes, and minnows Pimephales spp. Seasonal asynchrony between saugeye consumptive demand and gizzard shad biomass during spring and summer indicated that a saugeye population with high survival, growth, and consumptive demand will opportunistically increase use of prey other than gizzard shad. The manner in which saugeye predation quantitatively influences these prey species could not be assessed. However, overexploitation of gizzard shad prey appears to be unlikely at current saugeye population sizes, particularly considering the opportunistic use of alternative prey and the high reproductive potential of gizzard shad.																			0002-8487					JAN	2006	135	1					12	27		10.1577/T05-029.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-029.1													WOS:000235381500002

Analyses of 210Pb concentrations in surface air and in rain water at the central Guizhou, China	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												Samples of surface air and rain water were collected at the Mt. Guanfeng site located at Guiyang, China. The monthly mean Pb-210 concentrations in surface air exhibited a U-pattern with high values appearing in winter and low values in summer and early autumn. The annual mean of Pb-210 concentrations in surface air was estimated to be 2.7 +/- 0.6 mBq m(-3), which was at least four times higher than the annual mean reported from a large number of monitoring stations located throughout the world. The amounts of enriched Uranium in soil at the region could significantly contribute a great deal of release of Rn-222 that decay to Pb-210 which gets attached to the atmospheric aerosols. The site was under the influence of a monsoon climate. The distribution of monthly mean of Pb-210 concentrations in surface air correlates well with the reciprocal of monthly average of observed air temperature and rainfall. The partition coefficients of Pb-210 between rain water-surface air in the winter and spring were larger than those in the summer and autumn. The type and duration of rain depending on season played key roles for the changes of partition coefficients, although the rain amount is important.

Three zones (25-80 in wide) - lower, middle and upper were distinguished in each locality along 150 in transect and according to the vegetation types which were analysed with Braun-Blanquet method. The dominant species were following: Juncus acutus L., Salicornia prostrata Pall., Spergularia marina (L.) Gris, Hordeum geniculatum All., Plantago coronopus L. subsp. coronopus, Carex capitellata Boiss. and Bal, Artemisia santonicum L. and Juncus littoralis C. A. Mey. Soil samples were taken down to 50 cm. The results of soil analysis were evaluated by using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) from winter 1999 to autumn 2000. HCO3 concentration and inundation depth (2.22-21.44 cm) are the environmental variables that correlate the best with axis 1, whereas K concentration and inundation depth (2.22-21.44 cm) correlate the best with axis 2 during the study period. During winter 1999, HCO3 concentration showed the highest correlation with the canonical axis I and associated zone was H. geniculatum. In spring, summer and autumn 2000, inundation depth (3.44-19.11 cm) was the most prominent factor correlated with the first and second axes, respectively, with associated zone of C. capitellata. EC, Na+ and Cl- concentrations were decreased during autumn in all vegetation zones except for C. capitellata and Artemisia santonicum zones in which Na+ and Cl- concentrations and EC, respectively were increased during autumn. The C. capitellata (Cyperaceae) zone was located on the positive site of axis 1 during autumn 2000 and followed the gradient of inundation depth. S. prostrata, S. marina, H. geniculatum and R coronopus subsp. coronopus seems to be adapted to the most saline soils, whereas C.capitellata indicates the wettest soils in the studied salt marsh, The Juncus littoralis zone followed the gradient of maximum salinity during autumn of the year 2000, but the zone was not related to the measured increase in soil salinity during winter, summer and spring. In both localities EC, Na+ and Cl concentrations were tended to decrease at upper zones. Inundation regime, K+ concentration, and HCO3 concentration are key factors affecting vegetation zonation in studied salt marshes.

The two lakes are at the same level and are connected by a channel. Their inlet and outlet is the River Susa. Primary production was determined by the C14 method, and simultaneous samples were obtained for quantitative estimates of the phytoplankton. The period of study was May 1959 to May 1962, with special emphasis on the year 1961-1962. The quantitative distribution of the phytoplankton, along with the opacity of the water and the amount of primary production increased along the lake complex, with Bavelse So having the heaviest crop, the highest production and the least transparency. There were three phytoplankton maxima between April 1961 and May 1962, namely one in each spring and one in the fall. The fall maximum was dominated by Cyanophyta and the spring by diatoms. During the summer the Chlorophyceae and Ceratium were the most abundant.

J	Young, SP; Isely, JJ				Young, SP; Isely, JJ			Striped bass annual site fidelity and habitat utilization in J. Strom Thurmond reservoir, South Carolina Georgia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Forty-eight adult striped bass Morone saxatilis (3.2-19.1 kg) were captured by electrofishing in the tailrace of Richard B. Russell Dam and in the upper reaches of two major tributaries; they were implanted with temperature-sensitive radio transmitters and tracked approximately bimonthly for 20 months. As J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir downstream from the dam became thermally stratified in May, fish vacated the tributaries. From June to October, all striped bass were found within the reservoir's historical Savannah River channel. By August, most of the instrumented fish were found in the upper section of the reservoir, where optimal habitat was available throughout the summer owing to cool, artificially oxygenated hypolimnetic discharges from Richard B. Russell Dam. In mid-October the reservoir destratified, and fish dispersed from their up-reservoir summering areas and redistributed themselves throughout the reservoir. During early winter, the striped bass returned to tributary habitat or down-reservoir areas and generally used these locations throughout the winter. The fish exhibited a high degree of site fidelity to their summering areas, source tributaries (after fall dispersal and throughout the winter), and spring spawning areas. Mean movement rates were highest in the spring and fall, corresponding to the migration from tributaries in May and the return migration after fall dispersal. Mean movement rates were lowest in summer and winter, corresponding to the periods of high fidelity to summering and wintering areas. The average monthly temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations in areas used by striped bass were 19.0-20.4degreesC and 4.86-6.44 mg/L during May-October, which corresponded to average monthly habitat suitability index values of 0.76-0.98. Striped bass avoided temperatures above 25.1degreesC and dissolved oxygen concentrations less than 2.3 mg/L.																			0002-8487					SEP	2002	131	5					828	837		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0828:SBASFA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0828:SBASFA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177740600003

The distribution of established taxa from the 2 subdivisions is: in summer - 142 and 8, in spring - 124 and 8, in autumn - 73 and 3, in winter - 63 and 0, respectively. The majority of the established taxa (55 - 76 per cent) are rarely distributed along the river flow. By their numbers and biomass the green algae (predominantly Chlorococcales) occupied an important place in the river phytoplankton and in some stations they dominate over diatoms. Average numbers of the planktonic green algae varied from 2.30 x 10(5) cells/l (in winter) to 37.70 x 10(5) cells/l (in summer) and average biomass from 0.05 mg/l in autumn and 0.06 mg/l in winter to 0.34 mg/l in summer (1987/88). For Zygnemophytina this average values are 0.01 x 10(5) cells/l (in spring, summer and autumn) and 0.003 mg/l. The number of taxa, cell numbers and biomass of the green algae decrease after big industrial and port towns and increase after shallows in river arms near islands and sand strips (in summer period).

Mean total concentrations of PAHs in raw water were highest in the spring (xBAR = 27.9 ng/L) and autumn (xBAR = 21.0 ng/L) samples. The higher concentrations in the spring and in the fall are most likely caused by snow melt and increased runoff, respectively. The predominant compound is phenanthrene. High molecular weight PAHs are detected more frequently in the spring and fall samples. A mass balance equation is proposed to evaluate the relative importance of the principal sources of PAHs in the St. Lawrence River. The contributions of the principal sources of PAHs in the autumn were found to be: atmospheric deposition (52%), tributaries (17%), Great Lakes (8%) and other sources (22%). The atmospheric contribution could decrease to approximately 15% in the spring.																			0045-6535					SEP	1993	27	7					1137	1149		10.1016/0045-6535(93)90162-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-6535(93)90162-X													WOS:A1993LY92100002

The maximum permeable depth of Be-7 is 2-5mm in different seasons and locations, which is deeper in autumn than in spring, On the contrary, its apparent activity on boundary soil is higher in spring than in autumn. The Be-7 inventories in soil cores are higher in accumulative locations than in eroded one. Upper hills in the karst region are seriously eroded. Erosive intensity is higher in rainy periods than in dry ones. Influenced by the micromorphology and precipitation, the eroded particles accumulated in shallow basin after a short-distance transportation in winter and spring.

The evaluation results indicate that most MODIS data from all sites fall into the expected error ranges (+/- 0.05 +/- 0.15), with over a 66% probability that the NASA design requirements have been met. The Taihu station is an exception, accounting for only 41% of expected errors due to its lake area location and tendency to underestimate surface reflectance, thereby increasing the AOD values. Overall, the MODIS data show a good consistency and thus, are applicable for this analysis over the study area. The MODIS/Terra derived AOD at 0.55 um from 2000 to 2012 are used to analyze the spatio-temporal variation of AOD in East China. Results indicate that AODs are significantly affected by the topographic distribution. The AODs are relativity low over mountainous areas and high over plains and basins. Human activities also have a certain impact on the distribution of AOD. In addition, AODs exhibit clear seasonal variations; generally high in spring and summer, but low in autumn and winter. Combined with Angstrom exponent, aerosol particles are mainly coarse in spring and winter, but fine during summer and autumn.

In experiments, the rate of O-2 consumption and CO release, sedimentation rate and time of mineralization of phycodetritus in water from 2.5, 7.5 and >17 m depth were determined. It was found that 41% and 100% of detritus carbon (31.4 mg C dm(-3)) added to the water could be mineralized in whole water column in time 28 days during spring and 37 days during autumn homothermal conditions. In summer stratification periods 61% of the detritus carbon during 29 days, and in winter 100% during 35 days, could be mineralised down to the depth 18 m. The rate of mineralization of phycodetritus depends on temperature and activity of microflora. The differences in the rate of O-2 consumption and CO2 release between particular layers of water and seasons were statistically significant in the majority of cases.																			1505-2249						2004	52	3					247	259																WOS:000223852200001

The contribution of epipelon to total sediment microalgae in a shallow temperate eutrophic loch (Loch Leven, Scotland)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th Shallow Lakes Congress 2008	NOV 23-28, 2008	Punta del Este, URUGUAY					Benthic microalgae are known to perform important ecosystem functions in shallow lakes. As such it is important to understand the environmental variables responsible for regulating community structure, positioning and biomass. We tested the hypothesis that the positioning (across a depth gradient of 2-22 m overlying water depth) and relative biomass (determined using bulk and lens tissue harvested chlorophyll (Chl) a concentrations) of the epipelon community would vary independently with season (12 monthly samples) and across natural gradients of light and habitat disturbance relative to the total benthic algal community (i.e. all viable microalgae in the surface sediments) in a shallow eutrophic loch. Total sediment microalgal Chl a concentrations (TS-Chl; range: 5-874 mu g Chl a g(-1) dw) were highest in winter and in the deepest site (20 m overlying water depth), apparently as a result of phytoplanktonic settling and sediment focussing processes. Epipelic Chl a concentrations (Epi-Chl; range: < 0.10-6.0 mu g Chl a g(-1) dw) were highest in winter/spring, a period when water clarity was highest and TS-Chl lowest. Principal components analysis highlighted strong associations between Epi-Chl and sites of intermediate depths (2.5-5.5 m) in all seasons except autumn/winter. Autumn/winter represented the season with the highest average wind speeds preceding sampling, during which the highest Epi-Chl concentrations were associated with the deepest sites. Epi-Chl was associated with intermediate light and habitat disturbance during spring/summer and summer/autumn and varied positively with habitat disturbance, only, in autumn/winter and winter/spring. The epipelon community structure also varied with depth; diatoms dominated shallow water sediments, cyanobacteria dominated deep water sediments, and sediments at sites of intermediate depth returned the highest biovolume estimates and the most diverse communities. This study has strengthened the hypothesis that the structure and biomass of benthic microalgal communities in lakes are regulated by habitat disturbance and water clarity, both of which are expected to respond to climate change and eutrophication. The degree to which these structural responses reflect functional performance requires clarification.

The seed yield of all varieties was significantly higher from the autumn sowing in comparison with file winter and spring sown crops. Differences in seed yield related to file longer period of vegetative growth from file autumn sowing, which resulted in a significantly higher head weight prior to bolting. The low seed yield of spring-sown crops resulted from premature bolting due to the warm climatic conditions prevailing at the early stages of plant growth. The application of gibberellic acid at the 8-leaf stage promoted bolting, but only in the autumn sown crops of Parris Island and Grand Rapids did this bring about a significant increase in seed yield. The application of gibberellin at head maturity increased the height of the seed stalk, as did gibberellin application at the 8-leaf stage, but iid not affect seed yield. Unlike field grown seed crops in cooler climates, where spring sowings are favoured by a progressive increase in ambient temperature up to about 25 degreesC, under the warm climatic conditions of southern Greece, autumn sowing is indicated to avoid premature bolting.																			0952-3863					APR	2001	14	1					15	23																WOS:000171792200003

As a result of their large water surface areas, the lakes filter small time scale climatic fluctuations and respond primarily to large scale climatic fluctuations. A major change in the water balance of the region appears to have begun during the late 1960's and is continuing through the present time. The primary change in the water balance has been a sharp increase in summer and fall precipitation that began about 1965. The detailed changes in the water balance and their impacts on lake levels are discussed, as well as the implications for water resource management and socioeconomic effects.																									1998							729	737																WOS:000078339600074

Recent efforts to quantify wind erosion risk on Great Basin rangelands identified high to extreme wind erosion and dust emission hotspots. However, the spatial extent and seasonal variability of dust transport pathways from the Great Basin, and thus the local and regional dust impacts, are not well understood. Here, we computed forward air- parcel trajectories using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model using the North American Regional Reanalysis 32-km meteorological data and kernel density analysis to describe potential seasonal dust transport pathways associated with three Great Basin wind erosion hotspots. Probability mass-densities for six different heights above ground level (AGL) were estimated to describe the spatial and vertical extent of potential dust transport across North America. A large proportion of trajectories occurred within 0 - 500 m AGL in spring (25.9 %- 32.7 %), fall (33.6 %- 35.1 %), and winter (44.1 %- 53.8 %). The proportion of trajectories at 2000 - 5000 m AGL is highest in summer (32.1 %- 39.8 %) and spring (23.0 %- 23.3 %). Thus, long range west-to-east transport of dust over North America is likeliest in summer. However, local redistribution of dust near hotspots, is more likely in spring, fall, and winter. This study helps to link potential dust transport pathways to wind erosion hotspots for mitigating the local and regional impacts of dust emissions, informing rangeland management strategies, and improving air quality assessments across North America.

J	CASTENHOLZ, RW				CASTENHOLZ, RW			SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE ATTACHED ALGAE OF FRESHWATER AND SALINE LAKES IN THE LOWER GRAND COULEE, WASHINGTON	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A two year investigation of two freshwater alkaline lakes and two saline lakes in the Lower Grand Coulee has provided a quantitative and qualitative record of many of the seasonal changes occurring in the non-planktonic algae. A glass plate method satisfactorily recorded quantitative changes in the attached algae. The plates (28 by 28 cm) were submerged for 2 to 4 weeks at various depths. Dry weight and ash-free dry weight of the predominantly algal attachment materials on plates were determined, and the ash-free weight was expressed as a production rate. The ash from freshwater lakes was composed normally of intact diatom frustules. The ash from saline lakes was also diatomaceous, but the weakly silicified frustules were deformed during ashing. Proportional counts of the various species in freshwater lakes were made using the ash. The evaluation of relative dominance was based on the mathematical product of the cell count and a calculated volume factor for each species. The glass-plate production technique was examined at some length and it was concluded that a 2-week submergence period was most satisfactory, that glass was not unduly selective, that a horizontal position was satisfactory, and that the method was best suited to the freshwater lakes. In freshwater lakes (200-450 ppm T.D.S.) results clearly show a bimodal production curve with the peak generally higher in the spring than in the fall. Lowest production invariably occurred in late summer. High production values in the spring were commonly near or above 500 mg/m2/day. Comparison of the results of two years shows sizable differences in total production at comparable times of year, but the seasonal distribution of species followed the same general pattern both years. Cymbella affinis, C. cistula, C. mexicana, Diatoma elongatum, Fragilaria vaucheriae, Gomphonema eriense, Nitzchia spp., Synedra acus, and S. ulna were characteristic spring dominants in the freshwater lakes. These diatoms were replaced in summer mainly by Epithemia sorex, E. turgida, and Rhopalodia gibba. A few "spring" species were common in one lake in summer but only at greater depths. The summer period was also characterized by a great abundance of Cladophora, Spirogyra, Oscillatoria, and members of the Chlorococcales. The dominant summer diatoms usually remained through the fall and were joined at that time by several of the "spring" species. In winter diatom production was generally low, but Ulothrix clothed rocks in Falls Lake even under an ice cover. Nine per cent of the 275 algal taxa collected in the Lower Grand Coulee occurred in both freshwater and saline lakes. Although the saline lakes were not rich in numbers of species, production rates were similar to and even higher than production rates in the freshwater lakes. In the two saline lakes (Lake Lenore[long dash]10,000 ppm and Soap Lake[long dash]25,000 ppm) there was a pronounced diatom pulse in the fall. Production rate values as high as 550 mg/m2/day were achieved during this season. In Soap Lake a winter pulse reached a value of 1000 mg/m2/day which was followed by a distinct spring pulse, both absent in Lake Lenore. The dominants on glass plates in both lakes were species of Nitzschia and Amphora. Blue-green algae were also common and were conspicuous for their lack of seasonality.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1960	5	1					1	28																WOS:A1960WU64100001

Five areas were sampled monthly from March 1996 to December 1998. Following an increasing level of eutrophication, increases in both total species richness and Euglenophyte populations were observed, as well as a progressive substitution of Oscillatoriean Cyanophytes by Nostocalean ones. The dominant species were Planktothrix agardhii (GOMONT) ANAGNOSTIDIS & KOMAREK, Peridinium willei HUITFELDKAAS, Cryptomonas erosa EHRENBERG, Cyclotella meneghiniana KUTZING and Anabaena sphaerica BORNET & FLAHAULT. The only similarities between areas were the extremely eutrophic conditions and the algal flora, but the structural features of these assemblages lacked a common pattern among sites. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index embraced one of the widest ranges yet noted for wetlands (10(-2) and 4 bits/mm(3), average in different areas was 1.6-2.2 bits/mm(3)). Phytoplankton biomass tended to increase in humid years (1997-1998). Biovolume average ranged from 4-14 mm(3)/L and peaked in late summer, with the lowest values in winter-spring. No relationships were found among nutrient concentrations, zooplankton abundance and phytoplankton biovolume. Only two areas (the more isolated, so the less disturbed) showed a clear-cut pattern: the first, a eutrophic euryhaline pond with the highest diversity in winter-spring, supporting small pennate diatoms and cryptophytes followed by big blue-green filaments in summer and colonial chorophytes in autumn; the second was a perturbed pond with the highest diversity in summer-autumn, when a miscellany of large-sized algae occurred, followed by blooms of Cryptomonas in winter. Phytoplankton assemblage dynamics displayed quite stochastic trajectories due to grazing, allelopathy and alternating self-organization processes, resulting from interaction between the hydrology and shallow morphology of a semiarid wetland. Phytoplankton dynamics in a wetland are more complex than in lakes due to the large number of interacting factors. A conceptual ecological model for algal dynamics follows.

NUTRIENT LOADING AND SPATIAL-TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF PHYTOPLANKTON GUILDS IN A SOUTHERN ITALIAN COASTAL LAGOON (LAKE ALIMINI GRANDE, OTRANTO, ITALY)	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												The importance of external and internal P-loading to the structural organization and dynamics of phytoplankton guilds in a Southern Italy coastal lagoon (Lake Alimini Grande) was investigated. To this end, phosphorus external loading through localized freshwater inputs was measured, P-release through detritus decomposition on sediments was evaluated, and phytoplankton abundance, biomass and taxonomic composition were quantified at 33 sites and 12 sampling times from September 1998 to September 1999. P-loading in the area was greater in the winter (26.5 mu M P m(-2) d(-1)) than in the summer (18.4 mu M P m(-2) d(-1)). In the winter, external inputs were 61.7% of the total, while in summer, internal inputs accounted for 99.8% of the total. Phytoplankton biomass was related to P inputs. In particular, the spatial distribution of phytoplankton biomass was related to external inputs in winter-spring, and to internal inputs in summer-autumn. A total of 228 phytoplankton taxa were identified of which 13 taxa accounted for more than 80% of phytoplankton abundance. The spatial and temporal dynamics of 13 taxa were related to P-availability and habitat heterogeneity.

However, studies on changes in environmental factors and plankton community fluctuations remain limited. This study analyzed the seasonal physicochemical factors and changes in the phytoplankton community structure in Lake Uiam (2015-2016). Organic matter, phosphorus, total suspended solids (TSS), and Chl-a concentrations were high in the summer. Seasonal changes in the dominant taxa followed the typical succession pattern of temperate phytoplankton, with Bacillariophyceae (Ulnaria acus) being dominant in spring and Cyanophyceae (Pseudanabaena limnetica) dominant in summer. However, Cryptophyceae (Rhodomonas sp.) showed unusually high dominance in autumn. Cell abundance showed no seasonal differences. Rhodomonas sp. was negatively correlated with water temperature, suggesting its dominance in spring and autumn. Cryptophyceae showed a significant correlation with Chl-a (0.708 **), indicating its contribution to spring Chl-a concentrations. Cryptophyceae (Rhodomonas sp. and Cryptomonas spp.) commonly appear in spring but are dominant in autumn in Lake Uiam. Despite disturbances from various environmental factors, they showed higher adaptability than other algae, resulting in their consistent appearance and dominance, differing from the general succession patterns of temperate phytoplankton.					; Hwang, Sunjin/AAK-7149-2020	Sim, Youn Bo/0000-0003-2317-8146; Hwang, Soon-Jin/0000-0001-7083-5036														2073-4441				DEC	2023	15	23							4118	10.3390/w15234118	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15234118													WOS:001116730800001

Here, we present the atmo-spheric CH4 record from three stations in Suzhou, China, which is located in the famous economic developed zone, with wetland coverage about 20%. The study found that although significant variations in CH4 concen-trations across different regions within the Suzhou city, the mean values of the three sites could represent the atmospheric CH4 levels in Suzhou. The annual mean CH4 value in 2021 was significantly higher than that in 2020, with a growth of 8.02 ppb yr-1. CH4 followed a seasonal pattern, with low values in the spring and winter, and peak values in the autumn and summer. However, there were trough and surge values over time, which occurred in summer and winter in both year. These results highlighted that huge amounts of OH radicals accumulated when the summer extended a period of drought and heat, aggravating CH4 consumption and lowering concentration. Moreover, methanogens in subtropical areas might not be impacted by winter's lower temperatures. The CH4 significantly decreased exponentially with the increased wind speed, positively correlated with air temperature in spring and negatively correlated with atmospheric pressure. Taihu Lake, lied in the WNW, W, WSW and SW winds sectors with high concentration of CH4, is a local source. The Yellow Sea and the East China Sea where have some distance from Suzhou are important regional sources to the CH4.

The occurrence of Naegleria fowleri in recreational waters in Arizona	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amoeba found in waters in warmer regions that causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, a rare but almost universally fatal disease. The goal of this project was to assess the occurrence of N. fowleri and other thermophilic amoebae in 33 recreational surface waters across Arizona to determine if their presence could be correlated with seasonal or other environmental factors. First, 1-L grab samples were collected over two years and analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and amoebae viability. Seasonality was observed, with N. fowleri and thermophilic amoebae (20% and 30%, respectively) being detected more often in the winter and spring combined than in the summer and fall combined (7.9% and 9.5%, respectively). The spring and fall both had an average temperature of 18 degrees C, yet had different occurrence data (18.2% versus 5.9% for N. fowleri, respectively; 27.3% versus 0% for viable amoebae, respectively). These results are in stark contrast to previous studies in which N. fowleri has been found almost exclusively during warmer months. Over the two-year study, N. fowleri was detected in six and thermophilic amoebae in eight of the 33 recreational water bodies. Five of these were lakes near Phoenix that tested positive for N. fowleri and thermophilic amoebae over multiple seasons. These lakes differed significantly (P <= 0.05) from the other 28 surface waters, with a lower average temperature in the spring, a higher temperature in the fall, a higher pH and turbidity in the summer, and a lower electro-conductivity in the spring. They also had lower Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacteria levels during colder months. Future N. fowleri monitoring in Arizona should focus on these five lakes to further elucidate the factors that contribute to the low occurrence of this amoeba in the summer or which might explain why these lakes appear to be reservoirs for the organism.

Hydrodynamic controls on sediment retention in an emerging diversion-fed delta	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The morphodynamics of river-dominated deltas are largely controlled by the supply and retention of sediment within deltaic wetlands and the rate of relative sea-level rise. Yet, sediment budgets for deltas are often poorly constrained. In the Mississippi River Delta, a system rapidly losing land due to natural and anthropogenic causes, restoration efforts seek to build new land through the use of river diversions. At the Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion, a new crevasse splay has emerged since construction was completed in 2002. Here, we use beryllium-7 activity in sediment cores and USGS measurements of discharge and turbidity to calculate seasonal sediment input, deposition, and retention within the vegetated Davis Pond receiving basin. In winter/spring 2015, which included an experimental period of high discharge through the diversion, Davis Pond received 106,800 metric tons of sediment, 44% of which was retained within the basin. During this time, mean flow velocity was 0.21 m s(-1) and mean turbidity was 56 formazin nephelometric units (FNU). In summer/fall 2015, the Davis Pond basin received 35,900 metric tons of sediment, 81% of which was retained. Mean flow velocity in summer/fall was 0.10 m s(-1) and mean turbidity was 55 FNU. The increase in sediment retention from winter/spring 2015 to summer/fall 2015 may be due in part to the corresponding drop in water flow velocity, which allowed more sediment to settle out of suspension. Although high water discharge increases sediment input and deposition, increased turbulence associated with higher current velocity appears to increase sediment throughput and thereby decrease the sediment trapping efficiency. Sediment retention in Davis Pond is on the high end of the range seen in deltaic wetlands, perhaps due to the enclosed geometry of the receiving basin. Future diversion design and operation should target moderate water discharge and flow velocities in order to jointly maximize sediment deposition and retention and provide optimal conditions for delta growth.

Seasonal variation in CPUE and Wr occurred for all fish species. Northern pike CPUE declined from spring until fall. Black crappie CPUE was highest in the spring and fall. Yellow perch and walleye CPUE peaked during the summer. Seasonal variation in mean Wr was similar for all fish species-mean Wr declined from spring to early summer then increased until early fall. Fisheries biologists should consider seasonal variation associated with CPUE and Wr during the assessment of sampling data.

The main objective was to study the temporal variability in fish size and biomass in Lake Constance during 1993. This lake currently undergoes a re-oliogotrophication process, and is dominated greatly in its pelagic fish fauna by European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). The results showed that changes in target strength distribution presented a marked trend to unimodal TS-distributions during winter and spring, whereas the distribution was bimodal from early summer to fall. These patterns relate to the recruitment, growth, and first summer mortality of age-0 whitefish in the pelagic zone. Regarding results on biomass abundance patterns, a doubling of the pelagic fish biomass was observed from spring to summer and a successive decrease thereafter during fall. These seasonal changes in biomass mainly were the product of growth of whitefish 1+ and 2+ year-classes, which have maximal growth in this coregonid population. Decreasing total fish biomass during fall, however, was most likely related to heavier fishing pressure during the 2nd half of the year. Monthly commercial whitefish yields (from records of fishermen) were positively correlated to the actual standing stock of fish measured acoustically. The ratio of total annual yield to the average fish standing stock was found to be 84 %, giving evidence for a relatively high fishing pressure in this lake.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						227	236																WOS:000078180200023

During the investigation period, from November 1988 till October 1991 there were prominent spring maxima in March and April. A second but shorter peak was observed in May 1989 and June 1991. During the summer, the least amount of periphyton biomass was found on the stems. Throughout the year, the diatoms usually accounted for the most biovolume. Only in late spring or early summer, when the PAR (photosynthetic active radiation) was greatest within the Phragmites belt, they were displaced by chlorophytes. Only low volumes of cyanobacteria were present, and this group was never predominant. Adnate bacillariophyceaen and chlorophyceaen species were predominated during fall and winter, and loosely attached species displaced them during the other seasons. Biomass production and algal succession displaced great regularity throughout the three years of the investigation.																			0003-9136					JAN	1994	129	3					273	292																WOS:A1994MW08900002

We studied accumulation, composition and content of fatty acids in planktivorous vendace (Coregonus albula) muscle tissue during the summer feeding period (May to late September) in six boreal lakes. Vendace muscle fatty acid content increased from similar to 17.7mg/g DW to similar to 28.1mg/g DW from spring to summer, corresponding to a similar to 59% increase in total fatty acids. PUFA accounted for 45%-65% of all fatty acids, and the most abundant fatty acid was docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3). The DHA content remained relatively constant throughout the sampling period (similar to 7-8mg/g DW), but the proportion of DHA decreased from similar to 40% in spring to similar to 30% in summer and autumn. The decrease in DHA proportion was due to accumulation of other fatty acids, primarily C-18 PUFA (predominantly synthetised by algae) and monounsaturated fatty acids. A similar fatty acid accumulation pattern was observed in lipid storing copepods, an important prey for planktivorous vendace. The abundance of bacterial and terrestrial biomarker fatty acids in vendace muscle and prey items was low (<5% and <0.1% respectively). The increase in weight and the deposition of internal energy stores in vendace were achieved predominantly by algae-based food chain. This has ecological implications, as vendace requires sufficient lipid stores for reproduction in autumn and survival over winter.

Tangxun Lake, a typical Large urban lake in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, has experienced cultural eutrophication in recent years; however, few studies have comprehensively examined the water quality of this lake. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the water quality of the Tangxun Lake Basin using the Nemerow pollution index, principal component analysis (PCA), phytoplankton density and diversity, and the comprehensive trophic level index (TLI). Additionally, we analyzed the main influencing factors to provide a reference for the management of the aquatic environment of Tangxun Lake. The Nemerow pollution index evaluation showed that the annual degree of pollution in Tangxun Lake ranged from mild to heavy. The PCA results showed that the main pollution factors affecting water quality were total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN). According to the results of TLI, the water in Tangxun Lake was moderately to severely eutrophic. Evaluation of algal cell density showed that Tangxun Lake was mesotrophic, and the phytoplankton diversity index showed that the eutrophication level was high. The degree of pollution in Tangxun Lake varied seasonally and was in the order of spring > winter > summer > autumn. The pollution in inner Tangxun Lake was relatively serious in spring, summer, and autumn, whereas that in outer Tangxun Lake was more serious in winter. This study provides a scientific basis for the comprehensive management of the ecological environment in the Tangxun Lake Basin.

We examined the annual dynamics of picoplankton abundance and composition in the lake in order to establish if the picoeukaryotes merely survive the harsher winter conditions or they are able to grow in the ice-covered lake when the entire phytoplankton is limited by low light and temperature. Lake Balaton has an annual temperature range of 1-29A degrees C, and it is usually frozen between December and February for 30-60 days. In the spring-autumn period phycocyanin and phycoerythrin rich Cyanobacteria are the dominant picoplankters, and picoeukaryotes are negligible. Our five-year study shows the presence of three types of picophytoplankton assemblages in Lake Balaton: (1) Phycoerythrin-rich Cyanobacteria-the dominant summer picoplankters in the mesotrophic lake area; (2) Phycocyanin-rich Cyanobacteria-the most abundant summer picoplankters in the eutrophic lake area and; (3) Picoeukaryotes-the dominant winter picoplankters in the whole lake. The observed winter abundance of picoeukaryotes was high (up to 3 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)), their highest biomass (520 mu g l(-1)) exceeded the maximum summer biomass of picocyanobacteria (500 mu g l(-1)). Our results indicate that the winter predominance of picoeukaryotes is a regular phenomenon in Lake Balaton, irrespective of the absence or presence of the ice cover. Picoeukaryotes are able to grow at as low as 1-2A degrees C water temperature, while the total phytoplankton biomass show the lowest annual values in the winter period. In agreement with earlier findings, the contribution of picocyanobacteria to the total phytoplankton biomass in Lake Balaton is inversely related to the total phytoplankton biomass, whereas no such relationship was observable in the case of picoeukaryotes.

Of the two recognized discrete flyways of the Bar-headed Goose, the Eastern Tibetan Flyway (ETF) is the larger, comprising at least six migration routes. However, we remain ignorant about their migratory connectivity, habitat use and effectiveness of site-safeguard mechanisms set in place for the species. Methods We tracked 30 ETF Bar-headed Geese from Chinese and Mongolian breeding areas to their wintering grounds using GPS/GSM transmitters, to determine their migration routes and stopover staging patterns within the QTP, overlaying these upon GIS layers of protected area status and habitat type, to model their habitat selection. Results In total, 14 tagged Bar-headed Geese provided information on their entire autumn migration and 4 geese on their entire spring migration. Qinghai Lake marked birds overwintered in the QTP (n = 2), geese tagged in Mongolia wintered either in the QTP (n = 3) or in India/Bangladesh (n = 9), representing three of the migration routes within the ETF. In total, tagged birds staged at 79 different stopover sites within QTP in autumn and 23 in spring, of which 65% (autumn) and 59% (spring) of all fixes fell within the boundaries of either National Nature Reserves (NNRs) or Important Birds Areas (IBAs) in the QTP. Bar-headed Geese predominantly occurred on four land-cover types: grassland (mostly by day), water bodies (at night), wetlands and bare substrates (salt flats, dry lake/river substrates and plough) with little change in proportion. Generalized linear mixed models comparing presence with pseudo-absence data suggested geese strongly selected for wetlands as staging habitat, avoiding bare substrates in spring. Conclusions Based on our limited observations of these tagged geese, this study is the first to show that the current designated National Nature Reserves in place in the staging areas within the QTP appear adequate to protect this increasing population. In addition, Hala Lake in Qinghai Province and adjacent areas used as initial QTP staging during autumn migration (currently outside of designated as NNRs/IBAs) are recommended for protection, based on their use by tagged birds from this study. Habitat modelling confirmed the importance of natural wetlands as feeding areas and safe areas of open water as roosting places.					; Damba, Iderbat/I-5018-2018; Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-7066-2015	Zhang, Junjian/0009-0006-0643-6579; Damba, Iderbat/0000-0001-7274-3960; Xie, YanBo/0009-0000-5548-512X; Batbayar, Nyambayar/0000-0002-9138-9626; Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303													2053-7166					DEC 8	2020	11	1							49	10.1186/s40657-020-00230-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-020-00230-9													WOS:000597269000001
J	Ge, YX; Abuduwaili, J; Ma, L; Wu, N; Liu, DW				Ge, Yongxiao; Abuduwaili, Jilili; Ma, Long; Wu, Na; Liu, Dongwei			Potential transport pathways of dust emanating from the playa of Ebinur Lake, Xinjiang, in arid northwest China	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												In this paper, the HYSPLIT model, driven with reanalysis meteorological data from 1978 to 2013, was used to understand the potential transport characteristics of dust and salt dust emanating from the playa of Ebinur Lake in arid northwest China. Daily air parcel trajectories were computed forward for 8 days from an origin centered over Ebinur Lake at 100 m above ground level. Air parcel trajectory density plots were mapped for seven levels: 0-100 m agl., 100-500 m agl., 500-1000 m agl., 1000-1500 m agl., 1500-2000 m agl., 2000-3000 m agl., and 3000-5000 m agl. These show that potential dust transport pathways have clear seasonal differentiation. The potential transport distance of dust and salt dust is greatest in spring and summer. In autumn and winter, the potential transport of the high-density air trajectory is below 1000 m traveling a shorter distance. Potential dust transport pathways showed notifying directivity in different seasons and heights. Southeast in spring and summer, and north to northeast in autumn and winter are the two main potential transport channels of dust and salt dust. Accordingly, dust and salt dust from the playa of Ebinur Lake may influence the atmospheric processes and biogeochemical cycles of a vast region. The main area of influence of dust and salt dust is close to the source area, and will significantly accelerate the melting of snow and ice in the Tianshan Mountains. This highlights the urgent need to combine remote sensing, isotope and other methods to further research the transport characteristics of dust and salt dust from the playa of the Ebinur lake.

Here, we analyzed the population structure and the morphological and dietary plasticity of four populations of P. parva across the four seasons within the Arno River basin in Central Italy. We found that the studied populations were morphologically different, suggesting multiple introductions or adaptation to different environmental conditions. In all populations, males were bigger and, overall, more frequent than females. The gonadosomatic index showed a similar pattern across all populations, with higher spring and summer values, indicating a long reproductive period. The diet of P. parva considerably varied across populations and seasons, suggesting a high degree of spatio-temporal trophic plasticity. Diet breadth varied among seasons, being more specialized in spring and summer and more opportunistic during autumn and winter. Our results highlight high trophic plasticity in the invasive populations of P. parva, potentially impacting multiple native taxa.

Each spring, adult threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense) immigrate into Deer Island Lake from the river. These shad spawn and their young temporarily increase the trophic carrying capacity for piscivorous bass. In the spring and summer of 1973, yearling (1972 yr-class) bass grew rapidly while feeding on the abundant young shad. When all sizes of shad became scarce in the autumn and winter, these bass switched to an inadequate supply of crayfish and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) forage. Although fry and adult shad were again abundant in the spring of 1974, they were either too small to provide acceptable forage or too large for consumption by the (now 2 yr old) bass. Rising water temperatures between May and June increased the metabolic requirements of these bass resulting in their deaths presumably from starvation.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1978	100	1					116	125		10.2307/2424782	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424782													WOS:A1978FS05700011

Plerocercoids were acquired by the fish primarily during the summer when subsurface water temperatures (0-20 ft) were at an annual maximum. Intensities of infection were generally higher in rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) from Goodwin Lake than in rainbows from Shoecraft and Silver lakes in each season. Comparison of infections in rainbows with that in other species of salmonids in Goodwin Lake revealad distinctly lower intensities in lacustrine coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). but only slightly lower intensities (one season of observations) in cutthroat (Salmo clarki). and brook (Salvelinus fontinalis) trout. These differences were probably relative to feeding rates of each species on zooplankton. Chronic mortalities occurred in association with warm temperatures during the initial spring, summer, and fall after the fish were planted, when plerocercoid development was comparatively rapid and the fish were relatively small. An epizootic, however, occurred in Goodwin Lake in the winter of 1963-64, when infections reached an average of 78 plerocercoids/fish in spring-plant rainbows, 140 in fall-plant rainbows, and 38 in spring-plant cohos. The factors responsible for this outbreak remain unknown. Considerations for the control of infections in salmonids based on the parasite''s life cycle and host relationships are discussed.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1967	31	4					813	+		10.2307/3797989	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3797989													WOS:A1967A167700024

High prey availability, low predation and competition and comparatively better light under snow and ice in shallow compared with deep water are probable reasons. At ice break in June, all Arctic charr moved to the profundal zone for a brief period, probably in response to the sudden light increase and a profundal resource peak of chironomid pupae. In the summer, the Arctic charr are found in the pelagic, profundal and littoral zones of the lakes. These populations therefore perform regular habitat shifts between the littoral zone in the winter, the profundal zone at ice break and the whole lake in the summer and autumn. The fish fed continuously during winter despite the cold water and the poor light. Amphipods and chironomid larvae dominated the diet. Catch per unit effort, numbers of stomachs with food and food intake rates varied with the subarctic light cycle but were lowest after the winter solstice. The winter assimilation of energy was about equal to the standard metabolism in Takvatn but was higher in Fjellfrosvatn. The assimilation increased in both lakes under the spring ice in May. The habitat choice, diet and energy assimilation indicate that the Arctic charr is well adapted to the extreme winter conditions of subarctic lakes.

Michael			Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Winter-Spring Oxygen Depletion in Chesapeake Bay Bottom Water	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Although seasonal hypoxia is a well-studied phenomenon in many coastal systems, most previous studies have only focused on variability and controls on low-oxygen water masses during warm months when hypoxia is most extensive. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to investigations of what controls the development of hypoxic water in the months leading up to seasonal oxygen minima in temperate ecosystems. Thus, we investigated aspects of winter-spring oxygen depletion using a 25-year time series (1985-2009) by computing rates of water column O-2 depletion and the timing of hypoxia onset for bottom waters of Chesapeake Bay. On average, hypoxia (O-2 < 62.5 mu M) initiated in the northernmost region of the deep, central channel in early May and extended southward over ensuing months; however, the range of hypoxia onset dates spanned > 50 days (April 6 to May 31 in the upper Bay). O-2 depletion rates were consistently highest in the upper Bay, and elevated Susquehanna River flow resulted in more rapid O-2 depletion and earlier hypoxia onset. Winter-spring chlorophyll a concentration in the bottom water was highly correlated with interannual variability in hypoxia onset dates and water column O-2 depletion rates in the upper and middle Bay, while stratification strength was a more significant driver in the timing of lower Bay hypoxia onset. Hypoxia started earlier in 2012 (April 6) than previously recorded, which may be related to unique climatic and biological conditions in the winter-spring of 2012, including the potential carryover of organic matter delivered to the system during a tropical storm in September 2011. In general, mid-to-late summer hypoxic volumes were not correlated to winter-spring O-2 depletion rates and onset, suggesting that the maintenance of summer hypoxia is controlled more by summer algal production and physical forcing than winter-spring processes. This study provides a novel synthesis of O-2 depletion rates and hypoxia onset dates for Chesapeake Bay, revealing controls on the phenology of hypoxia development in this estuary.					kemp, Michael/F-9955-2013; Testa, Jeremy/C-7189-2013	Testa, Jeremy/0000-0003-0027-9761													1559-2723	1559-2731				NOV	2014	37	6					1432	1448		10.1007/s12237-014-9775-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-014-9775-8													WOS:000343722700010
J	Piao, SL; Fang, JY; Chen, AP				Piao, SL; Fang, JY; Chen, AP			Seasonal dynamics of terrestrial net primary production in response to climate changes in China	ACTA BOTANICA SINICA												Study on seasonal responses of terrestrial net primary production (NPP) to climate changes is to help understand feedback between climate systems and terrestrial ecosystems and mechanisms of increased NPP in the northern middle and high latitudes. In this study, time series dataset of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and corresponding ground-based information on vegetation, climate, soil, and solar radiation, together with an ecological process model, were used to explore the seasonal trends of terrestrial NPP and their geographical differences in China from 1982 to 1999. As the results,. seasonal total NPP in China showed a significant increase for all four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter) during the past 18 years. The spring NPP indicated the largest increase rate, while the summer NPP was with the largest increase in magnitude. The response of NPP to climate changes varied with different vegetation types. The increased NPP was primarily led by an advanced growing season for broadleaf evergreen forest, needle-leaf evergreen forest, and needle-leaf deciduous forest, whilst that was mainly due to enhanced vegetation activity (amplitude of growth cycle) during growing season for broadleaf deciduous forest, broadleaf and needle-leaf mixed forest, broadleaf trees with groundcover, perennial grasslands, broadleaf shrubs with grasslands, tundra, desert, and cultivation. The regions with the largest increase in spring NPP appeared mainly in eastern China, while the areas with the largest increase in summer NPP occurred in most parts of Northwestern China, Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, Mts. Xiaoxinganling-Changbaishan, Sanjiang Plain, Songliao Plain, Sichuan Basin, Leizhou Peninsula, part of the middle and lower Yangtze River, and southeastern mountainous areas of China. In autumn, the largest NPP increase appeared in Yunnan Plateau-Eastern Xizang and the areas around Hulun Lake. Such different ways of the NPP responses depended on regional climate attributes and their changes.

In total, 20 copepod species were identified. Density of copepods was high in spring and low in winter. Mesocyclops edax was the dominant species in summer, monsoon and fall, while Ectocyclops phaleratus and Eucyclops agilis were dominant in winter and spring respectively. Impact of selected physico-chemical parameters on population dynamics of copepods was also studied. Copepods density was positively correlated with temperature, pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and turbidity and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO). Shannon-Weaver diversity index, Simpson index, Pielou's evenness index, and Margalef index were calculated to find out diversity of copepods. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant difference (F=22.36, P=0.000) in copepods density of all seasons. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to find out correlation between copepod species and seasons.

An in-situ light-dark bottle method was used to investigate the spatiotemporal differences of phosphorus release potential of bloom-forming cyanobacteria (BFC) in Lake Taihu. Generalized additive model analysis (GAM) of field data revealed that the phosphorus release potential of BFC increased with the upregulation of Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) content per cell, which was further validated by the laboratory experiment results. We deduced that the accumulation of Chl-a content per cell might be an essential index of high phosphorus release potential of BFC. The phosphorus release potential of BFC was much higher in summer and autumn than that in spring and winter, while the phosphorus absorption potential increased with the rising of temperature. The distinct physiological status of BFC at different seasons brought about their variation in phosphorus release potential. Additionally, high phosphorus release potential of BFC region mainly concentrated in the eastern and the central, northwest, western, and the south of Lake Taihu in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. Further studies showed that the spatial differences in phosphorus release potential of BFC were most probably due to the horizontal drift of BFC driven by the prevailing wind. Collectively, the synergism of BFC's physiological status and horizontal drift determined the spatiotemporal differences of phosphorus release potential of BFC in Lake Taihu. Moreover, apparent spatiotemporal differences in phosphorus release potential of BFC were essential factors that induced the distinct distribution of total phosphorus in Lake Taihu. This study provides insight for exploring the reason for the constant increase of total dissolved phosphorus concentration and cyanobacterial density in Lake Taihu for the past 5 years.

J	Beletsky, D; Schwab, DJ				Beletsky, D; Schwab, DJ			Modeling circulation and thermal structure in Lake Michigan: Annual cycle and interannual variability	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A three-dimensional primitive equation numerical model was applied to Lake Michigan for the periods 1982-1983 and 1994-1995 to study seasonal and interannual variability of lake-wide circulation and thermal structure in the lake. The model was able to reproduce all of the basic features of the thermal structure in Lake Michigan: spring thermal bar, full stratification, deepening of the thermocline during the fall cooling, and finally, an overturn in the late fall. Large-scale circulation patterns tend to be cyclonic (counterclockwise), with cyclonic circulation within each subbasin. The largest currents and maximum cyclonic vorticity occur in the fall and winter when temperature gradients are low but wind stresses are strongest. The smallest currents and minimum cyclonic vorticity occur in spring and summer when temperature gradients are strong but wind stresses are weakest. All these facts are in agreement with observations. The main shortcoming of the model was that it tended to predict a more diffuse thermocline than was indicated by observations and explained only up to half of the variance observed in horizontal currents at timescales shorter than a day.					; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012	Beletsky, Dmitry/0000-0003-4532-0588; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				SEP 15	2001	106	C9					19745	19771		10.1029/2000JC000691	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000JC000691													WOS:000170956800016

Diaphragms were examined for Trichinella spiralis and gastrointestinal tracts for other helminth parasites. Ten species were found including 7 nematodes (T. spiralis, Physaloptera rara, Arthrocephalus lotoris, Molineus barbatus, Baylisascaris procyonis, Gnathostoma procyonis. Dtacunculus insignis), 2 cestodes (Mesocestoides variables, Atriotaenia procyonis), and 1 acanthocephalan (Macracanthorhynchus ingens). Dracunculus insignis is reported from Tennessee and Kentucky raccoons for the first time. Of the parasites detected, only T. spiralis showed a statistically significant preference for one sex (male) over the other. It was also the only parasite found in greater prevalence in relation to age classes (highest in age classes III and IV). Arthrocephalus lotoris, M. barbatus, B. procyonis, M. ingens, and D. insignis all had seasonal trends in prevalence, and winter intensity of parasites was found to be most similar to that of spring, spring to summer, and summer to fall.																			0022-3395	1937-2345					1985	71	5					599	603		10.2307/3281431	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3281431													WOS:A1985AUR0900014
J	Adrian, R; Deneke, R				Adrian, R; Deneke, R			Possible impact of mild winters on zooplankton succession in eutrophic lakes of the Atlantic European area	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We report on a long-term study (1975-94) of water temperatures and plankton in a eutrophic lake (Heiligensee, Berlin, Germany). Using a phenomenological approach, we use historical data to infer how an increase in air temperature has influenced a natural zooplankton community. 2. Air temperatures in Berlin showed a significantly rising trend between 1975 and 1994. Mean winter air temperatures in the last 8 years always exceeded the long-term mean. 3. A rising trend was also found for April water temperature, which increased significantly beginning in 1988-89. An increase of 2.58 degrees C in the last 21 years was recorded using a linear model. A significantly decreasing trend was found in June but no trend was noted for the other summer months. 4. Phytoplankton composition shifted from a dominance of diatoms and cryptophytes during winter and spring in the 1980s towards a dominance of cyanobacteria in 1990-94. 5. The dominant zooplankton species in spring shifted in recent years from the large-bodied Daphnia galeata to the smaller D. cucullata. Cyclops kolensis, previously the only invertebrate predator during winter, decreased in abundance while C. vicinus, usually present during spring and autumn, increased in abundance and was numerous during winter, a season passed in diapause in the earlier years. 6. Because direct and indirect temperature effects are species specific, we put forward the hypothesis that zooplankton species, rather than functional groups, are the nexus between environmental stress, such as rising air temperatures, and ecosystem changes.																			0046-5070					DEC	1996	36	3					757	770		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00126.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00126.x													WOS:A1996WA16200024
J	Maes, J; Tackx, M; Soetaert, K				Maes, J; Tackx, M; Soetaert, K			The predation impact of juvenile herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus on estuarine zooplankton	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The consumption of estuarine copepods by juvenile herring and sprat during estuarine residency was estimated using fish biomass data and daily rations calculated from two models of feeding in fish: a bioenergetic model and a gastric evacuation model. The bioenergetic model predicted daily rations that were, on average, three times higher than those estimated by a model based on field records of stomach contents. The biomass of herring and sprat in the estuary was negatively correlated with the daily ration suggesting that the clupeid fish populations were resource-limited. Copepod production decreased towards the winter and peaked in spring and summer. The relative importance of predation changed seasonally in function of the migration pattern of herring and sprat. In the spring and the summer, in situ production of copepod biomass was higher than the in situ consumption by fish. During the fall and the winter, consumption exceeded production. This suggests that top-down control exerted by marine pelagic fish may be an important force structuring estuarine copepod populations.					soetaert, karline/A-9839-2011; Soetaert, Karline/A-9839-2011; Maes, Joachim/ABG-8549-2020	soetaert, karline/0000-0003-4603-7100; Maes, Joachim/0000-0002-8272-1607; 													0018-8158					MAY 15	2005	540						225	235		10.1007/s10750-004-7146-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-7146-3													WOS:000231804400016

ANIMALS												Simple Summary African Swine fever is present on the African, European and Asian continents, causing devastating economic impact due to the mandatory mass depopulation in confirmed outbreaks. Using the data reported by the Romanian National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority, we created a database with all the localities from Romania where the outbreaks were confirmed between 2020 and 2021 as well as the geoclimatic features of those areas. The database was then used to statistically analyze the frequency of confirmed outbreaks in relation with specific climatic and environmental factors. Our results show that such studies need to be continued in order to have a better understanding of the geoclimatic risk factors in the transmission of African swine fever virus. African swine fever has a significant economic, social and environmental impact due to official regulation of the disease, namely the mass depopulation of all pigs in confirmed outbreaks. The main objective of the present study was to statistically analyze the possible correlation between the number of outbreaks and infected pigs from backyard farms with the altitude, seasonal average annual humidity, and average temperature during spring, summer, autumn and winter, as well as the distance from forests, rivers, and lakes in Romania. The study included all infected backyard pigs with African swine fever virus (n = 7764) and outbreaks (n = 404) that occurred in Romania between 6 February 2020 and 2 March 2021. The number of infected pigs and ASF outbreaks were significantly higher in localities at altitudes between 100 and 500 m, average annual humidity between 60% and 80%, average spring temperature between 10 and 14 degrees C, average summer temperature between 16 and 22 degrees C, average autumn temperature between 10 and 13 degrees C, average winter temperatures between -1 and 2 degrees C, and at distances of less than 5 km from the forests, less than 15 km from lakes and less than 5 km from the rivers. The number of affected pigs decreased significantly at summer temperatures below 16 degrees C.

J	SWINK, WD				SWINK, WD			GROWTH AND SURVIVAL OF NEWLY PARASITIC SEA LAMPREYS AT REPRESENTATIVE WINTER TEMPERATURES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Larval sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus begin to metamorphose into their parasitic phase in July and migrate to the Great Lakes either in autumn, when they immediately feed on fish, or in spring after overwintering in the stream substrate. Survival and growth of newly parasitic autumn migrants (mean weight, 4.18 g) differed significantly between temperature treatments when sea lampreys were held over winter and allowed to feed on longnose suckers Catostomus catostomus at either the maximum available temperature (similar to 4 degrees C) or normal surface temperature (minimum <1 degrees C) in the Great Lakes during winter. Survival from December 1990 to June 1991 was 60% for the animals held in the warmer water but only 30% for the animals held in the colder water until 23 April. The average increase in weight was 8.23 g for the 35 survivors in the warmer water but only 5.15 g for the 17 survivors in the colder water. Average increases in weight from December to May for sea lampreys at both temperatures were 3.8 to 6.6 times greater than increases reported previously. A newly metamorphosed sea lamprey that migrates to the Great Lakes in autumn could be 2.5 to 3 times larger in June than one that overwinters in the stream substrate, where it cannot feed, and migrates in spring. Hence, autumn migrants may have an advantage in growth and survival over spring migrants, particularly if food supply is adequate in the warmest stratum of the lake during winter.																			0002-8487					MAY	1995	124	3					380	386		10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0380:GASONP>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0380:GASONP>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995QW86900009

The fuctional groups, J (Desmodesmus communis), X1 (Selenastrum bibraianum), L-O (Ceratium hirundinella), P (Staurastrum pingue) and H1 (Anabaena crassa) dominated phytoplankton in summer, W2 (Trachelomonas volvocina), X1 (S. bibraianum) and L-O (C. hirundinella) in fall, MP (Hantzschia amphioxys), D (Synedra acus), J (D. communis) and P (Fragilaria crotonensis) in winter, H1 (A. crassa), J (D. communis), W2 (T. volvocina) and P (S. pingue) in spring. The phytoplankton functional groups of Karagol Lake were typical to well-mixed eutrophic shallow lakes. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 95.4 % of the cumulative percentage of the variance in the phytoplankton functional groups and their relationships with environmental variables. The Q index showed that the ecological status of Karagol Lake varied seasonally from bad to moderate. In winter 2015, the lake had a moderate ecological status and in spring 2016 it had a bad ecological status. The results of this study showed that the Q index satisfactorily reflected the changes in phytoplankton composition and functional group approach displayed itself as sensitive and responsive to environmental changes of shallow lakes, regardless of their geographic region.

Understanding this species' seasonal movements and migration will facilitate effective conservation to promote its population. We tagged 27 Oriental Stork nestlings at Xingkai Lake on the Sanjiang Plain in Heilongjiang Province, China, used GPS tracking to follow them over the periods of 2014-2017 and 2019-2022, and confirmed their detailed migratory routes using the spatial analysis function of ArcGIS 10.7. We discovered four migration routes during autumn migration: one common long-distance migration route in which the storks migrated along the coastline of Bohai Bay to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River for wintering, one short-distance migration route in which the storks wintered in Bohai Bay and two other migration routes in which the storks crossed the Bohai Strait around the Yellow River and wintered in South Korea. There were no significant differences in the number of migration days, residence days, migration distances, number of stopovers and average number of days spent at stopover sites between the autumn and spring migrations (P > 0.05). However, the storks migrated significantly faster in spring than in autumn (P 1/4 0.03). The same individuals did not exhibit a high degree of repetition in their migration timing and route selection in either autumn or spring migration. Even storks from the same nest exhibited considerable between-individual variation in their migration routes. Some important stopover sites were identified, especially in the Bohai Rim Region and on the Songnen Plain, and we further explored the current conservation status at these two important sites. Overall, our results contribute to the understanding of the annual migration, dispersal and protection status of the endangered Oriental Stork and provide a scientific basis for conservation decisions and the development of action plans for this species.

J	WEISSE, T				WEISSE, T			THE ANNUAL CYCLE OF HETEROTROPHIC FRESH-WATER NANOFLAGELLATES - ROLE OF BOTTOM-UP VERSUS TOP-DOWN CONTROL	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The population dynamics of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) were analyzed in prealpine Lake Constance over three cosecutive years. A recurrent seasonal pattern led to the identification of five seasonal phases: winter, spring, clear-water, summer and autumn. HNF biomass was lowest in winter and highest in late spring several weeks after the phytoplankton spring bloom. The average biomass of HNF was 5-12% of bacterial biomass and 13-34% of ciliate biomass respectively. The largest HNF cells were recorded during the phase, whereas the average cell size was reduced to one-third during the subsequent clear-water phase. The pronounced differences in the mean cell size were attributed mainly to varying grazing impact on HNF. Throughout most of the year, HNF production was balanced by grazing of microzooplankton, namely ciliates, within the microbial loop. During the clear-water phase, however, the grazing impact was mainly due to rotifers and daphnids. Changing grazing impact was primarily responsible for the observed 2-fold interannual difference in the mean biomass of HNF. Overall, top-down control by grazing was more important in governing the population dynamics of HNF than bottom-up control by bacterial food supply.

J	Edgell, HS				Edgell, HS			Karst and hydrogeology of Lebanon	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												Karst is very well-developed in Lebanon in thick, exposed, fractured and folded Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Eocene carbonates, as well as in localized, coastal Miocene limestones. This karstification not only results from the predominant calcareous lithology, but is also caused by the high, northerly trending ranges of he country, which cause abundant precipitation, as heavy rain and thick snow, to fall on Mt. Lebanon, Jabal Barouk, Jabal Niha, and Mt. Hermon. Lesser amounts fall on the Anti-Lebanon, Beqa'a Valley and the coastal hills of the country. Some 80% of precipitation occurs from November through February. The karst water emerges from five first-magnitude springs (Ain ez Zarqa (11 m(3)/sec), Ain Anjar (max. 10m(3)/sec), Nabaa Ouazzani (max. 6m(3)/sec), Nabaa Arbaain (mau. 3 m(3)/sec) and Nabaa Barouk (max. 3m(3)/sec), plus hundreds of second-and third-magnitude springs, and thousands of smaller springs. The large springs are all karstic and contribute to 13 perennial springs in the main Lebanese ranges, and 2 in the Anti-Lebanon. These include major rivers, such as the Nahr el Litani, Nahr el Assi (Orontes) and Nabr el Hasbani (upper Jordan River). More than two-thirds of the area of Lebanon (i.e. 6900 km(2)) is karstified and includes surface karst features, such as poljes, uvalas, dolines, blind valleys, natural bridges, and ponors, as well as smaller features, like karren and hoodoos. Subsurface karst features include many types of solutional shafts and galleries, grottoes, subsurface lakes and rivers and most types of speleothems. There are at least 15 aquifers in Lebanon, of which 14 are in karstified carbonate strata. The 1700m thick limestone/dolomite core of the ranges and over 2000m thickness of flanking, or overlying, Cretaceous limestones provide the majority of these aquifers, while significant aquifers are also found in thick Eocene limestones. High transmissivity values (T = or > 1.83 x 10(-1) m(2)) occur in these karstic aquifers, as is shown by the rapid decline in spring flow over the dry summer and autumn months, and their very quick recharge by winter and spring rains and heavy snow on the Lebanese ranges.																			0891-2556	1878-5212					1997	12	2					220	235		10.1007/BF03175419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03175419													WOS:000071513700006

Monthly precipitation extremes defined by maximum one-day precipitation amount (Rxl day) and maximum consecutive five-day precipitation amount (Rx5day) regimes were analyzed for precipitation data covering a period of 1957-2010. How the spatial patterns of these precipitation extremes are impacted by topographic characteristics was investigated using the max-stable method. Results indicated that a better performance of model can be identified if topographical influences were considered, showing the critical role of topography in the spatial distribution of precipitation extremes. Seasonal shifts of extreme precipitation events can be identified within the Poyang Lake basin: the Rxl day generally increases from the west to the east parts during spring, from the south to the north parts during summer, from the east to the west parts during autumn and from the northwest to the southeast parts during winter. Besides, details and subtle traits of spatial patterns of precipitation extremes can be attained when altitude was taken into consideration. However, complex influences of topographical properties or the mountains on changes of Rxl day and Rx5day were also detected: higher altitude tends to increase the Rxl day in summer and autumn while decrease the Rxl day in winter and spring, which should be attributed to propagation direction of water vapor flux and also different relations between water vapor flux and extreme precipitation processes during different seasons. When compared to Rx1day, the seasonal Rx5day regimes shift along the east-west direction and which may be attributed to the different seasonal movements of precipitation center for Rx5day when compared to those of Rxl day. Results of this study may help to better understand the possible influence of topography on the spatial patterns of precipitation extremes. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 250 species, including 88 protozoa, 115 rotifers, 28 cladocerans, and 19 copepod species, were detected and divided into 16 ZFGs. The ZFGs exhibited obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity. ZFGs in the Chaohu Lake were notably different from those in rivers and were different between the rivers. In the ecosystem, network analysis showed that protozoan algae/protozoan bacteria (PA/PB), rotifer particle filter (RF), and rotifer small predator (RSG) were important in the spring, summer, and autumn that and small zooplankton filter (SCF) was important in spring, autumn, and winter, while the importance of other ZFGs changed with seasons. Redundancy analysis showed that the environmental factors with a strong correlation between the ZFG compositions differed in each season. Different ZFGs exhibited different correlations with environmental factors. This study showed that ZFGs were closely related to environmental factors and that functional traits can reflect responses to changes in the water environment.					; Wu, Li/E-3821-2013; Ni, Jiajia/AAC-8769-2020	Zhang, Yan/0000-0001-9914-1302; Ni, Jiajia/0000-0002-8875-4899; 														2073-4441				JUL	2022	14	13							2106	10.3390/w14132106	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14132106													WOS:000823998000001
J	ERSKINE, AJ				ERSKINE, AJ			RING-BILLED GULL, LARUS-DELAWARENSIS, STATUS AND MOVEMENT IN THE MARITIME PROVINCES OF CANADA	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Few Ring-billed Gulls Larus delawarensis are present in Canada's Maritime Provinces in summer, except at nesting colonies, or in winter. In spring and fall, most concentrations occur in areas where few or none breed at present, the largest numbers being along Northumberland Strait and in the lower St. John River valley. The distribution and numbers found in spring and fall may be plausibly derived from Ring-billed Gull stocks breeding in the Maritimes, and their increases over the last 30 years parallel in timing and scale those in the breeding population. Transients from Newfoundland, Labrador, and eastern Quebec are hypothesized to migrate mainly by way of the St. Lawrence river and estuary, rather than passing through the Maritimes. Recoveries of banded Ring-billed Gulls support this hypothesis for the Newfoundland stock, but leave open whether the Maritimes gulls stemmed originally from the Gulf North Shore or from the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence River stocks.																			0008-3550					JAN-MAR	1993	107	1					46	52																WOS:A1993MZ02900005

Seasonal Movements and Spatial Overlap of Juvenile and Adult Lake Sturgeon in Lake Champlain	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens is a large, long-lived, potamodromous species that is widely distributed throughout freshwater systems in the central part of North America. In this study, we used acoustic telemetry to examine seasonal distribution and movement patterns of endangered Lake Sturgeon in Lake Champlain, Vermont. Acoustic tags were implanted in 29 juvenile Lake Sturgeon (453-874 mm TL) and 19 adults (1,215-1,615 mm TL) from the Winooski River and nearby areas of Lake Champlain between 2015 and 2019; tags were detected with 23 passive acoustic receivers deployed in the river and delta area and an additional 34 receivers deployed throughout Lake Champlain. Home range analysis using a lattice-based density estimator indicated that juvenile home range sizes were the same as adult home range sizes in spring and summer but were statistically larger than adult home ranges in winter. Cumulative home range analysis showed that juvenile and adult home ranges overlapped in shallow (<10-m) water in the summer and fall. In winter and spring, cumulative home ranges from juveniles included deepwater sites (>25 m), while adults remained in shallow water near the mouth of their spawning river. Seven juveniles made long-range movements (18-34 km) during the winter and spring months, and 13 juveniles moved back into the lower section of their natal river after overwintering in Lake Champlain. This study is the first to directly compare adult and juvenile Lake Sturgeon distribution, home range size, movements, and habitat use in a large lake system and provides a baseline for further research on the movement ecology of Lake Sturgeon in Lake Champlain.					; Marsden, Ellen/JVO-2249-2024	Parrish, Donna/0000-0001-9693-6329; Izzo, Lisa/0000-0002-2965-5161; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2022	151	6					666	681		10.1002/tafs.10378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10378		SEP 2022											WOS:000849665700001
J	NAGY, S				NAGY, S			THE FOOD OF THE WHITEFISH (COREGONUS-LAVARETUS L) IN THE STRBSKE PLESO MOUNTAIN LAKE	ZIVOCISNA VYROBA												Fifty-seven specimens of the whitefish, captured in spring, summer and autumn, were investigated for the qualitative and quantitative composition of the food of this fish species. Its food spectrum of the whitefish includes 25 items. The food importance index values were the highest in the water fleas (Cladocera) I = 149.10 and in the pupae of the chironomids I = 110.5. As to the seasonal variation, the chironomid pupae prevail in spring (I = 233.44) and the water fleas prevail in summer and autumn (I = 246.03 and I = 244.38, respectively). The index of filling amounted to 15.5 parts-per-thousand in spring, 18.2 parts-per-thousand in summer and 10.7 parts-per-thousand in autumn. The value of the trophic index is 3.00, which testifies to the prevalence of invertebrates in the food spectrum of the fish. This corresponds with the relative length of the alimentary tract which is equal to 79.8 % of body length. It follows from the data that the Coregonus lavaretus living in the Strbske pleso takes its food mainly in the pelagial zone and that its food spectrum largely consists of the zooplankton and, during some periods, of the emergent constituents of the zoobenthos.																			0044-4847						1990	35	10					915	920																WOS:A1990FN70100008
J	Wang, X; Wang, CZ; Zhou, W; Wang, DX; Song, J				Wang, Xin; Wang, Chunzai; Zhou, Wen; Wang, Dongxiao; Song, Jie			Teleconnected influence of North Atlantic sea surface temperature on the El Nino onset	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Influence of North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies on tropical Pacific SST anomalies is examined. Both summer and winter North Atlantic SST anomalies are negatively related to central-eastern tropical Pacific SST anomalies in the subsequent months varying from 5 to 13 months. In particular, when the North Atlantic is colder than normal in the summer, an El Nio event is likely to be initiated in the subsequent spring in the tropical Pacific. Associated with summer cold North Atlantic SST anomalies is an anomalous cyclonic circulation at low-level over the North Atlantic from subsequent October to April. Corresponded to this local response, an SST-induced heating over the North Atlantic produces a teleconnected pattern, similar to the East Atlantic/West Russia teleconnection. The pattern features two anticyclonic circulations near England and Lake Baikal, and two cyclonic circulations over the North Atlantic and near the Caspian Sea. The anticyclonic circulation near Lake Baikal enhances the continent northerlies, and strengthens the East-Asian winter monsoon. These are also associated with an off-equatorial cyclonic circulation in the western Pacific during the subsequent winter and spring, which produces equatorial westerly wind anomalies in the western Pacific. The equatorial westerly wind anomalies in the winter and spring can help initiate a Pacific El Nio event following a cold North Atlantic in the summer.

The heavy metal levels, except Cr in water were the highest in summer and winter, though lower than WHO standards. Generally higher metal levels were found in liver of Cyprinus carpio, while the lowest were determined in muscle tissue. Heavy metal levels in tissues of carp increased in summer and winter, but decreased in autumn and spring. Significant positive and negative relationships were found between heavy metal levels and fish size. Generally some of the results were above the limits for fish proposed by WHO, EC and TSE.

Dynamics of the benthic and planktic microbiomes in a Planktothrix-dominated toxic cyanobacterial bloom in Australia	WATER RESEARCH												Cyanobacterial blooms are a concerning issue that threaten ecosystems, ecology and animal health. Bloom frequency has increased tremendously in recent times due to pollution, eutrophication of waterways, climate change, and changes in microbial community dynamics within the aquatic environment. Information about the spatiotemporal variation in microbial communities that drive a cyanobacterial bloom is very limited. Here, we analysed the spatiotemporal diversity and composition of bacterial communities, with a focus on cyanobacteria, during the bloom phase in a natural reservoir in Eastern Australia using high throughput amplicon sequencing. Sampling points and season had no influence on the richness and evenness of microbial communities during the bloom period, however some compositional differences were apparent across the seasons. Cyanobacteria were highly abundant during summer and autumn compared to winter and spring. The dominant cyanobacterial taxa were Planktothrix, Cyanobium and Microcystis and were found to be significantly abundant during summer and autumn. While cyanobacterial abundance soared in summer (25.4 %), dominated by Planktothrix (12.2 %) and Cyanobium (8.0 %), the diversity was highest in autumn (24.9 %) and consisted of Planktothrix (7.8 %), Nodularia (5.3 %), Planktothricoides (4.6 %), Microcystis (3.5 %), and Cyanobium (2.3 %). The strongly correlated nonphotosynthetic Gastranaerophilales found in the sediment and water, suggested vertical transmission from the animal gut through faeces. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Planktothrix-driven toxic cyanobacterial bloom in Australia. Our study expands current understanding of the spatiotemporal variation in bacterial communities during a cyanobacterial bloom and sheds light on setting future management strategies for its control.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of using phytoplankton diversity as a water quality indicator in wetlands, and find out the main environmental variables affecting the distribution of phytoplankton. From 2020 to 2021, we examined phytoplankton assemblages and water environmental variables in spring, summer, and autumn at eight sampling sites from Hulanhe Wetland, Northeast (NE) China. The results showed that Bacillariophyta was the dominant species. Phytoplankton composition and abundance differed among sampling sites in each season; the abundance in summer (613.71 x 104 ind. L-1) was higher than that in autumn and spring. The water quality assessment of the trophic state index (TSI) based on the four physicochemical indicators was compared with phytoplankton diversity indices, which indicated that the phytoplankton community was stable, and these two indices were significantly lower in summer than in spring and autumn. According to redundancy analysis (RDA), total phosphorus (TP) and nitrogen (TN) were the main environmental variables affecting the distribution of phytoplankton. Temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) changes also played a role, and their impact on the community was discussed. This work can provide relevant scientific references on the usefulness of phytoplankton diversity structure in assessing water quality in cold regions, in which the succession can be significantly affected by nutrients and temperatures.

In spite of the fertile catchment basin, the developing ombrofile peat bogs of lake environment results in the acidification of lakes, the presence of small concentrations of dissolved mineral substances (below 50 mg L-1), and exceptionally high DOC concentrations, exceeding 10 mg L-1 C. During summer, a strong thermic stratification develops in the lakes, with constant conditions of oxygen deficiency prevailing below 3 m. In the course of the spring and autumn mixing of dystrophic lakes, the deterioration of oxygen conditions occurs in the epilimnion. In spite of high TP and NH4+ concentrations, which increase from spring to autumn, the conditions developing in the lakes are unfavourable, for the functioning of aquatic organisms, on account of the strong shading. The increased direct irradiation of water bodies caused by deforestation or favourable atmospheric conditions results in an increased trophy of lakes.

Orange fluorescing cyanobacteria prevailed in APP community in all four lakes, but in spring and autumn eukaryotic contribution increased. The densities of APP ranged between 2 x 10(4) ml(-1) and 9.5 x 10(5) ml(-1). There was a trend of increase of APP numbers along classical trophic gradient, but its share in total phytoplankton biomass was decreasing showing decreasing importance of picoplankton with eutrophication. Two types of APP seasonal patterns were described. One characterised by only one, spring-early summer peak, was found in mesotrophic and eutrophic lake.

J	Austin, J				Austin, Jay			What controls the onset of winter stratification in a deep, dimictic lake?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The transition from summer stratification to winter stratification is considered for deep, dimictic Lake Superior. The fall transition is dynamically distinct from the better-studied spring transition; it is characterized by a wind-driven collapse of weakening summer stratification, a surface-cooling-driven period during which the water column is essentially isothermal, and eventual onset of inverse (cold upper layer) stratification, after which sub-thermocline water temperatures are largely fixed for the rest of the season. Due to the small value of thermal expansivity near the temperature of maximum density, temperature gradients do not impart much stability to the water column, and it is difficult for winter stratification to form immediately upon dropping below the temperature of maximum density. Instead, the water column continues to cool until the thermal expansivity is sufficiently large in magnitude to allow temperature gradients to impart stability. This observation implies that the temperature locked into the deep water for the winter season will be a consequence of the specific meteorological forcing experienced in a given year; there may be long-term climate change driven trends in the timing of the onset of stratification but not trends in winter deep-water temperature. To address this hypothesis, 15 yr of moored temperature data collected in Lake Superior are examined, and a scaling argument and climatological data are applied to better understand interannual variability in the onset of winter stratification.

J	Hao, S; Li, FD				Hao, Shuai; Li, Fadong			Water sources for typical desert vegetation in the Ebinur Lake basin	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												In arid and semi-arid environments, desert vegetation plays an important role in preventing soil erosion by wind and helps maintain the stability of desert and oasis ecosystems. Four types of typical desert vegetation, namely Populus euphratica, Haloxylon ammodendron, Nitraria sibirica, and Halostachs caspica, corresponding to different habitats (i.e., river bank, sand dune, desert, and salt marsh) were chosen as the model vegetation in this research. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 for rainwater, soil water, and plant water were applied to identify the water sources and quantify the proportions of different water sources used over the entire plant growth period (from March to October). The results showed that the precipitation delta H-2 and delta O-18 in the Ebinur Lake basin varied from -142.5 parts per thousand to -0.6 parts per thousand and from -20.16 parts per thousand to 1.20 parts per thousand, respectively. The largest delta H-2 and delta O-18 values occurred in summer and the smallest in winter. The soil water delta H-2 and delta O-18 of the four habitats decreased gradually with increasing depth. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of water extracted from the stems of the four plants had similar variation trends, that is, the maximum was observed in spring and the minimum in summer. Among the four plants, H. caspica had the highest stable isotopic values in the stem water, followed by N. sibirica, H. ammodendron, and P. euphratica. The water sources and utilization ratios of desert vegetation varied across different growth stages. Throughout the growing period, H. ammodendron mainly used groundwater, whereas the water source proportions used by N. sibirica varied greatly throughout the growing season. In spring, plants mainly relied on surface soil water, with a contribution rate of 80%-94%. However, in summer, the proportion of deep soil water used was 31%-36%; and in autumn, the proportion of middle soil water used was 33%-36%. H. caspica mainly relied on topsoil water in spring and autumn, and the proportion of soil water in the middle layer slightly increased to 20%-36% in summer. P. euphratica mainly used intermediate soil water in spring with a utilization rate of 53%-54%. In summer, groundwater was the main source, with a utilization rate of 72%-88%, and only 2%-5% came from river water, whereas in autumn, the river water utilization rate rose to 11%-21%. The results indicated that there were significant differences in water use sources during the growing period for desert vegetation in arid areas. This research provides a theoretical basis for understanding water use mechanisms, water adaptation strategies, and vegetation restoration and management in arid areas.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				JUN	2022	32	6					1103	1118		10.1007/s11442-022-1987-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-022-1987-4													WOS:000797529200006

Growth, condition, diet, and consumption rates of northern pike in three Arizona reservoirs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Northern pike ( Esox lucius L.) introductions are controversial in the western United States due to suspected impacts they might have on established sport fisheries and potential illegal introductions. Three Arizona reservoirs, Parker Canyon Lake, Upper Lake Mary and Long Lake were sampled to examine the diet, consumption dynamics, and growth of northern pike. Northern pike diets varied by season and reservoir. In Parker Canyon Lake, diets were dominated by rainbow trout in winter and spring and bluegill and green sunfish in the fall. In Long Lake the northern pike ate crayfish in spring and early summer and switched to young of the year common carp in summer and fall. Black crappie, golden shiners, and crayfish were the major prey in Upper Lake Mary during spring, but they switched to stocked rainbow trout in the fall. Northern pike growth was in the high range of growth reported throughout the United States. Estimated northern pike specific consumption rate (scr) of rainbow trout (g/g/d x 10(-6)) was greatest in Upper Lake Mary (scr = 329.1 +/- 23.7 g/g/d x 10(-6)) where stocked fingerling (<120 mm total length [TL]) rainbow trout were most vulnerable to these predators, compared to larger (>280 mm TL) rainbow trout stocked in Long Lake (scr = 1.4 +/- 0.1 g/g/d x 10(-6)) and Parker Canyon Lake (scr = 287.2 +/- 15.1 g/g/d x 10(-6)) where catchable-sized rainbow trout were stocked. Managers should consider the cost-benefits of stocking fish >200 mm TL in lakes containing northern pike.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2008	24	2					99	111		10.1080/07438140809354054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354054													WOS:000269666100001

Adjacent catchments with similar patterns of land use and climate have markedly different dissolved organic carbon concentration and runoff dynamics	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Temporal patterns in specific runoff, dissolved organic carbon concentrations [DOC] and fluxes were examined during two periods: 1994-1997 (period 1) and 2007-2009 (period 2) in five adjacent tributary catchments of Lake Simcoe, the largest lake in southern Ontario, Canada. The catchments displayed similar patterns of land use change with increases in urbanization (5-16%) and forest cover (0.2-4%) and declines in agriculture (4-8%) between 1994 and 2008. Climate in the catchments was similar; temperature increased slightly, but no significant change in precipitation was observed. Despite similar pattern of climate and land use, runoff responses and tributary [DOC] were different across the catchments. Following a very dry year (i.e. 1999), runoff increased steadily until the end of record. We observed increased variability in tributary [DOC] and higher DOC exports in period 2. This led to similar to 10% increase in [DOC] and a 13% increase in flux between the two study periods. Between the two periods, [DOC] increased by 15% in spring and 25% in summer, whereas flux increased by 17% in spring and 48% in summer. [DOC] was consistently higher in the growing (summer+autumn) than the dormant (winter+spring, minus spring melt months) seasons, but no unique pattern or simple linear flow/concentrations relationships existed. This suggests complex spatial and temporal pattern to runoff controls on DOC and flow dynamics in adjacent catchments. We therefore caution against extrapolating from monitored to unmonitored catchments.

In the factorial analysis; 4 levels of season factors (autumn, winter, spring, summer), 2 levels of sex factor (male, female) and 1 level size factor were available. According to the results of biochemical analysis, effects of seasons were determined on crude protein and moisture levels. Crude ash levels changed depending on sex and season. There were no interactions of these three factors on the crude fat levels. The season and sex affected on LA, alpha-LNA and Sigma HUFA levels. ARA, EPA, DHA, Sigma SFA and Sigma PUFA levels were affected from seasonal changes. Interaction of season/sex affected to Sigma MUFA levels. The crude protein content, DHA, EPA and n-3 contents in tail muscle of A. leptodactylus increased by feeding in summer while these contents decreased by gonadal development in autumn. Therefore, in terms of nutritional protein contents, EPA, DHA and n-3 of this species were higher in summer. EPA, n-3 and DHA contents are important for A. leptodactylus.																			0101-2061	1678-457X				DEC	2018	38			1			44	49		10.1590/1678-457X.15817	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1678-457X.15817													WOS:000456673700006
J	Saunders, PA; Porter, KG; Taylor, BE				Saunders, PA; Porter, KG; Taylor, BE			Population dynamics of Daphnia spp. and implications for trophic interactions in a small, monomictic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In Lake Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA, herbivorous crustacean zooplankton are abundant and dominate zooplankton biomass in winter, but are scarce throughout most of the summer. We used a 3.5 year study of Daphnia population dynamics to infer when food, predators or temperature constrained growth of this population. Transitions between winter and summer consumer assemblages are concurrent with seasonal changes in water temperature, thermal structure (stratification/destratification), resources (autotrophic/heterotrophic-dominated production), and predator abundance and activity (e.g. Lepomis macrochirus and Chaoborus punctipennis). We sampled at weekly or less intervals from April 1992 to September 1995, and determined population abundances for all cladoceran species. For the Daphnia population (Daphnia ambigua + Daphnia parvula), we measured clutch size and length for all individuals. We used average water column temperature (where dissolved oxygen is >1 mg l(-1)) to estimate egg development time from an empirical model. Estimates of Daphnia population birth and death rate were thus generated from abundance, egg ratio and temperature/dissolved oxygen data. We compared observed birth rate (b(obs)) with expected birth rate (b(exp) +/- 95% CI; predicted for food-saturated conditions at ambient temperature). For variable (1-13 week) periods between late November and March, 1992-1995, water temperature was the primary factor constraining Daphnia population growth (b(obs) = b(exp)) From about April to early November, b(obs) < b(exp) suggested food-limited population growth. In spring, summer and early fall (March-October), population densities were several-fold lower than in late fall and winter (November-February). However, all else being equal, egg ratio and population birth rate data would have predicted that Daphnia abundance fluctuates over equivalent ranges in spring and fall. We interpret this discrepancy as evidence for increased rates of extrinsic mortality during the growing season and a seasonal shift in the relative importance of resource and predator regulation. The duration of predator suppression of crustacean population abundance in Lake Oglethorpe and other warm-latitude lakes (similar to 36 degrees N-27 degrees S) is longer (greater than or equal to 3-7 months) than that observed in north temperate lakes (1-2.5 months; 41-52 degrees N).																			0142-7873					OCT	1999	21	10					1823	1845		10.1093/plankt/21.10.1823	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.10.1823													WOS:000083234700002

The objectives were to compare seasonal habitat use and diurnal movements of channel catfish and blue catfish. Mortality and tag loss among implanted fish was high, as only two of the original eight tagged catfish were tracked for the entire period; both were blue catfish. To maintain an active pool of four of each species, a total of 15 channel catfish and 6 blue catfish were implanted and monitored for varying periods during the study. Seasonal habitat preferences differed between species. Channel catfish used most of the lake during spring, tended to use the shallower, southern arms of the lake in summer, and restricted their use to mid-impoundment areas and the southeastern arm during fall and winter. Blue catfish also occupied the entire impoundment during spring, but they used the western arm and mid-impoundment areas during the summer, moved to deeper areas of the impoundment during fall, and were confined to areas near the dam during winter. When all seasons were combined, both catfish species were most active at sunset and sunrise and the least active during mid-day. Blue catfish used open water areas more (53% of observations) than channel catfish (27%). Seasonal habitat segregation most likely contributed to the differential rates of return to the creel for channel catfish and blue catfish as channel catfish were vulnerable to bank anglers throughout the year.																			0892-2284		1-888569-19-0				1999	24						239	255																WOS:000086864000021

Stomach contents of 207 individuals ranging in size from 115 to 243 mm fork length were analyzed and 23.67% were empty. There was a seasonal variation in the feeding intensity of this species. The spring and summer feeding intensity were quite lower than other seasons. The food items in stomach showed a wide spectrum, ranging from phytoplankton, macrophytes, zooplankton to aquatic insects. Therefore, white bream displayed an omnivorous feeding. The relative importance index (RII%) indicated that Bosmina, Macrophytes, Chironomid larvae, Melosira, Navicula, Cymbella and Cyclopoid copepod were the most importance food items of white bream. The feeding strategy indicated that white bream plays an accelerator role in eutrophication. According to the Schoener's overlap index values, there was a high degree of consumed food overlap between spring-autumn (C-xy = 0.78095) and summer-winter (C-xy = 0.92035).

The dynamics of white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) CWD inputs from the riparian environment in a boreal lake in Eastern Quebec, Canada, over the past 350 years were reconstructed and differences in the macroinvertebate communities according to CWD age, season of sampling (spring, summer and autumn), depth and site were investigated. It was hypothesised that CWD macroinvertebrate community structure would change with CWD age, season and depth, but not among sites. No significant correlation was found between CWD age and macroinvertebrate densities and taxa number. The macroinvertebrate community was highly variable in space and time. Season was the main factor influencing taxa composition and the relative densities of individuals. The mean density was more than twofold greater in autumn than in spring and summer (1046, 1049 and 2335 individuals m(-2) in spring, summer and autumn respectively). Density and taxa number decreased with depth, but site did not appear to influence the community. As CWD inputs increased during the log-driving period, impacts on macroinvertebrate communities were likely to be important and should be documented across the boreal zone.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2009	60	9					960	970		10.1071/MF08260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF08260													WOS:000270029800010

J	Green, K				Green, Ken			Intra- and inter-annual changes in chemistry of Australian glacial lakes	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The chemical characteristics of five seasonally ice-covered lakes in the Snowy Mountains were measured monthly from 2006 to 2009. Although N and P concentrations were significantly higher in rainfall than snowfall, concentrations peaked in lakes in winter rather than summer. This was linked to continuous winter nutrient flow into the lakes from melting snowpack and continued biogeochemical processes in unfrozen soil at a time when biological activity beneath the lake ice was depressed. In contrast to high altitude lakes elsewhere, there was no spring ionic pulse of nutrients. Lake pH fluctuated throughout the ice-free period between 6.9 and 6.5, falling to 6.1-6.0 beneath ice cover, before rising abruptly after ice break-up. Earlier ice break-up in recent years has resulted in an earlier increase in pH, and decrease in concentrations of NH3-N and NOx-N. In years with least snowfall and early ice break-up, winter peaks of NH3-N were lowest whereas both PO4-P and NOx-N showed winter peaks of various concentrations in medium years rather than extreme years. Rising winter and/or spring temperatures resulting in changes in precipitation from snow to rain could lead to increased nutrient deposition, with rain carrying an order of magnitude more nutrients than does snow.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2012	63	6					513	527		10.1071/MF12013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF12013													WOS:000305190000005

Results indicated wide local and seasonal variations in the concentrations of various physicochemical parameters. There was a noticeable variation in levels of nitrogen and phosphorus forms; higher ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate contents of 11.6 (in autumn), 2.28 (in winter), and 2.32 mg L-1 (in autumn), respectively, were detected at Shatt Greba (site IV). Total-P and ortho-P exhibited higher levels of 7.14 and 0.96 mg L-1, respectively, at site IV in summer. The greatest amounts of sodium, potassium, calcium, barium, and lithium were 102.88 g L-1, 9.12 g L-1, 8.56 g L-1, 345.8 mg L-1, and 1.62 mg L-1, respectively, during summer. Two-way ANOVA presented a highly significant local and seasonal effect of physicochemical parameters on phytoplankton biomass. There were high levels of autumn algal biomass (65.96 mg L-1) and low levels of winter algal biomass (32.28 mg L-1). Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Pyrrophyta dominated in the autumn, whereas Bacillariophyta dominated in the winter. Cyanophyta and Pyrrophyta biomass showed high local variations in contrast to Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta. The species diversity index revealed that the study area was mildly to moderately polluted water.

GPS MONITORING OF CATTLE LOCATION NEAR WATER FEATURES IN SOUTH FLORIDA	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												A study was conducted to quantify the amount of time spent by grazing cattle near or in water locations (wetlands, ditches, and water troughs) across seasons in a cow-calf production ranch in south Florida. Prolonged hot summers in these regions can cause physiological heat stress in cattle and drive them into water-filled ditches and wetlands in order to cool down. Because of the numerous ranches in the region, it is perceived that this activity is contributing towards the phosphorus loading into the receiving water body, Lake Okeechobee. Cattle position data was monitored continuously using GPS collars. Data was recorded every 15 min during a 5-day period in spring (March), summer (June), fall (late August), and winter (November or December) from 2001 to 2003. The average percentage of daily time spent by cattle near/in water locations (water trough, wetland, and ditch) during the warm season (summer + fall) was 11.45 +/- 0.39% and 6.09 +/- 0.69% during the cool season (winter + spring). Overall, the cattle utilized water-filled features somewhat more during warm seasons, with some exceptions under higher temperatures found in southern Florida winters. Temporal, sub-daily analysis of the use of water troughs revealed very little usage during early morning and night and increased use as the day progressed. Similar analysis of wetlands use showed greater utilization during late morning and nights in the cool season. Utilization of ditches was fairly consistent throughout all years; more during warm seasons and less during cool. Current hydrological modeling systems that arc, actively used to represent the nutrient-enriched agricultural enterprises in south Florida lack the ability to comprehensively represent the dynamics of the animal-plant-soil system. This study will provide crucial information for model developers who may utilize these results to develop more detailed hydrological and nutrient loading models.

This experiment is forced with annually varying orbital parameters and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4. The objective is to study the impact of these long-term forcings on the surface temperature evolution during different seasons in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere. We find in summer a thermal optimum in the mid-Holocene (6-3 ka BP), with temperatures locally 3 degrees C above the preindustrial mean. In autumn the temperatures experienced a long-term increase, particularly during the first few thousand years. The opposite trend was simulated for winter and spring, with a relatively warm Southern Ocean at 9 ka BP in inter (up to 3.5 degrees C above the preindustrial mean) and a warm continent in spring (+3 degrees C, followed by a gradual cooling towards the present. These long-term temperature trends can be explained by a combination of (1) a delayed response to orbital forcing, with temperatures lagging insolation by I to months owing to the thermal inertia of the system, and (2) the long memory of the Southern Ocean. This long memory is related to the storage of the warm late winter-spring anomaly below the shallower summer mixed layer until next winter. Sea ice plays an important role as an amplifying factor through the ice-albedo and ice-insulation feedbacks. Our experiments can help to improve our understanding of the Holocene signal in proxies. For instance, the results suggest that, in contrast to recent propositions, teleconnections to the Northern Hemisphere appear not necessarily to explain the history of Southern Hemisphere temperature changes during the Holocene.					; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie/G-1995-2011; Renssen, Hans/C-9927-2010	Masson-Delmotte, Valerie/0000-0001-8296-381X; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2005	15	7					951	964		10.1191/0959683605hl869ra	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl869ra													WOS:000233135300003

Proteins homologous to aquaporins of higher plants in the freshwater alga Ulothrix zonata (Ulotrichales, Chlorophyta)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The green filamentous alga Ulothrix zonata inhabits Lake Baikal and overgrows the underside of hummocky ice during winter and spring. To clarify physiological adaptations of U. zonata to low temperature and the potential contribution of membrane water permeabilities, the expression level of aquaporins from a winter population growing under the lake ice and in interstitial water was compared with that of benthic summer and autumn populations of algae by immuno-detection using an anti-maize PIP1 (plasma membrane intrinsic protein) antiserum. Algal, and in particular Ulvophycean, transcriptome sequences are only partially available and this higher plant-specific PIP1 epitope has not been detected so far in available genomic datasets. PIP1 expression levels were highest in the ice population and the rise in water temperature during summer was correlated with a drop in PIP1 amounts, which slightly increased again in autumn. ITS2 rDNA (internally transcribed spacer region 2) sequences revealed conspecificity of the ice and summer populations. The difference in PIP1 aquaporin expression suggests adaptation of the algae to changing environments by maintaining membrane permeability at low temperatures. Our study shows that the ice population of U. zonata inhabiting Lake Baikal is a unique subject for studying physiological and biochemical adaptation mechanisms of freshwater extremophiles.

The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine the phenology of potamodromous trout parr across a region encompassing two large lake catchments. One hundred sixty-seven trout parr were tagged in late summer across four lake tributaries between 2018 and 2020. In total, 75 tagged parr migrated into the lakes with 67 (89%) migrating between September and December and 8 (11%) migrating between March and June. Autumn migration was highly prevalent across all the tributaries, with 16%-66% of each tagged sample exhibiting autumn migration, and 0%-15% of each tagged sample exhibiting spring migration. Autumn migrants were significantly longer and heavier than spring migrants, but condition factor was similar. Autumn migrants were associated with higher river discharge levels and lower water temperatures than spring migrants. The management challenges posed by extensive autumn migration behaviour in migratory trout stocks are examined and discussed.																				1095-8649				MAR	2022	100	3					697	704		10.1111/jfb.14982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14982		JAN 2022						34932222					WOS:000739111100001

Ecosystem Scale Implication of Soil CO2 Concentration Dynamics During Soil Freezing in Alaskan Arctic Tundra Ecosystems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The rates, processes, and controls on Arctic cold period soil carbon loss are still poorly understood. To understand one component of winter CO2 loss in the atmosphere, continuous measurements of soil (CO2) were made and compared to ecosystem scale CO2 fluxes. Measurements of soil (CO2) were made near Utqiagvik, Alaska from the beginning of soil thaw in summer 2005 to spring 2007. In the summer, soil (CO2) rose with increased soil temperature, reaching value orders of magnitude higher than the atmospheric (CO2). Soil (CO2) initially decreased at the end of summer and beginning of fall but then increased subsequent to soil freezing. Due to complex changes in biological activity, storage, and transport processes, soil (CO2) was then approximately doubled than that was observed in the summer. After reaching peak concentrations in November, soil (CO2) steeply decreased over a couple of weeks, suggesting a substantial release of CO2 into the atmosphere and movement within the soil column. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements showed variable but continued emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere during freezeup. The disconnect between soil (CO2) and landscape level fluxes may be attributed to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in release of high concentrations of soil (CO2) to the atmosphere during the fall; and when integrated over the area of the EC tower footprint, do not frequently result in detectable emission events.

Water quality characteristics of Vanderkloof Dam and its potential for rainbow trout farming	WATER SA												Vanderkloof Dam was periodically sampled between November 2014 and April 2016 for a range of water quality parameters to assess the potential for cage culture of rainbow trout, Oncorhyncus mykiss. The dam is strongly stratified in summer and autumn, although upper water column temperatures remain relatively cool, largely <25 degrees C. The dam is considered oligotrophic, characterised by phosphorus limitation of primary production, particularly during summer. Light is strongly attenuated in the epilimnion and heterotrophic community metabolism is observed through much of the water column. Surface nutrients are depleted through the summer with phytoplankton assemblages dominated by the green algae, Oocystis lacustris, Desmodesmus bicaudatus and Coelastrum microporum. The water column turns over during the winter and the nearly isothermal impoundment approaches 11 degrees C. Nutrients are re-introduced into surface waters following winter mixing coincident with an increase in diatoms. The preferred environmental window for rainbow trout becomes severely contracted during the summer in that epilimnion temperatures exceed 21 degrees C and thermocline/hypolimnion oxygen concentrations fall below 3 mg center dot L-1. The coincidence of relatively high pH >9.5 could exacerbate these physiological challenges. Hydrological conditions for fish farming are most suitable in the proximity of the dam wall as opposed to further upstream. Here the hypoxic conditions that develop in the thermocline/hypolimnion during summer and autumn are less pronounced, particularly towards the southern bank, where concentrations of total suspended solids are generally <10 mg center dot L-1 and water clarity is more favourable for visual feeders such as fish. Although rainbow trout may survive the adverse conditions prevalent during the summer, growth is likely to be compromised and susceptibility to disease may increase.

ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A system-dynamic model has been built to evaluate the competition between submerged macrophytes Potamogeton malaianus Miq. (PM) and filamentous green algae Spirogyra sp. (SP). The data background is based on a spring-summer and an autumn-winter experiment carried out in artificial field ponds. The experiments had the aim to acquire a knowledge base necessary to a successful restoration of submerged macrophyte vegetation in Lake Taihu, China by use of P. malaianus Miq. The model mainly focuses on variations in water volume; biomass dynamics of P. malaianus Miq., Spirogyra sp. and zoobenthos; nutrients cycling between water column, P. malaianus Miq., Spirogyra sp., zoobenthos, detritus and sediment. Sixteen state variables are included in the model: biomass of P. malaianus Miq., Spirogyra sp. and zoobenthos; nitrogen in sediments, detritus, in P. malaianus Nil., in Spirogyra sp. and zoobenthos; total dissolved nitrogen; phosphorus in sediments, detritus, in P. malaianus Miq., in Spirogyra sp. and in zoobenthos; total dissolved phosphorus, and water volume of the experiment pond. The calibration and validation of the model show a good accordance with the results of the spring-summer experiment and the autumn-winter experiment. Model outputs show that higher temperature, shading effect and improper nutrients would result in a decrease in biomass of P. malaianus Miq. The most crucial factor having a negative effect on the growth of P. malaianus Miq. is Spirogyra sp., which entangles the stems and leaves of P. malaianus Miq. In order to successfully restore the vegetation of P. malaianus Miq., Spirogyra sp. should be suppressed in the early phase. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hansen, MJ; Nate, NA				Hansen, MJ; Nate, NA			A method for correcting the relative weight (Wr) index for seasonal patterns in relative condition (Kn) with length as applied to walleye in Wisconsin	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT					134th Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society	AUG 22-26, 2004	Madison, WI	Amer Fisheries Soc				We determined whether the relative weight (W-r) model for walleye Sander vitreus was representative of populations in Wisconsin and if relative weight varied with length seasonally. We then developed standard condition (K-n) models that correct for seasonal variation in body condition. We compiled data from 54.657 walleyes sampled during 640 Surveys of 202 lakes in 30 Wisconsin counties. Weight-length relationships and mean relative weight varied more widely for Wisconsin populations than for North American populations overall. Weight-length relationships and mean relative weight varied significantly among seasons, with the highest slope (lowest intercept) and mean relative weight in spring. lowest slope (highest intercept) and mean relative weight in early summer. and intermediate slopes (and intercepts) and mean relative weights in late summer and autumn. Mean relative weight increased with length in spring, decreased with length in early summer, and did not change with length in late summer, autumn, or over all seasons combined. For samples collected in spring or early summer, we found that relative weight did not accurately index body condition or estimate trends in body condition with length. We propose a new index, adjusted relative weight (the product of W-r and a seasonal K-n model, W-r center dot K-n) that adjusts relative weight for life-history-based seasonal trends in body condition with length.

The contribution of picophytoplankton to the total Chl-a biomass and primary production were 50.1 and 66.1%, respectively. Picophytoplankton were mainly composed of phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-cells) and photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs). PPEs were dominant in spring, reaching a maximum cell density of 3.0 x 10(4) cell mL(-1), while PE-cells were prevalent in other seasons. PE-cell abundance was relatively similar throughout the year, except for a decrease in summer during the stratification period, when nutrient concentration was low. High-throughput sequencing results from the sorted samples revealed that Synechococcus was the major PE-cell type, while Chrysophyceae, Dinophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Eustigmatophyceae, and Prymnesiophyceae were equally important PPEs. In spring, PPEs were mainly composed of Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae, while in summer, their dominance was replaced by that of Chrysophyceae and Prymnesiophyceae. Eustigmatophyceae and Chlorophyceae became the major PPEs in autumn, and Dinophyceae became the most abundant in winter. Single cells of Microcystis were usually detected in summer in the south, suggesting the deterioration of the water quality in Lake Fuxian.

J	Li, WL; Deng, MH; Liu, C; Cao, Q				Li, Weiling; Deng, Menghua; Liu, Chang; Cao, Qing			Analysis of Key Influencing Factors of Water Quality in Tai Lake Basin Based on XGBoost-SHAP	WATER												Tai Lake Basin, a key freshwater resource in eastern China, has garnered attention due to widespread cyanobacterial blooms. Effective water quality management is vital for the region's sustainable development. Investigating the seasonal variations of water quality parameters (WQPs) in Tai Lake Basin is essential for devising targeted strategies to enhance water quality. This study employs an interpretable machine learning model (XGBoost-SHAP) to identify the most important factors of water quality using daily monitoring WQP data from 2023 to 2024. Results revealed that dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) are primary determinants of water quality in the basin, while water temperature, pH, total nitrogen (TN), and turbidity showed minimal impact (SHAP value < 1). Seasonal analysis demonstrated that DO exerts a substantial influence on water quality during spring, summer, and autumn; TP and CODMn have a stable and negative impact on water quality throughout the year; NH3-N has a relatively significant negative impact on winter water quality. Recommendations include enhancing DO levels in spring and summer, fortifying TP and NH3-N concentrations in winter, and implementing tailored strategies in response to seasonal variations. This research offers valuable insights to guide decision-making processes aimed at enhancing water quality and safeguarding the water environment in the Tai Lake Basin.																				2073-4441				MAY 27	2025	17	11							1619	10.3390/w17111619	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17111619													WOS:001507958100001

Off-host survival of Dermacentor variabilis (Acari: Ixodidae) adults near their northern distributional limit in Saskatchewan, Canada	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Dermacentor variabilis (Say) is expanding its range northwards in Saskatchewan and Manitoba (Canada). Knowledge of the relative ability of different life cycle stages to survive off-host over winter is important for assessing the potential for further range expansion and risk of pathogen transmission. In the present study, the off-host survival of D. variabilis adults was determined in outdoor terraria within a field plot close to Lizard Lake Community Pasture (LLCP) situated near the northern distributional limit in Saskatchewan. Only a small proportion (7%) of adult ticks in this relatively recently established population survived from mid-summer to late winter. Off-host survival had declined further to <4% by mid-spring. A significantly greater proportion of female ticks (6%) survived from mid-summer to mid-spring than did male ticks (1%). The supercooling points (SCPs), the temperature below 0 & DEG;C when body fluids spontaneously freeze, of the 17 ticks that survived through to mid-spring did not differ significantly from the SCPs of questing ticks in the previous summer, suggesting adult D. variabilis do not undergo cold hardening during winter diapause. The off-host survival of D. variabilis adults near LLCP was also much lower than that previously reported for adults from Sandy Hook in Manitoba, a population that has been established for decades. This finding suggests that there is geographical variation in the ability of D. variabilis in southern Canada to survive from mid-summer to the subsequent spring. However, the ecological and genetic factors influencing the survival of northern populations of D. variabilis requires further investigation.

J	Zhang, YX; Ding, YH; Li, QP				Zhang Yingxian; Ding Yihui; Li Qiaoping			A Climatology of Extratropical Cyclones over East Asia During 1958-2001	ACTA METEOROLOGICA SINICA												A climatology of extratropical cyclones (ECs) over East Asia (20 degrees-75 degrees N, 60 degrees-160 degrees E) is analyzed by applying an improved objective detection and tracking algorithm to the 4-time daily sea level pressure fields from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data. A total of 12914 EC processes for the period of 1958-2001 are identified, with an EC database integrated and EC activities reanalyzed using the objective algorithm. The results reveal that there are three major cyclogenesis regions: West Siberian Plain, Mongolia (to the south of Lake Baikal), and the coastal region of East China; whereas significant cyclolysis regions are observed in Siberia north of 60 degrees N, Northeast China, and Okhotsk Sea-Northwest Pacific. It is found that the EC lifetime is largely 1-7 days while winter ECs have the shortest lifespan. The ECs are the weakest in summer among the four seasons. Strong ECs often appear in West Siberia, Northeast China, and Okhotsk Sea-Northwest Pacific. Statistical analysis based on k-means clustering has identified 6 dominating trajectories in the area south of 55 degrees N and east of 80 degrees E, among which 4 tracks have important impacts on weather/climate in China. ECs occurring in spring (summer) tend to travel the longest (shortest). They move the fastest in winter, and the slowest in summer. In winter, cyclones move fast in Northeast China, some areas of the Yangtze-Huaihe River region, and the south of Japan, with speed greater than 15 m s(-1). Explosively-deepening cyclones are found to occur frequently along the east coast of China, Japan, and Northwest Pacific, but very few storms occur over the inland area. Bombs prefer to occur in winter, spring, and autumn. Their annual number and intensity in 1990 and 1992 in East Asia (EA) are smaller and weaker than their counterparts in North America.																			0894-0525	2191-4788				JUN	2012	26	3					261	277		10.1007/s13351-012-0301-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13351-012-0301-2													WOS:000306123300001

Seasonal determinations of algal virus decay rates reveal overwintering in a temperate freshwater pond	ISME JOURNAL												To address questions about algal virus persistence (i.e., continued existence) in the environment, rates of decay of infectivity for two viruses that infect Chlorella-like algae, ATCV-1 and CVM-1, and a virus that infects the prymnesiophyte Chrysochromulina parva, CpV-BQ1, were estimated from in situ incubations in a temperate, seasonally frozen pond. A series of experiments were conducted to estimate rates of decay of infectivity in all four seasons with incubations lasting 21 days in spring, summer and autumn, and 126 days in winter. Decay rates observed across this study were relatively low compared with previous estimates obtained for other algal viruses, and ranged from 0.012 to 11% h(-1). Overall, the virus CpV-BQ1 decayed most rapidly whereas ATCV-1 decayed most slowly, but for all viruses the highest decay rates were observed during the summer and the lowest were observed during the winter. Furthermore, the winter incubations revealed the ability of each virus to overwinter under ice as ATCV-1, CVM-1 and CpV-BQ1 retained up to 48%, 19% and 9% of their infectivity after 126 days, respectively. The observed resilience of algal viruses in a seasonally frozen freshwater pond provides a mechanism that can support the maintenance of viral seed banks in nature. However, the high rates of decay observed in the summer demonstrate that virus survival and therefore environmental persistence can be subject to seasonal bottlenecks.

A total of 160 protozoan species belonging to 71 genera was identified, of which 53 were flagellates, 37 sarcodines, and 70 ciliates. Among them, Peritrichida (32.6% of frequency), Arcellinida (16.2%), Volvocales (13.61/6), Peridiniales (13.1%), and Chrysomonadales (9.1%) were the main groups and contributed to 84.5% of the overall species. Ciliates were mainly composed of sessile species and small species. The total protozoan abundance varied from 2,400 cells L-1 to 20,250 cells L-1. The highest protozoan abundance occurred in spring; the lowest number was in autumn. The highest abundance of ciliates occurred in spring and winter, whereas flagellates developed the highest abundance in,summer and autumn. Pearson correlation analysis and linear regressions indicated that chlorophyll a and water velocity were the main factors affecting ternporal and spatial variations of the protozoan abundance.

J	Sikder, MNA; Xu, HL; Warren, A				Sikder, Mohammad Nurul Azim; Xu, Henglong; Warren, Alan			Colonization features of marine biofilm-dwelling protozoa in Chinese coastal waters of the Yellow Sea	MARINE LIFE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Colonization features of biofilm-dwelling protozoa, especially ciliates, are routinely used as a useful tool for marine bioassessment. In this review, we summarize some of these features to develop an optimal sampling strategy for using biofilm-dwelling protozoa as bioindicators of marine water quality. We focus on the utility of: (1) diversity indices to analyze the colonization features of biofilm-dwelling protozoa for monitoring marine water quality; (2) MacArthur-Wilson and logistic equation models to determine spatio-temporal variations in colonization dynamics; and (3) homogeneity in taxonomic breadth of biofilm-dwelling protozoa during the process of colonization. The main findings are that: (1) the colonization dynamics of biofilm-dwelling protozoa are similar at depths of 1-5 m in spring and autumn; (2) temporal variability was well fitted to the MacArthur-Wilson and logistic models (P < 0.05); and (3) species composition reached an equilibrium after a colonization period of 10-14 days in spring and autumn, but this took less time in the summer and more time in the winter. Ellipse-plotting tests demonstrated spatial variability in homogeneity in taxonomic structure of the ciliate communities at different depths in the water column, with high levels at 1 m and 2 m and lower levels at 3.5 m and 5 m. Thus, the findings of this review suggest that the colonization dynamics of biofilm-dwelling protozoa may be influenced by different depths and seasons in coastal waters and 1-2 m in spring and autumn may be optimal sampling strategy for bioassessment on large spatial/temporal scales in marine ecosystems.																			2096-6490	2662-1746				AUG	2020	2	3					292	301		10.1007/s42995-020-00040-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42995-020-00040-4													WOS:000649453900010

Comparison of Lake and River Fishery Performance between Two Strains of Steelhead in Eastern Lake Michigan	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Management of fish species for which alternative genetic strains can be considered should be informed by indicators of strain-specific fishery performance. We compared how two strains of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss supported indices of angler satisfaction (catch rate and size) and motivation (effort) in the Lake Michigan basin. We assessed 10years of recreational angling data collected for the Little Manistee River steelhead strain (LMR-STS) and Skamania steelhead strain (SKA-STS), which were tagged and stocked as paired groups in the St. Joseph and Manistee rivers. The LMR-STS were stocked to enhance fall/winter and spring river fisheries, and SKA-STS were stocked to create river/inshore summer fisheries; both were also intended to contribute to the recreational fishery of Lake Michigan. Summer angler effort exceeded spring effort on the St. Joseph River, whereas spring effort exceeded summer effort on the Manistee River. In spring river fisheries, catch rates of LMR-STS were higher than those of SKA-STS. In summer fisheries on the Manistee River, catch rates of SKA-STS exceeded those of LMR-STS. In summer on the St. Joseph River, catch rates of LMR-STS and SKA-STS were equivalent. In spring/summer, steelhead of either strain stocked in the St. Joseph River were caught equally among eight of nine ports surveyed. The CPUE of Manistee River-stocked SKA-STS was higher than that of LMR-STS in the Lake Michigan fishery. Catch statistics in both rivers and in Lake Michigan indicate that the two strains provide similar opportunities for trophy-sized steelhead. Our findings suggest that LMR-STS are favored for the St. Joseph River fishery and may represent a better total return on investment in the Lake Michigan basin.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2018	38	5					1138	1151		10.1002/nafm.10218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10218													WOS:000448853400015

The average contribution of indirect photolysis to the overall photolysis was approximately 17%. In an oligotrophic lake water, indirect photolysis apparently occurred only in summer and direct photolysis was depressed in other seasons. The correlation between the first-order rate constant for indirect photolysis and COD by the permanganate method was poor in both lake waters. The contribution of singlet oxygen route decomposition to the indirect photolysis in eutrophic water was approximately 10% in summer.

The relationship between somatic stage and gonad cycle was also investigated and discussed. Condition, nutrition and somatic energy cycles could be divided into two distinct periods: from April to January with summer decreases and autumn increments, which is common for juveniles and mature fish; and from January to March, when juveniles and mature fish displayed different temporal variations related to the reproductive cycle. Gonad development took place from the end of the winter into the summer, the testes developing before the ovaries. Spawning started in late spring (May) and continued into summer (June and July), with fish quiescent by autumn (September). The results suggest that, for L. pyrenaicus, both environmental factors (e.g. food supply, water temperature) and reproduction needs affect the condition, nutrition and somatic energy storage of fish, which have been used as indicators of the physiological status of the population.

J	WILLIAMS, JB				WILLIAMS, JB			TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL PATTERNS OF ABUNDANCE OF THE CHYDORIDAE (CLADOCERA) IN LAKE ITASCA, MINNESOTA	ECOLOGY												The chydorid populations of Lake Itasca, Minnesota, were monitored over a 2.5-yr period by pattern sampling. Of the 24 spp. collected, 15 were sufficiently abundant to allow analysis of population trends. Chydorid species have 2 basic patterns of abundance. One group of species exhibits only a summer density peak. The 2nd group shows 1 abundance peak in summer and a 2nd peak in fall or winter. All species experience a precipitous decline in density following the summer peak. Population growth in chydorids is limited by different factors during different times of the year. During periods of ice cover most species are apparently limited by a reduction in primary productivity due to reduced light penetration rather than by water temperature. Spring chydorid populations are limited by temperature. Summer populations, at least for abundant species, are limited by predation. Chydorid species are distributed patchily within Chara beds. Patchiness is moderate in spring, declines to low levels during summer, and peaks in the fall for most species. Patchiness remained about constant during the summer decline in density. Experimentation showed that heterogeneity of the physical habitat is not a necessary cause of patchiness. A Bray-Curtis-type ordination was performed on data from a complete year of monitoring. The primary component of variation extracted from the data matrix is due to temporal differences in abundance among species. The 2nd major source of variation is due to spatial differences in abundance (habitat preference). The most abundant chydorid species tend to have similar habitats and temporal patterns of abundance.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1982	63	2					345	353		10.2307/1938952	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938952													WOS:A1982NS77900013

In this study, temporal variability of water level extremes is investigated across the plain river network region of the Taihu Basin. The driving force analysis on water level extremes is mainly conducted for atmospheric (rainfall, climatic index, and tide) and anthropogenic forcing. The quantile perturbation method is employed to examine variability of extreme values and the Spearman correlation analysis to identify potential drivers of extreme water level variability. Considering water level extremes in all seasons, the 1990s have statistically significant positive anomalies, while the late 1960s to the 1970s and the 2000s have significant negative anomalies. The oscillation pattern of anomaly in summer has a higher variability than that in the other three seasons. Significant correlations are detected between the anomalies of water level extremes and rainfall (tide level) during summer and winter. Water level extremes in summer and winter have a strong connection to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation, respectively. Conversely, no consistent significant correlations between water level extremes and climatic indices are found in spring and autumn, which is mainly related to hydraulic structure construction and operation.

In this study, we examined the vigilance levels of common cranes that exhibit flocking behavior during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons. We considered the influence of both social (age, presence of offspring, and flock size) and environmental factors (habitat type, time of day, and study period). Parents allocated more time for vigilance than nonparents and juveniles. The alertness of nonparents was lower in flocks of size 51-150 individuals compared to flocks under 50 and over 150 birds. Juveniles increased their vigilance at the end of the premigration period. Habitat type and time of day did not affect crane vigilance levels.

The lake, which is ice-covered for 8-10 mo/yr, is moderately eutrophic due to enrichment by seal excreta. The annual cycle of the phytoplankton is described. During the winter (.apprx. May-Sept.), very few algal cells were detected in the water column and 14C fixation was below measurable limits. In spring (Oct.-Nov.), a rapidly-growing population of algae caused a large increase in the chlorophyll a concentration (maximum value 170 mg m-2) but C fixation remained low, with values < 500 mg C m-2 day -1. The algae contributing to this peak were mainly small chlorophytes and chrysophytes. The summer open-water period (Dec.-March) was characterized by a different phytoplankton population dominated by cryptophytes. Chlorophyll levels were lower (.apprx. 40 mg m-2), but 14C fixation rates > 3 g C m-2 day-1 were measured on bright days. Values for assimilation number were very high (maximum value 10.5 mg C h-1 mg-1 (chlorophyll a)) in Jan. (1971) although temperatures never exceeded 8.degree. C. In autumn the phytoplankton regressed to winter levels. Both spring and summer algal populations probably overwinter as resting stages.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1981	11	1					11	26		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01239.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01239.x													WOS:A1981LC48100002

These stable isotopes track water movement through the catchment, especially seasonal precipitation and snow melt. All samples fall close to the regional meteoric water line but factors other than air temperature cause year-to-year variability. Residence times are in the order of days thus the lake water provides an average of precipitation falling only a few days before, except in the winter when the lakes are effectively closed. Freezing of surface waters preserves the isotope signature of the underlying waters from the previous summer. In spring, meltwaters from winter snow are isotopically depleted having delta(18)O and deltaD as low as -13parts per thousand and -100parts per thousand (VSMOW). Ice-cover break-up in late December allows complete water column mixing. By February, the lakes are relatively enriched isotopically (delta(18)O-9parts per thousand) by summer precipitation. Precipitation isotopic composition at Halley Station, Brunt Ice Shelf, is similar, illustrating the broad-scale effects of the Weddell Sea cyclonic atmospheric circulation. These data form a useful reference data-set for the ground-based validation of atmospheric models and palaeoclimate reconstructions in this isolated sector of the South Atlantic Ocean.

Circumpolar synchrony in big river bacterioplankton	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Natural bacterial communities are extremely diverse and highly dynamic, but evidence is mounting that the compositions of these communities follow predictable temporal patterns. We investigated these patterns with a 3-year, circumpolar study of bacterio-plankton communities in the six largest rivers of the pan-arctic watershed (Ob', Yenisey, Lena, Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie), five of which are among Earth's 25 largest rivers. Communities in the six rivers shifted synchronously over time, correlating with seasonal shifts in hydrology and biogeochemistry and clustering into three groups: winter/spring, spring freshet, and summer/fall. This synchrony indicates that hemisphere-scale variation in seasonal climate sets the pace of variation in microbial diversity. Moreover, these seasonal communities reassembled each year in all six rivers, suggesting a long-term, predictable succession in the composition of big river bacterioplankton communities.					; Crump, Byron/ABF-3711-2020; Raymond, Peter/C-4087-2009; Amon, Rainer/F-2524-2018	Crump, Byron/0000-0001-7062-1273; Raymond, Peter/0000-0002-8564-7860; Holmes, Robert Max/0000-0002-6413-9154; McClelland, James W/0000-0001-9619-8194													0027-8424					DEC 15	2009	106	50					21208	21212		10.1073/pnas.0906149106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0906149106								19940248					WOS:000272795300037

Here, we studied the Pb-210 variations in drip water and modern calcite depositions at five sampling sites in Maomaotou Big Cave in Guilin, south China, through more than three years of in situ monitoring. In this work, the air Rn-222 concentrations, weights and Pb-210-specific radioactivity of modern calcite depositions showed significant temporal and spatial variations. The modern calcite deposition weights and Rn-222 concentrations in the air of Maomaotou Big Cave ranged from 0.02 to 6.04 g and 62.9-628 Bq.m(-3) (higher values in summer-autumn and lower values in winter-spring), respectively, while the Pb-210-specific radioactivities in calcite depositions varied from 7.33 to 658.52 Bq.kg(-1), with lower values reported in summer-autumn and higher values in winter-spring. The opposite seasonal trends observed for the Rn-222 concentrations and Pb-210-specific radioactivity indicated that the air Rn-222 concentration was not the dominant factor influencing the Pb-210-specific radioactivity in the modern calcite depositions. This study concluded that Pb-210-specific radioactivity in modern calcite depositions is mainly carried by drip water; further, the remarkable negative correlation between deposition weight and Pb-210-specific radioactivity in modern calcite depositions suggests that the Constant Initial Concentration model (CIC) is fit for recent speleothem dating in a closed system. Such important information may provide a scientific basis for cave deposition dating using Pb-210.					jianjun, Yin/LDF-1082-2024; Pu, Junbing/A-8609-2015	Pu, Junbing/0000-0003-0418-4719													0883-2927					FEB	2020	113								104468	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.104468	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.104468													WOS:000514814800008

Models were built for all possible combinations of four external variables: spring-summer water temperature, June nearshore zooplankton density, spring abundance of alewives Alosa pseudoharengus, and an index of wind-induced transport of yellow perch larvae. Four relatively parsimonious models were deemed robust, and three external variables were represented (spring-summer water temperature, spring alewife abundance, and June zooplankton density). The Ricker stock-recruitment model with the lowest value of Akaike's information criterion (i.e., the best-supported model) included spring-summer water temperature and spring alewife abundance. The basic Ricker stock-recruitment model ranked second, followed by the Ricker model that included June zooplankton density. The fourth Rickermodel that was deemed robust included spring-summer water temperature. The four best models provided a good fit to age-0 yellow perch abundance estimates based on fall seining catches along the Illinois shoreline of Lake Michigan during 1989-2007. Our findings indicate that over the last two decades, yellow perch recruitment benefited during years associated with relatively warm water, low alewife abundance, and high zooplankton density.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2011	140	5					1277	1289		10.1080/00028487.2011.620480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2011.620480													WOS:000296143900012

Precipitation variability and its response to urbanization in the Taihu Lake Basin, China	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The precipitation pattern in the Taihu Lake basin in East China has significantly changed over the last decades, perhaps due to intensive urbanization. However, there is limited understanding of the effect of large-scale expansion of city groups on the precipitation variability, which causes a challenge for flood control in the basin. Considering the process of urbanization, we investigated in this study the variability of precipitation in different urban zones and characteristic scales and explored the influence of urban development on the rain island effect in the basin. The basin was divided into three zones (old urban area, new urban area, and suburbs) considering different degrees of urbanization. Results indicated that precipitation change and its response to urbanization had spatial differences at various characteristic scales. Urbanization exhibited a significant "precipitation enhancement effect" at the characteristic scales including annual, flood season, summer, autumn, and winter but indicated a "precipitation reduction effect" in spring. Annual (flood season) precipitation in 1990-2013 increased by 30.04 mm (16.94 mm), due to urbanization, compared with that in the preceding period. The rate of contribution of urbanization to precipitation increase was 15.6%, 41.1%, and 14.4% in summer, autumn, and winter. The enhancement effect of short duration rainfall extremes in old urban area was also discernible, and that in new urban areas would enhance along with urban expansion, complicating urban flood and waterlogging control. More effective adaptation strategies should be implemented to handle the unfavorable situation.

J	Josephson, DC; Youngs, WD				Josephson, DC; Youngs, WD			Association between emigration and age structure in populations of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in Adirondack lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Patterns of emigration by brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from five Adirondack lakes indicated a synchronized, repetitive response to seasonal stimuli over a 13-year period. Emigration occurred in the spring and fall with virtually no movement in the winter and summer. Spring emigration coincided with peak runoff from snowmelt and consisted of small numbers of mostly yearlings (94.8% of emigrants). Large-scale fall emigration from four lakes (32.7-68.8% potential losses from populations), by mostly mature fish (94.6% of emigrants), coincided with the spawning season for brook trout. Fall emigrants were likely searching for spawning sites, which were limited or unavailable within the lakes. In a larger set of 14 lakes, the greatest proportion of older (age 3) brook trout occurred in lakes with no outlets, which prevented emigration. In drainage lakes with outlets present, the proportions of older fish in lakes with later maturing strains (age 2-3) were greater than in those with earlier maturing strains (age 1-2). Later age at maturity would have delayed fall emigration from these lakes. Fall emigration appears to be a major factor that causes the virtual absence of older brook trout in many Adirondack lakes and must be assessed in future population dynamic studies.																			0706-652X					MAR	1996	53	3					534	541		10.1139/cjfas-53-3-534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-3-534													WOS:A1996UU21300010

A total of 152 taxa were identified by microscope, phytoplankton had an abundance ranging from 131.25x10(4) ind. L-1 to 745.88x10(4) ind. L-1. The highest phytoplankton abundance were observed in spring and the lowest in autumn. Cyanophyta, Euglenophyta and Cryptophyta were the most important groups in terms of abundance and biomass. The preponderant and sub-preponderant species changed in accordance with the seasons. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to investigate the relationship between environmental factors and phytoplankton community. The results indicated that nutrient gradient had a positive correlation with axis 1 in spring, summer and autumn. But in winter, the nutrient gradient had a positive correlation with axis 2. The varieties of environmental factors affected the structure of phytoplankton community in each season. CCA shows a slight, but significant method to understand the spatial distribution of phytoplankton community in lake systems.

J	Gebre, S; Alfredsen, K				Gebre, Solomon; Alfredsen, Knut			Contemporary trends and future changes in freshwater ice conditions: inference from temperature indices	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												This study examines current trends and future changes in five daily air-temperature derived proxy indices for freshwater ice regimes. The indices are autumn 0 degrees C isotherm date (autumn I-0), spring 0 degrees C isotherm date (spring I-0), winter duration (WD), maximum annual accumulated freezing degree-days (AFDD), and mid-winter thaw frequency. A total of 127 meteorological stations distributed across Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland) have been used to derive the indices for the contemporary period 1961-2010. Results show overall trends towards later autumn I-0 and stronger trends towards earlier spring I-0. Altogether, WD was shortened by a regional average of -5.2 +/- 2.9 days per decade, the reduction being significant at 5% level in 71 stations. AFDD decreased in all the 127 stations with a regional average of -57 +/- 35 degrees C-days per decade. The impact of future warming on the indices was investigated using climate signals from the IPCC's A1B emissions scenario. The results showed that WD will shorten by an average of 36 days in 2041-2070 and by an average of 51 days in 2071-2100. The ecological and socio-economic impacts of the observed and future changes in the indices are qualitatively evaluated.																			1998-9563	2224-7955					2014	45	3					455	478		10.2166/nh.2013.213	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2013.213													WOS:000338913600013

Brachionus angularis (Rotifera) is preferred in such studies because of their planktonic behavior, high fecundity, and absence of cryptic species. In this study, one-year zooplankton samples were collected twice a month from a subtropical lake and the roles of abiotic and biotic factors regulating the population dynamics of B. angularis were analyzed. The sampled B. angularis were composed of two discontinuous populations: 'summer and autumn' and 'spring and winter', segmented by high mixis rates. The 'summer and autumn' population had high egg ratios, but low egg volumes. Water temperature was the main factor driving temporal dynamics in density, thereby counteracting the negative effect of top-down force. Based on the synchronous dynamics of two fractions of chlorophyll-a, the densities of B. angularis, its potential competitors and predators, together with the reverse correlations between the egg ratio and population density, and Secchi-disk depth, we found that bottom-up and top-down forces were plausible factors regulating variations in population density in spring (March and April). However, the density peak of B. angularis in winter might be primarily ascribed to recruitment from the sediment. We further addressed the necessity for diverse evidence from the speciation of cryptic species, abundance, reproduction, and morphology, in understanding the population dynamics of a field rotifer population.

J	Robinson, CT; Rushforth, SR; Burgherr, P				Robinson, CT; Rushforth, SR; Burgherr, P			Seasonal effects of disturbance on a take outlet algal assemblage	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Streams flowing from lakes typically have high standing crops of filamentous algae and associated diatoms. Most outlet streams show more constant environmental conditions than other comparably-sized streams, as the lake ameliorates extreme fluctuations in flow, temperature, and water chemistry. We examined the recovery dynamics of periphyton following disturbance in a low elevation lake outlet in spring, summer, and winter. In each season, replicated 1 m(2) areas were disturbed every 0 (not disturbed), 5, 10, and 30 days. After 30 days, each area was sampled and assessed for periphyton biomass, relative abundance of common algal tars or groups (e.g. Cladaphora glomerata (L.) KUTZ., pennate diatoms), and diatom composition. Periphyton biomass of undisturbed areas was 4x greater in spring and winter than in summer, probably due to seasonal changes in ambient light (i.e, canopy coverage) and temperature. Response to disturbance varied seasonally with recovery fastest in summer (<10 days), intermediate in winter (<30 days), and slowest in spring (>30 days). Recovery primarily reflected increases in periphyton standing crops (i.e. growth of Cladophora) and seasonal changes in the abundance of some diatom species (e.g. Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta (EHR.) CL., Achnanthes minutissima KUTZ., and Nitzschia dissipata (KUTZ.) (GRUN.)). Principal components analysis revealed that other diatom species also showed a change in abundance to frequent disturbance in spring and winter, but not in summer. Our results indicate that recovery of lake outlet periphyton assemblages following disturbance reflects seasonal differences in the abundances of specific taxa. The interplay between algal life histories and seasonal changes in environmental conditions play a strong role in the recovery dynamics of algal communities to physical disturbance.

We studied seasonal and spatial variations of the abundance, diet composition and feeding selectivity of small omnivorous-planktivorous fish in relation to zooplankton at different habitats in a floodplain lake of the Lower Parana River. Fish catches were very high in spring and summer and scarce in autumn and winter, and their distribution varied among habitats in response to changes in refuge provision and oxygen concentration. Fish diet comprised zooplankton, phytoplankton and detritus, except in summer when Cyanobacteria prevailed; in general, cyclopoid copepods and cladocerans were positively selected. Macrozooplankton biomass was the highest in spring when calanoid copepods dominated, probably because their fast swimming velocity enabled their escape from predators. Lower macrozooplankton biomass in summer with low waters, was likely caused by harmful effects of Cyanobacteria or elevated salinity, while washing-out or dilution processes may explain macrozooplankton scarcity during cold seasons under low fish predation pressure. Our results indicate that in floodplain lakes, factors affected by or related to hydrology (salinity, Cyanobacteria development, dilution and washing-out processes) may have stronger influence than predation on zooplankton structure.

Overall prevalence, mean intensity, and coefficient of dispersion showed the same pattern of seasonal changes.

However, there exists an alternative state, which is unstable and can shift to either a clean or a turbid state depending on varied environmental factors. In this paper, we report a lake undergoing a pattern of seasonal shifting. We found that Lake Xingyun appeared clean in winter with low level of nutrients, low Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and high secchi depth (SD). However, during summer, the lake turned into turbid with higher level of nutrients and Chl-a, but lower SD. In close response to environmental changes, phytoplankton population of the lake also adopted a pattern of seasonal shift. The order of the seasonal appearances of the dominant populations was as follows: Cyanophyta and Cryptophyta in spring, Microcystis in summer, Melosira in autumn, and Chlorophyta in winter. Our data clearly indicate that Lake Xingyun stayed in clean state in winter but became turbid in summer, and 0.07-0.135mg/L can be considered as the total phosphorus (TP) threshold concentration for Lake Xingyun's alternation between those two states. We also found that both TP and water temperature were the major factors influencing the phytoplankton biomass and its succession. In addition, wind also played a significant role in promoting the dominance of Chlorophyta in winter. In conclusion, Lake Xingyun, represents an alternative state lake with a certain nutrient level, can undergo a seasonal regime shift. Temperature change is the primary force that drives Lake Xingyun to shift its regime state.

In this paper, we investigate if S-35 can be utilized as an independent tracer to quantify glacier melt. We report the first measurements of S-35 in samples collected from the Tibetan Plateau during 2009-2012 with an aim to interpret S-35 in atmospheric particles and their deposition over glacier and snowmelts. Our measurements show that S-35 activity in the aerosol phase varies from 116 +/- 13 to 2229 +/- 52 atoms/m(3) resulting in higher values during winter-spring and lower values during summer-autumn. This seasonality is likely due to higher mixing of S-35-rich stratospheric air masses during winter-spring and S-35-poor air masses from the Bay of Bengal during the Asian summer monsoon. The average S-35 activity in the Zhadang glacier was found to be 3-8 times higher relative to the nearby lake water. The main source of S-35 activity in the Zhadang glacier is atmospheric deposition, whereas both atmospheric deposition and glacier snowmelt are the primary sources in the Nam Co Lake. The focus of this study is to quantitatively determine the spatial and temporal variations in glacier snowmelt. In the future, extensive sampling of aerosols and snow is required for determining S-35 in combination with stable oxygen isotopes in sulfate to better understand the glacier melt process and hydrological cycle on the Tibetan Plateau.					; Zhang, Zhisheng/W-5138-2019; Lin, Mang/C-1451-2013; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018	Zhang, Zhisheng/0000-0002-3742-0880; Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005													2169-897X	2169-8996				APR 16	2014	119	7					4125	4135		10.1002/2013JD019801	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013JD019801													WOS:000334908300028

The hierarchical nature and seasonality of stream ecosystems suggests a strong system specific response to ecological disturbance. We tested this idea experimentally by disturbing the substratum along a series of transects in a lake outlet during summer, spring, and winter. Our results showed a strong influence of season on the recovery dynamics of the benthic community. Disturbance reduced periphyton biomass only in winter and spring. No disturbance affect was found in summer when algal biomass remained at low levels because of a dense riparian canopy that attenuated solar radiation. In winter and spring, periphyton attained high standing crops only in the absence of disturbance. Benthic organic matter recovered within 30 days regardless of season, primarily due to the rapid accumulation of coarse particulate organic matter. A seasonal response to disturbance also was reflected in the macroinvertebrate community. We found no affects of disturbance on macroinvertebrate densities or species richness in summer, but significant affects on these parameters in winter and spring. The seasonal response in macroinvertebrate parameters corresponded to structural changes in periphyton biomass, and also reflected macroinvertebrate life histories. The results suggest that the recovery of macroinvertebrate communities from physical disturbance is primarily a function of changes in habitat conditions and seasonal shifts in life history.

Here, we experimentally investigated the effects of six flooding regimes with contrasting combinations of flooding duration (5.5, 6 and 6.5 months) and submergence rate (from 3.3 to 17.5 cm/day) on the growth and reproductive traits of Carex cinerascens, a dominant plant species of the Poyang Lake wetland in southern China. The time span of this study included a summer flooding event and the following growing seasons (autumn of first year and spring of following year) before the return of the next flooding event. The six flooding treatments affected plant traits during the flooding and the following growing seasons, but the different submergence rates under the same flooding duration did generally not show significant influence on plant traits. The 6.5-month flooding treatments had many fewer old (0.4 on average) and new stems (1 on average) than the 5.5-month treatments (8.3 and 29 stems, respectively) at the end of the flooding. The treatments with 5.5 months of flooding had 23% more stems than the other treatments and 26% more community biomass than the 6-month flooding treatments during the autumn growing season. The effects of summer flooding persisted in spring of the following year, but with an opposite trend of C. cinerascens growth traits response to flooding treatments compared to autumn. In addition, the 6-month flooding treatments induced a higher number of inflorescences (39) than the 5.5-month (22) and 6.5-month floods (3). Altogether, our findings highlighted the important legacy effects of summer flooding with some trade-offs between growth recovery (autumn) and resilience (following spring) and between resource allocation to biomass production in autumn and resource allocation to sexual reproduction in the following spring, that were both mediated by flooding duration.					; Mariotte, Pierre/G-4798-2011; Santonja, Mathieu/M-8020-2019; Xu, Ligang/HHZ-1943-2022; Cheng, Junxiang/S-4125-2018	Santonja, Mathieu/0000-0002-6322-6352; Mariotte, Pierre/0000-0001-8570-8742; 													2045-7758					MAY	2025	15	5							e71395	10.1002/ece3.71395	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.71395								40330105					WOS:001482451400001

MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Age, growth and maturity parameters were examined for the southern Australian ommastrephid squid Nototodarus gouldi. Squid were obtained from the fishing ports of: Ulladulla, New South Wales; Port Lincoln, South Australia; Lakes Entrance, Victoria; and Hobart, Tasmania. Squid were collected during 2 seasonal periods: summer/autumn-caught (warm-season squid) and spring-caught (cool-season squid) over 2 consecutive years (2000, 2001). N. gouldi is a sexually dimorphic species, with females generally reaching larger sizes than males. Initial genetic analysis has found only a single species in Australian waters. Statolith ageing revealed that squid completed their life cycle in <1 yr, and appear to hatch throughout the year. Trends in size, growth and maturity varied considerably between sites, seasons and years. Squids hatched in summer/autumn grew consistently faster than squid that hatched in winter/spring, presumably due to the influence of temperature on growth. Squid in 1999/2000 also grew faster than squid in 2000/2001. Growth of female squid in winter correlated with sea surface colour (SSC) during peak hatch periods, but the SSC relationship did not exist for males. Ulladulla squid were generally smaller, younger, had smaller gonads than most other squid and were possibly a smaller morph of the species. Tasmania and Lakes Entrance tended to have larger older individuals with larger gonads, while Port Lincoln was variable and intermediate. However, during spring 2001 both Tasmania and Port Lincoln had individuals that were much smaller than those of the other seasons for these sites, and were more like those from Ulladulla. Trends in age of mature individuals showed considerable variability (over 100 d from youngest to oldest) and there appeared to be a cline across all sites and seasons. Arrow squid appear to reveal marked plasticity in age, growth and maturity parameters, but currently the extent to which the environment or genetics control plasticity is unclear.

How can we use this data to generate accurate vegetation cover maps on a local scale? Our main objective was to assess the use of multitemporal C-Band Sentinel-1 data to generate wetland vegetation maps. We considered a portion of the Lower Delta of the Parana River wetland (Argentina). Seventy-four images were acquired and 90 datasets were created with them, each one addressing a combination of seasons (spring, autumn, winter, summer, complete set), polarization (VV, HV, both), and texture measures (included or not). For each dataset, a Random Forest classifier was trained. Then, the kappa index values (kappa) obtained by the 90 classifications made were compared. Considering the datasets formed by the intensity values, for the winter dates the achieved kappa index values (kappa) were higher than 0.8, while all summer datasets achieved. up to 0.76. Including feature textures based on the GLCM showed improvements in the classifications: for the summer datasets, the. improvements were between 9% and 22% and for winter datasets improvements were up to 15%. Our results suggest that for the analyzed context, winter is the most informative season. Moreover, for dates associated with high biomass, the textures provide complementary information.					; Rajngewerc, Mariela/HHZ-4176-2022	Rajngewerc, Mariela/0000-0001-8268-3260; 													1133-0953	1988-8740				JUL	2022		60					29	46		10.4995/raet.2022.16915	http://dx.doi.org/10.4995/raet.2022.16915													WOS:000832032600003

Macroinveretebrates were usually the primary (% by number) prey item selected by yellow perch <200 mm, while prey fishes were commonly the primary (% by weight) prey source for yellow perch ≥130 mm, and fish consumption was observed in yellow perch as small as 65 mm. Yellow perch that exceeded 130 mm regularly consumed fish, and prey fish selection varied considerably by season. During the spring, the two primary prey fishes were brook stickleback (Culae inconstans) and johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum). During the early summer months, larval fishes appeared in yellow perch diets. Lepomids were the primary fishes consumed during late summer, fall, and winter months.

The main conclusions drawn from the data are that: (a) the aromatic C fraction which is assumed to be refractory remains at less than 10% of the total, with a slight increase in relative importance in the fall, (b) less structurally complex aliphatic carbon decreases from winter to spring and remains at lower levels into later fall, (c) carbohydrates are at a maximum during the summer, (d) the carboxylic C fraction is at a minimum in the summer and maximum in the fall and winter. Results show roughly the same annual patterns of C composition for the two running water sites. Our data suggest that the hydrological processes which carry terrestrial and wetland DOM to streams and lakes allow a selective adsorption process of DOM to occur in soils. We compare our data to those from other freshwater studies and suggest that the importance of aromatic carbon in freshwaters has probably been overestimated in the past, with a corresponding underestimate of the more biologically labile carbohydrate and aliphatic material.																			0018-8158					JAN 12	1996	317	2					141	150		10.1007/BF00018737	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018737													WOS:A1996TY88100006

Reduced total phosphorus concentrations in the summer which followed the addition of iron aluminum sulphate to White Lough [Northern Ireland] failed to reduce significantly the phytoplankton, which continued to be dominated by Oscillatoria agardhii var. isothrix Skuja. This species was present throughout the 4 years studied, forming over 50% of the algal volume in 80% of samples. In contrast, species which occurred principally in the summer months were found to be severely curtailed when sediment release of phosphorus was suppressed. 2. The phosphorus:carotenoid ratio was used to assess the extent of phosphorus limitation because laboratory studies on O. agardhii var. isothrix showed that this ratio was a much better indicator of cell phosphorus content than the phosphorus: chlorophyll a ratio. Reduced summer phosphorus concentrations in White Lough caused a transition from intermittent to continuous phosphorus limitation rather than a proportion reduction in the summer phytoplankton. 3. Reduced autumn grazing pressure by Daphnia hyalina Leydig allowed large algal productions to develop in the winters following phosphorus reduction despite a 50% decline in total phosphorus. The combination of increased winter phytoplankton and lower total phosphorus reduced soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations to less than 5 .mu.g P l-1 which in turn curtailed the spring diatom pulse.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	1987	17	1					1	13		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01024.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01024.x													WOS:A1987G318300001

Of the total of 141 faecal samples studied, 0-21% were found to be positive for C. jejuni at various sampling times throughout the year. More cows were found to be campylobacter positive in summer or in autumn after the grazing period than after the winter, when the animals were inside and their drinking water source was municipal chlorinated tap water. C. jejuni was isolated from most of the lake water samples. Serotyping with heat stable antigens and molecular typing with PFGE using SacII- and SmaI digested DNA revealed that an animal that was permanently infected with C. jejuni sero-/PFGE-type PEN 0/6, 25/I/ND most probably contaminated the lake water in summer 1987. This was the only sero/PFGE-type isolated from the lake water in summer and autumn 1987 and in spring 1988. This sero/PFGE-type was also isolated from four other cows in autumn 1987, suggesting that lake water was the source of the infection. This study is first to employ molecular methods to assess the possible role of contaminated drinking water in the transmission of campylobacter infection within a dairy herd.																			0931-1793					FEB	1998	45	1					37	42											9529995					WOS:000072193000006

Highest infrapopulations occurred during fall and winter and lowest in mid to late summer. The composition of the infrapopulations varied seasonally. From late spring to late summer, the majority of worms were segmented (maturing) or gravid; this period coincided with time of recruitment. Beginning in Oct. and continuing into May, nearly all (> 98%) of the worms were nonsegmented. The major shifts in composition occurred when surface water temperatures increased above 25.degree. C in the spring and fell below 25.degree. C in the fall. Laboratory studies showed conclusively that growth and development were stimulated at water temperatures > 25.degree. C. At temperatures above 25.degree. C, mean infrapopulation densities declined significantly. The decline in mean infrapopulation densities could result from a temperature-dependent rejection response, selective mortality or an immune response. The best evidence points to competition for limited space or nutrient resources within the intestine of mosquitofish as the most probable cause for decline in parasite density. Egg maturation and hatching, and coracidium motility were all found to be temperature dependent, with maximum activity occurring at 25.degree. and 30.degree. C; at 20.degree. and 35.degree. C, activity was depressed. The lower hatching success and briefer period of coracidium motility at 35.degree.

Results show that decreased (increased) spring SIC in the Arctic Ocean and the Greenland Sea corresponds to increased (decreased) summer rainfall in northeast China and central China between the Yangtze River and the Yellow River (28 degrees-36 degrees N); and decreased (increased) rainfall in south China. Corresponding summer 500 hPa height anomalies show a Eurasian wave train structure, which originates in northern Europe and extends southeastwards to northeast China, and a south-north dipole structure over East Asia south to Lake Baikal. Such a spatial distribution of 500 hPa height anomalies and corresponding summer rainfall anomalies cannot be entirely attributed to the impact of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) variability. The spring Arctic SIC provides a complementary precursor for Chinese summer rainfall variability. The combined impacts of both spring Arctic SIC and Eurasian snow cover on the Eurasian wave train may explain their statistical linkage. Citation: Wu, B., R. Zhang, B. Wang, and R.

In this paper, we describe climate sensitivities and possible impacts of climate warming for two economically important fish species: walleye Stizostedion vitreum and smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu. Climate driven variation in recruitment within populations is demonstrated using long time series of recruitment data from the Lake Erie walleye population and the Lake Opeongo smallmouth bass population. Climate driven differences between populations in growth and reproductive timing is illustrated using comparative data from 73 walleye populations and 10 smallmouth bass populations. Quantitative definitions of these sensitivities are used to derive spatially explicit assessments of the potential impacts of climate change on: sustainable yields and angling efforts for the walleye populations of Ontario; and the position, within Ontario, of the northern zoogeographic boundary for smallmouth bass. Evidence for recent changes in Ontario's climate was provided by analyses of long time series of water temperature data from Lake Erie and air temperature data from Lake Opeongo. Over the last 40 years, significant changes in specific seasons were detected: winters are becoming shorter and summers are becoming longer and warmer. Winter and summer indices were significantly correlated with the global air temperature index, suggesting that future changes of these seasons in Ontario will reflect changes in the global index. The spring warming rate and fall cooling rate did not exhibit significant temporal trends or significant associations with the global temperature index. These results suggest that fish populations that are particularly sensitive to current winter conditions may be the first to exhibit impacts from climate change, while populations that are particularly sensitive to current fall/spring conditions may be the last to exhibit impacts.

We conducted an annual-based survey of the trophic niche of the mysid Hemimysisanomala in the largest European peri-alpine lake by combining molecular and isotope analyses. We hypothesized that the population trophic niche width would vary seasonally, expanding in warm periods due to greater ecological opportunities and higher mysid metabolic activity. Molecular analyses identified a diversified set of prey throughout the year ranging from autotrophic protists to zooplankton and converged with isotope analyses to support the diet seasonality hypothesis of H.anomala with wider trophic niches and, in a lower extent, richer diets in spring and summer when compared to autumn and winter. Isotope analyses also highlighted a seasonal pattern in resources used with a dominance of pelagic reliance in summer and autumn. These results underlined the significant seasonal variability in the trophic niche of this invasive mysid suggesting that future assessments of its ecological impacts should account for the temporal variations of its trophic interactions with the native biodiversity.

This region's agriculture and people are highly vulnerable to the variability in the autumn rain. This study documents that the water vapour for West China autumn precipitation (WCAP) is from the Bay of Bengal, the South China Sea and the Western Pacific. A strong convergence of the three water vapour transports (WVTs) and their encounter with the cold air from the northern trough over Lake Barkersh-Lake Baikal result in the intense WCAP. Three predictors in the preceding spring or summer are identified for the interannual variability of WCAP: (1) sea surface temperature in the Indo-Pacific warm pool in summer, (2) soil moisture from the Hexi Corridor to the Hetao Plain in summer and (3) snow cover extent over East Europe and West Siberian in spring. The cold SSTAs contribute to an abnormal regional meridional circulation and intensified WVTs. The wet soil results in greater air humidity and anomalous southerly emerging over East Asia. Reduced snow cover stimulates a Rossby wave train that weakens the cold air, favouring autumn rainfall in West China. The three predictors, which demonstrate the influences of air-sea interaction, land surface processes and the cryosphere on the WCAP, have clear physical significance and are independent with each other. We then develop a new statistical prediction model with these predictors and the multilinear regression analysis method. The predicted and observed WCAP shows high correlation coefficients of 0.63 and 0.51 using cross-validation tests and independent hindcasts, respectively.					; dong, wenjie/F-4314-2012	Ting, Wei/0000-0001-9822-6494; Dong, Wenjie/0000-0002-9635-6292													0177-798X	1434-4483				JAN	2019	135	1-2					183	192		10.1007/s00704-017-2363-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-017-2363-7													WOS:000459226500013

A bioenergetic assessment of the influence of stocking practices on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) growth and consumption in a New Zealand lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1To investigate the carrying capacity and factors affecting growth of rainbow trout in Lake Rotoiti, we employed a bioenergetics model to assess the influence of stocking rates, timing of releases and prey abundance on growth and prey consumption. We hypothesised that stocking rates and prey abundance would affect growth and prey consumption by influencing per-capita prey availability, and that the environmental conditions encountered by fish at the time of stocking would affect growth and consumption. 2Prey consumption of stocked rainbow trout was calculated with the Wisconsin bioenergetics model. We calculated growth trajectories of released trout based on data from stocked trout that were released in spring and autumn from 1993 to 2009 and then re-captured by anglers. Diet, prey energy density, body mass lost during spawning and lake temperature were measured locally. 3Stocking timing had no effect on return rates to anglers or length or weight of caught fish. Although trout released in autumn were smaller than those released in spring, autumn-released trout grew at a faster rate and had similar lengths and weights to spring cohorts after 2years of growth in the lake. Modelled consumption parameters were negatively correlated with trout population size, suggesting that stocking rates (347809fishha1year1) caused density-dependent effects on growth. Although common smelt (Retropinna retropinna) accounted for 85% of total prey consumption, no significant relationship was found between prey consumption by individual trout and adult smelt abundance, possibly because trout are targeting smaller smelt that our abundance estimate did not account for. 4Releasing trout in autumn appears to be advantageous for growth, possibly because (i) temperature is more suitable for growth in autumnwinter than in springsummer and (ii) prey for small trout is abundant in autumn. Mild winter conditions appear to enhance overwinter survival and growth of rainbow trout in warm-temperate lakes compared to higher latitudes. This implies that moderately productive warm-temperate lake ecosystems are highly suitable for trout growth in winter, but less so in summer, when lake stratification and high nutrient levels may create conditions suitable for algal blooms and hypolimnetic deoxygenation. High growth rates of trout in warm-temperate lakes can therefore be supported by timing releases to coincide with favourable winter conditions.

The results show that more than 90% of the moisture can be tracked when the backtracking time is set to 10 days. There are three similar moisture transport paths in winter and summer, namely, the Mediterranean-Caspian Sea-Balkhash Lake path, the Eastern European Plain-Western Siberian Plain-Balkhash Lake path, and the Arabian Peninsula-Iranian Plateau-Pamir Plateau path. Besides, there is one more path in summer: the Indian Ocean-Indian Peninsula-Pamir Plateau. The paths of moisture transport in spring (autumn) are similar to those in winter (summer). In summer, the contribution rate of Xinjiang itself and Central Asia accounts for more than 80%, among which the local contributions account for 52%. In the other three seasons, Xinjiang, Central Asia, North Africa-Arabian Peninsula, and South Asia are the main sources of moisture. The contribution rates of moisture uptake in the source regions other than Central Asia vary greatly with the seasons. The interannual variation of contribution rate to precipitation of each source region is limited. Regionally, the moisture source distribution for southern Xinjiang resembles those of the whole Xinjiang; for the northern Xinjiang, the contribution of Central Asia becomes more important.

THE EXCHANGE OF PHOSPHORUS BETWEEN SEDIMENTS AND WATER	EKOLOGIA POLSKA-POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In spring, summer and winter the sediments in lakes examined released phosphates, whereas in autumn they absorbed them from the near-bottom water. During summer stagnation the maximal release rates were 11.0 mg P .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1 in mesotrophic lake up to 21.2 mg P .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1 in the eutrophic polluted lake. At that time 83-96% of annual PO4-P release by sediments was realized. Under anoxic conditions the amount of PO4-P release by sediments was directly proportional to phosphate concentration in interstitial water. Under oxic conditions the direction and quantity of PO4-P exchange between sediments and adjacent water depended on the concentration of phosphates in the near-bottom water.																			0070-9557						1985	33	2					329	344																WOS:A1985C434700009

Seasonal fluctuations were insignificant (p-value > 0.05) relative to the mean total P (TP) concentrations. Still, the highest levels were in autumn samples (1555 mg kg(-1)), followed by winter (1405 mg kg(-1)), spring (1378 mg kg(-1)), and summer (1130 mg kg(-1)). These minor temporal fluctuations in P concentrations are explained by seasonal differences in runoff amount and intensity of rivers discharging into the Caspian sea and thereby their sediment loading and physicochemical characteristics. The large riverine influx has led to TP contamination hotspots in the river deltas of Anzali wetland, Babolrood, and Sefidrud, where high loadings of suspended particles are discharged into the sea. The spatial distribution of TP is thus site-specific and uneven. The main P fraction was calcium-bound P (CaP), reflecting the phosphate (PO43-) strong affinity for, and association with, Ca-bearing minerals. Only a minor fraction of P was determined as loosely bound P (LP). The fraction of the mud size particles was the main explanatory factor for the spatial distribution of overall low levels of non-residual (or bioavailable) P forms (i.e., LP and iron- and aluminum- bound P: FeP and AlP, respectively) during spring and summer, while the sand fraction had strongest explanatory value for the distribution of residual (non-bioavailable) P form (CaP) during autumn and winter. This study demonstrates that P bioavailability in sediments is mainly governed by the physicochemical characteristics of the sediment material, which again is steered by seawater chemistry. A low content of bioavailable P fractions could therefore be explained by the relatively low content of fine-grained (< 63 mu m, i.e., mud) particles in sediments of the southern Caspian Sea.

Biogeochemistry of selenium compounds in the water column of warm monomictic Lake Kinneret	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The biogeochemistry of dissolved selenium (Se) was investigated over 3 years (2015-2017) in the subtropical, warm monomictic and meso-eutrophic Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel). We monitored seasonal variation and vertical distribution of dissolved total Se (T.Se), inorganic oxyanions (Se(IV) & Se(VI)), reduced Se fraction (Red.Se), organic (Org.Se) and volatile Se compounds. T.Se varied between similar to 100 and 160 ng L-1 with Red.Se comprising 40-80% of the Se inventory, and Se(VI) dominating over Se(IV) most of the time. The variation in T.Se and species correlated with winter holomixis vs. summer fall stratification periods. The annual cycle includes: (a) increase of T.Se from fall/winter to spring, representing increased allochthonous Se input flux, along with Se recycling via holomixis; (b) decrease of T.Se from spring to the end of the year, representing the diminishing Se inputs and the evolving output fluxes to the lake's bottom and to the atmosphere. Org.Se variations are directly associated with Chlorophyll-a and primary production attesting for the significant role of phytoplankton activity in the Se cycle. An important Se output flux comprises spring to summer Se uptake by phytoplankton and further volatile compounds production and volatilization accounting for similar to 10% of estimated Se input. The similarity of total dissolved Se concentrations in this work and from mid 1990s attests for long-term stability of the Se inventory. The TVSe concentrations in lacustrine systems being similar to that of estuary systems, the biological role of phytoplankton and eventually the degradation of organic material may produce similar fluxes of volatile Se to the atmosphere.

J	BASKIN, CC; BASKIN, JM; CHESTER, EW				BASKIN, CC; BASKIN, JM; CHESTER, EW			SEED-GERMINATION ECOPHYSIOLOGY OF 4 SUMMER ANNUAL MUDFLAT SPECIES OF CYPERACEAE	AQUATIC BOTANY												Cyperus erythrorhizos Muhl., C. flavicomus Michx., Fimbristylis autumnalis (L.) R.&S. and F. vahlii (Lam.) Link are characteristic summer annuals on mudflats that appear every late summer-autumn when water levels in Lake Barkley, an impoundment on the Cumberland River in Tennessee and Kentucky USA, are lowered. Seeds of each species were buried under nonflooded conditions and exposed to natural seasonal temperature changes for 28 months. Each month, exhumed seeds were tested for germination in light and darkness at 12/12 h daily thermoperiods of 15/6, 20/10, 25/15, 30/15 and 35/20-degrees-C. At maturity in autumn, seeds of C. flavicomus were dormant, while those of C. erythrorhizos, F. autumnalis and F. vahlii germinated to high percentages, but only at high temperatures. Seeds of the four species after-ripened during winter and germinated to 93-100% in light at 25/15, 30/15 and 35/20-degrees-C by February. During the remaining 25 months of burial, seeds germinated to 91-100% in light at simulated May (25/15-degrees-C), June (30/15-degrees-C), July (35/20-degrees-C), August (35/20-degrees-C) and September (30/15-degrees-C) temperatures in each respective month; exhumed seeds of C. erythrorhizos, C. flavicomus, F. autumnalis and F. vahlii germinated to a maximum of 7%,4%, 73% and 0%, respectively, in darkness. Seeds flooded from October to April or May came out of dormancy during winter, and those flooded from February to August did not re-enter dormancy. Thus, the major effect of flooding is prevention of germination while mudflats are under water. Since seeds do not enter dormancy in spring or summer, they can germinate any time during the growing season if the mudflats become exposed.																			0304-3770					MAR	1993	45	1					41	52		10.1016/0304-3770(93)90051-W	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(93)90051-W													WOS:A1993KU18000004

Shifts in controls on the temporal coherence of throughfall chemical flux in Acadia National Park, Maine, USA	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY					BIOGEOMON Conference	JUL 19, 2012	Northport, ME					Major ion and mercury (Hg) inputs to terrestrial ecosystems include both wet and dry deposition (total deposition). Estimating total deposition to sensitive receptor sites is hampered by limited information regarding its spatial heterogeneity and seasonality. We used measurements of throughfall flux, which includes atmospheric inputs to forests and the net effects of canopy leaching or uptake, for ten major ions and Hg collected during 35 time periods in 1999-2005 at over 70 sites within Acadia National Park, Maine to (1) quantify coherence in temporal dynamics of seasonal throughfall deposition and (2) examine controls on these patterns at multiple scales. We quantified temporal coherence as the correlation between all possible site pairs for each solute on a seasonal basis. In the summer growing season and autumn, coherence among pairs of sites with similar vegetation was stronger than for site-pairs that differed in vegetation suggesting that interaction with the canopy and leaching of solutes differed in coniferous, deciduous, mixed, and shrub or open canopy sites. The spatial pattern in throughfall hydrologic inputs across Acadia National Park was more variable during the winter snow season, suggesting that snow re-distribution affects net hydrologic input, which consequently affects chemical flux. Sea-salt corrected calcium concentrations identified a shift in air mass sources from maritime in winter to the continental industrial corridor in summer. Our results suggest that the spatial pattern of throughfall hydrologic flux, dominant seasonal air mass source, and relationship with vegetation in winter differ from the spatial pattern of throughfall flux in these solutes in summer and autumn. The coherence approach applied here made clear the strong influence of spatial heterogeneity in throughfall hydrologic inputs and a maritime air mass source on winter patterns of throughfall flux. By contrast, vegetation type was the most important influence on throughfall chemical flux in summer and autumn.

Phytoplankton blooms and low oxygen have also been observed in these lakes under winter ice; however, detailed studies coupling winter stratification to biogeochemistry are lacking. In this study, four years of continuous high resolution temperature and dissolved oxygen observations are analyzed from a small temperate lake in Ontario, Canada. The lake exhibits near-bed hypoxia and anoxia 2/3 and 1/3 of the time, respectively, and so a low oxygen concentration state should be considered typical for the lake. The watercolumn resets to atmospheric oxygen levels only during fall turnover (63-79 d) and long spring turnover (17-19 d) events. Short spring turnover events (1-8 d), which occur during anomalously warm and calm weather conditions, have uniform temperature profiles, through direct heating of the entire watercolumn with short wave solar radiation. The watercolumn subsequently stratifies and wind and convection induced mixing are insufficient to fully mix oxygen over the depth.																					978-7-89437-020-4				2012							1168	1179																WOS:000396804100110
J	Pieters, R; Lawrence, GA				Pieters, Roger; Lawrence, Gregory A.			Effect of salt exclusion from lake ice on seasonal circulation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We describe the circulation of Tailings Lake, located 220 km north of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. From Jul 2004 to Sep 2007, temperature and conductivity profiles were collected together with data from three moored temperature chains and a meteorological station. The salt content of the lake was elevated ( salinity 1 g L-1) relative to surrounding natural waters (similar to 0.1 g L-1). Winter ice cover included 60-80 cm of transparent "black" ice, which excluded up to 99% of the salt from the water as the ice formed. During winter, the salt excluded from the ice was mixed throughout the water column under the ice. In spring, ice melt and snow runoff resulted in a freshwater cap; the density contrast between this fresh epilimnion and the more saline hypolimnion was sufficient to inhibit spring turnover. In summer, the epilimnion was deepened by storms, mixing anoxic water from the hypolimnion into the surface layer. Because spring turnover was suppressed, oxygen replenishment of the hypolimnion occurred only in fall. Although Tailings Lake has been subject to numerous anthropogenic changes, similar effects can be expected in other natural and manmade water bodies with elevated salinity and significant ice cover.

The objectives of the present study were to assess the changes observed in the chemical composition of the water column following resuspension of a polluted marine sediment and the consequences for the chemical composition of adjacent marine waters according to season. For that purpose, an experimental sediment resuspension protocol was performed on four distinct occasions, spring, summer, fall and winter, and the changes in nutrients, organic contaminants and inorganic contaminants were measured after mixing sediment elutriate with lagoon waters and offshore waters sampled nearby. Significant seasonal variations in the chemical composition of the contaminated sediments were observed, with a strong accumulation of PAHs in fall, whereas minimum PAH concentrations were observed during, winter. In all seasons, sediment resuspension provoked a significant enrichment in nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, and trace metal elements like Ni, Cu, and Zn in offshore waters and lagoon waters, with enrichment factors that were season and site dependent. The most pronounced changes were observed for offshore waters, especially in spring and winter, whereas the chemical composition of lagoon waters was weakly impacted by the compounds supplied by sediment resuspension.

Recent toxic cyanobacterial blooms caused by excessive human nutrient loading have focused attention on arresting blooms and restoring the lake to acceptable water quality conditions by reducing nutrient inputs. Field sampling and in situ nutrient enrichment bioassays were conducted to determine seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation and nutrient thresholds for phytoplankton growth. The TN: TP and TDN: TDP mass ratios in the ambient water showed high seasonal variation and changed from 33-80 : 1 and 52-212:1, respectively, in winter and spring, and both declined to below 20 : 1 in summer. In spring and winter, total phytoplankton biomass and growth rates increased significantly with additions of P, with no primary effects from N, suggesting P limitation of phytoplankton growth. During the summer and fall bloom periods, however, N additions alone revealed a significant positive effect on phytoplankton growth, and P additions only stimulated phytoplankton growth once N had been added, suggesting that N was the primary limiting nutrient, with P being a secondarily limiting nutrient. When P enrichment was >= 0.20 mg P L-1 and N enrichment >= 0.80 mg N L-1, growth of the toxin-producing, dominant bloom-forming cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. was not nutrient limited. This study suggests that availability of N during the summer is a key growth-limiting factor for the proliferation and maintenance of toxic Microcystis spp. blooms. Therefore, although P load reduction is important, N load reduction is essential for controlling the magnitude and duration of algal booms in Taihu.					xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Paerl, Hans/ACA-9911-2022; Gao, Guang/AAJ-8676-2021														0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2010	55	1					420	432		10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0420	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0420													WOS:000272759900029

No differences in hourly movement rates or home ranges were detected among stocks. Movement rates were greatest during spring (mean +/- SE = 42 +/- 4 m h(-1)), lowest during summer (16 +/- 3 m h(-1)) and intermediate in autumn (28 +/- 5 m h(-1)). Additionally, movement rates during the summer were greater at night than crepuscular periods. Home range sizes were similar during spring and autumn (mean +/- SE = 1718 +/- 34 ha) and decreased during summer (5 +/- 3 ha). Although habitat selection characteristics were generally similar among stocks, fish from the Upper Mississippi River drainage occupied deeper water more frequently and selected the pelagic zone more strongly during the spring than those from the Ohio River and mixed-origin stocks. Within the littoral zone, muskellunge selected coarse woody habitat and aquatic macrophytes. Collectively, these findings suggest little behavioural differentiation among genetically divergent stocks when evaluated in a common reservoir environment.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				DEC	2011	18	6					482	496		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2011.00802.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2011.00802.x													WOS:000297208100005
J	Che, YH; Parsons, K; Yu, BF				Che, Yahui; Parsons, Katherine; Yu, Bofu			Assessment of a revised dust prediction model for Mildura, Australia	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Dust storms are regarded as global natural hazards, adversely impacting the climate, economy, and human health. As a dry continent, Australia is extensively impacted by dust storm activity, particularly in dry seasons. Located in the Mallee region and 600 km downwind of the Lake Eyre Basin, Mildura is one of the most vulnerable regional cities to dust storms. Rapid development of agriculture in the Mildura region removed natural vegetation and increased the frequency of dust storms in the 20th century. To better understand the factors and processes that affect dust storm activity in Mildura, a seasonal predictive model for dust event days was developed in the early 1990s. This was based on an empirical relationship between seasonal rainfall in preceding autumn and summer dust event days (the most active dust season in Mildura). In this study, this model was applied for a further 24-year period (from 1990 to 2013) to test model validity for forecasting dust activity. Results show that the r(2) was 0.13 and the root mean square error was 5.33 days in the 'forecast' mode, which indicates poorer model performance than that for the original calibration period (1960-1989). All large 'forecast' errors occurred in the 1990s. Winter rainfall was identified as the main climate factor for overprediction. The effect of the preceding winter rainfall on summer dust event occurrence was found to increase with the ratio of winter rainfall over autumn rainfall for the whole period of 1960-2013. An updated dust prediction model for 1960-2013 was constructed based on preceding autumn and winter rainfall. Autumn rainfall was used as the predictor when the ratio of winter and autumn rainfall was no more than 3.1; otherwise, winter rainfall was used. This was a marked improvement in model performance with an r(2) value of 0.37 to that of 0.26 for the original model performance for the period as a whole (1960-2013).					; Yu, Bofu/G-5184-2010	Che, Yahui/0000-0001-9382-8322; Yu, Bofu/0000-0001-7266-4197													0197-9337	1096-9837				SEP 15	2023	48	11					2260	2273		10.1002/esp.5611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5611		MAY 2023											WOS:000981254000001

Greenhouse gases, organic carbon, major and trace elements in ultra-small water bodies (<100 m2) of permafrost peatlands: Assessment across seasons and permafrost gradient	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Thawing permafrost releases substantial amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs), organic carbon (OC), nutrients, and trace metals into surface waters including rivers and, eventually, the Arctic Ocean. However, intermediate components linking soil and surface waters-specifically, small and ultra-small puddles and depressions (<10-100 m(2)) formed after snowmelt in spring and through permafrost thaw in summer-have largely remained outside the scope of research. In this study, we investigated 206 surface waters from small depressions and puddles (1-100 m(2)) in spring, summer, and autumn across a permafrost gradient, spanning from sporadic to continuous permafrost zones in the Western Siberian Lowlands (WSL). Our findings showed the highest concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the sporadic/discontinuous permafrost zones during summer and autumn, likely due to intensive mobilization of organic carbon from peat and GHG generation at the active permafrost thawing front. Across all permafrost zones, the highest concentrations of major and trace solutes were observed during summer and autumn, with the lowest concentrations in spring. This trend likely reflects a progressive increase in connectivity between surface and subsurface waters, which are enriched in GHGs, organic matter (OM) and inorganic components due to leaching from peat and soil minerals. For the two main size ranges of studied small water bodies (SWBs) in the WSL - <10 m(2) and 10-100 m(2) - no significant seasonal or spatial differences were observed in CO2, CH4, DOC, macro- and micronutrient or metal concentrations. When averaged across all seasons and permafrost zones, SWBs showed concentrations of CH4 and CO2 approximately 10 times higher and levels of certain macro- (Si and P) and micronutrients (Fe, Co, Rb and Mn) 3 to 7 times higher when compared to thermokarst lakes. Thus, despite their limited surface area, SWBs may serve as crucial regulators of GHG dynamics and nutrient storage, especially during the understudied transitional seasons of spring and autumn.

J	Rakocevic, J				Rakocevic, Jelena			SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN LAKE SKADAR	ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Phytoplankton seasonal succession and spatial heterogeneity were studied in Lake Skadar from February to December 2004. A total of 167 taxa from 6 algal divisions were observed, with Bacillariophyta being best represented (52.8%). The general pattern of phytoplankton seasonal succession in Lake Skadar was: Bacillariophyta in the spring, Chlorophyta in early summer, Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta in late summer and Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta in autumn and winter. Distinct spatial heterogeneity was observed. The central, open part of the lake (pelagic zone) was characterized by dominant euplanktonic species, mostly diatoms, whereas the western and northwestern parts (more isolated and shallower) had higher abundance of greens and blue-greens and a higher percentage of resuspended benthic-epiphytic forms in the phytoplankton community. Comparison with former phytoplankton data showed distinct differences in terms of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the phytoplankton community of Lake Skadar, which indicates lake deterioration.

For each parameter, spatial comparisons were performed to test for differences between habitats (nearshore and offshore) and between regions (east and west) during each season. Significant differences between habitats were found only for silica and chlorophyll a; silica was higher nearshore in fall, and chlorophyll a was higher offshore in fall. Significant differences between regions were detected in Secchi depth, epilimnetic zooplankton mean length, total phosphorus and Cercopagis pengoi density and biomass; Secchi depth and zooplankton mean length were higher in the east in spring, total phosphorus and Cercopagis pengoi biomass were higher in the west in summer, and Cercopagis pengoi biomass was higher in the east in fall. Cercopagis pengoi was present lake-wide in summer and fall, but Bythotrephes longimanus was present only in fall in the Kingston basin. Mean spring total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and epilimnetic zooplankton density and biomass are at or near record low levels. As we move into the future, persistent low levels of these lower food web elements will continue to stress alewife populations both through reduced food resources and food quality for zooplankton, and may force these fish to seek alternative food such as Mysis.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2008	11	4					377	391	PII 906371651	10.1080/14634980802515302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980802515302													WOS:000261413500004
J	Scapozza, C; Patocchi, N				Scapozza, Cristian; Patocchi, Nicola			Lake Maggiore: geomorphological genesis, lake-level evolution, and present and future ecosystems importance	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Lake Maggiore, the second deeper and larger south alpine lake, was selected as a model system to detect the potential damages on water resources, biodiversity and ecosystem health caused by different water levels during the lake-level regulation period (March to November). With a drainage basin exceeding an altitude difference of 4400 m, Lake Maggiore fills a deep valley floor whose bedrock reaches up to 700 m below the present sea level. The cryptodepression occupied by the lake was probably formed during the end of the Miocene and the Pliocene and was shaped successively during the Pleistocene glaciations. Lake Maggiore originated following the Last Glaciation, when it reached its maximum lake-level and extension just after its deglaciation. The mean secular lake-level progressively decreased throughout the Holocene, causing a gradual shrinkage of the lake because of the constant depositional input that created the fluvio-deltaic plains at the mouth of the main tributaries of the lake. The regime of the tributaries is of mixed type, with a spring maximum mainly due to snowmelt and an autumn maximum exclusively of pluvial origin. Water levels naturally tend to reflect the amount of rain or snow precipitation and are expressed through a double cycle: winter and summer characterised by low waters, and spring and autumn by high waters. In 1943, the need to use the waters of the great lakes to have water available in the less favourable periods, led to the construction of a dam at the Lake Maggiore outlet. This structure allows to store water during heavy rainfall or snowmelt periods. The accumulated water is then supplied during the irrigation periods to agriculture (spring and summer) and to industrial users (mainly in autumn and winter). The geomorphological genesis and the ecosystems description was focused on riparian, fluvio-deltaic, and ephemeral systems. For these ecosystems, their evolution considering the hydrological regime of the tributaries, the anthropogenic activities in the watershed and the effects of lake-level management since 1943, was also described. Considering the summer increase, between April and July, to +1.25 m (with possible peaks to +1.50 m) experimentally tested between 2015 and 2020, and the approval of the proposal to continue the test for the next five-year period (2022-2026), we finally emphasise the potential further reduction of reeds and natural habitats and the subsequent loss of biodiversity related to the plan of raise the lake-level to +1.50 m all year round.

J	Simcic, T; Germ, M				Simcic, Tatjana; Germ, Mateja			Increased Temperature Due to Global Warming Alters the Respiratory Potential in Aquatic Organisms from an Oligotrophic Lake	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The influence of elevated temperature was studied on the respiratory potential of a microplankton community, two macrophytes species (Myriophyllum spicatum and Chara aspera), and sediments, all from an oligotrophic lake, in order to estimate their susceptibility to temperature change. Samples collected in winter, spring, summer and autumn were incubated at three different temperatures. The respiratory potential, measured as electron transport system (ETS) activity at a standard temperature of 20 degrees C was, in average, greater at higher incubation temperatures for 117% in microplankton and for 30% in sediments, indicating that elevated temperature influenced the respiratory capacity of the microbial communities for mineralization of organic matter through respiration. The large increases of respiratory potential in winter microplankton community (for 184% at the highest incubation temperature compared to the temperatures of the multiyear period) and spring microplankton community (190%), and in spring sediment (64%) reveal that those communities are most susceptible to elevated temperatures during the coldest period of a year and at the beginning of lake warming. The respiratory activity of Myriophyllum spicatum was independent of incubation temperature, indicating its wide physiological tolerance. The lower respiratory potential at higher temperatures in Chara aspera optimized the use of energy in plants.

J	Pothoven, S; Warren, L; Höök, T				Pothoven, Steven; Warren, Les; Hook, Tomas			A comparison of age-0 alewife energy content between two Lake Michigan habitats and year classes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The energy content and diet mass of juvenile alewife Alosa pseudoharengus was determined in Muskegon Lake, a drowned river mouth lake, and in the adjacent nearshore zone of Lake Michigan during summer and fall 2021 and 2022 and spring 2022 and 2023. Larger age-0 alewife had disproportionately higher total energy as a function of length than small alewife at both sites. Because age-0 alewife from Muskegon Lake grew to a larger average size, individuals had 43 and 204 % greater total energy content than in Lake Michigan in fall 2021 and 2022, respectively. Contrary to expectations, length-specific energy content declined from summer through fall each year, possibly related to declines in diet mass in the fall. Although diet mass was higher in 2021 than 2022, there were no differences in length-adjusted energy content between years during the fall in either lake. However, in Lake Michigan, the average length was much larger in fall 2021 (79 mm) than 2022 (66 mm) so that the average predicted total energy content in 2021 (20,889 J) was over twice that in fall 2022 (9852 J). Energy content declined over winter, but in spring 2023, small yearlings had surprisingly lost less size-adjusted energy than larger fish. Age-0 alewife had lower length-adjusted energy content in 2021 and 2022 than in 2001 and/or 2002 in both lakes. Nursery habitats such as the drowned river mouths where age-0 fish have higher diet mass and grow larger provide an energetic advantage over the main basin habitat of Lake Michigan.																			0380-1330					JUN	2025	51	3							102546	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102546	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102546													WOS:001493232600010

The Atchafalaya River exhibits a distinct spring flood pulse each year, inundating a 3,640-km(2) floodplain that includes a complex network of canals, bayous, and lakes. During non-flood months, diel locations of 27 fish recorded at 2-h intervals (median = 24 locations/fish) indicated that most spotted gars were shoreline oriented (P < 0.0001), preferred submerged branches as cover and avoided areas of exposed bank (P < 0.0001). Median spotted gar movement rates were higher during summer (40.4 m/h) than fall-winter(15.1 m/h), and during both seasons,rate of movement and percentage of home range used were significantly greater at night during dawn, day, or dusk periods (P < 0.03). Increased nocturnal activity appeared to be related to feeding periodicity, as a substantially greater proportion (70%) of spotted gars collected at night (N = 30) contained food compared with dawn, day, and dusk samples (29%; N = 90). Seasonal movement studies (twice-weekly locations; N = 37 fish) indicated that spotted gar activity increased as water temperature and river stage rose in the spring,resulting in greater median movement rates (130.1 mid) and home ranges (265.1 ha) than during fall-winter (35.8 mid; 6.2 ha) and summer (34.6 mid; 10.5 ha). Spotted gar home ranges established during the hood pulse typically included large areas of inundated floodplain, which provided extensive areas of suitable spawning and nursery habitat.

Some generalizations based on stratification and vertical mixing in meromictic Lake Shira, Russia, in the period 2002-2009	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												In a brackish, temperate, 24-m-deep Lake Shira, the profiles of salinity, temperature, oxygen and sulfide concentrations were measured on a seasonal basis from 2002 to 2009. The lake was shown to be meromictic with autumnal overturn restricted to mixolimnion. The depth of mixolimnion and position of oxic-anoxic interface varied annually. The spring mixing processes contribute to the formation of mixolimnion in autumn. The exceptionally windy spring of 2007 caused the deepening of mixolimnion in the winter of 2008. The winter position of oxic-anoxic interface was affected by the position of lower boundary of mixolimnion in all winters. The salinity in the winter mixolimnion increased compared with the autumn because of freezing out of salts from the upper water layers meters during ice formation and their dissolution in water below. The profiles of salinity and temperature were simulated by the mathematical 1-D model of temperature and salinity conditions taking into account ice formation. The simulated profiles generally coincided with the measured ones. The coincidence implies that simplified one-dimensional model can be applied to roughly describe salinity and density profiles and mixing behavior of Lake Shira.					; Gulati, Ramesh/F-4943-2013; Rogozin, Denis/AAE-8113-2019; Genova, Svetlana/B-3287-2013; Andrei, Degermendzhi/P-8042-2015	Andrei, Degermendzhi/0000-0001-8649-5419; Genova, Svetlana N/0000-0002-6220-5277; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2010	44	3					485	496		10.1007/s10452-010-9328-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-010-9328-6													WOS:000285338600003
J	Petrie, SA; Wilcox, KL				Petrie, SA; Wilcox, KL			Migration chronology of Eastern-Population Tundra Swans	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												We used satellite platform transmitting transmitters (PTTs) in 1998-2000 to track spring and fall migratory movements of Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) captured at Long Point, Ontario. Migration corridors reported here corroborated those identified in previous studies using alphanumerically coded neck collars. However, PTTs provided additional information on duration of spring and fall migrations, duration of stay in different staging regions, time spent on breeding and wintering areas, and migration speed. Birds migrated between the Atlantic coast and northern prairies along a narrow geographic corridor through portions of the southern Great Lakes. From the northern prairies, swans followed 3 corridors to breeding areas on the west coast of Hudson Bay, central High Arctic, and Mackenzie River delta. While swans spent considerable time on Great Lakes (27% of spring migration) and northern prairie (40%) staging areas in spring, the northern boreal forest was an important fall staging area (48% of fall migration). Tundra Swans spent 20% of the annual cycle on wintering areas, 28% on spring staging areas, 29% on breeding areas, and 23% on fall staging areas. The long duration of migration and the fact that birds spend half their lives on staging areas underscore the importance of conserving Tundra Swan migratory habitats. Thirty-gram neck-collar-attached PTTs were more suitable than 95-g Teflon-harness-attached backpack PTTs for tracking Tundra Swans.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				MAY	2003	81	5					861	870		10.1139/Z03-063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z03-063													WOS:000183980600012

Lakes are pervasive features of Fildes Peninsula landscapes, some of which are used as water sources for Antarctic stations. We studied seven Fildes Peninsula lakes to explore differences among lakes and between seasons in phytoplankton and bacterioplankton communities. We measured environmental variables, analysed pigments using high-performance liquid chromatography and examined bacterial DNA through high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The main driver structuring microbial communities was the season (i.e. spring vs autumn). Chlorophyceae were the dominant phytoplankton group in all lakes and both seasons. Indicator bacteria for each season were identified, including Flavobacterium, Polaromonas and Oxalobacteraceae as indicators of spring conditions under thick ice, whereas Frankiales and Verrucomicrobia were indicator species of autumn following the ice-free summer. The indicator species for spring are generally observed in oligotrophic conditions, whereas many of the autumn indicators are commonly found in soils. There were lesser between-lake differences in microbial communities in autumn, at the end of the open-water period, than in spring at the end of the ice-covered period. This study will act as the basis for future assessments of changes in aquatic microbial communities.					piccini, claudia/P-3840-2019	Piccini, Claudia/0000-0002-2762-1953; Bertoglio, Florencia/0000-0003-2023-8940; Antoniades, Dermot/0000-0001-6629-4839													0954-1020	1365-2079				APR	2023	35	2					89	102	PII S0954102023000068	10.1017/S0954102023000068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102023000068		APR 2023											WOS:000973846800001
J	MORGAN, MD				MORGAN, MD			ABUNDANCE, LIFE-HISTORY, AND GROWTH OF INTRODUCED POPULATIONS OF THE OPOSSUM SHRIMP (MYSIS-RELICTA) IN SUBALPINE CALIFORNIA LAKES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The opossum shrimp M. relicta was introduced into Donner Lake and Fallen Leaf Lake, California, in 1965. Samples from both lakes in Aug. 1978 and June 1979 and from Donner Lake in Nov. 1980, reveal that the mysids are established throughout each lake. In Donner Lake, the estimated overall lakewide density was 238/m2 in Aug. 1978, 123/m2 in June 1979 and 108/m2 in Nov. 1980. In Fallen Leaf Lake, the overall lakewide density was 114/m2 in Aug. 1978 and 103/m2 in June 1979. Mysids in both populations lived for 2 yr and reproduced each spring at 1 and 2 yr of age. Growth was fastest in the spring and summer and slowest in the fall and winter. Previously published data suggest that mysid life history traits can be predicted based on the productivity of the lake. This study supports this view. When productivity is relatively high, the life cycle lasts from 1-2 yr, but when productivity is low, it may take up to 4 yr.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1981	38	8					989	993		10.1139/f81-134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f81-134													WOS:A1981MD53200017
J	Ducharme-Riel, V; Vachon, D; del Giorgio, PA; Prairie, YT				Ducharme-Riel, Veronique; Vachon, Dominic; del Giorgio, Paul A.; Prairie, Yves T.			The Relative Contribution of Winter Under-Ice and Summer Hypolimnetic CO2 Accumulation to the Annual CO2 Emissions from Northern Lakes	ECOSYSTEMS												We explored the whole-lake accumulation of CO2 during winter ice cover and in the hypolimnion during summer stratification, in 15 temperate and boreal lakes, and how these processes vary with lake trophic state and morphometry. We further estimated an annual CO2 budget for each lake that incorporates the fluxes resulting from winter ice-cover and summer hypolimnetic CO2 accumulation to assess their relative importance. The volumetric rates of CO2 accumulation during the winter ice cover ranged from 4.1 to 42.1 mg C m(-3) d(-1), and from 9.3 to 54.5 mg C m(-3) d(-1) in the summer hypolimnion, and both varied mainly as a function of water temperature. The total CO2 accumulation at the end of winter/summer was most strongly related to lake mean depth and was significantly greater under ice than in the hypolimnion. This greater CO2 accumulation resulted in relatively high and unvarying spring outflux, averaging 404 mg C m(-2) d(-1) (C.V. 27%). Significant hypolimnetic CO2 accumulation also resulted in relatively high fluxes (average 228 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during autumnal mixing, which were more variable (C.V. 43%) than spring fluxes. Average fluxes were lowest and most variable in summer (198 mg C m(-2) d(-1), C.V. 46%). The net annual CO2 flux ranged from 14 to 68 g C m(-2) y(-1), and was positively related to DOC concentration. The winter ice-cover CO2 accumulation accounted from 3 to 80% (average 17%) of the annual CO2 flux, whereas summer hypolimnetic accumulation accounted for a smaller but still significant proportion (from 1.4 to 46%). These winter and summer hypolimnetic CO2 accumulations are released to the atmosphere through short but intense emission bursts that are rarely captured in regular lake sampling schemes, yet they have the potential to profoundly influence the annual lake CO2 budgets in northern landscapes.					; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Prairie, Yves/B-9108-2008	Vachon, Dominic/0000-0003-1157-5240; Prairie, Yves/0000-0003-1210-992X; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				JUN	2015	18	4					547	559		10.1007/s10021-015-9846-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-015-9846-0													WOS:000354126300001

Anders; Skov, Christian; Bronmark, Christer; Hansson, Lars-Anders			Interplay between temperature, fish partial migration and trophic dynamics	OIKOS												Whereas many studies have addressed the mechanisms driving partial migration, few have focused on the consequences of partial migration on trophic dynamics, and integrated studies combining the two approaches are virtually nonexistent. Here we show that temperature affects seasonal partial migration of cyprinid fish from lakes to predation refuges in streams during winter and that this migration in combination with temperature affects the characteristics and phenology of lower trophic levels in the lake ecosystem. Specifically, our six-year study showed that the proportion of fish migrating was positively related to lake temperature during the pre-migration growth period, i.e. during summer. Migration from the lake occurred later when autumn water temperatures were high, and timing of return migration to the lake occurred earlier at higher spring water temperatures. Moreover, the winter mean size of zooplankton in the lake increased with the proportion of fish being away from the lake, likely as a consequence of decreased predation pressure. Peak biomass of phytoplankton in spring occurred earlier at higher spring water temperatures and with less fish being away from the lake. Accordingly, peak zooplankton biomass occurred earlier at higher spring water temperature, but relatively later if less fish were away from the lake. Hence, the time between phyto- and zooplankton peaks depended only on the amount of fish being away from the lake, and not on temperature. The intensity of fish migration thereby had a major effect on plankton spring dynamics. These results significantly contribute to our understanding of the interplay between partial migration and trophic dynamics, and suggest that ongoing climate change may significantly affect such dynamics.

Seasonal dynamics of organic carbon and metals in thermokarst lakes from the discontinuous permafrost zone of western Siberia	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Despite relatively good knowledge of the biogeochemistry of Siberian thermokarst lakes during summer base flow, their seasonal dynamics remains almost unexplored. This work describes the chemical composition of similar to 130 thermokarst lakes ranging in size from a few m(2) to several km(2), located in the discontinuous permafrost zone. Lakes were sampled during spring flood, just after the ice break (early June), the end of summer (August), the beginning of ice formation (October) and during the full freezing season in winter (February). The lakes larger than 1000 m(2) did not exhibit any statistically significant control of the lake size on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the major and trace element concentrations over three major open water seasons. On the annual scale, the majority of dissolved elements including organic carbon increased their concentration from 30 to 500 %, with a statistically significant (p < 0.05) trend from spring to winter. The concentrations of most trace elements (TEs) increased in the order spring > summer > autumn > winter. The ice formation in October included several stages: first, surface layer freezing followed by crack (fissure) formation with unfrozen water from the deeper layers spreading over the ice surface. This water was subsequently frozen and formed layered ice rich in organic matter. As a result, the DOC and metal (Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Ba and Pb) concentrations were highest near the surface of the ice column (0 to 20 cm) and decreased by a factor of 2 towards the bottom. The main implications of discovered freeze-driven so-lute concentrations in thermokarst lake waters are enhanced colloidal coagulation and removal of dissolved organic matter and associated insoluble metals from the water column to the sediments. The measured distribution coefficients of a TE between amorphous organo-ferric coagulates and lake water (< 0.45 mu m) were similar to those reported earlier for Fe-rich colloids and low molecular weight (< 1 kDa, or < 1-2 nm) fractions of thermokarst lake waters, suggesting massive coprecipitation of TE with amorphous Fe oxyhydroxide stabilized by organic matter. Although the concentration of most elements was lowest in spring, this period of maximal water coverage of land created a significant reservoir of DOC and soluble metals in the water column that can be easily mobilized to the hydrological network. The highest DOC concentration observed in the smallest (< 100m(2)) water bodies in spring suggests their strongly heterotrophic status and, therefore, a potentially elevated CO2 flux from the lake surface to the atmosphere.

Influence of the Atmospheric Circulation on Ice-Thermal Processes on Baikal During 1950-2010	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												A study is made of the influence of the large-scale atmospheric circulation, described by the indices of Northern Hemisphere Teleconnection Patterns, on air temperature and ice-thermal characteristics of Lake Baikal for the time interval 1950-2010. Multiple linear regression equations have been obtained to account for 46-47% of the air temperature changes during the winter, spring and autumn seasons, and for 18% during the summer season. The main contribution to air temperature change for separate seasons (except in the summertime) and ice-thermal characteristics is made by the fluctuations of the AO and NAO indices characterizing the west-east transport of air masses, and of the SCAND and Sh indices of the mechanisms blocking this transport.																			1875-3728	1875-371X				APR	2013	34	2					158	165		10.1134/S187537281302008X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S187537281302008X													WOS:000219935000008
J	French, JRP; Schloesser, DW				French, JRP; Schloesser, DW			Distribution and winter survival health of Asian clams, Corbicula fluminea, in the St Clair River, Michigan	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We studied the distribution and winter survival of the Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea, in the St. Clair River from the fall of 1988 to the spring of 1990. Between fall of 1988 and spring of 1989, distribution of Corbicula was extended from 5.5 to 11.5 km downstream from an electric power plant. However, total abundance of clams decreased during the winter. By fall of 1989, Corbicula was found 14.5 km from the power plant, and the mean density of clams was 27 individuals/m(2). Between fall of 1989 and spring of 1990, distribution was reduced to 7.5 km from the power plant and abundance decreased 97%. During the winter of 1988-1989, we collected clams monthly from one station 2.2 km from the power plant, and we observed that clams survived the harsh winter for two months after the water temperature dropped about 1.5 degrees C below the reported lethal level for Corbicula in midwinter. During the winter of 1989-1990, we held clams at the sediment-water interface in enclosures, and we observed that condition indices (dry body weight:dry shell weight) of clams remained stable (mean = 0.05 +/- 0.01) in December and January and then declined significantly (p < 0.05) to 0.04 +/- 0.01 in February. All clams perished by late March. The deteriorating physiological state of clams, as indicated by declining condition index, seemingly is a factor in late winter mortalities of Corbicula in the St. Clair River. In contrast to the rapid geographic spread and population increases in the southern United States, Corbicula likely will not spread rapidly throughout the Great Lakes beyond shoreline thermal refugia of heated-water discharge plumes from power plants.																			0270-5060					JUN	1996	11	2					183	192		10.1080/02705060.1996.9663477	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1996.9663477													WOS:A1996UH81800008

Buffalo Springs Lake. We implanted temperature-sensing ultrasonic transmitters in 29 flathead catfish and monitored them from June 1993 through June 1995. During the summer months. flathead catfish were found in the warmest lake waters (24.5-31.5 C) even though cooler well-oxygenated water was available. As lake temperatures decreased in fall and winter. fathead catfish were located in the warmest available water. Coldwater habitats were utilized only when the reservoir was not stratified. There was no significant difference in temperature selection by flathead catfish based on size, sex, year, or month. Other habitat variables may be more important to the overall habitat selection by flathead catfish in Buffalo Springs Lake.																									1999							42	49																WOS:000169733700006

Parasites belonging to six species were recorded for 133 pike hosts: Argulus foliaceus, Tetraonchus monenteron, Rhipidocotyle fennica, Diplodiscus subclavatus, Raphinascaris acres, and Acanthocephalus anguillae, of which only two specimens of A. foliaceus were found in the gills of one host fish, and a single specimen of A. anguillae and two specimens of D. subclavatus in the intestine of another. Tetraonchus monenteron, R. fennica, and R. acus were the dominant parasite species found in the pike. Tetraonchus monenteron was the most prevalent species found in fish of all sizes during the year of the study. Rhipidocotyle fennica infection rate was highest during summer and autumn and minimal during winter and early spring, with larger pike having more parasites than smaller host pike. The third dominant parasite, R. acres, produced two generations per season, with peaks in spring (April) and autumn (October). There was a negative correlation between size of the host and density of R. acres. Occurrence, density, seasonal changes, and the preferences of the parasite species for various size groups of its pike host are discussed in detail.

We firstly test the applicability of VGPM in Lake Taihu by comparing the results between the model-derived and the in situ results, and the results showed that a strong significant correlation (R-2 = 0.753, p < 0.001, n = 63). Then, VGPM was used to map temporal-spatial distributions of primary production in Lake Taihu. The annual mean daily primary production of Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2013 was 1094.06 +/- 720.74 mgCm(-2)d(-1). Long-term primary production maps estimated from the MODIS data demonstrated marked temporal and spatial variations. Spatially, the primary production in bays, especially in Zhushan Bay and Meiliang Bay, was consistently higher than that in the open area of Lake Taihu, which was caused by chlorophyll-a concentrations resulting from high nutrient concentrations. Temporally, the seasonal variation of primary production from 2003 to 2013 was: summer > autumn > spring > winter, with significantly higher primary production found in summer and autumn than in winter (p < 0.005, t-test), primarily caused by seasonal variations in water temperature. On a monthly scale, the primary production exerts a clear character of bimodality, increasing from January to May, decreasing in June or July, and finally reaching its highest value during August or September. Wind is another important factor that could affect the spatial variations of primary production in the large, eutrophic and shallow Lake Taihu.					; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; , 张一波/AAY-5453-2020; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013	Zhang, Yibo/0000-0001-5542-2495; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512													2072-4292					MAR	2017	9	3							195	10.3390/rs9030195	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9030195													WOS:000398720100011

Large temporal variation characterized the particle dynamics. The estuary had a stable stratification during most of the year, being mainly controlled by temperature. Under stratified conditions, inflowing particulate material of fluvial origin was largely transported straight through the estuary to the sea. At the spring and autumn turnover of the water column, there was a net erosion of the surface sediment due to re-suspension. Barotrophically forced seawater intrusions destabilized the stratification on a few occasions in the summer, and probably more often in the winter, causing increased retention of suspended particulate matter in the summer, and increased re-suspension and erosion of the surface sediment in the winter. The morphology of the basin, the bi-annual turnover of the water column and irregular seawater intrusions were the three most important factors governing the turnover of particulate material in Gardsfjarden.

However, it is hard to understand the underlying mechanisms for substantial variations in the magnitude and direction of runoff response to vegetation change. Models fail to clearly identify the underlying mechanisms due to limitations in accommodating all the driving factors of the extremely complex reality. This study used a data-driven approach to determine the linkages between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and runoff in the spring and summer seasons of 1982-2015 in 3600 + northern mid/high-latitude (>= 30 degrees N) catchments. The results suggested that a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation existed between spring NDVI and summer runoff in the Rocky Mountains, the Great Lakes region, the northern Scandinavia and the Alps. In the southern Rocky Mountains, there was a significant increase in spring NDVI and a decrease in summer runoff due to loss of snowpack. In the Great Lakes region, significant decrease in spring NDVI was accompanied by increase in summer runoff. Earlier spring onset and consequent withering vegetation in late spring significantly reduced spring NDVI while slightly increased summer runoff in Northern Rocky Mountain. The warmer and wetter winter could have increased spring NDVI owning to better water/energy environment, and insignificantly reduced summer runoff in northern Scandinavia and the Alps. Both anthropogenic warming and Arctic amplification might influence the patterns of vegetation-runoff in the region. Our findings can help improving the understanding on how vegetation change affects runoff and enhancing the forecasting abilities of hydrological models.

Seasonality and landscape factors drive dissolved organic matter properties in Mediterranean ephemeral washes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY					4th Conference on the Mechanisms of Organic Matter Stabilization and Destabilization (SOM) - Organic Matter Stabilization and Ecosystem Functions	SEP 19-23, 2010	FRANCE	Bioemco Lab (Biogeochemistry and Ecol Continental Ecosystems), Soil Organ Matter Grp				Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) is a fundamental component of the aquatic carbon cycle and a key driver of the biogeochemical interactions between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The origin, properties and role of DOM are increasingly characterised in lakes, rivers and streams, but little is known about DOM characteristics in ephemeral washes, which are the most common water flows in Mediterranean landscapes. Here, we examine the patterns in the optical properties of DOM in ephemeral washes draining a small catchment in the island of Menorca, Western Mediterranean. We used concentration data (dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen) and several spectroscopic descriptors (SUVA(254), absorption coefficient at 440 nm, fluorescence index, and excitation-emission fluorescence matrices) to assess changes in DOM concentrations and quality at both seasonal and spatial scales. Two periods were clearly distinguished in the DOM properties: autumn and winter-spring. In autumn, which includes the first flows of the hydrological year, DOM showed an aromatic character and was spatially homogenous over the catchment. In winter-spring, DOM was smaller and recently produced, and a considerable spatial heterogeneity was observed in all descriptors. The variability in DOM concentrations and quality was driven by hydromorphology and by the landscape features of the catchment, but the influence of these drivers on DOM properties changed along the hydrological year. In autumn, hydromorphology was the main factor determining DOM properties, whereas in winter-spring the land uses in the watershed highly determined the observed differences in DOM quality between subcatchments.

Cambarid catches increased in the spring until a midsummer maximum, but dropped suddenly as the water temperature began to fall in August. Ovigerous (i.e., egg-bearing) females and recently moulted males were captured by SCUBA divers in August. Trap catches increased, once breeding and moulting periods concluded, and subsequently decreased as water temperatures continued to drop in the autumn. In contrast, catches of male O. virilis increased in the spring and remained relatively constant throughout die summer until water temperatures fell in September. Catches of female O. virilis peaked somewhat later in the summer and then gradually declined in the early fall. Although the two species and the two sexes differed in the length of the midsummer sampling period when trap catches were relatively constant, similar seasonal trends among lakes suggest that midsummer trap catches can be used to estimate crayfish relative abundance. Other factors, such as the presence of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui), lake physical and chemical characteristics, and the number of co-occurring crayfish species also correlated with trap catches. Both the presence of bass and the number of co-occurring species of crayfish probably affect crayfish behaviour and activity, thereby reducing catches in baited traps, but not necessarily affecting actual population abundance. Comparisons of relative abundance based on catches from baited traps must control for these seasonal behavioural, and environmental factors.																			0008-4301					JUN	1993	71	6					1136	1145		10.1139/z93-155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z93-155													WOS:A1993LU73200011

The ranking of potential activity rates of the assayed enzymes was: lipase > aminopeptidase > phosphatase > -D-glucosidase > chitinase > -D-glucosidase. The selected extracellular enzymatic activities were all characterized by a distinct seasonal variability and depended on the location of the research site. In spring and in autumn, the waters of Lake Chemyskie were more eutrophic than in summer. Significant differences in enzyme activity between different parts of the studied lake were demonstrated. In autumn, stations near the town of Chema (I-II) were more eutrophic than the stations far from the town; this was supported by the activity of aminopeptidase being higher in the urban area of the lake than in the zone away from town. On the other hand, in spring the activity of aminopeptidase near town (stations II-IV) was lower than far from town (stations VI, VII, X and XI). The enzyme chitinase exhibited higher activity far from town both in summer and autumn.					; Brzezinska, Maria/H-4133-2014; Kalwasinska, Agnieszka/AAI-4851-2020	Kalwasinska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-2435-567X; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC 1	2013	28	4					517	527		10.1080/02705060.2013.793220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2013.793220													WOS:000330015100007

Climate warming causes intensification of the hydrological cycle, resulting in changes to the vernal and autumnal windows in a northern temperate forest	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Climate warming is likely to lead to complex effects on northern forests of the temperate forest biome. We investigated whether rising temperatures altered the timing of snowmelt and snowpack accumulation or extended the forest growing season length in the Turkey Lakes Watershed in central Ontario. Archived satellite imagery was used to track changes in timing of snowpack loss/gain and canopy leaf on/off; the periods between these events were defined as the vernal (spring) and autumnal (fall) windows. We found only a slight extension of the growing season into the autumn period and no increase in the width of the vernal or autumnal windows, indicating that forest growth is not responding significantly to temperature increases during these windows. Archived time series of temperature, precipitation and discharge data for a nested set of catchments ranging in size from headwater (<10ha) to regional (10(3)ha) catchments were used to track changes in the magnitude, timing and partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and discharge. We found an intensification of hydrological cycling, with (1) a higher dryness index (PET/P) during the summer growing season and (2) earlier spring snowmelt discharges, and later more concentrated autumn storm discharges during the shoulder seasons. This intensification of the hydrological cycle during the summer growth season and the vernal and autumnal windows may not only limit opportunities for enhanced forest growth, but may be contributing to the recent observations of forest decline within this biome.

In the early 1970s, the external P load to the inner archipelago of Stockholm, Sweden (Baltic Sea), was drastically reduced by improved sewage treatment, but the internal P loading and its controlling factors have been poorly quantified. We use two slightly different four-layer box models to calculate the area's seasonal and annual P balance (input-export) and the internal P exchange with sediments in 1968-2015. For 1020 years after the main P load reduction, there was a negative P balance, small in comparison to the external load, and probably due to release from legacy sediment P storage. Later, the stabilized, near-neutral P balance indicates no remaining internal loading from legacy P, but P retention is low, despite improved oxygen conditions. Seasonally, sediments are a P sink in spring and a P source in summer and autumn. Most of the deep-water P release from sediments in summer-autumn appears to be derived from the settled spring bloom and is exported to outer areas during winter. Oxygen consumption and P release in the deep water are generally tightly coupled, indicating limited iron control of P release. However, enhanced P release in years of deep-water hypoxia suggests some contribution from redox-sensitive P pools. Increasing deep-water temperatures that stimulate oxygen consumption rates in early summer have counteracted the effect of lowered organic matter sedimentation on oxygen concentrations. Since the P turnover time is short and legacy P small, measures to bind P in Stockholm inner archipelago sediments would primarily accumulate recent P inputs, imported from the Baltic Sea and from Lake Malaren.																			1726-4170	1726-4189				MAY 17	2018	15	9					3003	3025		10.5194/bg-15-3003-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-3003-2018													WOS:000432392200002

This paper compiles terrestrial and marine proxy data from sites along the northeastern Pacific margins and proposes that they indicate 1) suppressed ENSO conditions during the middle Holocene between similar to 8000 and 4000 cal BP with a North Pacific that generally resembled a La Nina-like or more negative PDO phase and 2) a climate transition between similar to 4200 and 3000 cal BP that appears to be the teleconnected expression to a more modern-like ENSO Pacific. Compared to modern day conditions, the compiled data suggest that during the middle Holocene, the Aleutian Low was generally weaker during the winter and/or located more to the west, while the North Pacific High was stronger during the summer and located more to the north. Coastal upwelling off California was more enhanced during the summer and fall but suppressed during the spring. Oregon and California sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were cooler. The Santa Barbara Basin had an anomalous record, suggesting warmer SSTs. Late Holocene records indicate a more variable, El Nino-like, and more positive PDO Pacific. The Aleutian Low became more intensified during the winter and/or located more to the east. The North Pacific High became weaker and/or displaced more to the south. Coastal upwelling off California intensified during the spring but decreased during the fall. Oregon and California SSTs became warmer, recording the shoreward migration of sub-tropical gyre waters during the fall, while spring upwelling (cooler SST) increased in the Santa Barbara Basin. The high-resolution proxy records indicate enhanced ENSO and PDO variability after similar to 4000 cal BP off southern California, similar to 3400 cal BP off northern California, and by similar to 2000 cal BP in southwestern Yukon. A progressively northward migration of the ENSO teleconnection during the late Holocene is proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

A total of 196 species (including varieties) belonging to 77 genera of 7 phyla were identified. The phytoplankton communities were dominated by Chlorophyta and diatoms, and there were significant differences across the five sampling sites. The phytoplankton abundance, which ranged between 13.85 x 10(4) and 335.54 x 10(4) cells<middle dot>L-1, was significantly higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. Chlorella sp. and Cyclotella sp. were the dominant populations, and their dominance degree reached as high as 0.54 and 0.33, respectively. The diversity of the phytoplankton populations was significantly higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter, and the Shannon-Wiener index and Margalef index ranged from 2.49-3.65 and 2.47-3.10, respectively. The water quality of Qionghai Lake was generally good. The trophic level index was between 30 and 60, showing that the water body was overall in a mesotrophic to slightly eutrophic state. The Spearman correlation analyses revealed that ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), water temperature (WT), permanganate index (CODMn), and transparency (SD) were the most important environmental factors that influenced the phytoplankton communities. For example, NH4+-N was significantly correlated with Chroococcus sp. (r = 0.41, p < 0.05) and Cryptomonas ovata Ehrenberg (r = 0.45, p < 0.05), and WT was significantly correlated with Cryptomonas marssonii Skuja (r = 0.43, p < 0.05) and Cryptomonas ovata (r = 0.53, p < 0.01).																				2073-4441				JAN	2024	16	2							229	10.3390/w16020229	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16020229													WOS:001153097800001

The migratory Mute Swan Cygnus olor population in East Asia	WILDFOWL												Until recently, almost nothing was known about the migration routes, flyway structure and population status of the Mute Swan Cygnus olor in East Asia. Here, we use a combination of GPS telemetry data, collar resightings, published literature and expert advice to update existing knowledge of its summer and winter distribution in the region, and to provide a preliminary description of the swans' migration and habitat use. Three flyway units were indicated for the Mute Swan in East Asia. The Eastern China-wintering unit includes swans summering along the lower Selenga River in Russia, in central Mongolia and Inner Mongolia in China, which winter on the coast of eastern China, where 403 swans were recorded in 2014/15 but where fewer than 30 have been counted in very recent years. In the absence of better data, we conservatively estimate this Chinese-wintering group at 400 birds. Mute Swans in the Korean-wintering unit are individuals that winter along the Korean Peninsula and summer in Inner Mongolia (China) and the Amur region (on the border of China and Russia); they are poorly covered by the mid-winter waterbird counts in South Korea and we have no knowledge of numbers wintering in North Korea. Finally, mid-winter counts of the introduced and sedentary population of Mute Swans in Japan have amounted to c. 240 birds in the last five years. We therefore suspect that there are likely c. 1,000 Mute Swans in Far East Asia, but await improved coverage throughout the entire wintering grounds to provide a better population estimate, with the species confirmed as one of the poorer known of the migratory waterbirds in the region. A single GPS-tagged Mute Swan tracked successfully provided detailed information on its migration routes, timing of migration and habitat use (almost exclusively waterbodies) over four complete migration episodes. It summered at Dalai Lake, China, used three stopover sites (on the borders of Russia and North Korea, in North Korea, and Baicheng City in China) during spring and autumn migration, and showed site fidelity to summer, winter and stopover sites. Combined count data and GPS data suggested that Mute Swans mostly occur within protected areas throughout the year. However, further research is required to establish the true distribution and abundance of this small and scattered species within these three flyways in East Asia, as well as to confirm its population structure and migration routes.					; Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-7066-2015; Wood, Kevin/C-7312-2012; Fang, Lei/Q-4913-2019; Damba, Iderbat/I-5018-2018; Chen, Xiaoli/JGM-2484-2023	Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; 													0954-6324	2052-6458					2020					6		73	96																WOS:000611498400004

In this article, the relationship between phytoplankton biomass and related environmental variables has been evaluated in inter-annual and seasonal scale using factor analysis and liner regression method base on the monthly monitoring data covering the period of 2004-2009. The results indicate that water temperature and total phosphorus (TP) played governing roles in phytoplankton biomass in most seasons (i.e. temperature in winter and summer; TP in autumn); COD (chemical oxygen demand) presented significant positive relationships with phytoplankton biomass in autumn and BUD (biological oxygen demand) shows opposite trend with it. However, a complex interplay was found between phytoplankton biomass and nitrogen considering significant positive relationships occurring between them in spring and autumn. The results indicate that interactions between phytoplankton biomass and related environmental variables are highly sensitive to seasonal periodicity, which improves understanding of different roles of biotic and abiotic variables upon phytoplankton variability, and hence, advances management methods for eutrophic lakes.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-416-7				2012	518-523						194	200		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.518-523.194	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.518-523.194													WOS:000313845900037

Seasonal epilimnetic temperature patterns and trends in a suite of lakes from Wisconsin (USA), Germany, and Finland	INLAND WATERS												Epilimnetic temperatures from early 1980s through 2017 were analyzed for 12 Wisconsin (USA), German, and Finnish lakes. Seasonal temperature metrics exhibited large interannual variability with trends differing among regions. In the Wisconsin lakes, only late summer and fall temperatures increased significantly. In the 2 northeastern German lakes, temperatures increased in all seasons (not all significantly). The 3 Finnish lakes exhibited large spring temperature increases influenced by earlier ice-out; summer and fall temperatures also increased except for Konnevesi (central Finland) in early summer and polar Kevoj?rvi in midsummer. Kevoj?rvi also exhibited no increase in maximum recorded temperatures. Earlier records from 4 lakes were analyzed to elucidate longer-term epilimnetic temperature patterns. For Lake Mendota (southern Wisconsin), spring and late fall temperatures have increased modestly but significantly since 1894; summer temperatures have also increased modestly because of higher frequency of warm temperatures in recent summers and not from new record high temperatures. Trout Lake (northern Wisconsin) exhibited warm temperatures in some summers during the 1930s?1940s, similar to warm temperatures in some recent summers. Air?water temperature relationships coupled with long-term regional air temperature data also indicated summer epilimnetic temperatures in the study lakes were likely as warm in the 1930s?1940s as in recent years. Lake data confirmed cooler epilimnetic temperatures occurred in many summers during the 1950s?1980s coincident with cooler air temperatures. Because epilimnetic temperatures have not increased monotonically since 1900, our study supports continued temperature monitoring in lakes with extensive historical data to better understand and predict future effects of climate change on lake ecosystems.

Samples were collected at six sites along a stream reach during autumn, winter, spring and summer. The sampling sites differed in flow velocity, depending on their position within the study reach and distance from tufa barriers and associated waterfalls. Seasonality was pronounced for most physico-chemical measurements. The highest concentrations of transported (in)organic particulate matter, being related to increased amounts of moss in transport, were observed in autumn. Drift densities were highest at tufa barriers that had higher flow velocities. Drift abundance partially followed the seasonal pattern in transported (in)organic matter. Autumn peaks in drift of Oligochaeta, Coleoptera as well as some Diptera and Trichoptera were related to increased moss and particulate matter quantities, while observed increases in drifting Nematoda, Cladocera, Copepoda, Ephemeroptera, Simuliidae and Chironomidae in spring and summer were probably due to distribution shifts of larvae or to higher seston levels originating from the upstream lake. Although we found that faster flowing stream sites generally had higher drift densities, there typically was no significant correlation between flow velocity and the amount of drift. Therefore, our expectation that fine-scale spatial drift patterns primarily depend on flow differences between lotic habitats was not supported for this system. The positive correlation between transported moss and other measured drift parameters, both at the seasonal and fine spatial scale, suggests that drift patterns were influenced by trapping/refuge efficiency of moss-covered tufa substrate and respective seasonal changes in instream vegetation (moss) as linked to hydrochemistry and water temperature.

This triggered a series of systematic studies on APP and resulted in the setting of a unique long-term picoplankton dataset. In this review, we intend to summarize the obtained results and to give a new insight on APP ecology and diversity in Lake Balaton. According to the results, APP dynamics depends on trophic state, temperature, nutrient, and light availability, as well as grazing pressure. APP abundance in Lake Balaton decreased to a low level (1-2 x 10(5) cells mL(-1)) as a consequence of decreasing nutrient supply (oligotrophication) during the past more than two decades, and followed a characteristic seasonal dynamics with higher abundance values from spring to autumn than in winter. Concomitantly, however, the APP contribution to both phytoplankton biomass and primary production increased (up to 70% and 40-50%, respectively) during oligotrophication. Regarding annual pattern, picocyanobacteria are dominant from spring to autumn, while in winter, picoeukaryotes are the most abundant, most likely due to the different light and temperature optima of these groups. Within picocyanobacteria, single cells and microcolonies were both observed with mid-summer dominance of the latter which correlated well with the density of cladocerans. Community-level chromatic adaptation (i.e., dominance of phycoerythrin- or phycocyanin-rich forms) of planktonic picocyanobacteria was also found as a function of underwater light quality. Sequence analysis studies of APP in Lake Balaton revealed that both picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes represent a diverse and dynamic community consisting several freshwater genotypes (picocyanobacteria:Synechococcus, Cyanobium; picoeukaryotes:Choricystis, Stichococcus,Mychonastes, Nannochloris, andNannochloropsis).					; Bernat, Gabor/J-6333-2017; Felfoldi, Tamas/F-7856-2011	Somogyi, Boglarka/0000-0003-0900-3315; 													2676-8615	2676-8607				DEC	2020	71	4			SI		371	382		10.1007/s42977-020-00030-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42977-020-00030-8		JUL 2020						34554456					WOS:000558126400003

The main processes playing a role in the lake''s N cycle are inventorized. During spring and summer, the uptake of NH3 and nitrate by primary producers, accompanied by sedimentation of organic matter, result in significant N losses from the 0-6 m stratum. NH3 accumulates during the stratification in the hypolimnion and after the autumn overturn is recirculated over the whole water column. In winter, release of NH3 from the sediments and nitrification further restore the lake''s nutrient supply. The changes in N content of the different compartments are quantified, giving a basis for more detailed research.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	1982	95	1					191	197		10.1007/BF00044483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00044483													WOS:A1982PP41900013

Sediment at Inlet site was having higher value for physicochemical parameters viz; EC (0.509 dS/m), available nitrogen (109.86 mg/kg), available potassium (89.97 mg/kg), available phosphorus (10.18 mg/kg), Ca (352.53 mg/kg) and Mg (152.44 mg/kg) except pH which was highest (7.99) at Outlet. The values of all the physico-chemical parameters of sediment were found maximum in summer season and minimum in autumn except for pH which was higher (7.81) in autumn and lower in (7.16) in summer. Highest values for Fe (23.90 mg/kg), Mn (8.54 mg/kg), Cu (3.65 mg/kg) and Zn (2.77 mg/kg) in sediment were found at Inlet site and lowest values for Fe (11.82 mg/kg), Mn (3.52 mg/kg), Cu (0.97 mg/kg) and Zn (1.14 mg/kg) at outlet site. Further, these trace elements were observed in higher concentration during summer season as compared to autumn. This all may be due to the high rate of degradation of huge quantities of waste present in the Wetland.

The temporal abundance and composition of the plankton of a continental Antarctic lake (Lake Druzhby) situated in the Vestfold Hills, Eastern Antarctica was investigated from December 1992 to December 1993. The system was dominated by microbial plankton (cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria and protozoans) with few metazoans. 2. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged between 0.15 and 1.1 mu g 1(-1) and showed highest levels from late winter to spring. 3. Heterotrophic bacteria ranged between 75 and 250 x 10(6)1(-1) with highest abundances in late winter/spring. Mean bacterial biovolumes showed considerable seasonal variation (0.05-0.31 mu m(3)). Largest biovolumes occurred in summer and this was the time of highest community biomass. 4. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates reached highest abundances in late summer (maximum 14 x 10(5)1(-1)). Their mean biovolume also exhibited considerable seasonal variation, ranging between 1.77 and 27.0 mu m(3), with largest size resulting in community biomass peaking in early summer. Ciliated protozoa were poorly represented and sparse. Phototrophic nanoflagellates were sparse in this lake, instead the phototrophic plankton was dominated by a small rod-shaped cyanobacterium which constituted the largest carbon pool in the system. It was common throughout the year, its biomass peaking in autumn. Its presence is discussed in relation to lake morphometry and light climate. 5. Heterotrophic flagellate grazing rates ranged from 6.78 bacteria cell(-1) day(-1) at 2 degrees C to 11.8 bacteria cell(-1) day(-1) at 4 degrees C. They remove around 2% of the bacterial carbon pool per day during summer and winter. 6. Nutrient levels were low and recorded in pulses. Dissolved and particulate organic carbon were also low, usually less than 3 mg 1(-1) and 600 mu g 1(-1), respectively. The carbon pools were derived from autochthonous sources. This lake system is driven by bottom-up forces and lacks top-down control, which fits into the picture currently seen for continental Antarctic lakes.																			0046-5070					FEB	1996	35	1					57	67		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00480.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00480.x													WOS:A1996TW36600006

Two-weekly samples for the lakes were analyzed for 7 water-quality variables, total phytoplankton biomass and the abundances of 131 algal taxa. The small Chlorophyta included both motile and non-motile species of Chlorococcales and Volvocales. Ankistrodesmus falcatus was the most cosmopolitan species and occasionally exceeded 103 cm-3 in all 5 lakes. Chlorella minutissima, C. vulgaris and Scenedesmus grahneisii also occurred in all the lakes studied but were less common than A. falcatus. Some small species of Chlamydomonas and Chloromonas were restricted to 1 or 2 of the lakes. The mountain lakes Llyn Cwellyn and Llyn Llydaw in Snowdonia had nutrient-poor waters supporting phytoplankton populations of low density. Species of small Chlorophyta were dominant numerically in the phytoplankton and were present throughout the year. The median proportions of numbers of small Chlorophyta of the total number of all other phytoplankton taxa were 87 and 91% for Llyn Cwellyn and Llyn Llydaw, respectively. Llyn Padarn, a mesotrophic lake, had a greater phytoplankton biomass than the 2 mountain lakes. The phytoplankton exhibited distinct seasonal periodicity, with the spring diatom growth followed by a population of Oscillatoria limnetica during the summer, and further diatom growth in the autumn. Small Chlorophyta were present through the year with population densities exceeding 104 cm-3 during the summer. The median proportion of small Chlorophyta of the total number of all phytoplankton taxa was 70%. Llyn Coron and Llyn Maelog, situated in agricultural catchments on Anglesey, were nutrient-rich; their water samples contained high concentrations of N, P and Si compounds, particularly in the late summer and autumn. The succession of phytoplankton was dominated by taxa of larger-celled algae, mainly diatoms and buoyant blue-green algae. The phytoplankton density (as chlorophyll a) exceeded 100 mg m-3 during the spring and summer. Small Chlorophyta attained their maximum population densities, greater than 103 organisms cm-3, during the winter and early spring when the larger-celled algae were not recorded or were present only at low densities.

During spring, early summer, late summer, and fall seasons, clay pots containing agar supplemented with N, P, N+P, or control (no nutrients) were placed in the stream for 3-wk periods. In spring, with meltwater in the stream, P-diffusing pots had significantly higher algal biomass than controls (p < 0.05). N-diffusing pots supported significantly higher algal biomass in early summer (p < 0.05) and late summer (p < 0.05) than control pots. In fall, algal biomass was not significantly different among treatments. Algal biomass on control pots was similar for ail 4 experiments. In the spring, there was a significant accumulation of algae on stream rocks during the experimental period (p = 0.002). However, in fall,algal biomass on rocks was much higher than in thr spring and showed a trend toward increasing (p = 0.06). Nutrient concentrations and the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to soluble reactive phosphorus also fluctuated seasonally, but were not consistent predictors of algal biomass responses on pots. These results show that nutrient limitation of algal biomass is seasonally dynamic, thus must be determined by a variety oi processes within the stream and watershed.																			0887-3593					JUN	1996	15	2					170	178		10.2307/1467946	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467946													WOS:A1996UQ68500003

The results indicated that Amur sturgeon fed mainly on Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera and secondarily on unspecified bony fish, Odonata, and Trichoptera. Diet changed throughout the year, with autumn 2017 and spring 2018 dominated by Ephemeroptera larvae, while summer 2018 prey comprised primarily Chironomidae larvae. Unspecified bony fish were observed at greater frequency in autumn 2017. Amur sturgeon captured in summer contained a greater quantity of Trichoptera larvae compared to those from autumn and spring sampling. Results were consistent with previous reports of Amur sturgeon diet in other areas of its native distribution and suggested that they may be opportunistic feeders throughout the year, although larval Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera appear to be important prey. These results represent the first reported diet composition data for juvenile Amur sturgeon in the lower Songhua River. Results of the study form part of a comprehensive investigation of feeding habits of juvenile Amur sturgeon that provides basic data for study of the biological characteristics of the species.

The levels of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in 100 g total fatty acid were found to be 28.73, 25.31, and 38.19 g in winter; 29.39, 24.06, and 35.75 g in spring; 31.05, 35.02, and 24.86 g in summer; 29.85, 32.39, and 30.92 g in autumn, respectively. Total omega 3 and omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels in 100 g fatty acid in muscle of the common carp ranged from 12.90 g to 25.97 g and from 10.73 g to 14.59 g, respectively. The ratio of total omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was higher than that of total omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in all seasons. The ratios of omega 6/omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic/eicosapentaenoic acids were the lowest in winter (0.41, 0.64) and highest (0.98, 2.72) in autumn. The amount of eicosapentaenoic + docosahexaenoic acids was also highest in winter and was composed of 22.50 g of 100 g total fatty acid in muscle of pike.

However, the underlying mechanisms of how changes in vegetation are linked to seasonal WLF remain unclear. Using vegetation and hydrological data from 1989 to 2009, we identified the key seasonal fluctuations and their impacts on vegetation in the Poyang Lake wetland by utilizing a tree-based hierarchical model. According to our results: 1) WLF in summer had significant impacts on both sedges and reeds. The severe summer floods promoted the expansion of sedges, while they inhibited the expansion of reeds; 2) WLF in autumn also greatly impacted sedges, while reeds were severely affected in spring. Specifically, we found that low water levels in autumn led to the expansion of sedges, and low water levels in spring led to the expansion of reeds. The results were well corroborated through comparisons of the vegetation distribution patterns over the last two decades (i.e., the 1990s and 2000s), which may shed light on corresponding water resource and wetland management.					李, 艳艳/AAX-2977-2021; dai, xue/KFB-3128-2024; Xu, Ligang/K-2584-2013														2095-0195	2095-0209				JUN	2019	13	2					398	409		10.1007/s11707-018-0731-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-018-0731-y													WOS:000468328700013

In 2016 and from 2021 to 2022, we deployed satellite tracking devices on 22 and 10 mute swans wintering at the Ili River, Xinjiang of Western China, and summering at Ulansuhai Lake, Inner Mongolia of Eastern China, to determine their migration routes. Eight environmental factors, namely, human population density, the shortest distance to the nearest transportation route, elevation, aspect, slope, air temperature, wind speed and gross primary productivity (GPP), were used to analyse the environmental differences at the stopover sites of swan populations between Eastern and Western China. Ebinur and Ulungur Lakes in Xinjiang of Western China and Kapchagay Reservoir and Sasykkol and Alakol Lakes in Eastern Kazakhstan were the summering sites for the Western Chinese swan population; for the Eastern Chinese swan population, in addition to the Yellow River Delta being identified as a wintering site, the Hongze Lake Region of Jiangsu and Danaoban Lake of Inner Mongolia in China were also identified for the first time as wintering and summering sites, respectively. We also found that human population density and GPP were crucial determinants of stopover duration in the Eastern and Western Chinese swan populations both in spring and in autumn. Our findings provide basic data for future research on mute swans in East Asia and will contribute to conservation action plan development through current conservation status evaluations of important summering, wintering and stopover sites along the migration routes of mute swans.																				2351-9894				APR	2024	50								e02807	10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e02807	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e02807													WOS:001167703100001

Its mild salinity gradient provides a unique environment for the coexistence of freshwater and marine bacteria. This study employs catalysed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (CARD-FISH) to investigate seasonal dynamics of marine (SAR11 clade I/II) and freshwater (SAR11 clade IIIb (LD12), Limnohabitans clades B, C, D, Burkholderiales (former Betaproteobacteria)) bacterial groups. Samples were collected from below the ice in February, and then monthly from April to October 2011 from three stations with different salinity. The abundance of SAR11 clade I/II strongly positively correlated with salinity, with the highest abundance in autumn at time of inflows of saline waters from the Baltic Sea. Two groups (spring-summer and autumn-winter) were distinguished within this clade, based on a scatter chart between SAR11-I/II abundance and salinity. Salinity explained 69% of the variability of the spring-summer group and 77% of the autumn-winter group. This suggests that the presence of marine SAR11-I/II in the Vistula Lagoon was caused by passive inflow with waters from the open Baltic Sea, and this environment is not suitable for its regular existence. The abundance of the freshwater SAR11 clade IIIb was similar to that of SAR11-I/II. However, it depended on temperature, organic and inorganic phosphorous, and not on salinity, suggesting that SAR11-IIIb found a regular niche in the eutrophic Vistula Lagoon. Burkholderiales positively correlated with temperature, chlorophyll-a, organic and inorganic phosphorous, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, suggesting that their role in the Vistula Lagoon may be similar to that in lakes. Interestingly, Burkholderiales had the highest relative abundance under ice in February. Finally, the abundance of Limnohabitans clades B, C, D positively depended on temperature, chlorophyll-a and negatively on salinity. This together with positive correlation with Cryptophytes and with heterotrophic nanoflagellates emphasis its importance in this ecosystem. These results show that the conditions in the Vistula Lagoon are rather inappropriate for typical marine bacteria, while freshwater bacteria may find their niches despite slightly elevated salinity.					; Piwosz, Kasia/B-1131-2010	Kownacka, Janina/0000-0001-9919-7795; Piwosz, Kasia/0000-0002-3248-3364													0272-7714	1096-0015				MAR 5	2021	250								107100	10.1016/j.ecss.2020.107100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2020.107100													WOS:000620821100004

Structural Indices and Toxic Species of Cyanobacteria of Pskov Lake	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The cyanobacterial communities of Pskov Lake were studied in different seasons of 2021, and a comparison was made with data of 2018-2020. Information on the taxonomic composition and quantitative characteristics of cyanobacteria was obtained, and the species toxic to living organisms were demonstrated. A total of 196 species taxa of phytoplankton were registered at four permanent stations of the lake, 15.8% of which accounted for cyanobacteria. The cyanobacterial communities were most similar in terms of species in the summer and autumn periods. The quantitative indices of cyanobacteria, such as the abundance and biomass, were minimal in spring and maximal in the summer-autumn period. In each of the seasons of the year studied, toxic and potentially toxic species belonging to the genera Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Lyngbya, Microcystis, Nodularia, and Nostoc were present among the detected cyanobacteria. The total contribution of the representatives of these genera to the total abundance of phytoplankton changed from 4.0% in spring to 65.0% in autumn. In summer, the portion of cyanobacteria from the above genera in the total abundance of microalgae accounted for about 40.0%. The largest role was noted for the algae Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutzing) Kutzing, which causes "blooming" of the reservoirs and produces a microcystin toxin with hepatotoxicity. The study of Pskov Lake requires constant monitoring of the content of cyanotoxins, especially in autumn, when the maximal biomass content of cyanobacteria (including toxic species) is observed, which can lead to serious consequences.

Autumn leaf subsidies influence spring dynamics of freshwater plankton communities	OECOLOGIA												While ecologists primarily focus on the immediate impact of ecological subsidies, understanding the importance of ecological subsidies requires quantifying the long-term temporal dynamics of subsidies on recipient ecosystems. Deciduous leaf litter transferred from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems exerts both immediate and lasting effects on stream food webs. Recently, deciduous leaf additions have also been shown to be important subsidies for planktonic food webs in ponds during autumn; however, the inter-seasonal effects of autumn leaf subsidies on planktonic food webs have not been studied. We hypothesized that autumn leaf drop will affect the spring dynamics of freshwater pond food webs by altering the availability of resources, water transparency, and the metabolic state of ponds. We created leaf-added and no-leaf-added field mesocosms in autumn 2012, allowed mesocosms to ice-over for the winter, and began sampling the physical, chemical, and biological properties of mesocosms immediately following ice-off in spring 2013. At ice-off, leaf additions reduced dissolved oxygen, elevated total phosphorus concentrations and dissolved materials, and did not alter temperature or total nitrogen. These initial abiotic effects contributed to higher bacterial densities and lower chlorophyll concentrations, but by the end of spring, the abiotic environment, chlorophyll and bacterial densities converged. By contrast, zooplankton densities diverged between treatments during the spring, with leaf additions stimulating copepods but inhibiting cladocerans. We hypothesized that these differences between zooplankton orders resulted from resource shifts following leaf additions. These results suggest that leaf subsidies can alter both the short- and long-term dynamics of planktonic food webs, and highlight the importance of fully understanding how ecological subsidies are integrated into recipient food webs.					; Cottingham, Kathryn/AAV-3934-2021	Cottingham, Kathryn/0000-0003-3169-5047; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				JUL	2015	178	3					875	885		10.1007/s00442-015-3279-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3279-5								25761444					WOS:000356534400022
J	Spence, C; Kokelj, SA; Kokelj, SV; Hedstrom, N				Spence, Christopher; Kokelj, Shawne A.; Kokelj, Steve V.; Hedstrom, Newell			The process of winter streamflow generation in a subarctic Precambrian Shield catchment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												There have been widespread increases in winter streamflow across the circumpolar north since the mid to late 1900s. However, the physical processes that result in winter runoff generation are not well understood. The objective of this research was to determine the runoff generation processes and pathways of cold season streamflow, and to compare and contrast them with those of spring freshet in a subarctic Canadian Shield study catchment in which winter streamflow regime changes have been documented. Traditional hydrometric methods were used in conjunction with modelling and hydrochemistry to estimate runoff sources and pathways. Results suggest that while runoff generation processes do not necessarily differ between spring and winter runoff events, the timing at which pre-event and event water contributes does differ. Furthermore, the periods in which certain runoff pathways activate and deactivate are different. Runoff during the spring freshet is dominated by pre-event water that has not been exposed to the subsurface. In contrast, and most notably, isotopic chemistry reveals that 72% of high cold season streamflow is from new precipitation. In Precambrian Shield regions, or in other landscapes where there may be a large fraction of lakes, late autumn rainfall can increase lake levels, and in turn, storage, to ample volumes that can provide high amounts of winter runoff. Where autumn rainfall has been increasing, precipitation and surface water should be considered as a source of enhanced winter streamflow in these types of landscapes. These results have implications for how widespread environmental changes in the circumpolar north, especially those of aquatic chemistry and permafrost thaw, should be interpreted and predicted.

Utilizing glass microscope slides as artificial substrates, a total of 240 slides were used to collect ciliates after immersion times of 3, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days during each of four seasons, i.e., February, May, August and November, 2017 representing winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. Four trophic-functional groups (TFgrs) were recorded from a 122 species-dataset, i.e., algivores (A), non-selectives (N), raptors (R) and bacterivores (B), comprising of 65, 31, 12 and 14 species, respectively. Based on these four TFgrs, the colonization dynamics of biofilm-dwelling ciliates exhibited different seasonal patterns in terms of both frequency of occurrence and probability density during the study period. During colonization processes, TFgrs A, N and B occurred frequently and generally dominated the samples following an increase in abundance of their members from spring to autumn, whereas TFgr R generally showed different colonization dynamics during the four seasons. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) demonstrated that the colonization dynamics of the trophic-functional groups followed different models in each of the four seasons. Multidimensional scaling ordinations (MDS) based on bootstrapped-average analyses revealed a clear shift in dominance of trophic-functional groups from spring to winter. Thus, the colonization feature of biofilm-dwelling protozoa as measured by trophic-functional structure differed seasonally, suggesting that an optimal sampling strategy needs to be developed when using ciliates as bioindicators on marine water quality.

Evidence of a change in water chemistry in Canada's subarctic associated with enhanced winter streamflow	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Enhanced winter streamflow is a characteristic of a nival/pluvial regime that has emerged in parts of the subarctic Canadian Shield because of increasingly common late summer rains. This phenomenon is part of a widespread trend toward higher winter streamflow in watersheds across the circumpolar north. There may be implications for biogeochemical systems as streamflow regimes undergo these types of changes associated with climate warming. Streamflow and geochemical fluxes were observed over 2years with different winter flow conditions in a subarctic Canadian Shield catchment. Results show that higher wintertime loads of carbon and solutes associated with enhanced winter streamflow were in association with an expansion of contributing areas to run off over what would have existed during typical winter recession. Furthermore, the wet fall conditions that lead to enhanced winter streamflow require water tables close to the topographic surface in highly conductive organic soil layers, which is a similar to the condition during the spring melt. Fall rainfall-runoff leaves an ample volume of water in the lakes that are ubiquitous in this landscape. This water maintains winter streamflow during a time when it traditionally would have ceased. A slowing of biological activity under lake ice increases net mineralization and nitrification rates. This convergence of nitrogen cycling and winter streamflow produced a disproportionate flux of inorganic nitrogen from the study catchment. A conceptual model of how enhanced winter streamflow changes water chemistry in a lake-dominated shield landscape is proposed and may be used as a benchmark to guide hypotheses of process interactions, change in other landscapes, or across scales.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				JAN	2015	120	1					113	127		10.1002/2014JG002809	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JG002809													WOS:000349899200009

Zooplankton serve as the principal trophic link, transferring energy from phytoplankton to fish. Understanding the alterations in zooplankton carbon source compositions following ecological restoration and the seasonal variations in this relationship is crucial. This study employs stable carbon isotope (delta 13C) and fatty acid (FA) analyses to investigate the seasonal changes in carbon source contributions to zooplankton between the restored and unrestored segments of Lake Xuanwu. Results from FA analysis reveal higher proportions of algal dietary markers in zooplankton FAs in both segments during spring and autumn. Summer exhibits a shift with zooplankton utilizing more bacterial FAs in the restored part and more algal FAs in the unrestored part. While approaching winter, zooplankton in the restored part consume more algal FAs but less in the unrestored part. Zooplankton FAs enriched in delta 13C are associated with assimilation of more terrestrial carbon, contrasting with depleted delta 13C when zooplankton relies more on phytoplankton. Isotope mixing models indicate a substantial contribution of terrestrial carbon to zooplankton carbon sources, especially in autumn (42.3% unrestored, 51.2% restored) and winter (41.4% unrestored, 36.8% restored), while phytoplankton has a higher contribution in summer (34.5% restored, 46.9% unrestored). These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of carbon cycling variations in food webs between eutrophic lakes and ecologically restored lakes.

In all, 66 ITS1 sequences were found in the different clone libraries. The nucleotide diversity of all the sampled isolates were in the same range (average number = 0.022) regardless of their origin, showing that several clones are involved in the summer bloom event and contribute to the high biomass production. Phylogenetic study and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed no obvious genetic differentiation between the benthic and pelagic isolates. This finding confirms that the Microcystis genus in this lake is characterized by having both a benthic phase in winter and spring allowing this organism to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions, and a pelagic phase in summer and autumn when environmental conditions allow them to grow in the water column.

Especially Siberia has the large influence on the earth environment. The Lake Chany complex is located in the Novosibirsk region between the Ob River and the Irtish River. It is effective in investigating an environmental change that there is no river of outflow from the Lake Chany. Our aims of the study in Lake Chany are to measure the seasonal changes in the open water area by using NOAA AVHRR images and to compare NOAA AVHRR images with the data from the ground truth. We developed an analysis system to count pixels for arbitrary area in NOAA AVHRR images. The area is thought to be an underestimate in the neighborhood of the inlet and the channel. It is difficult to measure small inlets or bays exactly because the resolution of NOAA is 1.1 km per pixel. The area of Lake Chany was the largest in spring and decreased until summer. And then it became fixed in autumn. We analyzed the results in detail by comparing NOAA AVHRR images with the data from the ground truth including measurements of limnological features. In the waterside of this area, the reed grows gregariously over several km and the reed communities are formed. The vegetations of this area are covered with snow in winter, and the reed remains falling down even if spring comes. So, the reed communities may be recognized as open water on NOAA AVHRR images.																					0-7803-7929-2				2003							3914	3915																WOS:000187293501291

Their Variable contributions were observed in suspended matters taken over a period of a year (annual scale) and in lacustrine sediments covering the last 12,000 years B.P. (millennial scale). Results obtained lead to three main conclusions. Firstly, there exists a seasonal variation in the detrital organic fluxes, directly linked to the autumnal litter production. This allows us to distinct the detrital OM loaded during autumn-winter organic floods and spring-summer ones. Secondly, the organic record in Boreal to modern sediments of the lake of Chaillexon, fed by autumn-winter fluxes, appears mainly controlled by the autumnal productivity of vegetal biomass. Thirdly, the organic record does not point out a progressive evolution of organic fluxes linked with successive climatic phases. It shows abrupt ruptures of the balance (threshold effects) corresponding with the passage of the tree line in the watershed. These ruptures are not necessarily synchronous with climatic fluctuations.																			0037-9409						2000	171	5					533	544		10.2113/171.5.533	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/171.5.533													WOS:000089952100004

Prevalence of Asian fish tapeworm Bothriocephalus in grass carp in Dongting Lake of Hunan province, subtropical China	TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE												We investigated the prevalence of Asian fish tapeworm Bothriocephalus infection in grass carp in Dongting Lake of Hunan province, subtropical China between August 2014 and October of 2015. A total of 2534 fish samples from four representative administrative regions in Hunan province, subtropical China were examined for the presence of Bothriocephalus using helminthological approach. The overall prevalence of Bothriocephalus in grass carp was 6.6% (167/ 2534). The prevalence of Bothriocephalus in grass carp was higher in summer (10.0%) and spring (7.0%) than in autumn (6.0%) and winter (3.3%) (P < 0.01). The highest prevalence of Bothriocephalus was found in grass carp with body weight 0.5 < Weight < 1.5 group with 1-91 infected intensity. The highest intensity of infection was in summer (23-104), and least in winter (1-32). The present survey revealed the prevalence of Bothriocephalus in grass carp in Dongting Lake of Hunan province, subtropical China. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Bothriocephalus prevalence in grass carp in China.

J	Vagle, S; Carmack, E				Vagle, Svein; Carmack, Eddy			Annual patterns of stratification, mixing and ventilation in long, deep, seasonally ice-covered Francois lake, British Columbia, Canada	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Francois Lake is a long, deep, seasonally ice-covered, dimictic lake set in an east-west orientation in mid-British Columbia. As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?).																				2296-6463				FEB 21	2023	11								1090124	10.3389/feart.2023.1090124	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2023.1090124													WOS:000944109100001

Gilvin is primarily responsible for the strong selective attenuation of blue light in both lakes. As a result of differing gilvin concentrations light transmission maxima of downwelling and upwelling spectra are near 615 nm in Lake Cromwell and 599 nm in Lake Croche. With increases in depth both upwelling and downwelling radiance fluxes decrease, are shifted to longer wavelengths and become more monochromatic. The greatest penetration of light occurs in the summer and spring after which a gradual decrease occurs through fall to a minimum value in winter. Under the winter cover the .lambda.P50 of downwelling light shifts 10 to 20 nm towards shorter wavelengths. Seasonal changes in downwelling irradiance are related to solar altitude, concentration of suspended particles, phytoplankton populations, amount of gilvin, mixing and winter cover. The brownish colouration of these lakes is explained by reflectance of spectrally impure orangish-red light.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 10	1988	169	1					107	121		10.1007/BF00007938	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007938													WOS:A1988R086700010
J	MAKAREWICZ, JC				MAKAREWICZ, JC			PHOTOSYNTHETIC PARAMETERS AS INDICATORS OF ECOSYSTEM HEALTH	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Thirty-three limnological variables, including the photosynthesis parameters P(max) and Alpha, were monitored for 2 years in the nearshore and offshore of Lake Ontario. In the nearshore, P(max) and Alpha varied seasonally and were higher during the summer and early autumn and lowest in the winter and spring of 1986-87. No seasonable variability of the photosynthetic parameters were observed in the offshore and nearshore in 1987-88. P(max) varied during the winter, a period of decreased biological activity and ostensibly less variability. Multiple regression analysis suggested that over 25% of the variability in P(max) was predicted by temperature. The large number of variables, that are either correlated or have been experimentally determined to affect P(max) and Alpha and the similarity of the photosynthetic parameters within the various Great Lakes of differing trophic status, suggests that the use of the photosynthetic parameters as indicators of "ecosystem health" is at best weak.																			0380-1330						1991	17	3					333	343		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71370-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71370-1													WOS:A1991GK77500006

During the summer (June-August), perch were present within the thermocline (9-14.degree. C) between 7 and 10 m. There was no significant difference between samples during this period, nor was there any evidence of shoaling. From September onwards perch moved into deeper waters. By late winter fish had become patchy in their distribution. Total numbers, during the summer, were estimated to be 988 ha-1 with 95% confidence limits of .+-. 115 (biomass 98.8 kg ha-1). Densities (no. m-3) fell by over 90% after the autumn overturn. The implications for predators are discussed.

The sampling stations represent the trophic gradient of the lake. The environmental parameters (Chlorophyll-a content of the plankton and of the reed periphyton, and suspended solid content of the water) were significantly higher (ANOVA) in the western basin (Keszthely and Szigliget bays) than in the eastern basin (Bozsai and Paloznak bays). However, the population parameters (length of the animals, percentage of juveniles, length of ovigerous females, percentage of ovigerous females and fecundity) did not differ significantly between the two basins. Both the abundance and biomass were higher in the middle than in the westernmost and easternmost bays but the difference is not significant. The ovigerous females were significantly bigger in spring than in summer and autumn. The egg number per female was also significantly greater in spring than in summer and autumn. The length of ovigerous females and the fecundity in summer did not differ significantly from those of autumn data. There is a significant positive correlation (Spearman rank correlation) between both abundance and biomass and the above environmental parameters. The length of ovigerous females and the fecundity were inversely correlated with the plank-ton Chlorophyll-a concentrations. The abundance of C. curvispinum in the reed belt of Lake Balaton is greater than in several parts of the Dnieper and Volga. However, it is much lower than in the Don, Oka, Danube and Rhine rivers.

We followed the prevalence of visible neoplasms among walleyes Stizostedion vitreum aged 3-8+ years from 1995 to 1999 in Oneida Lake, New York. The percentage of fish developing tumors increased from age 3 to age 6 but decreased thereafter These findings give further support to the hypothesis that walleyes from Oneida Lake contract the disease during the spawning run and develop visible neoplasms in the fall and winter of that same year but return in the spring with regressing tumors that disappear by summer and do not return. Over time, almost all walleyes of a year-class may contract the disease. These Endings are not consistent with the hypothesis that walleyes that have visible neoplasms in the spring will develop the disease again the following year.

The identification results of algae and phytoplankton showed that a total of 8 phyla and 276 species of algae and phytoplankton were detected, of which Chlorophyta was the dominant phytoplankton. Diversity analysis showed that the species diversity and richness were higher in summer and autumn, and decreased in spring and winter, and there was little difference in the whole year. Correlation analysis showed that the water quality factors that had great influence on algae and phytoplankton were ammonia nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, temperature and so on. Hyriopsis schlegelii is an important freshwater pearl mussel in China, it feeds on algae and phytoplankton, so its growth rate is related to algae and phyto-plankton. The mussel growth calculation results showed that H. schlegelii grows faster in spring and summer and slower in winter, which is in line with the seasonal variation law of algae and phytoplankton. According to the results of stepwise regression analysis of water quality and mussel weight gain, the most relevant factors of mussel weight gain were consistent with the dominant species at the same time. Some algae species, including Synedra, Chlorella and Nitzschia, are good bait for H. schlegelii.

The cycle involves a period of summer invasion, fall development of plasmodia and initiation of sporogenesis, winter completion of sporogenesis, and spring release of spores. An experiment revealed that rising water temperature in spring promotes cyst rupture and loss. The development of cysts is synchronized within individual fish and among members of the host population. As such, the parasite spends 8-9 mo in perch tissues to produce a single annual generation that culminates in a 4-6-wk period of spore dispersal. The parasite does not appear to be pathogenic. The observed cycle of H. doori repeated itself over 4 yr of sampling in Vinegar Lake, Nova Scotia.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				DEC	1994	80	6					900	904		10.2307/3283438	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3283438								7799162					WOS:A1994PZ73700012

This study investigated the dynamic characteristics and particle-water interaction of heavy metals in the waters of a subtropical eutrophic reservoir in China. Monthly concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Cd, As, and Pb in solution and suspension were analyzed in the Shanzi Reservoir from 2013 to 2014 using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Results showed that there were significant differences in the dynamic characteristics of heavy metals. Suspension was the main transportation phase for Fe, Mn, Cr, and Pb, while Cd and As existed mainly in solution. Cu was evenly distributed between the two phases. Seasonal variability of the particle-water distribution coefficient (KD) showed lowest value during winter and spring for Fe and Mn, during winter for Cu and Cr, during autumn and winter for Cd, during summer and winter for As, and during spring for Pb. The low KD suggested a direct ecological hazard during these seasons. Transport of Fe, Mn, Cu, As, and Pb along the water flow were generally consistent and transitioned from the suspended to dissolved phase downstream. Eutrophication had an impact on the migration and transformation of Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, and Cd. This study highlights the importance of thorough and regular monitoring of heavy metals in eutrophic reservoirs to reduce and prevent metal pollution in reservoir-type drinking water sources.					wang, qianfeng/AAY-6922-2020; li, yunqin/HNQ-6024-2023; Zeng, Jingyu/JFS-5947-2023; wang, qianfeng/C-2777-2014	Zeng, Jingyu/0000-0002-5892-6098; wang, qianfeng/0000-0002-8460-6821													0375-6742	1879-1689				JAN	2020	208								106391	10.1016/j.gexplo.2019.106391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gexplo.2019.106391													WOS:000498684300007

Recently, however, water quality has improved substantially. An overview of the developments in water quality (transparency, P-TOT, chlorophyll) is presented for 1969-1996. Dominance of filamentous cyanobacteria in summer is analyzed. P-reduction is the key-factor to reduce cyanobacterial dominance, At P-TOT > 0.20 mg l(-1) cyanobacterial dominance approaches 100%, at 0.05 < P-TOT < 0.20 mg l(-1) the dominance decreases rapidly, while at P-TOT less than or equal to 0.05 mg l(-1) filamentous cyanobacteria virtually disappear. In the intermediate range for P summer dominance of cyanobacteria may be either high or low. The occurrence of these two states is related to the winter conditions and the global insolation in spring (April-May). Low summer dominances may occur after a severe winter. A severe winter results in a low inoculum of filamentous cyanobacteria, a mild winter in a high inoculum. High cyanobacterial dominance in summer is related to a high inoculum and/or high global insolation in spring. When the inoculum is low, i.e, after a severe winter, cyanobacterial dominance in summer may be either low or high. Low global insolation does not provide an indication fbr poor conditions for growth. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

We evaluate the hydrology simulated by a lake model coupled to NCAR's regional climate model (RegCM2) in a study of the Aral Sea. The meteorological variables that are input to the lake model are simulated well by RegCM2. Simulated surface air temperatures closely match observed values, except during spring and fall when the simulated temperatures are too cold. The magnitude of precipitation is too high in the region surrounding the Aral Sea during summer and fall. On a yearly basis, RegCM2 produces a reasonable amount of runoff throughout the drainage basin. The lake model coupled to RegCM2 accurately simulates Aral Sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The lake model also simulates observed mid-winter ice fraction well, although the onset of ice growth occurs too late in the year and the ice melts too rapidly in the spring. The simulated annual evaporation from the Aral Sea is consistent with observed estimates; however, the simulated evaporation is greater than observed during summer and less than observed during winter. In a "stand-alone" lake model simulation, the simulated Aral Sea hydrology does not match observations as closely as in the coupled model experiment. These results suggest that a stand-alone lake model would not accurately simulate the hydrologic response of the Aral Sea to various forcings.

We determined the CH4 production and oxidation potentials in deep and shallow profundal sediments, water column CH4 oxidation potentials, and seasonal variation in CH4 oxidation in water column in situ. The sediment CH4 production and oxidation potentials were greater in summer than in winter. In the shallow profundal, the CH4 oxidation potential of the surface sediment was equal to or higher than the sediment CH4 production potential, whereas in the deep profundal sediment, CH4 production potential exceeded the CH4 oxidation potential. The entire water column had the potential to oxidize CH4. The CH4 oxidation rates (shown as negative values) in the water column in situ, ranged from 0 to -27 mmol m(-3)d(-1), and were lower than the potential CH4 oxidation rates, which ranged from -9 to -160 mmol m(-3)d(-1). The supply of CH4 regulated its oxidation rate in water in situ, resulting in a clear seasonal variation in the level of CH4 oxidation. The highest oxidation rates occurred in the hypolimnion during summer and winter stratifications when there were the highest CR4 concentrations. During these stratifications, the CH4 oxidation contributed significantly to the hypolinmetic O-2 consumption. In winter, there was CH4 oxidation both in the aerobic and anaerobic water column. The depth integrated CH4 oxidation in the water column was highest during stratification, in winter -31 and in summer -15 mmol m(-2)d(-1). During the autumn overturn, the water column oxidized some CH4, but in spring, after the ice melt. the water column had a very low CH4 production. Oxidation of CH4 both in the sediments and water column reduced the emissions of CH4 to the atmosphere.																			0003-9136					JUL	2002	154	4					585	603																WOS:000177786800004
J	Staehr, PA; Sand-Jensen, K				Staehr, PA; Sand-Jensen, K			Seasonal changes in temperature and nutrient control of photosynthesis, respiration and growth of natural phytoplankton communities	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. To investigate the influence of elevated temperatures and nutrients on photosynthesis, respiration and growth of natural phytoplankton assemblages, water was collected from a eutrophic lake in spring, summer, autumn, winter and the following spring and exposed to ambient temperature and ambient +2, +4 and +6 degrees C for 2 weeks with and without addition of extra inorganic nutrients. 2. Rates of photosynthesis, respiration and growth generally increased with temperature, but this effect was strongly enhanced by high nutrient availability, and therefore was most evident for nutrient amended cultures in seasons of low ambient nutrient availability. 3. Temperature stimulation of growth and metabolism was higher at low than high ambient temperature showing that long-term temperature acclimation of the phytoplankton community before the experiments was of great importance for the measured rates. 4. Although we found distinct responses to relatively small temperature increases, the interaction between nutrient availability, time of the year and, thus, ambient temperature was responsible for most of the observed variability in phytoplankton growth, photosynthesis and respiration. 5. Although an increase in global temperature will influence production and degradation of organic material in lakes, the documented importance of ambient temperatures and nutrient conditions suggests that effects will be most pronounced during winter and early spring, while the remaining part of the growth season will be practically unaffected by increasing temperatures.

Such compensation is higher when there is reduced density-dependent competition in plants after herbivore damage. Whether there is relief from competition may largely be determined by the life-history stage of plants under herbivory. Such stage-specific compensation may apply to seasonal herbivory on the clonal aquatic plant sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.). It winters in sediments of shallow lakes as tubers that are foraged upon by Bewick's Swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii Yarrell), whereas aboveground biomass in summer is mostly consumed by ducks, coots, and Mute Swans. Here, tuber predation may be compensated due to diminished negative density dependence in the next growth season. However, we expected lower compensation to summer herbivory by waterfowl and fish as density of aboveground biomass in summer is closely related to photosynthetic carbon fixation. In a factorial exclosure study we simultaneously investigated (1) the effect of summer herbivory on aboveground biomass and autumn tuber biomass and (2) the effect of tuber predation in autumn on aboveground biomass and tuber biomass a year later. Summer herbivory strongly influenced belowground tuber biomass in autumn, limiting food availability to Bewick's Swans. In contrast, tuber predation in autumn by Bewick's Swans had a limited and variable effect on P. pectinatus biomass in the following growth season. Whereas relief from negative density dependence largely eliminates effects of belowground herbivory by swans, aboveground herbivory in summer limits both above- and belowground plant biomass. Hence, there was an asymmetry in exploitative competition, with herbivores in summer reducing food availability for belowground herbivores in autumn, but not the other way around.

Modelling potential effects of climate change on winter turbidity loading in the Ashokan Reservoir, NY	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Eastern Snow Conference (ESC)	JUN 05-07, 2012	Clayville, NY					Recent studies have indicated that potential future climate change may lead to changes in the timing and quantity of snowpack accumulation and winter (November to April) streamflow patterns including increased streamflow and turbidity in early winter and a slight reduction in turbidity loads at the time of traditional early spring run-off. In this study, we examine the potential effects of these predicted changes on reservoir turbidity levels. Our analysis focuses on Ashokan Reservoir, NY, which can at times receive significant watershed turbidity inputs mainly from stream channel erosion from the Esopus Creek. Both measured and simulated turbidity loads and climatology are input to CE-QUAL-W2 (W2), a reservoir turbidity transport model that can simulate reservoir turbidity and other water quality parameters. The W2 model is applied to estimate the effects of hydroclimatology on effective settling rates and turbidity transport as a result of differences in reservoir thermal structure during summer and winter events. Simulations suggest that the effective settling velocity is substantially lower at low temperatures during winter time. Winter average stream flow is simulated to increase by 12% and 20%, which leads to increases in reservoir turbidity by 11% and 17% for the future period 2046-2065 and 2081-2100, respectively. From a seasonal perspective, a change in timing of peak streamflow with increased flows during the winter and slightly reduced flows during early spring leads to increased average reservoir turbidity during winter and slightly decreased in-reservoir turbidity during early spring and summer.

The age and the minimum size at first maturation in both lakes and both sexes were estimated as 2-year-old and about 230 mm SL, respectively. Although their spawning periods were estimated as being from late April to late June in Lake Shorenji and from mid-April to mid-May in Lake Nishinoko, well-developed yolked oocytes were found in the ovaries of the fish from both lakes from late fall to early summer. The peaks of spermatogenesis occurred in spring and fall, male gonadosomatic indices indicating high values in winter. These reproductive cycles of largemouth bass, which started to develop from fall, extended their spawning period and May have been an important factor of naturalization of the species into various environments in Japanese inland waters.																			0021-5392					MAR	2002	68	2					151	156																WOS:000176869400003
J	Buech, RR				Buech, RR			Sex differences in behavior of beavers living in near-boreal lake habitat	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Comparative studies of how female and male North American beavers (Castor canadensis) allocate time provide a basis for understanding their life history. I studied the behavior of beavers living in lake habitats of a near-boreal region to determine how animals of each sex allocated time during their active periods. Markov time-budget estimates revealed that over the open-water season, adult females and males spent 91 and 86%, respectively, of time during active periods feeding, traveling, and being in the lodge. Adult females spent most of their time feeding in late spring and summer. In late summer through fall, they spent more time provisioning, working on lodges, and constructing winter food caches. In contrast, adult males spent less time feeding and more time traveling, being in the lodge, and working on the lodge in late spring and early summer. As the season progressed, adult males traveled less and spent more time feeding and working on the lodge. Overall, the results suggest that there is a division of labor in this monogamous species. Adult females seemed to function primarily as providers of energy to kits. In contrast, adult males seemed to function primarily in protection and provisioning of kits, territory maintenance, and construction and maintenance of structures.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	1995	73	11					2133	2143		10.1139/z95-250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z95-250													WOS:A1995TQ06300019

Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in Lake Taihu, China from 2018 to 2019 is collected and collocated with GF-1 satellite data. This study develops a general and reliable estimation of Chl-a concentration from GF-1 WFV data under turbid inland water conditions. The collocated data are classified according to season and used in random forest (RF) regression to train models for retrieving the lake Chl-a concentration. A composite index is developed to select the most important variables in the models. The models trained for each season show a better performance than the model trained by using the whole year data in terms of the coefficient of determination (R-2) between retrievals and observations. Specifically, the R-2 values in spring, summer, autumn, and winter are 0.88, 0.88, 0.94, and 0.74, respectively; whereas that using the whole year data is only 0.71. The Chl-a concentration in Lake Taihu exhibits an obvious seasonal change with the highest in summer, followed by autumn and spring, and the lowest in winter. The Chl-a concentration also displays an obvious spatial variation with season. A high concentration occurs mainly in the northwest of the lake. The temporal and spatial changes of Chl-a concentration are almost consistent with the changes in the areas and times of cyanobacteria blooms based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The proposed algorithm can be operated without a priori knowledge on atmospheric conditions and water quality. Our study also demonstrates that GF-1 data are increasingly valuable for monitoring the Chl-a concentration of inland water bodies in China at a high spatial resolution.					li, xinyi/GWZ-8941-2022; Li, Yachun/KGL-1692-2024														2095-6037	2198-0934				FEB	2022	36	1					208	226		10.1007/s13351-022-1146-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13351-022-1146-y													WOS:000769464400015

The lakes along the way have different ecological functions for the life histories of waterbirds. In order to determine the ecological functions of high-altitude lakes, we selected Mangcuo Lake in Markam County to investigate the waterbird community in four seasons. The results show that Mangcuo Lake provides a breeding habitat for nine species of birds and also supports excellent numbers of birds migrating in the spring and autumn. In view of the role of Mangcuo Lake in the migration route, we propose upgrading the protection level of the Mangcuo Lake.The stopovers provide food and habitat for migratory birds and therefore play an important role in facilitating the birds' completion of their migration. The Hengduan Mountains, which have a complex topography, are located in a large corridor of the Central Asian migratory flyway, so the lakes along the Hengduan Mountains are important for waterbird migration. The existing research on lakes in the Hengduan Mountain area is mostly concentrated in the central and southern parts of the mountains, which proves that many lakes are wintering grounds for migrating birds. We wonder whether the ecological functions of lakes will change more with further elevation. With this question, we conducted four surveys for the seasonal bird survey in Mangcuo Lake, which is located in the northwest of the Hengduan Mountains, in Markam County of Qamdo City, between October 2019 and July 2020. We recorded a total of 6109 birds from 20 species of waterbirds, including 20 species of migratory waterbirds, accounting for 100% of all bird species. The diversity and richness of waterbirds in Mangtso Lake is shown as spring > autumn = , summer > winter, with no waterbirds in winter. The black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus), bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), and ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) were the dominant species in the waterbird community. The highest number of waterbird species and total individuals were found in the transition zone between the marsh wetlands and lakes, and the number of waterbird species differed significantly among habitats (X-2 = 14.405, p = 0.000), with habitat complexity being an important factor influencing waterfowl abundance and distribution. The IUCN Red-listed species recorded include the black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis), painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala), and common pochard (Aythya ferina). By comparing with other lakes in Hengduan Mountain, we found that the ecological functions of the plateau lakes in the Hengduan Mountains, to support the life histories of migrating waterbirds, are gradually transforming as the altitude rises, and can be divided into approximately three levels, with the first level of Qionghai, Chenghai, Erhai, and Jianhu at altitudes of 1500-2200 m being the most important ecological function in terms of providing wintering grounds for migrating birds. The second layer, at an altitude of 2400-3300 m, includes Lashihai, Lugu Lake, and Napahai, which are not only wintering wetlands for migratory birds but also important stopover sites. The third layer of Mangcuo Lake, which is above 4000 m above sea level, provides a breeding ground for some migratory waterbirds in summer and a migratory resting place for migratory waterbirds in spring and autumn.					yang, yongbing/LRC-1156-2024; YANG, Le/JPX-9862-2023	yang, le/0000-0002-7248-2972; 													2076-2615					APR	2023	13	7							1139	10.3390/ani13071139	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani13071139								37048395					WOS:000969741500001

The region experiences warm, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Study focus Using a three-year (2019-2022) high-resolution (30-min interval) vertical water temperature dataset, we investigated Mang Co's seasonal thermal stratification and mixing dynamics, and compared controlling mechanisms with those of arid mid-western TP lakes. New hydrological insights Mang Co exhibits monsoon-driven humidity amplification (annual mean up to 60 %), which suppresses evaporative cooling and maintains hypolimnetic temperatures up to similar to 10 degrees C-significantly warmer than those in mid-western TP lakes where the climate is drier. Stratification develops from late May to early October, followed by spring and autumn overturning and similar to 4 months of winter ice cover with inverse stratification, and post-melt convection. Episodic spring wind gusts (>10 m<middle dot>s(-)(1)) drive mixing. Summer stratification is mainly stabilized by air temperature and humidity-radiation synergy, unlike arid lakes where wind and solar radiation dominate. Due to Mang Co's shallow depth and low salinity, the thermocline is shallower (similar to 10 m) and Schmidt stability lower (max similar to 194 J<middle dot>m(-)(2)) than in deeper saline lakes. These findings highlight divergent thermal structures shaped by humidity, wind events, and ice-water interactions. They underscore the importance of incorporating humidity thresholds and episodic wind forcing into lake models for accurately simulating monsoon-affected high-altitude lakes under climate change.																				2214-5818				DEC	2025	62								102840	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102840	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102840		DEC 2025											WOS:001594811700001

Size Fractionation of Trace Elements in a Seasonally Stratified Boreal Lake: Control of Organic Matter and Iron Colloids	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The colloidal distribution and size fractionation of organic carbon and trace elements were studied in a seasonally stratified, organic-rich boreal lake, Lake Maselga, located in the European subarctic zone (NW Russia, Arkhangelsk region). This study took place over the course of 5 years in winter (glacial) and summer periods and during the spring and autumn overturn. A newly developed in situ dialysis technique (1, 10, and 50 kDa) and traditional frontal filtration and ultrafiltration (20, 10, 5, 0.22, and 0.025 mu m) were used to assess element concentrations at different depths. No significant changes in element concentrations occurred during filtration through sub-colloidal pore-size membranes (20-0.22 mu m), suggesting a negligible amount of particulate Fe, OC, and associated trace metals. Large colloids (0.025-0.22 mu m) were found to be the main carriers of poorly soluble elements (Fe, Al, Ti, Zr, REEs, Th, and U) during the summer and winter stratification. There was also a clear change in the vertical pattern of the percentage of colloidal Al, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, and Ni during different seasons, and the greatest proportion of colloidal forms was observed during the spring and autumn overturn. This pattern is most likely linked to the dominance of soil (allochthonous) organic carbon, which complexes with trace metals during these periods. During the summer seasons, autochthonous production of small exometabolites or photodegradation increases the concentration of the low-molecular weight fractions (< 1 kDa) that dominate the speciation of divalent heavy metals in surface horizons. The colloidal status of As (30-60%), which was documented in different seasons along the full depth of the water column, is most likely linked to the presence of organic complexes. The overall results of this study suggest that changes in the colloidal speciation of trace elements with depth in different seasons depend on changes in the redox conditions, the input of soil OM, the biodegradation of plankton biomass releasing dissolved organic matter in the bottom horizons, and in upward diffusion from the sediments.					; Kokryatskaya, Natalia/V-4986-2017; Audry, Stéphane/ABF-8717-2020; Pokrovsky, Oleg/W-4934-2019; Chupakov, Artem/A-9191-2014; Klimov, Sergey/B-2191-2014; Moreva, Olga/A-8591-2014; Zabelina, Svetlana/A-8851-2014; Тихтилова, Наталья/A-9404-2014; Vorobieva, Taisia/AAZ-2832-2020	Audry, Stephane/0000-0002-5075-1262; Zabelina, Svetlana/0000-0001-7160-0618; Chupakov, Artem/0000-0001-6424-5582; Moreva, Ol'ga/0000-0002-5114-8481; Vorob'eva, Taisia/0000-0002-3410-0240; Pokrovsky, Oleg/0000-0002-3155-7069													1380-6165					MAR	2012	18	2					115	139		10.1007/s10498-011-9154-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-011-9154-z													WOS:000300281200003

All age-classes of fish fed exclusively on Daphnia in early spring and late fall but had a mixed diet during the summer consisting of zooplankton, other invertebrates, and filamentous algae. Concentration of methyl Hg in Daphnia varied during the summer. Concentration of T-Hg in age-1 fish also varied during the summer, but all age-classes increased in T-Hg concentration during winter. Body burden increased steadily throughout the year for all age-classes and cohorts. Each successively older age-class of fish had increasingly higher concentrations of T-Hg and body burdens. The T-Hg concentration and body burden were significantly different between cohorts in early spring for age-1 and age-2 fish. Differences between cohorts corresponded to differences in Hg concentrations in the water and Daphnia during the cohort's year of birth. Our results suggest that small planktivorous fish are a useful sentinel for monitoring short-term changes in the availability of Hg in lakes.																			0002-8487					JUL	1999	128	4					701	712		10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0701:TMDADC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0701:TMDADC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000089183800015

Mixing ratios were highest in the wintertime with maximum values approaching 600 mmol mol(-1) during atmospheric inversions. Nighttime carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of source CO2 showed a seasonal pattern with isotopically depleted values in the wintertime and isotopically enriched values in the spring and summer. The effects of gasoline combustion, natural gas combustion, and biogenic respiration of plants and soils on CO2 mixing ratio were quantified with a mass balance calculation using dual carbon and oxygen isotopic tracers. The calculations showed large contributions of natural gas combustion in the winter and significant nighttime biogenic respiration in the spring and late summer/early fall.

Torcu			Endohelminth parasite communities of Squalius cii, including the zoonotic trematoda Clinostomum complanatum: Effect of host sex and size on community structure	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												An examination was carried out from spring 2020 (April) to winter 2021 (February) to determine the occurrence of endoparasitic helminth in European chub ( Squalius cii) in the Susurluk basin from the Northwest region of Turkey. The infection levels of all identified endoparasitic helminths were also investigated in relation to host factors and seasons. In addition, the differences with their prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance were evaluated statistically. A total of 79 S . cii were examined, 33 fishes were found to be infected by one or more endoparasitic helminth specimens. Three species of endoparasitic helminth were identified on gill cavities and in the gastrointestinal tracts, respectively: Clinostomum complanatum (Rudolphi, 1814), Caryophyllaeides fennica (Schneider, 1902), and Rhabdochona denudata (Dujardin, 1845). R. denudata was the most common and most abundant species. The endohelminth infections were recorded in all seasons. C . fennica was recorded in spring and summer, while C . complanatum was encountered in spring and autumn, whereas it was not detected in summer and winter. The prevalences were higher in larger hosts based on body length in C . complanatum, C . fennica, and R. denudata, while a high mean intensity of C . complanatum and R . denudate was in smaller hosts.

Several differences between the parasite on B. dilatata and that described originally from Diaptomus gracilis were noted: the infection hyphae on B. dilatata did not swell distally into bulbous appressoria and the oogonia were typically larger and ornamented with spines or tubercles. The incidence of infection among adult female B. dilatata from 1969-1978 varied from nil to over 20% in both Lake Hayes and Lake Johnson and reached a peak of 47.7% in Lake Hayes in Oct. 1977. Infection was highest in winter, spring and late summer and lowest in early summer and autumn in both lakes. In Lake Hayes, peaks of infection roughly coincided with times when numbers of adult females of successive copepod generations were waning; this implies that the incidence of infection increases with female age after maturation.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1980	14	1					23	29		10.1080/00288330.1980.9515839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1980.9515839													WOS:A1980JP01100003

Here we summarize the current knowledge based on lake development and eolian accumulation in catchments on the NETP. Interlinked processes between selected lakes and their catchments on the NETP show a relatively clear division into summer and late autumn/winter/early spring (October to April) dominated activities based on lake hydrological and eolian variations. Investigated lakes on the NETP experienced seldom water cover or pond/playa status during the Late Glacial with long ice cover periods. Eolian sand deposited in lake beds and/or the eastern parts of the respective catchments as a constant process during the colder season. These processes continued during the early Holocene despite climate warming and increased moisture supply as lake levels still remained relatively low, mainly fed by spring/summer glacier and snow melt. Eolian sand activity dominated in the catchments during the cold periods, while coarse sediments in the lake centers were mainly deposited by fluvial input in spring/summer and/or randomly distributed eolian material in ice cracks after melt in spring. During the mid-Holocene high lake levels occurred due to intensified multiple moisture supply sources. Eolian sand accumulation diminished and was eroded by precipitation thus more fluvial suspension was transported to the lake center. Subsequently, lake level decline until around 3 ka BP signaled a reduction in moisture availability and related surface runoff. Eolian sediment was less preserved due to surface erosion in line with lake level increase during the succeeding period. Fluvial material mixed with eolian sand was transported to the lake center during unfrozen periods. Afterwards fluctuating lake levels and intensive eolian deposits were frequently documented for the last 2 ka demonstrating climate variations similar to present. Fluctuations between the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) and Mid Latitude Westerlies (MLW)/Asian winter monsoon (AWM) influences were recorded with respect to season shifts for the entire Holocene with general dominance of north-westerly surface winds at investigated sites. Inspected periodicities of one lake record and eolian material demonstrate that local effects are of significance for eolian accumulations however, both records react to regional/global climatic changes but with different extend.

Germany were examined. The abundance of both species was lowest during the summer months and highest during autumn. The stone leach population in the littoral comprised age classes 1 to 3 plus, in autumn, age class 0. The burbot population showed distinct seasonal changes in both length and age composition. During spring and summer, only age class 1 was present in the littoral whereas, in autumn, only age class 0 was caught.

The lake's catchment area is estimated to be similar to 12,500 km(2), and the terrestrial input is carried through eolian, riverine, snowmelt and anthropogenic paths. Extent and seasonality of the terrestrial inputs to the lake have not been studied, but it is essential to evaluate its environmental status and to assess the use of environmental proxies to estimate the lake's response to climate changes. This study aims to measure seasonal changes in terrestrial input of natural and anthropogenic origin as recorded by the fluxes of pollen and biomarkers of soil bacteria and vascular or higher plants, as well as petrogenic biomarkers in monthly resolved sediment traps from August 2006 to July 2007. Fluxes of pollen, soil and higher plant biomarkers seem to be related to precipitation and snowmelt in autumn and spring. In addition, dust storms, which are common during the summer months, may have resulted in long-distance transport. Anthropogenic biomarker fluxes indicate year-round petrogenic contamination although some mature biomarker fluxes are higher in summer and in late winter-spring. The relative changes between petrogenic markers indicate variations in the pollutant sources.

Maximum and minimum period values of 28.1 and 24.8 h were recorded under constant darkness from fish obtained at the times of the winter and summer solstices, respectively. There was an asymmetric annual pattern in the .tau. values obtained from the increasing and decreasing photoperiods of spring and fall. Annual variations in .tau. were relatively independent of temperature. They were interpreted as being aftereffects of natural photoperiodic entrainment.

Assessing change in the overturning behavior of the Laurentian Great Lakes using remotely sensed lake surface water temperatures	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Most large temperate lakes experience overturning every spring and fall as surface water moves past 4 degrees C, the temperature of maximum density for freshwater. These semiannual, lake-wide overturning events play an important role regulating the thermal structure, deep-water ventilation, nutrient supply, water circulation, and nearshore water quality of the lakes. The general pattern of overturning has long been known from field observations and models, but its timing, duration, detailed spatio-temporal progression and seasonal and inter-annual variability remain largely undocumented, particularly in the context of recent climate-driven changes in lake thermal dynamics. Here, we used a reconstructed record of daily and spatially-explicit lake surface water temperatures (LSWT) to analyze the migration of the 4 degrees C thermal front as it progressed from the shorelines to the deep parts of the Laurentian Great Lakes during every overturning event between June 1995 to April 2012. The analysis revealed a strong asymmetry in the timing and duration of overturning between spring and fall, and no relationship with the lake-averaged LSWT or its rate of change. Key differences in the average spatio-temporal progression of overturning were also observed between spring and fall, with the spring progression being largely driven by latitude and water depth and the fall progression being less predictable and influenced by other factors such as wind. Narrow regions of very slow overturning progression were also identified, revealing areas of the lakes where persistent 4 degrees C thermal bars are likely to re-occur every year. The timing and duration of these seasonal overturning events varied between years by as much as one and two months, respectively, with a direct impact on the duration of lake-wide stratification. In 2012, Lakes Michigan and Ontario experienced an incomplete fall overturning, leading only to a partial winter stratification. Lakes Michigan and Ontario were more susceptible to experience an incomplete overturning than the other Laurentian Great Lakes, seemingly due to a combination of comparatively milder winter air temperatures and lower lake dynamic ratio (steepness of bottom slope). Overall, the duration of lake-wide winter stratification was found to be strongly correlated with mean winter air temperatures, and a simple trend analysis suggested that rising temperatures could lead to more frequent incomplete fall overturnings and partial winter stratifications in Lakes Michigan and Ontario over the next few decades. This study demonstrated that remote sensing provides an unparalleled tool for assessing the long-term variability in the overturning behavior of large lakes in the context of climate change.

In the water, Fe has the highest concentrations among the studied metals. Generally, the metal concentrations increased in the hottest period decreased in warm seasons. Results for levels in water were compared with national and international water quality guidelines, as well as literature data reported for the lakes. Fe was the highest in sediment samples, also Cu and Zn were the highest in spring, while Fe and Mn were in autumn. Among the heavy metals studied, Cu and Mn were below the detection limits in some tissues. Generally, higher concentrations of the tested metals were found in the summer and winter, compared with those during the autumn and spring seasons. High levels of heavy metals were found in liver of T. tinca, while low levels in muscle samples. Metal concentrations in the muscle of examined fish were within the safety permissible levels for human consumption.

Long-term water color and flow trends in the Mississippi River Headwaters, 1944-2010	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Intensification of brown color in surface waters has been observed over several decades in many areas. We examined a 64-yr daily record (1947-2010) of visual water color, a measure of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), in the Mississippi River at Minneapolis, Minnesota. Although no monotonic trends in daily or mean annual color were evident, our analyses revealed trends in seasonal metrics, for example, mean winter color, on decadal scales related to changes in flow (hence climatic conditions). A pattern of high color (CDOM) in late spring and summer, corresponding with higher flow, was found across the period. Daily flow accounted for similar to 50% of the variance in color, and a lag of four days was found between peak responses of flow and color, supporting a CDOM source from wetlands in northern parts of the basin. The slope of the color-flow relationship increased over the 64 yr, driven by increased CDOM flushing in late summer-early fall. Based on trends in seasonally aggregated color and discharge, minimum and mean color and flow increased during winter over the 64 yr, potentially due to higher temperatures. Summer months did not show increases, but color became less variable. As a result, the color difference between summer and winter became smaller over the study period. During high flow events (ice-out or high precipitation), some hysteretic color patterns were observed consistent with observations on other large rivers. Our results indicate that long-term color (CDOM) trends in the Mississippi Headwaters reach are related to seasonally dominant changes in climatic conditions.					; Finlay, Jacques/B-6081-2011; Brezonik, Patrick/ISV-2988-2023	Germolus, Noah/0000-0002-6919-4021; Finlay, Jacques/0000-0002-7968-7030; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2021	66	9					3552	3567		10.1002/lno.11898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11898		JUL 2021											WOS:000678561500001

The evaluation of the lake's health and nutritional status could be achieved by the analysis of the phytoplankton community. Nevertheless, the understanding of the long-term phytoplankton dynamics in Hongze Lake after the implementation of the South-to-North Water Diversion remains insufficient. In this study, an investigation was conducted to analyze the community structure, distribution patterns, and environmental factors influencing the abundance of phytoplankton in Hongze Lake. The results of the study revealed that Hongze Lake showed seasonal variations in both the structure and biomass of its phytoplankton population. In fall, winter, and spring, Chlorophyta dominates, while Cryptophyta dominates in summer. Algae predominantly inhabit Chengzi Lake and Lihewa during the summer season. According to the redundancy analysis, temperature is positively correlated with algal abundance in summer but negatively correlated in spring and winter. Furthermore, the mantel analysis indicated that the abundance of different algal species was significantly correlated with dissolved oxygen and nutrient levels. The generalized linear model further clarified the contribution of environmental factors to algal abundance: total nitrogen (weights = 30.67%) ranked second in importance after temperature (weights = 34.52%). The results of this study provide insight into the alterations in the phytoplankton community within Hongze Lake following the implementation of the water transfer project. In addition, these findings offer valuable guidance for the regulation of lake water resources and water quality.

Syntheses of proxy data indicate that global mean annual temperature declined from the mid-Holocene until the Pre-industrial Era, a trend linked to decreasing Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. In contrast, global climate models simulate increasing mean annual temperatures driven by retreating ice sheets and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. This proxy-model disagreement may originate from a warm season bias in Northern Hemisphere proxy reconstructions, highlighting the need for new proxies that quantify cold season temperature, especially in Arctic regions that were devoid of continental ice sheets during the Holocene. Here, we present a new 16,000-year winter-spring temperature reconstruction derived from the unsaturation ratio of alkenones (U-3(7)K) in a continuous sedimentary sequence from Lake E5, northern Alaska. We employ a thermodynamic lake model to convert alkenone-inferred lake temperatures into winter-spring air temperature anomalies and we contextualize our proxy reconstruction with climate model output from the region. Our reconstruction shows that winter-spring temperatures warmed rapidly during the deglaciation at 16 and 14 thousand years before present and continued to warm gradually throughout the middle and late Holocene (0.12-0.28 degrees C/thousand years) in concert with regional sea surface temperature and sea ice records. Our results are consistent with climate model simulations and we attribute Holocene warming to rising winter-spring insolation, radiative forcing from rising greenhouse gas concentrations and regional feedbacks. Our reconstructed cold season warming equaled or exceeded summer cooling according to a regional synthesis of temperature records, suggesting that seasonal biases in temperature reconstructions may account for proxy-model disagreements in Holocene temperature trends from Eastern Beringia.

J	Livingstone, DM; Dokulil, MT				Livingstone, DM; Dokulil, MT			Eighty years of spatially coherent Austrian lake surface temperatures and their relationship to regional air temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Eighty years of monthly mean lake surface temperature (LST) data from eight lakes in the northern perialpine area of Austria show a high degree of coherence among lakes in all seasons and reflect much of the temporal structure of the regional air temperature. Coherence is least in winter because of the distorting effect of varying periods of ice cover. In spring, regional coherence in meteorological driving forces that are essentially uncorrelated with air temperature (e.g., geostrophic wind speed) contribute to the coherence in LST. presumably by partially determining the timing of the onset of stratification. In summer, spatial coherence in LST appears to be related directly (via the radiation balance) and/or indirectly (via air temperature) to large-scale variations in high-altitude cloud cover. Correlations of the Austrian LSTs with (1) seasonal indices of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), (2) the timing of spring ice break-up in Finland, and (3) air temperatures in northern and western Europe, suggest that from autumn to spring, spatial coherence of LST in central Europe is related to the dominance of the weather by large-scale climatic processes occurring over the North Atlantic, whereas in summer the processes responsible are more regional in nature. The influence of the NAO on LST is greatest in low-lying lakes in which periods of ice cover are infrequent and short.

A detailed study of the timing of the stages in the life cycle showed that T. v. interiores has a life cycle which differs from that of all other Corixidae. This species overwinters solely in the egg stage. Females oviposit in the late summer and all adults die in the fall. The eggs, which remain in a pre-blastokinesis stage of embryonic development until the following spring, are prevented from developing in late summer by diapause which lasts approximately 2 mo. Although diapause terminates in Oct., embryonic development does not occur in cold water during the winter months. Experimental results indicate that exposure to cold is not necessary to break diapause.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1977	7	1					31	36		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1977.tb01654.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1977.tb01654.x													WOS:A1977DC31800004

Intriguingly, a novel bloom was detected in winter 2015-2016, in which picocyanobacterial cell density increased by one order of magnitude despite lower water temperature, suggesting the possibility that "cold-water-preference" species dominate in the picocyanobacterial community. In the present study, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity of picocyanobacteria in Lake Biwa by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. We found that the picocyanobacterial community were highly diverse in Lake Biwa, with eight Synechococcus-related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in different seasons. These OTUs fell into distinct phylogenetic groups, and the majority were closely related to clusters reported previously. Notably, OTU04, detected during the winter bloom, was highly affiliated with sequences found in a variety of lakes, such as Tibetan lakes and Lake Superior, where the water bodies generally have a low trophic state and temperature, and different concentrations of total dissolved solids. Thus, we inferred that the group containing OTU04 may be a psychrotolerant lineage that is widely distributed in oligotrophic water systems with low-intermediate salinity.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2021	22	2					161	167		10.1007/s10201-020-00649-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-020-00649-5		FEB 2021											WOS:000614346900001

Throughout this period of observation, the large, thecate dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense formed an annual, late winter to early spring bloom resulting in very high standing stock levels. The dominance of these dinoflagellates has a profound impact upon the lake ecosystem. In the summer and fall the phytoplankton assemblage consisted mainly of nanoplanktonic green and blue-green algae and diatoms. Picophytoplankton, mainly picocyanobacteria, were present in low numbers during the dinoflagellate bloom but reached maximum abundance (10(5) cells.ml-1) in the epilimnion during the summer and fall. Within a given year, chlorophyll concentrations correlated well with estimates of wet weight biomass, derived from microscope counts. However, interannual averages of chlorophyll did not correlate closely with those for wet weight biomass. Both wet weight biomass and chlorophyll standing stocks fluctuated more than 2 fold from 1970 through 1989 but no extreme, long-term, continuous trend of increase or decrease was observed. Thus, phytoplankton has remained relatively stable although there has been a significant rise in the levels of summer-fall biomass since 1981. The main factor responsible for this may have been increased available phosphorus; the abundance of phytoplankton did not show any clear, long-term relation to that of herbivorous zooplankton.																			1015-1621						1992	54	2					104	127		10.1007/BF00880278	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00880278													WOS:A1992JA78300002

We first fit a basic Ricker spawner-recruit model to the lakewide biomass estimates of age-3 recruits and the corresponding spawning stock size; we then fit models for all possible combinations of the following four external variables added to the basic model: an index of salmonine predation on an alewife year-class. an index for the spring-summer water temperatures experienced by alewives during their first year in the lake, an index of the severity of the first winter experienced by alewives in the lake, and an index of lake productivity during an alewife year-class's second year in the lake. Based on an information criterion, the best model for alewife recruitment included indices of salmonine predation and spring-summer water temperatures as external variables. Our analysis corroborated the contention that a decline in alewife abundance during the 1970s and early 1980s in Lake Michigan was driven by salmonine predation. Furthermore, our findings indicated that the extraordinarily warm water temperatures during the spring and summer of 1998 probably led to a moderately high recruitment of age-3 alewives in 2001, despite abundant salmonines.

Macrozoobenthos of Danubian Lake Kugurluy (Odessa region, Ukraine)	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The taxonomic composition and quantitative characteristics of macrozoobenthos of the Danube Lake Kugurlui have been studied. In 2006-2012 on the littoral and sublittoral of the lake, 278 macrozoobenthos samples were collected. There are 172 species of Spongia, Hydrozoa, Turbellaria, Annelida, Crustacea, Insecta, Acarina, Gastropoda, Bivalvia. All species are found on the littoral, in the sublittoral - 48 species. There are 36 species new to the lake. Ponto-Caspian faunal complex is represented by 19 species. The number of species on the littoral decreased from 129 in the upper reaches to 98 in the lower reaches, in the sublittoral was within 35-37 species. On the littoral, the abundance and biomass of macrozoobenthos increased on average throughout the lake from winter to summer, in the sublittoral biomass increased from winter to autumn, the maximum number was recorded in the spring. The number was dominated by oligochaetes and chironomids, and by mollusks by biomass.																			2520-2138						2018	8	1					898	905		10.15421/2018_291	http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/2018_291													WOS:000429918700111
J	LUND, JWG				LUND, JWG			THE SEASONAL CYCLE OF THE PLANKTON DIATOM, MELOSIRA-ITALICA (EHR) KUTZ SUBSP SUBARCTICA O MULL	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The periodicity of this diatom was followed in some lakes during 2 and others during 7 1/2 consecutive years. It is most abundant between autumn and late spring, and the spring maxima are generally earlier in the shallow than in the deep lakes. A decrease in numbers usually occurs in spring before thermal stratification of the water begins, though, when it does, the alga disappears rapidly and almost completely or wholly from the water. Many filaments pass to the deposits in summer and there remain alive till they are resuspended in the water through the resumption of isothermal turbulent conditions in autumn. On and within the deposits the cells pass into a "resting stage" which can be recognized by the changes occurring in the size and shape of the chromatophores. Some cells, at least, can exist for 3 years in the dark under anaerobic conditions, but growth never occurs. It sinks fast relative to some other plankton algae which commonly accompany it. Parasitism by fungi is common but rarely causes appreciable changes in the growth of the population. Grazing by animals is also unimportant. Floods, in some lakes, lead to marked losses by outflow. Ice-cover leads to a rapid loss from the surface to the deeper layers and, eventually, to the deposits, during inverse thermal stratification. Practically nothing is known about its nutrition. Observations suggest that its growth is stopped if the concentration of available silica in the water falls to approx. 0.6 mg./l. The periodicity of the diatom is considered to be due to its relatively high sinking-rate, its inability to grow appreciably at high light intensities (and perhaps high temperatures) and its ability to remain alive on and in the deposits in the dark and under anaerobic conditions. The changes in population occurring in one season or a series of seasons may influence the size of the maxima in the next because of the importance of the resting stage in providing a reserve to live cells during summer which serve as an "inoculum" for renewed growth when thermal stratification is lost in the autumn. The ecology of other planktonic Melosirae is considered.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1954	42	1					151	+		10.2307/2256984	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2256984													WOS:A1954YD68700009

It remains unclear as to how possible toxic phytoplankton assemblages vary vertically and temporally in Swakoppoort and Von Bach dams, located in a dry subtropical desert region in central Namibia. The following variables were analyzed: pH, Secchi depths, turbidity, water temperature, total phosphorus, orthophosphate, chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton cells, and water depths. Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community in the autumn, winter and spring (dry) and summer (wet) seasons, at all the depth ranges in both dams. Microcystis dominated the vertical and temporal dynamics, followed by Dolichospermum. In the dry seasons, higher cyanobacteria cell numbers were observed in comparison to the rainy season in both dams. Spring blooms of cyanobacteria were evident in the Von Bach Dam while autumn and spring cyanobacteria blooms were observed in the Swakoppoort Dam. In the Swakoppoort Dam, the preferable depth ranges for toxic cyanobacteria species were at 5 to 10 m while in the Von Bach Dam at 0 to 5 m range. The findings of the current study indicate that the traditional selective withdrawal of water in the two dams should be performed with vertical and temporal dynamics of possible toxic cyanobacteria accounted for to aid the abstraction of water with the lowest possible toxic phytoplankton numbers, which could lower the public health risk.

In 1970-1971, the cove was meromictic with meromixis being attributed to the heavy application of deicing salts in the cove''s watershed. Application of deicing salts to roads in the Town of Irondequoit has steadily declined from > 31,000 metric tons in 1970-1971 to < 4,000 tons in 1979-1980. The resultant decrease in salt concentrations of the surface waters of the cove since 1970 is evidence of recovery from meromixis. Also, complete mixing of the water column observed during the winter of 1979-1980 suggests that the town''s "sensible salt use policy" has been a success. Cl- concentrations and conductivity in the hypolimnion during the spring, summer and autumn have remained high due to the discharge of naturally occurring salt from groundwater streams (mean annual Cl- = 303 mg/l) into the cove. The addition of naturally occurring salt into the cove currently affects mixing patterns by suppressing the autumn and spring turnover and probably affected mixing patterns in a similar manner prior to the advent of deicing operations.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1982	1	5					467	481		10.1080/02705060.1982.9664066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1982.9664066													WOS:A1982PB12900003

In this work, we highlight changes in thermal structure, stratification dynamics, and ice characteristics in the Laurentian Great Lakes (Lakes Superior, Huron, Michigan, Erie, and Ontario) as simulated between 1979 and 2021. Three-dimensional lake hydrodynamics and ice cover were modeled using the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) coupled with the Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE). Analysis revealed significant increases in surface (0.4 degrees-0.6 degrees C decade-1) and subsurface (0.1 degrees-0.4 degrees C decade-1) temperatures as well as dramatic losses in ice cover (1%-8% decade-1) and ice volume (0-3 km3 decade-1) over the last 40 years. Estimated surface heating rates were strongest during the summer and fall, while subsurface warming was most rapid during the nearly isothermal winter and spring. Intensified (decreased) summer (winter) stratification led to shifts in lake turnover dynamics, with delayed fall turnover dates (2-6 days decade-1) and earlier spring overturn dates (2-9 days decade-1). Modeled surface temperatures (LST), bottom temperatures (LBT), and annual averaged ice cover (AAIC) were used to estimate low-frequency climate signals, which were highly correlated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Warming trends fit to residual climate signals (LST: 0.1 degrees C decade-1; LBT: 0.03 degrees C decade-1; AAIC:-1% decade-1), calculated by removing low-frequency variability from the raw climate signal, were lower than those fit to associated low-frequency components, suggesting that recent climate change in the Great Lakes may be strongly infiuenced by natural multidecadal climate variability.

A trend analysis indicates a slight decreasing trend in cloud cover over the region during this time period. The trend is significant and largest (similar to 2% per decade) over the water bodies. A strong seasonal cycle of cloud cover is observed over both land and water surfaces. Winter cloud amounts are greater over the water bodies than land due to heat and moisture flux into the atmosphere. Late spring through early autumn cloud amounts are lower over the water bodies than land due to stabilization of the boundary layer by relatively cooler lake waters. The influence of the lakes on cloud cover also extends beyond their shores, affecting cloud cover and properties far down wind. Cloud amount composited by wind direction demonstrate that the increasing cloud amounts downwind of the lakes is greatest during autumn and winter. Cold air flows over relatively warm lakes in autumn and winter generate wind parallel convective cloud bands. The cloud properties of these wind parallel cloud bands over the lakes during winter are presented.

However, the dynamics of groundwater discharge in reservoirs and their impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) production and emission under different conditions remain unclear. This study focuses on a reservoir in southeastern China, where we conducted seasonal field observations alongside microcosm incubation experiments to elucidate the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and groundwater discharge. Based on the radon (222Rn) mass balance model, groundwater discharge rates were estimated to be 2.14 f 0.49 cm d- 1 in autumn, 4.04 f 2.09 cm d- 1 in winter, 2.55 f 1.32 cm d- 1 in spring, and 2.61 f 1.93 cm d- 1 in summer. Groundwater discharge contributes on average to 31.23 % of CH4, 35.65 % of CO2, and 11.26 % of N2O emissions across all seasons in the reservoir. Groundwater primarily influences GHG emissions by directly inputting carbon and nitrogen, as well as by altering aquatic chemical conditions and the environment of dissolved organic matter (DOM), exerting significant effects particularly during spring and autumn seasons. Especially, in winter, higher groundwater discharge rates influence microbial activity and environmental conditions in the water body, including the C/N ratio, which somewhat reduces its enhancement of greenhouse gas emissions. This study provides an in-depth exploration of greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs and examines the impact of groundwater on these emissions, aiming to reduce uncertainties in understanding greenhouse gas emission mechanisms and carbon and nitrogen cycling.

Using a Bayesian method developed in an earlier study (Moss et al., 1994, Water Resour. Res., 30(10): 2717-2723), probabilities of summer inflows to alpine lakes when the spring SOI is positive (La Nina conditions) are shown to be significantly larger than in springs when SOI is neutral or negative (El Nino conditions). This has major economic significance because the lakes feed hydroelectric power plants that produce typically 43% of the electrical energy used in New Zealand. The lake inflows peak in spring and summer, and use of the available controlled storage must be scheduled carefully to meet power demands that peak in winter. We hypothesise that this occurs because in springs with La Nina conditions, there is a relative absence of snow accumulation, and hence less summer snowmelt.																			0022-1694					OCT 15	1996	184	3-4					175	187		10.1016/0022-1694(95)02994-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(95)02994-X													WOS:A1996VM08400002

The total heavy metal concentrations in water samples were higher in winter and summer than in spring and autumn season, whereas in sediment they were higher in winter and summer seasons, respectively. The trend of metal mean contents found in the fish and oyster were in decreasing order of Pb > Cu > Cr > Cd and Pb > Cu > Cr > Cd, respectively. The tissues of fish and oyster captured during winter and summer accumulated a higher significant different amount of metals relative to other season, which was attributed to a higher influx of agricultural waste, sewage and sludge by heavy rainfall and floods. In addition, the pollution load index (PLI) values were above one (>1), indicating an advanced decline of the sediment quality, and contamination factor (CF) confirmed that the sediment samples were moderate to high contamination by Pb and Cr. Thus, comparative studies with seasonal pollution of heavy metals in Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu regions indicate considerable heavy metal enrichment in water, sediments as well as in various organs of fish and oyster. Finally, our results indicated that the metal concentration values increased statistically significaht different related to season (p < 0.001). The determination of heavy metal stress biomarkers in fish along with seasonal variations may serve as a convenient approach during pollution bio-monitoring programme. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, studies on the seasonal and spatial distribution of cyanobacteria in deep lakes based on high-throughput DNA sequencing are still rare. In this study, we combined monthly water sampling and monitoring in 2019, amplicon sequence variants analysis (ASVs; a proxy for different species) and quantitative PCR targeting overall cyanobacteria abundance to describe the seasonal and spatial dynamics of cyanobacteria in the deep hard-water oligo-mesotrophic Lake Tiefer See, NE Germany. We observed significant seasonal variation in the cyanobacterial community composition (p < 0.05) in the epi- and metalimnion layers, but not in the hypolimnion. In winter-when the water column is mixed-picocyanobacteria (Synechococcus and Cyanobium) were dominant. With the onset of stratification in late spring, we observed potential niche specialization and coexistence among the cyanobacteria taxa driven mainly by light and nutrient dynamics. Specifically, ASVs assigned to picocyanobacteria and the genus Planktothrix were the main contributors to the formation of deep chlorophyll maxima along a light gradient. While Synechococcus and different Cyanobium ASVs were abundant in the epilimnion up to the base of the euphotic zone from spring to fall, Planktothrix mainly occurred in the metalimnetic layer below the euphotic zone where also overall cyanobacteria abundance was highest in summer. Our data revealed two potentially psychrotolerant (cold-adapted) Cyanobium species that appear to cope well under conditions of lower hypolimnetic water temperature and light as well as increasing sediment-released phosphate in the deeper waters in summer. The potential cold-adapted Cyanobium species were also dominant throughout the water column in fall and winter. Furthermore, Snowella and Microcystis-related ASVs were abundant in the water column during the onset of fall turnover. Altogether, these findings suggest previously unascertained and considerable spatiotemporal changes in the community of cyanobacteria on the species level especially within the genus Cyanobium in deep hard-water temperate lakes.

The multi-seasonal WorldView-3 images collected in 2015 include late spring, mid-summer, early-fall, and late-fall scenes. Our analysis indicates that the overall accuracy of individual tree-based species classification is the highest when using mid-summer, followed by the late-spring image, and the early-fall image.

Yet, the impacts of the flood events on the physics and biology of fjords is still unknown. Current velocities, density, in-situ zooplankton samples, and volume backscatter (S-v) derived from an acoustic profiler were used to explore the response of circulation and zooplankton abundance in a Patagonian fjord to GLOF events in 2010 and 2014. Maximum S-v was found both during the GLOFs and in late winter to early spring of 2010 and the fall and summer of 2014. The increase in S-v in late winter and spring of 2010 corresponded to multiple zooplankton species found from in-situ net sampling. In addition, diel vertical migrations were found during this seasonal increase both qualitatively and in a spectral analysis. Concurrently with zooplankton increases, wind forcing produced a deepening of the pycnocline. Zooplankton abundance peaked in the fjord when the pycnocline depth deepened due to wind forcing and throughout the entire spring season, indicating that mixing conditions could favor secondary production. These results were corroborated by the 2014 data, which indicate that weather events in the region impact both fjord physics and ecology.					; Perez, Ivan/B-9321-2018	Valle-Levinson, Arnoldo/0000-0002-3852-0971; Ross, Lauren/0000-0001-8542-2875; , Ivan Perez-Santos/0000-0002-0184-1122; Perez, Ivan/0000-0001-5804-9761														2073-4441				JAN	2020	12	1							248	10.3390/w12010248	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12010248													WOS:000519847200248

Inter- and intra-annual variations of pCO2 and pO2 in a freshwater subtropical coastal lake	INLAND WATERS												Inland waters emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but tropical and subtropical lakes are underrepresented in current assessments. Here we present results of a 6-year study of the dynamics of surface partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen (pCO(2) and pO(2)) in a subtropical lake, Lake Peri, Brazil, to determine how temperature, rainfall, and wind moderate surface concentrations. Both pCO(2) and pO(2) tended to increase during the transitions between seasons when rainfall increased, with pCO(2) averaging 2.5-3-fold higher than atmospheric values. Occasionally during autumn/winter, pCO(2) similarly increased and pO(2) decreased. We infer that the increases in both gases during the transition periods resulted from increasing inputs of allochthonous material into the lake. Those in winter resulted from near-bottom intrusions that intermittently reach the depth of measurement. In autumn/winter, pCO(2) was 3-fold higher (average 1700 mu atm) compared to spring/summer (550 mu atm), whereas changes in pO(2) did not have a clear seasonal pattern. Overall median net CO2 evasion was 11 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Variability in the extent of rainfall and the associated high intra- and inter-annual variability in CO2 and CO2 emissions are in part controlled by atmospheric processes related to the South American Monsoon System and to El Nino Southern Oscillation cycles.

Changing patterns of heavy rainfall in upland areas: a case study from northern England	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												There has recently been a widespread shift in the pattern of UK rainfall towards more heavy falls of rain in winter and fewer in summer. Here, this change is examined in the context of orographic enhancement for a transect of rain gauges running across northern England from coast to coast and including both the Lake District and Pennine uplands. Gauges have been selected where very long records of daily rainfall exist; where data are missing, these have been infilled using data from nearby gauges. The very long records for Armagh and Durham are also included to provide additional context in time and space. For the upland gauges, the increase in total winter rainfall in recent decades and the simultaneous decrease in total summer rainfall are reflected in the number of heavy falls of rain, as defined using two threshold indices. The 1990s saw record numbers of heavy falls in winter and an almost complete absence of heavy summer rainfall in the uplands, in marked contrast to lowland gauges. Comparison of the rainfall record with the Lamb Weather Catalogue suggests that increased winter rainfall is related to an increase in the rainfall provided by westerly weather types. Decreased summer rainfall is related to a reduction in rainfall associated with cyclonic weather types. The results presented here underline the value of long-term monitoring and the maintenance of records from key historic sites.

During this investigation, the sources of nitrate and the hydrologic system through which it is dispersed were assessed using geochemical data and a multiple isotopic approach. The cold waters from the south and north springs originated from the deep subsurface. Isotopically, these waters exhibited relatively negative delta D and delta O-18 values and nitrate in the water was substantially depleted N-15, suggesting that the mineral water was primarily derived from depth. Lakes within the Wudalianchi region were primarily composed of water from these deep mineral springs and precipitation. Chemical fertilizers were the primary source of nitrate to the Wudalianchi lakes. Groundwater was found in shallow mineral springs and wells plotted above the local meteoric water line, implying that shallow groundwater was primarily derived from precipitation. Elevated concentrations of nitrate in shallow mineral springs and well waters during the summer, autumn, and winter suggest that shallow groundwater within the Yaoquan volcanic area was also polluted by nitrate from human activities. Denitrification of shallow groundwater is slow, reducing the potential for "self-remediation". The concentration data are supported by nitrogen (N) isotope data; wells and springs exhibited N isotopic ratios between - 5aEuro degrees and + 5aEuro degrees (typical of fertilizers and precipitation) and exhibited higher oxygen (O) isotope values than water in the Wudalianchi lakes. These relationships suggest that nitrate in shallow mineral springs, wells, and lakes near the Yaoquan volcano was derived from the mixing of chemical fertilizers with local summer rainfall.

Human persecution during migration and habitat loss at stopover and wintering sites are commonly regarded as most serious threats. However, little is known about seasonal movements, migration routes, and wintering sites of the bar-headed geese from Kyrgyzstan, which represent the westernmost geographical population of the species. As part of a conservation project, which also included reinforcement of the wild population by the release of hand-reared juveniles, in late summer of 1998, five bar-headed geese, three wild adults and two hand-reared goslings, were fitted with sun-powered satellite transmitters in order to track their movements from Lake Son Kul and Lake Chatyr Kul in Kyrgyzstan. The five individuals contributed very unevenly to the more than 5,000 signals in total that were received from the French ARGOS system: one failed after 8 weeks, while another one was tracked for more than 2 years. The four geese contributing to this study followed three completely different migration routes leading to their wintering areas in Pakistan, India and Uzbekistan, while stopover areas were situated in southern Tajikistan and in western Tibet. Both in autumn and spring the adult birds migrated distances of 1,280-1,550 km in two steps, with stopover periods of 32-46 days (autumn) and 16-23 days (spring). Flight speeds of up to 680 km per actual migration day were recorded regularly, even during crossings of very high summits. A hand-reared juvenile flew non-stop for 790 km to southern Uzbekistan and even visited southernmost Turkmenistan, where the species is very rarely seen. The timing of migration varied considerably between individuals but also for the same individual between years. We compare our tracking results with previous findings (field observations, ring recoveries, and satellite tracking results) and discuss them with respect to migration over high-mountain habitats and a general migration strategy of the species.																			2193-7192	2193-7206				JUL	2010	151	3					703	712		10.1007/s10336-010-0492-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-010-0492-1													WOS:000278836600018

Rise of Great Lakes Surface Water, Sinking of the Upper Midwest of the United States, and Viscous Collapse of the Forebulge of the Former Laurentide Ice Sheet	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Great Lakes water levels rose 0.7-1.5 m from 2013 to 2019, increasing surface water volume by 285 km(3). Solid Earth's elastic response to the increased mass load is nearly known: The Great Lakes floor fell 8-23 mm, and the adjacent land fell 3-14 mm. Correcting GPS measurements for this predicted elastic loading (1) straightens position-time series, making the evolution of position more nearly a constant velocity and (2) reduces estimates of subsidence rate in Wisconsin, Michigan, and southern Ontario by 0.5-2 mm/yr, improving constraints on postglacial rebound. GPS records Wisconsin and Michigan to have subsided at 1-4 mm/yr. We find this sinking to be produced primarily by viscous collapse of the former Laurentide ice sheet forebulge and secondarily by elastic Great Lakes loading. We infer water on land in the Great Lakes watershed to be total water change observed by GRACE minus Great Lakes surface water smeared by a Gaussian distribution. Water stored on land each year reaches a maximum in March, 6 months before Great Lakes water levels peak in September. The seasonal oscillation of water on land in the Great Lakes basin, 100 km(3) (0.20 m water thickness), is twice that in a hydrology model. In the seasons, groundwater in the Great Lakes watershed increases by 60 km(3) (0.12 m) each autumn and winter and decreases by roughly an equivalent amount each spring and summer. In the long term, groundwater volume remained constant from 2004 to 2012 but increased by 50 km(3) (0.10 m) from 2013 to 2019.

Seasonal variation of behavior and brain size in a freshwater fish	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Teleost fishes occupy a range of ecosystem, and habitat types subject to large seasonal fluctuations. Temperate fishes, in particular, survive large seasonal shifts in temperature, light availability, and access to certain habitats. Mobile species such as lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) can behaviorally respond to seasonal variation by shifting their habitat deeper and further offshore in response to warmer surface water temperatures during the summer. During cooler seasons, the use of more structurally complex nearshore zones by lake trout could increase cognitive demands and potentially result in a larger relative brain size during those periods. Yet, there is limited understanding of how such behavioral responses to a seasonally shifting environment might shape, or be shaped by, the nervous system. Here, we quantified variation in relative brain size and the size of five externally visible brain regions in lake trout, across six consecutive seasons in two different lakes. Acoustic telemetry data from one of our study lakes were collected during the study period from a different subset of individuals and used to infer relationships between brain size and seasonal behaviors (habitat use and movement rate). Our results indicated that lake trout relative brain size was larger in the fall and winter compared with the spring and summer in both lakes. Larger brains coincided with increased use of nearshore habitats and increased horizontal movement rates in the fall and winter based on acoustic telemetry. The telencephalon followed the same pattern as whole brain size, while the other brain regions (cerebellum, optic tectum, olfactory bulbs, and hypothalamus) were only smaller in the spring. These findings provide evidence that flexibility in brain size could underpin shifts in behavior, which could potentially subserve functions associated with differential habitat use during cold and warm seasons and allow fish to succeed in seasonally variable environments.					; Laberge, Frederic/V-7773-2019; Fernandes, Timothy/AAC-3661-2020; Laberge, Frederic/C-2280-2013	Fernandes, Timothy/0000-0001-6277-5619; Middel, Trevor/0000-0002-8390-1220; McMeans, Bailey/0000-0002-9793-6811; Versteeg, Evan/0000-0001-7800-3496; Laberge, Frederic/0000-0002-2469-9720													2045-7758					NOV	2021	11	21					14950	14959		10.1002/ece3.8179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8179		SEP 2021						34765152					WOS:000702141700001

In Monoporeia affinis, which is more active and has a higher respiration rate, lipid levels were low in winter and early spring, rose to 27% of the dry mass in late summer, then declined in autumn. In Pontoporeia femorata, which regulates its oxygen consumption, lipid levels were 20-23% of the dry mass. In October, maturing male P. femorata had a significantly lower lipid content than females. Triacylglycerol and phospholipid accounted for approximately 90% of lipids. Phospholipid dominated in M. affinis in March, but triacylglycerol accumulated and became the main lipid after the spring bloom. Triacylglycerol was always the main lipid in P. femorata. but also accumulated after the spring diatom bloom. Both species seem to assimilate and store food resources from the diatom bloom. The higher feeding rate of M. affinis may explain its greater accumulation of lipid. Lower metabolic costs in P. femorata may allow it to maintain steady lipid levels for most of the year.																			0024-3590					SEP	1992	37	6					1280	1289		10.4319/lo.1992.37.6.1280	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.6.1280													WOS:A1992KR91400012
J	Lehtonen, KK				Lehtonen, KK			Ecophysiology of the benthic amphipod Monoporeia affinis in an open-sea area of the northern Baltic Sea: Seasonal variations in oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion	MARINE BIOLOGY												Seasonal variations in the oxygen uptake rate (VO2) and ammonia excretion rate (VNH4+) of the benthic deposit-feeding amphipod Monoporeia affinis were studied in an open-sea population of the northern Baltic Sea during three consecutive years (1991 to 1993). In the early summer an increase in the weight-specific VO2 by 22% (''standard'' 1-mg individual) was registered; an even more striking change was noted in the VNH4+ which showed an increase in the early summer of ca. six times the extremely low winter/spring values. The metabolic changes observed could not be attributed to temperature, which remained at steady-state throughout the year, nor could seasonal variations in the biochemical composition of the amphipods explain the results. Therefore, it is evident that quality-food abundance following the sedimentation of the spring phytoplankton bloom induces the observed early-summer elevations in VO2 and VNH4+. In turn, the marked decrease in the VNH+4 towards autumn reflects the gradual depletion of quality-food in the benthic environment. Atomic O:N ratios indicated that, at the sampling location, M. affinis uses lipid almost exclusively for metabolic energy throughout the year, except in early summer when the use of lipid and protein was observed to be almost equal. Results also indicated a time-lag between sedimentation of the phytoplankton bloom and metabolic response in the amphipod population.

Exploring long-term trends in microcystin toxin values associated with persistent harmful algal blooms in Grand Lake St Marys	HARMFUL ALGAE												High external nutrient loads from agricultural runoff have led to persistent and highly toxic algal blooms in Grand Lake St Marys (GLSM) for decades. These pervasive blooms are concurrent with long-term (2009 - 2021) toxin and environmental monitoring, providing a robust weekly dataset for modeling microcystins. Median weekly microcystin concentrations (23.2 mu g/L) routinely exceeded World Health Organization recreational limits (20 mu g/L) for the study period (ranged 0.03 -185.0 mu g/L). Here, we used a Bayesian hierarchical dynamic linear model to hindcast weekly microcystin toxins using external nutrient loads from tributary data as well as internal lake nutrient and physicochemical concentrations. Overall, lake TN was the biggest driver of microcystin con-centration in GLSM. Likewise, TN:TP was a strong negative driver of microcystin (i.e. low N:P ratios align with lower total microcystins), suggesting that N availability directly impacts toxins. External nutrient loading was positively related to microcystin during winter and spring; however, there was no relationship detected between toxin and external loading during summer or fall (particulate phosphorus exhibited the strongest signal but all external nutrients were unsurprisingly correlated). This lack of direct correlation on a weekly timescale between external loads and cyanobacterial toxins during the summer months likely results from nutrient saturation and reflects the importance of internal loading for bloom maintenance as supported by the correlation between in -lake TN and microcystin. Thus, management goals to reduce the highest biomass and toxins in the summer should focus on reduction of winter and spring external nutrient loads. Supporting this, both 2010 and 2021 had lower rain in the first half of the year (winter/spring), resulting in less loading, and experienced smaller/later low toxicity blooms. This suggests that, although internal nutrient loads are important for bloom maintenance, reduced external loads are an effective management strategy even in nutrient saturated systems such as GLSM.

Ski Areas affect Pacific Marten Movement, Habitat Use, and Density	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Alpine ski recreation is one of the most popular outdoor winter sports globally but often involves habitat modification and dense human activity, both of which can harm wildlife. We investigated the effects of ski area development and winter recreation activities on movement, occupancy, and density of Pacific martens (Martes caurina) in the Lake Tahoe region of California and Nevada, USA by comparing 3 ski and 3 control study areas. We systematically surveyed martens using live traps and hair snares during spring-summer and winter seasons from 2009 through 2011 to identify how martens responded to the year-round effects of habitat fragmentation from ski area development and the seasonal effects of winter recreation activities. Martens selectively moved between remnant forest patches with the shortest crossing distances across open, non-forested ski runs in both seasons, with the effect more pronounced in females. Overall, habitat connectivity was reduced by 41% in ski areas compared to habitat not fragmented by ski runs. During spring-summer, occupancy rates were not different between habitat within or outside of ski operations areas. During winter, however, occupancy was significantly lower inside (52%) ski area boundaries than outside (88%) them. Reduced detection probability in ski areas indicated martens also reduced the frequency of use of operations areas in winter. Using spatially explicit capture-recapture models, we found that marten density did not differ between ski areas and controls during spring, but during winter female density declined at ski areas by 63% compared to spring-summer and was < 50% of female density compared to controls. This suggests that females seasonally avoid habitat in ski areas by shifting their habitat use to areas outside ski operations boundaries during winter. Although male marten density did not differ, the lack of resident males > 3 years old coupled with higher annual turnover rates suggests male densities at ski areas may be reliant on annual male immigration. In winter, martens avoided using habitat in ski operations areas when recreation activity was greatest. Winter ski recreation may not be incompatible with marten use of habitat in ski areas, but habitat fragmentation from ski areas affects marten movement and recreation activities affect seasonal habitat occupancy and female density. Maintaining functional habitat connectivity, via networks of short ski run crossings that link habitat in and out of ski areas, will be important for maintaining or improving marten use of remnant habitat in developed ski areas.

The most frequent and longest wintering (from autumn to the end of Aug. of the next vegetative season) was observed in the case of larvae of Triturus alpestris (Laur.) and T. montandoni (Bingr), which subsequently underwent metamorphosis. Larvae of T. vulgaris (L.) showed the shortest wintering period (to Nov. 5th) and died before completing metamorphosis. During the observations the larvae of T. cristatus (Laur.) did not winter at all. The number of wintering larvae in different lakes ranged from several dozen to about 3000, but only a few to a few dozen survived until the next spring. The wintering larvae, 23-50 mm in length, were at the stage of maximum development and initial metamorphosis. The wintering of the larvae was caused mainly by climatic factors; their ability to survive until next spring and metamorphose also depended on other ecological factors.																			0015-5497	1734-9168					1983	31	1					79	+																WOS:A1983QW62900010
J	Yang, CY; Ye, HB; Tang, SL				Yang, Chaoyu; Ye, Haibin; Tang, Shilin			Seasonal Variability of Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient in the Pearl River Estuary from Long-Term Remote Sensing Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												We evaluated six empirical and semianalytical models of the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) using an in situ dataset collected in the Pearl River estuary (PRE). A combined model with the most accurate performance (correlation coefficient,R-2= 0.92) was selected and applied for long-term estimation from 2003 to 2017. Physical and biological processes in the PRE over the 14-year period were investigated by applying satellite observations (MODIS/Aqua data) and season-reliant empirical orthogonal function analysis (S-EOF). In winter, the averageK(d)(490) was significantly higher than in the other three seasons. A slight increasing trend was observed in spring and summer, whereas a decreasing trend was observed in winter. In summer, a tongue with a relatively highK(d)(490) was found in southeastern Lingdingyang Bay. In Eastern Guangdong province (GDP), the relatively higherK(d)(490) value was found in autumn and winter. Based on the second mode of S-EOF, we found that the higher values in the eastern GDP extended westward and formed a distinguishable tongue in winter. The grey relational analysis revealed that chlorophyll-a concentration (C-chla) and total suspended sediment concentration (C-tsm) were two dominant contributors determining the magnitude ofK(d)(490) values. TheC(tsm)-dominated waters were generally located in coastal and estuarine turbid waters; theC(chla)-dominated waters were observed in open clear ocean. The distribution of constituents-dominated area was different in the four seasons, which was affected by physical forces, including wind field, river runoff, and sea surface temperature.																				2072-4292				JUL	2020	12	14							2269	10.3390/rs12142269	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12142269													WOS:000557537300001

There were typical vernal and autumnal maxima, and winter and summer minima. The maxima ranged from 1234 x 106 [gamma]3/l. to 2123 x 106 [gamma]3/l. Comparisons with results reported from the western basin of Lake Erie indicate a much smaller productivity for the central basin. Changes of the phytophankton content of the water could not be correlated closely with such simple environmental conditions as temperature or turbidity alone. Diatoms constituted practically 100% of the phytoplankton in winter and spring. In fall proportionately greater quantities of green and blue-grass algae appeared, but diatoms always dominated.

As water temperature increases as a result of climate change, quantitative information on the thermal requirements of these three species is essential so that potential problems can be anticipated by those responsible for the conservation and sustainable management of the fisheries and the maintenance of biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems. Part I compares the temperature limits for survival, feeding and growth. Salmo salar has the highest temperature tolerance, followed by S. trutta and finally S. alpinus. For all three species, the temperature tolerance for alevins is slightly lower than that for parr and smolts, and the eggs have the lowest tolerance; this being the most vulnerable life stage to any temperature increase, especially for eggs of S. alpinus in shallow water. There was little evidence to support local thermal adaptation, except in very cold rivers (mean annual temperature < 6 center dot 5 degrees C). Part II illustrates the importance of developing predictive models, using data from a long-term study (1967-2000) of a juvenile anadromous S. trutta population. Individual-based models predicted the emergence period for the fry. Mean values over 34 years revealed a large variation in the timing of emergence with c. 2 months between extreme values. The emergence time correlated significantly with the North Atlantic Oscillation Index, indicating that interannual variations in emergence were linked to more general changes in climate. Mean stream temperatures increased significantly in winter and spring at a rate of 0 center dot 37 degrees C per decade, but not in summer and autumn, and led to an increase in the mean mass of pre-smolts. A growth model for S. trutta was validated by growth data from the long-term study and predicted growth under possible future conditions. Small increases (< 2 center dot 5 degrees C) in winter and spring would be beneficial for growth with 1 year-old smolts being more common. Water temperatures would have to increase by c. 4 degrees C in winter and spring, and 3 degrees C in summer and autumn before they had a marked negative effect on trout growth.

Materials and Methods: From autumn 1990 to summer 1991 artificial substrates were submerged in an unpolluted mountain stream. The parallel oriented glass slides (against the surface) were placed 10 cm beneath the wafer surface (protected from debris) and exposed to different current velocities (10-30 cm s(-1), 40-60 cm s(-1) and 80-100 cm s(-1)). The samples were collected seasonally. To define diatom colonization, a nonlinear regressive analysis of empirical data was performed. Results: A total of 71 diatom species were found. Species Cocconeis placentula, Surirella ovata, Gomphonema olivaceum, and Navicula gracilis were the most abundant, depending on different current velocity. Conclusions: The time needed for reaching the equilibrium Progressively, increased with the current velocity (F=16.7; P<0.01). In the summer and autumn, the time needed for the stabilization of diatom flora was longer than in spring and winter Concerning species abundance, Cocconeis placentula, and Navicula gracilis were independent of the current velocity, while Surirella ovata was abundant at lower (130 cm s(-1)) and Gomphonema olivaceum at higher (160 cm s(-1)) current velocities.

Year-class formation of upper St. Lawrence River northern pike	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Variables associated with year-class formation in upper St. Lawrence River northern pike Esox lucius were examined to explore population trends. A partial least-squares (PLS) regression model (PLS 1) was used to relate a year-class strength index (YCSI; 1974-1997) to explanatory variables associated with spawning and nursery areas (seasonal water level and temperature and their variability, number of ice days, and last day of ice presence). A second model (PLS 2) incorporated four additional ecological variables: potential predators (abundance of double-crested cormorants Phalacrocorax auritus and yellow perch Perca flavescens), female northern pike biomass (as a measure of stock-recruitment effects), and total phosphorus (productivity). Trends in adult northern pike catch revealed a decline (1981-2005), and year-class strength was positively related to catch per unit effort (CPUE; R-2 = 0.58). The YCSI exceeded the 23-year mean in only 2 of the last 10 years. Cyclic patterns in the YCSI time series (along with strong year-classes every 4-6 years) were apparent, as was a dampening effect of amplitude beginning around 1990. The PLS I model explained over 50% of variation in both explanatory variables and the dependent variable, YCSI first-order moving-average residuals. Variables retained (N = 10: Wold's statistic >= 0.8) included negative YCSI associations with high summer water levels, high variability in spring and fall water levels, and variability in fall water temperature. The YCSI exhibited positive associations with high spring, summer, and fall water temperature, variability in spring temperature, and high winter and spring water level. The PLS 2 model led to positive YCSI associations with phosphorus and yellow perch CPUE and a negative correlation with double-crested cormorant abundance. Environmental variables (water level and temperature) are hypothesized to regulate northern pike YCSI cycles, and dampening in YCSI magnitude may be related to a combination of factors, including wetland habitat changes, reduced nutrient loading, and increased predation by double-crested cormorants.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				MAY	2007	27	2					481	491		10.1577/M05-081.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M05-081.1													WOS:000246970200011

Winter dynamics in lake trophic status are rarely evaluated, yet they could vary drastically from the more commonly sampled summer patterns. This represents a key blindspot in our knowledge because ice sheets affect nutrient distribution (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), light infiltration (translucency), and phytoplankton propagation (Chl-a concentration). We examined long-term (2011-2020) changes in the trophic status (trophic level index; TLI) of Lake Wuliangsuhai, a shallow lake situated in a cold and arid region, using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The results suggested a significant decrease in eutrophication of Wuliangsuhai Lake over the study period, with TLI decreasing from 61.7 (moderately eutrophic) in 2011 to 49.9 (mesotrophic) in 2020. TLI was significantly higher over winter (p < 0.05), with the rank of seasons in terms of TLI of: winter (58.7) > summer (54.7) > autumn (54.2) > spring (54.0). TLI of the ice-covered period (58.7) significantly exceeded that of the ice-free period (54.3) (p < 0.05). There were also significant spatial differences in TLI (p < 0.05). Factors driving the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in lake trophic levels included the water supplement, water depth, water temperature, external inputs of nutrients, hydrodynamic conditions (flow velocity), distribution of phragmites, and the location of the main diversion channel.

Lake Kus (Manyas Golu), an important bird conservation area, was sampled in the summer, autumn, winter and spring of 1997, and the seasonal and spatial distributions of ostracods: were investigated. Many of the taxa collected are useful indicator species for monitoring conditions within lake basins. 2. The findings suggest that the L. Kus ecosystem is already substantially degraded. Pollution, coupled with extensive water abstraction for irrigation, have damaged the value of the lake, both commercially (as an inland waters fishery), and as an important site for wetland bird conservation. 3. This work shows that ostracod faunal analysis has value in the study of such sites, particularly where more formal physical, chemical and biological monitoring methods are inappropriate or unavailable.

We investigated how the water level of the lagoon where cranes roost, precipitation, and air temperature might have influenced the species' migration and wintering patterns in this area between 1973 and 2018. Over the study period, the mean annual air temperature increased at 0.3 degrees C per decade. Simultaneously, cranes advanced the spring peak migration date at a rate of 0.37 days/year. Water level and rainfall during spring were also positively correlated with the date of spring migration peak. Because cranes need shallow water to roost, and must drink water from streams because the lagoon is saline, these correlations suggest that low water levels at roosting sites and drinking water shortage may have further accelerated the onset of northward spring migration. The water level was also positively correlated with peak crane numbers in autumn, suggesting that the roosting capacity of the lagoon may limit numbers of cranes that can stopover in the area. We conclude that global warming, variations in the water level of the lagoon, and precipitation during spring have determined changes in the use of Gallocanta as a staging and wintering area by Common Cranes during the last decades. Because climatic models predict further decreases in rainfall and higher temperatures in the area, further advances in the migration phenology of cranes should be expected, which might also have implications for the conservation and management of the species and the study area.					; Alonso, Juan Carlos/C-9974-2012; Macías, José/ABG-7616-2020; Bautista-Sopelana, Luis M./B-1735-2008; Bautista-Sopelana, Luis/B-1735-2008; Alonso, Juan/C-9974-2012; Causape, Jesus/G-6906-2015	Orellana Macias, Jose Maria/0000-0003-2695-2766; Alonso, Juan Carlos/0000-0003-0450-7434; Bautista-Sopelana, Luis M./0000-0002-1503-652X; Causape, Jesus/0000-0002-3037-4340													1712-6568					JUN	2020	15	1							16	10.5751/ACE-01565-150116	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-01565-150116													WOS:000550365900016

Seven global climate model (GCM) outputs from Phase Five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were used to generate 50-year (2015-2064) future climate scenarios. GCM outputs predict an increase in winter precipitation in the watershed and the maximum and minimum daily temperatures to rise by more than 1 degrees C in the fall and spring. Compared to the baseline scenario (1964-2014), the results showed that increased winter air temperature reduced the amount of snowfall, which eventually decreased the basin average snowmelt runoff by more than 70%. With the increase in winter rainfall, the mean annual streamflow in the basin increases by 6.7%, but peak streamflow shifts from mid-March to early February. Winter flood frequency as well as summer extreme low flow frequency are projected to increase. Therefore, future challenges in the watershed will be to balance the seasonal effects of climate change.

A series of trap lines was set to determine patterns and possible causes of seasonal migration. During summer and autumn, the peak bathymetric distribution of crayfish was in shallow, near-shore waters. In autumn, with decreases in both water temperature and daily solar radiation, the adult population migrated into deeper waters. This migration is probably an adaptation of the species to avoid winter storms that cause high rates of mortality among members of the population remaining in shallow water. As is typical with many other invertebrates living in an environment with large temperature variation. P. leniusculus shows peak activity during the warmer summer season and very low activity during the winter months. Diel activity was directly related to the length of the dark interval with even a small amount of light (e.g., moonlight) reducing the activity period of the population.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1977	97	2					280	292		10.2307/2425094	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425094													WOS:A1977DE81000003

Here, the contributions of nitrification and denitrification to N2O production were quantitatively assessed in the eutrophic Lake Taihu using molecular biology and isotope mapping techniques. The N2O fluxes ranged from -41.48 to 28.84 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) in the lake, with lower N2O concentrations being observed in spring and summer and significantly higher N2O emissions being observed in autumn and winter. The 15N site preference and relevant isotopic evidence demonstrated that denitrification contributed approximately 90% of the lake's gross N2O production during summer and autumn, 27-83% of which was simultaneously eliminated via N2O reduction. Surprisingly, nitrification seemed to act as a key process promoting N2O production and contributing to the lake as a source of N2O emissions. A combination of N2O isotopocule-based approaches and molecular techniques can be used to determine the precise characteristics of microbial N2O production and consumption in eutrophic lakes. The results of this study provide a basis for accurately assessing N2O emissions from lakes at the regional and global scales.

Each season (spring, summer, and autumn) gill nets were randomly placed at littoral and limnetic sites and fished for approximately 24 h. Gill nets were allowed to fish for approximately 24 h. At Lake Kampeska, 811 fishes were collected representing 16 species; statistical analyses were completed for five species. A total of 2,881 fishes was collected at Lake Enemy Swim with analyses completed for seven species. Significant(P<0.05) differences between littoral and limnetic gill net catch rates were identified during the spring at Lake Kampeska for walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni). At Lake Enemy Swim, significant differences between littoral and limnetic sites occurred for yellow perch (spring and autumn) and rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) (summer). Differences between median lengths of littoral and limnetic caught fishes were identified for white sucker at Lake Kampeska and yellow perch and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) at Lake Enemy Swim. Significant seasonal differences in gill net catch rates and median lengths were identified at both lakes.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				SEP	2000	15	3					353	362		10.1080/02705060.2000.9663753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2000.9663753													WOS:000088709800007

Samples were collected for analysis during spring, summer and autumn for a period of two years. We identified 13 phytoplankton functional groups (Lo, S1, H1, P, C, MP, X3, Y, X2, W1, J, F, and T) among 37 species out of which 7 groups Lo, H1, P, C, MP, X2, and F were dominant. The biomass of phytoplankton functional groups in the Lake exhibited a strong seasonal variation with the highest biomass value observed in autumn and lowest in spring. Functional groups MP, P, and C were dominant in spring when the temperatures were very low. Groups H1 and X2 were the dominant in summer corresponding to higher temperatures. In autumn groups Lo and X2 were the dominant corresponding to high levels of total phosphorus (TP). Our study revealed that alkalinity, pH, arsenic, chemical oxygen demand, and TP are the most important physical-chemical variables structuring the phytoplankton functional groups in Dali Nur Lake. Functional groups Lo and X2 were mainly influenced by TP while groups MP and P flourished better under high conditions of arsenic. This study reveals the importance of physical-chemical variables in the spatial and seasonal gradient, in structuring phytoplankton functional groups, and consequently in the assessment of environmental status of the lake.

Retrospective analysis of burn windows for fire and fuels management: an example from the Lake Tahoe Basin, California, USA	FIRE ECOLOGY												Background In fire-adapted ecosystems of the western USA, prescribed fire is an essential restoration and fuel reduction tool. There is general concern that, as the fire season lengthens, the window for conducting prescribed burns will contract unless management changes are made. This could occur because a number of conditions must be met before prescribed fire can be used in the field, and those are most common during the spring and autumn when the need for fire suppression response has been historically less. To assess patterns of potential prescribed burning feasibility, this study evaluated three conditions: (1) permission to burn as granted by air quality regulators; (2) weather within burn plan prescription; and (3) availability of operational and contingency resources. Our 21-year analysis (1999 to 2019) combines three independent datasets for a daily comparison of when prescribed fires could have been implemented (henceforth, burn windows) in the Lake Tahoe Basin (LTB) and analyzes seasonality, interannual variability, and trends. Results Burn windows were most frequent during spring, followed by autumn, with the fewest burn windows during the summer and winter. Burn windows lasting multiple days occurred infrequently. Two- to three-day burn windows did not often occur more than twice per month over the study period, and longer burn windows were very rare. Interannual variation was considerable. Finally, an abrupt increase in burn windows was detected in 2008. This was determined to be related to a methodological change by air quality regulators and not to any changes in climate or resource availability. Conclusions While this case study focuses on the LTB, the analysis was performed with readily available data and could be applied easily to other land management units, demonstrating a valuable method for planning and prioritizing fire and fuels management activities. This type of tool can also identify areas for research. For example, if there were unused burn windows during the winter and early spring-or they were projected to increase-research into the ecological impacts of winter and spring burning may allow managers to more confidently adapt to changing climate. Moreover, this analysis demonstrated that modest and reasonable regulatory changes can increase opportunities for prescribed burning.					papa, michael/A-7566-2013; Safford, Hugh/ACG-9041-2022	Striplin, Randell/0000-0002-9999-4257													1933-9747					MAY 25	2020	16	1							13	10.1186/s42408-020-00071-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s42408-020-00071-3													WOS:000535364100001
J	Brzezinski, M				Brzezinski, Marcin			Food habits of the American mink Mustela vison in the Mazurian Lakeland, Northeastern Poland	MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY												Food habits of the American mink Mustela vison were studied based on the analysis of 2364 scat samples, collected at three lakes in Northeastern Poland. The mink preyed on a wide range of prey, but two types of prey, amphibians and fish, dominated in the diet of the mink during all the seasons. Frogs, and first and foremost, the common frog Rana temporaria, were hunted by the mink, mainly from the late autumn until the early spring, and comprised up to 83.9% of the prey biomass (the multiannual average for November-December at the Majcz Wielki Lake). The most frequently eaten fish were cyprinids and percids. Seasonality of fish consumption by mink was not as well pronounced as in the case of amphibians. At the first two lakes, fish were hunted mainly in the winter and in the early spring, whereas at the third lake in the summer. The highest multiannual average share of fish in the diet of the mink was recorded in March-April at Lake Tuchlin (69.2% of the prey biomass). Crayfish, which were recorded in the diet mainly in the late spring and in the summer, comprised up to 59.6% of the prey biomass for May-June at the Majcz Wielki Lake. Birds, mammals and insects were supplementary food for the mink. During the breeding season, mink predation on waterfowl and their broods was correlated with the abundance of crested grebe Podiceps cristatus and coot Fulica atra nests in the area. The diet of individual mink varied considerably and the share of birds in the diet of the mink was related to the distance from individual mink dens to the colonies of waterfowl. In May-June, adult birds, chicks and eggs comprised up to 73.6% of the prey biomass of a female mink that inhabited a den located 100 m from the colony's edge. At all three lakes, the diet of the mink was the most diverse in the late spring and in the summer. In May-August, the values of the mink food niche breadths were about twice those noted in winter months. (c) 2007 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Sdugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS INFLUENCING CHLOROPHYLL NUTRIENT RELATIONSHIPS IN LAKES	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A model relating log chlorophyll a concentration to log epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) concentration was re-examined based on: (a) comparative and temporal studies of four stratifying Wisconsin and other highly eutrophic temperate lakes; (b) comparative summer lake surveys from Iowa and Alberta. 2. Although P-limited, deeper lakes with long hydraulic residence times and low external and internal nutrient loading in summer had summer chlorophyll a yields below model predictions based on spring and summer epilimnetic TP concentrations. 3. For lakes with summer epilimnetic TP between 30 and 80 mg m-3, chlorophyll a concentrations exceeded model predictions based on summer TP. This relationship held even for Lake Delavan, Wisconsin, where the ratio of available N to P was unfavourably low during spring turnover, and where the trans-thermocline N:P flux ratio was suboptimal for algal needs in early summer. 4. With increasing summer TP concentrations and/or increasing epilimnetic circulation depth (> 5 m), chlorophyll a concentrations fell below model predictions-independent of the potential for N-limitation. This plateauing in chlorophyll a response occurred at lower epilimnetic TP content (<c. 400 mg m-2) in lakes with elevated non-algal light extinction coefficients. Using Talling's algorithm for the 'column compensation point' (algal photosynthesis = algal respiration over diel cycle), light limitation best explains this fall-off in chlorophyll a yield. 5.

Three M. arvalis, (2 in summer and 1 in autumn) carried Ehrlichia sp. (overall prevalence = 4.1%), whereas infection was not detected in the other rodent species. We hypothesize that Ixodes ricinus (the most common tick in the region) with which the animals were heavily infested, constitutes the likely natural vector for this pathogen and that M. arvalis are its natural reservoir.

The dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the river course is an important factor affecting the aquatic environment and ecological health. However, there are shortcomings in studying the differences and quantitative contributions of river DOM in different seasons and sources. In this study, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra were used to characterize the optical properties, analyze the spatiotemporal changes, and establish the quantitative relationship between environmental factors and DOM in the inflow rivers of Baiyangdian Lake. The results showed that the relative DOM concentrations in summer and autumn were significantly higher than those in the other seasons (P < 0.001) and that the DOM source (S-R < 1) was mainly exogenous. The fluorescence abundance of protein-like substances (C1 + C2 + C3) was the highest in spring, whereas that of humus C4 was the highest in autumn. Moreover, the inflow rivers exhibited strong autogenetic characteristics (BIX > 1) throughout the year. Self-organizing maps (SOM) indicated that the main driving factors of water quality were NO3--N in spring, autumn, and winter and DO, pH, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in summer. Random forest analysis showed that the fluorescent components (C1-C4) were closely related to the migration and transformation of nitrogen, and pH and nitrogen were the main predictors of each component. The Mantel test and structural equation model (SEM) showed that temperature and NO3--N significantly influenced the DOM concentration, components, and molecular properties in different seasons. Moreover, the river source also affected the distribution mechanism of DOM in the water body. Our study comprehensively analyzed the response of DOM in inflow rivers in different seasons and water sources, providing a basis for further understanding the driving mechanisms of water quality.

J	Badzinski, SS; Petrie, SA				Badzinski, Shannon S.; Petrie, Scott A.			Diets of lesser and greater scaup during autumn and spring on the lower Great Lakes	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												We examined diets of lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and greater scaup (A. marila) during autumn 1999 and spring 2000 at 3 major stopover sites on lakes Erie, Ontario, and St. Clair in southern Ontario, Canada. Overall dietary composition did not differ between sexes in lesser or greater scaup. We also did not detect interspecific or sex-related differences in average size of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) consumed by scaup, but both species ate slightly larger zebra mussels during spring, as compared with autumn. Dietary intake of lesser scaup differed between seasons and among stopover sites. Lesser scaup generally ate more zebra mussels during spring and more gastropods and plants during autumn. Lesser scaup at Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, and Lake St. Clair, respectively, consumed more zebra mussels, nonmollusk animal matter (crustaceans and insects), and plant matter than did conspecifics at the other 2 locations. Greater scaup diets differed depending on both season and stopover site. At Lake Ontario greater scaup diets contained more zebra mussels but fewer gastropods during spring as compared with autumn, but there were no seasonal differences in consumption of those 2 food items at Lake Erie. Greater scaup at both Lake Ontario and Lake Erie did not show seasonal differences in consumption of plant matter, but autumn-staging birds at Lake Erie contained more plant matter than did autumn-staging birds at Lake Ontario. Interspecific comparisons of dietary intake of scaup staging at lakes Erie and Ontario showed that greater scaup generally ate more gastropods and plant matter than did lesser scaup, whereas lesser scaup consumed more zebra mussels than did greater scaup. Overall, our study showed that zebra mussels, gastropods, and submerged aquatic plants all currently are important foods during both autumn and spring for lesser and greater scaup staging on the lower Great Lakes (LGL). Consumption of zebra mussels by scaup is of particular concern because of the hypothesized link between scaup foraging ecology, zebra mussels, and elevated selenium burdens documented recently in scaup staging on the LGL. Thus, our findings that both scaup species generally ate more and larger zebra mussels during spring illustrates the need for further investigation into contaminant acquisition and burdens in wintering, staging, and breeding scaup, particularly those using, or originating from, the LGL region.																			2328-5540					OCT	2006	34	3					664	674		10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[664:DOLAGS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[664:DOLAGS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000242398700015
J	Harmata, AR; Podruzny, KM; Zelenak, JR; Morrison, ML				Harmata, AR; Podruzny, KM; Zelenak, JR; Morrison, ML			Passage rates and timing of bird migration in Montana	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Rates and timing of bird passage in the proposed Norris Hill Wind Resource Area (NHWRA) and vicinity in southwesteren Montana were investigated using two marine surveillance radars between August 1995 and August 1996. The scanning radar array displayed movements in a horizontal plane within 360 degrees while the vertical radar displayed altitudes of bir dr in and out of the NHWRA to the east and west. Radars were also used to record raptor movements within NHWRA in summer. Spatio-temporal profile of migration was determined by adjusting observed number of events by detection probability by radar, derived from point- and line-transect bird sampling techniques. Autumn migration was more protracted than vernal migration. Altitude of birds flying in and within 2 km east and west of NHWRA averaged 209 m in autumn and 388 m in spring. Higher altitudes in spring were a function of birds ascending after leaving Ennis Lake, whereas birds were descending to visit the lake in autumn. More birds passed over valleys and swales than high points. Passage rate decreased with declining barometric trend in autumn (headwinds), but the reverse was true in spring (tailwinds).																			0003-0031					JAN	2000	143	1					30	40		10.1674/0003-0031(2000)143[0030:PRATOB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2000)143[0030:PRATOB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000084690600002

Several bivalve specimens were sampled monthly at two different sampling sites of Lake Maggiore (N. Italy): Baveno, located in the main bay of the lake, and Pallanza (Villa Taranto), below one of the largest Italian botanical gardens. We used U elongatulus only to test the available methods because it was less suitable than Zebra mussel in the field studies due to the few specimens (3-10) found in each sampling station and the consequent high intra-specific variability recorded. A close relation between AChE activity in D. polymorpha and the period of sampling was noticed, with a clear difference between results obtained during the autumn-winter season and those measured in spring and summer: AChE activity measured in the former period was very similar in all the specimens collected at the two sampling sites (7-9% of difference), while activity measured in Pallanza specimens from early spring to summer was much lower (32-66%) than that of Baveno.

Oxygen dynamics in permafrost thaw lakes: Anaerobic bioreactors in the Canadian subarctic	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Permafrost thaw lakes occur in high abundance across the subarctic landscape but little is known about their limnological dynamics. This study was undertaken to evaluate the hourly, seasonal, and depth variations in oxygen concentration in three thaw lakes in northern Quebec, Canada, across contrasting permafrost regimes (isolated, sporadic, and discontinuous). All lakes were well stratified in summer despite their shallow depths (2.7-4.0 m), with hypoxic or anoxic bottom waters. Continuous automated measurements in each of the lakes showed a period of water column oxygenation over several weeks in fall followed by bottom-water anoxia soon after ice-up. Anoxic conditions extended to shallower depths (1 m) over the course of winter, beginning 18-137 d after ice formation, depending on the lake. Full water column anoxia extended over 33-75% of the annual record. There was a brief period of incomplete spring mixing with partial or no reoxygenation of the bottom waters in each lake. Conductivity measurements showed the build-up of solutes in the bottom waters, and the resultant density increase contributed to the resistance to full mixing in spring. These observations indicate the prevalence of stratified conditions throughout most of the year and underscore the importance of the fall mixing period for gas exchange with the atmosphere. Given the long duration of anoxia, subarctic thaw lakes represent an ideal environment for anaerobic processes such as methane production. The intermittent oxygenation also favors intense methanotrophy and aerobic bacterial decomposition processes.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Matveev, Alex/H-7380-2017	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Matveev, Alex/0000-0003-4103-9131													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2015	60	5					1656	1670		10.1002/lno.10126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10126													WOS:000362227500014
J	BAYLY, IAE				BAYLY, IAE			ECOLOGY OF THE ZOOPLANKTON OF A MEROMICTIC ANTARCTIC LAGOON WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO DREPANOPUS-BISPINOSUS (COPEPODA, CALANOIDA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The zooplankton of Burton Lake, a meromictic lagoon with a tenuous connection to Crooked Fjord near Davis, Antarctica, was studied during the summer of 1981, when the lake was still ice-covered. Sampling occurred through a 10 cm diameter ice-hole. A plankton pump was used to investigate vertical changes in population density. A newly designed collapsible net was hauled vertically through the entire oxylimnion (6.5 m thick) to examine temporal changes in population structure and in the species composition of the zooplanktonic community. Four metazoan species occurred in the zooplankton: Drepanopus bispinosus and Paralabidocera antarctica (Copepoda), Rathkea lizzioides (Anthomedusae) and a cydippid ctenophore. Except for R. lizzioides, the lower limit of the vertical distributions occurred precisely at the oxycline at a depth of 8.15 m. The densities of both R. lizzioides and the ctenophore were low throughout the depth range 5.0-7.25 m and considerably higher above and below this stratum. The density of R. lizzioides increased greatly in a downward direction starting about 35 cm above the oxycline, and many individuals were capable of making excursions of about 10 cm downward past the chemocline into anoxic water. D. bispinosus had a more even vertical distribution than the medusa and ctenophore, but densities were higher in that portion of the oxylimnion lying below 6.0 m than above. The vertical distributions of R. lizzioides and D. bispinosus were stable over 24 h, but vertical migration occurred in that portion of the ctenophore population located above the low-density stratum. P. antarctica occurred in very small numbers. The ctenophore was uniformly distributed horizontally, but significant horizontal differences (among four stations) in mean vertical density occurred in adult D. bispinosus and R. lizzioides. The lowest density of D. bispinosus occurred at the station with the highest density of R. lizzioides. In early summer (11 December 1981), the mean densities of zooplankters within that portion of the oxylimnion overlying the anoxylimnion were D. bispinosus 550 m-3, ctenophore 410 m-3 and R. lizzioides 230 m-3. Throughout summer the absolute density and relative community proportion of R. lizzioides fell continuously, and these measures showed a comparable decline for adult D. bispinosus (almost entirely females). At the same time there was a consistent increase in the numbers of immature D. bispinosus. The density and community percentage of the ctenophore remained high (ca. 480 m-3 and 44%, respectively) throughout December and early January, but declined thereafter. D. bispinosus is univoltine. Mature males appear in late autumn and mating occurs mainly in early winter, when significant numbers of mature females first appear. The species overwinters as adults, and ovigerous females first appear in midwinter. Males are short-lived and are already rare by the end of winter. Stage I nauplii are present in early spring, and naupliar development continues throughout spring and into early summer in company with an almost entirely female adult population. Stage I copepodites first appear in December and reach peak numbers in January. The last of the adult females from the previous winter disappear by late summer, but development of the immature copepodites continues into autumn. Females may store sperm for up to six months.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 30	1986	140	3					199	231		10.1007/BF00007436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007436													WOS:A1986E820400002

Considerable differences between the two populations wer observed as to seasonal occurrence, clutch size, body size and number of diapausing individuals. In Gronne, Cyclops vicinus is a summer form. The main period of reproduction occurred from June to October. diapause started in Jul/August and lasted to March of the following years. number of diapausing C4 stages was low. In professoren-Weiher the population maxima appeared in spring and autumn/winter. Body size and clutch size of females were considerably lower than in Gronne and both parameters showed almost no seasonal fluctuations. Abundances of Cyclops vicinus were low during summer, as development of copepodites was retarded and the greater part of C4 stages descended for diapause. Diapause in May/June an lasted to October/November. Number of diapausing copepodites was very high. Available evidence indicates that differences between the two populations are the response to different predation pressure by fish.																			0003-9136					APR	1989	115	2					203	219																WOS:A1989U682400003

Spatial distributions of predator and prey were measured along a cross-lake transect during spring, summer, and fall with a 120-kHz, dual-beam acoustic system. A geographic information system provided the platform to create high-resolution maps of observed acoustic (prey and predator biomass densities), biological (energetic parameters), and physical (temperature) variables, and to model salmonine growth rate potential in a spatially explicit context. Predators and prey occupied only a small percentage of the available habitat: 0.3-14.7% and 8.7-25.9%, respectively. A range of 3% to 27% of the habitat sampled, depending on the species and season, was able to support positive salmonine growth. Predator distributional overlap with regions of positive growth potential was nearly 50% in summer, 72% in fall, and 71% in spring for chinook salmon and 58% in summer, 77% in fall, and 72% in spring for lake trout. Predator overlap with prey was slightly higher (about 1-12%) than that of positive growth rate regions. We contend that spatially explicit bioenergetic models are useful tools for examining habitat use, predator-prey interactions, and ecosystem production in such spatially complex aquatic systems.																			0002-8487					SEP	1993	122	5					870	883		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0870:SMOSGR>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0870:SMOSGR>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993MJ44000019

Elevated Streamflows Increase Dam Passage by Juvenile Coho Salmon during Winter: Implications of Climate Change in the Pacific Northwest	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												A 4-year evaluation was conducted to determine the proportion of juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch passing Cowlitz Falls Dam, on the Cowlitz River, Washington, during winter. River and reservoir populations of coho salmon parr were monitored using radiotelemetry to determine if streamflow increases resulted in increased downstream movement and dam passage. This was of interest because fish that pass downstream of Cowlitz Falls Dam become landlocked in Riffe Lake and are lost to the anadromous population. Higher proportions of reservoir-released fish (0.3910.480) passed Cowlitz Falls Dam than did river-released fish (0.0370.119). Event-time analyses demonstrated that streamflow increases were important predictors of dam passage rates during the study. The estimated effect of increasing streamflows on the risk of dam passage varied annually and ranged from 9% to 75% for every 28.3m3/s increase in streamflow. These results have current management implications because they demonstrate the significance of dam passage by juvenile coho salmon during winter months when juvenile fish collection facilities are typically not operating. The results also have future management implications because climate change predictions suggest that peak streamflow timing for many watersheds in the Pacific Northwest will shift from late spring and early summer to winter. Increased occurrence of intense winter flood events is also expected. Our results demonstrate that juvenile coho salmon respond readily to streamflow increases and initiate downstream movements during winter months, which could result in increased passage at dams during these periods if climate change predictions are realized in the coming decades.

The objective was to reconstruct the ecohydrologic, vegetation, and fire history of the watershed for the last 2650 years to better understand past climate variations at the forest-steppe transition. The data suggest a period of limited bottom-water anoxia, relatively wet winters, and cool springs and summers from 2650 to 2100 cal yr BP (700-150 BC). Dry warm conditions occurred between 2100 and 850-800 cal yr BP (150 BC and AD 1100-1150), when the lake was anoxic, winter precipitation was low, and summer stratification was protracted. The data are consistent with overall warmer/drier conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, although they suggest a shift towards wetter winters within that period. The period from 850 to 800 cal yr BP (AD 1100-1150) to 250 cal yr BP (AD 1700) was characterized by greater water-column mixing and cooler spring/summer conditions than before. In addition, fire activity shifted towards infrequent large events and pollen production was low. From 250 to 150 cal yr BP (AD 1700-1800), winter precipitation was moderate compared to previous conditions, and the lake was again stratified, suggesting warm summers. Between 150 and 42 cal yr BP (AD 1800-1908), winter precipitation increased and spring and summer conditions became moderate. Metal pollution, probably from regional mining operations, is evident in the 1870s. Large fires occurred between ca. 1800-1880, but in general the forests were more closed than before. The Crevice Lake record suggests that the last 150 years of Yellowstone's environmental history were characterized by intermediate conditions when compared with the previous 2500 years.

We studied palmetto bass (male white bass M. chrysops x female striped bass) population dynamics and seasonal movements from 2005 to 2007 at Monroe Lake, a 4,350-ha flood control impoundment in south-central Indiana. Palmetto bass were collected, measured, and aged using otoliths to assess growth and mortality. Thirty fish were tagged with radio tags in April 2006 to determine seasonal movements and distributions for 1 year. Oxygen and temperature profiles were measured throughout the year to determine available habitat. Total annual mortality was 32% (+/- 5%). Catch-curve residuals were modeled against the number of fish stocked to investigate recruitment variability. More than 95% of the variation in year-class strength was explained by the number of age-0 fish (25-50 mm total length) stocked in early summer. We determined that optimal stocking rates were between 12 and 23 fish/ha. Fish moved more during spring (501 m/d) than other seasons (109-220 m/d). Fish were concentrated in the lower basin of the lake during summer and in the upper basin during winter. Based on minimum habitat suitability index values for temperature and dissolved oxygen, there was no optimal habitat available in winter or spring. The volume of optimal habitat increased to 22% of the lake during summer and 47% in fall. Based on our evaluation of population dynamics, seasonal movements, available habitat, and stocking efficiency, current management strategies of hybrid striped bass in Monroe Lake are adequate to sustain a healthy fishery at similar levels of mortality.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-36-3				2013	80						313	332																WOS:000323292100019

There is 1 molt in the egg and a 2nd molt when the egg hatches. Third stage larvae were not infective to perch or invertebrates (copepods, oligochaetes). These larvae were experimentally transmitted orally to small cyprinid fish in which they developed to the 4th larval stage and became encysted in the liver. Prey fish may act as intermediate hosts for this parasite. High prevalence of the parasite in large, piscivorous perch from Lake Erie supports this hypothesis. In addition a histiotrophic stage of development occurs in the fish intermediate hosts rather than in perch. In other cucullanids studied, the life cycle is primarily monoxenous with a histiotrophic stage of development in 1 host. Annual changes in prevalence, intensity and worm development were followed in adult perch from Lake Erie. Worms are acquired in late summer, fall and winter, but most larvae acquired at this time do not develop past the 4th larval stage until the following spring. Worms rapidly develop into adults in the spring and females begin to produce eggs in early summer. These adults disappear in late summer.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1984	62	10					2062	2093		10.1139/z84-301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z84-301													WOS:A1984TR65100023

Seasonal variation in cell volume and biomass of the phototrophic picoplankton were also studied. PP were counted using disposable glass microscopic plates, which gave superior accuracy to sample filtration onto membrane filters. Phycoerythrin-rich rod-shaped cyanobacteria (PEC), one of the major components of the picoplankton community, were sparse (about 10(4) cells ml(-1)) in winter and began to increase in April. Several PEC peaks were observed during the period of thermal strati. cation, and a rapid fall took place after October or November. In the northern basin, PEC peaked during late June and early July in 3 of the 5 years, and in late summer in the remaining years. Phycocyanin-rich rod-shaped cyanobacteria (PCC) were abundant in the southern basin and were present in smaller numbers in the eutrophic nearshore area of the northern basin; they peaked several times during the period from July to October. Seasonal variations of these two kinds of picoplankton were correlated with seasonal changes in water temperature. Phycoerythrin-rich cylinder-shaped cyanobacteria exhibited narrow peaks in July, their abundance declining as the year progressed. The density of heterotrophic nanoflagellates was greatest in early spring. Average cell volume of PEC was largest in winter, then decreased gradually to a minimum in late summer; after the fall, it recovered to the winter cell volume. This change can likely be attributed to the depletion of nitrogen in the warmer seasons.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2004	528	1-3					1	16		10.1007/s10750-004-8985-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-8985-7													WOS:000224723600001

Our study shows that CDOM absorption is a major contributor to the total absorption signal in Lake Qiandaohu during all seasons, except autumn when it has an equivalent contribution as total particle absorption. The exponential slope of CDOM absorption varies within a narrow range around a mean value of 0.0164 nm(-1) (sd = 0.00176 nm(-1)). Our study finds some evidence for thIS autochthonous production of CDOM in winter and spring. Absorption by phytoplankton, and therefore its contribution to total absorption, is generally greatest in spring, suggesting that phytoplankton growth in Lake Qiandaohu occurs predominantly in the spring. Phytoplankton absorption in freshwater lakes generally has a direct relationship with chlorophyll-a concentration, similar to the one established for open ocean waters. The NAP absorption, whose relative contribution to total absorption is highest in summer, has a spectral shape that can be well fitted by an exponential function with an average slope of 0.0065 nm(-1) (sd = 0.00076 nm(-1)). There is significant spatial variability present in the summer of Lake Qiandaohu, especially in the northwestern and southwestern extremes where the optical properties of the water column are strongly affected by the presence of allochthonous matter. Variations in the properties of the particle absorption spectra with depths provides evidence that the water column was vertically inhomogeneous and can be monitored with an optical measurement program. Moreover, the optical inhomogeneity in winter is less obvious. Our study will support the parameterization of the Bio-optical model for Lake Qiandaohu from in situ or remotely sensing aquatic color signals.

Seasonal Variation in Sensitivity of Larval Sea Lampreys to the Lampricide 3-Trifluoromethyl-4-Nitrophenol	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the sensitivity of larval sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus to the lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) in a series of toxicity tests in spring and summer. Although noted previously, the seasonal variation in sensitivity to TFM had never been tested as a means of reducing TFM usage in stream treatments. A preliminary study consisted of three spring and four summer static toxicity tests conducted at 12 degrees C. A more comprehensive study consisted of 12 spring and summer paired flow-through toxicity tests conducted both at seasonal water temperatures and at 12 degrees C. The sensitivity of larval sea lampreys to TFM was greater in spring than in summer. The preliminary static toxicity tests indicated that the concentration of TFM needed to kill larval sea lampreys in spring (May and June) was about one-half that required in summer (August) the concentrations lethal to 50% and 99.9% of the test animals (the LC50 and LC99.9 values) were less in spring than in summer. Analysis of variance of the flow-through toxicity data indicated that season significantly affected both the LC50 and LC99.9 values. For all 12 paired flow-through toxicity tests, the spring LC50 and LC99.9 values were less than the corresponding summer values. For 9 of the 12 paired flow-through toxicity tests, the dose-response toxicity lines were parallel and allowed statistical comparison of the LC50 values. The spring LC50 values were significantly lower than the summer values in eight of the nine tests. Verification of a seasonal variation in the sensitivity of larval sea lampreys to TFM will allow inclusion of this factor in the selection model currently used by both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans-Canada to schedule lampricide stream treatments.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2008	28	5					1609	1617		10.1577/M06-178.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M06-178.1													WOS:000261796900024

Modern pollen assemblages as climate indicators in southern Europe	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim and Location Our aim is to develop pollen-climate inference models for southern Europe and to test their performance and inference power by cross-validation with modern climate data. Surface sediments collected from lakes along a climate gradient from the winter-cold/summer-wet Alps to winter-wet/summer-dry Sicily were analysed for modern pollen assemblages. Methods For each lake, mean monthly temperatures, seasonal precipitation and site-specific climate uncertainties have been estimated. Pollen-climate relationships were studied using numerical analyses, and inference models were derived by partial least squares (PLS) and weighted-averaging PLS (WA-PLS) regressions for January and July temperatures (T), and for winter, spring and summer precipitation (P). In order to assess whether these variables are also of ecological importance for vegetation in the subregions, we split the data set into an Alpine and a Mediterranean subset. Results Low bootstrap cross-validated root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) for January T (1.7 degrees C), July T (2.1 degrees C) and summer P (38 mm), as well as low RMSEPs expressed as a percentage of the gradient length (8-9%), indicate a good inference power. Models revealed excellent to good performance statistics for January T, July T and summer P (r(2)= 0.8), and for winter and spring P (r(2) =c. 0.5). We show that the variables with the highest explanatory power differ between the two subregions. These are summer T and P for the Alpine set, and January T, winter P and July T for the Mediterranean set. Main conclusions The study reveals the influence of climatic conditions during the growing season on modern pollen assemblages and indicates the potential of pollen data for long-term climate reconstructions of parameters such as winter precipitation and temperature, which seem to be the main factors having an influence on the variability of Mediterranean climate. These models may therefore provide important information on past regional climate variability in southern Europe.

Among the heavy metals analyzed Cr, Pb and Cd were below the detection limit (<0.03). Heavy metal concentrations varied significantly depending on the type of the tissue and season. The highest metal concentrations were found in the liver, followed by gill and muscle. Heavy metal levels in tissues of carp were increased in summer and winter, while were decreased in autumn and spring.

J	Timms, BV				Timms, Brian, V			On the influence of season and salinity on the phenology of invertebrates in Australian saline lakes, with special reference to those of the Paroo in the semiarid inland	JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												While the fauna of Australian salt lakes is now well-known, seasonal phenological patterns of invertebrates are not. Two studies on saline lakes in southern Australia suggest the lakes fill in early winter and remain at salinities characteristic for each lake during winter-spring before elevating and drying in summer. The fauna is dominated by crustaceans with few insects and all component species arc present most of the time and randomly fluctuating in numbers. Lakes in the southern inland (mainly Lake Eyre) fill in summer, change little in salinity until near drying, and are dominated by crustaceans but have some insects. By contrast temporary salinas in the central inland fill episodically mainly in summer and then their salinity increases steadily as they dry without further rain. Their fauna is also dominated by crustaceans, but with a significant insect component and composition varies though the hydrological cycle. This study reports on an unusual winter fill in two central Paroo lakes and two pools, in which the crustacean fauna is similar to that in summer but insects are delayed till late spring and are not as common as in summer fills. It seems therefore that while insects are more restricted by medium and high salinities than crustaceans, they are also more restricted by cooler temperatures than crustaceans.																			2096-5508					NOV	2018	36	6			SI		1907	1916		10.1007/s00343-018-7308-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-018-7308-1													WOS:000454629000002

PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PARAMETER VARIABILITY RELATIVE TO SEASONAL DYNAMICS AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF PLANKTON IN THE BOUKOURDANE LAKE DAM (ALGERIA)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The impact of seasonal variations in the water physico-chemical parameters on the zooplankton and phytoplankton composition was investigated in the Boukourdane reservoir (Tipaza, Algeria) over two years (April 2005-March 2007). High levels of nitrites were observed during the cold seasons, and the phosphate levels were higher in summer with a very high NO3-/PO43- ratio (>30) in winter. A significant increase in the level of chlorophyll a (Chl a) was observed in spring. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) highlighted a large variability during the warm seasons, especially for nitrites, nitrates, phosphates and ammonia. A great species diversity was observed (rotifers: 79, copepods: 13, and phytoplankton: 83). The weighted averages of the species enabled us to determine the optimal values of their physico-chemical parameters, as elevated temperatures for Bacillariophyta and Pyrrhophyta or high concentrations of chlorophyll a for Charophyta. The zooplankton was more prevalent during the spring and appeared to be correlated with sulfates and electrical conductivity. A redundancy analysis (RDA) corroborated the previous results and explained 84.1% of the total variance. This analysis highlights the influence of some of the environmental variables on the seasonal distribution of plankton, characterized by a high profusion in spring and scarcity in autumn and winter.

Rotifers were sampled with artificial substrates at two or three weekly intervals from eight sites chosen with respect to macrophyte species distribution from near shore to deeper water. 58 rotifer species were found, a high diversity in comparison to that of New Zealand limnetic communities, which usually have less than ten species. Rotifers had peak abundances in summer within emergent and submerged vegetation, when shallow regions were dry. Lecane bulla (Gosse) and Testudinella parva (Ternetz) generally had the highest numerical densities. Three major temporal groupings of species were distinguished by cluster analysis and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA): summer-autumn (e.g. Lecane hornemanni (Ehrenberg), L. bulla), winter-spring (e.g. Mytilina mucronata (Muller), Trichocerca porcellus (Gosse)), and late autumn to mid spring (e.g. T. parva, Polyarthra vulgaris (Carlin)). Rotifer species composition appeared to depend on seasonal change of water level and the associated shift from heterogeneous to homogenous physical and chemical conditions across the ecotone. Temporal variability in the abundance of zindividual rotifer species was far greater than their spatial variability. CCA indicated that temperature and pH were the factors most strongly associated with temporal variation in abundances of rotifer species. Macrophytes appeared to play the major role in determining spatial distribution, both because of differences in physical structure between species (affecting microhabitat diversity) and by causing variations in physical and chemical conditions (e.g. oxygen and pH) by inhibiting mixing.					; Duggan, Ian/G-2275-2012	Green, John D/0009-0003-5845-171X; Duggan, Ian/0000-0002-6037-9759													0018-8158						1998	387						179	197		10.1023/A:1017097911087	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017097911087													WOS:000080234300027

Understanding phytoplankton functional groups and their relationships with the environment is critical for the sustainable management of the reservoir for the supply of drinking water. Therefore, phytoplankton and water samples were collected and analyzed seasonally in 2016 to detect these relationships, with a total of 23 functional groups of phytoplankton identified. The highest diversity of functional groups was observed in spring, while the lowest was in winter. Due to differences in the geographical position, as well as the hydrological and environmental conditions, upstream phytoplankton-community structures are different from those downstream, with the dominant functional groups having a clear seasonal succession. The succession dynamics of phytoplankton functional groups from upstream to downstream in spring were M (Microcystis aeruginosa) + Y (Cryptomonas sp.) -> S1 (Pseudanabaena limnetica) + L-M (Gomphosphaeria sp.) -> S1 + L-M + X1 (Chlorella sp.) -> X1 + X2 (chlamydomonas sp.) + F (Oocystis sp.) -> F + X1 + X2; X1, F and Lo (Peridinium sp.) were the co- dominant groups from summer to autumn, and group C (Melosira ambigua) was dominant in winter. The upstream assemblages of X1 + X2, X1 + F, S1 + L-M + M in spring and LO in summer can adapt to the rapid growth in eutrophic conditions with potential bloom threats. Water temperature, light and phosphorus were the primary factors regulat- ing the dominant functional groups, and the phytoplankton succession was seasonally dependent. These results may have implications for the management of future water resources in the Zhushuqiao Reservoir, such as the determination of the intake depth of drinking water, and the prevention of nutrient pollution.

The highest bloom of P. micans was observed in summer and autumn, but it declined in winter. This blooming was highly correlated to the increased water salinity and temperature. The seasonal cellular changes included partial deterioration of the cytoplasmic organelles that was observed in autumn, and many ruptured individuals with chlorophyll leakage in winter. As for the cellular proteins, many polypeptides were significantly down-regulated downstream from summer to winter. Induction of protein phosphorylation steady state was found in winter samples. This most likely contributed to signal transduction cascades regulating programmed cell death and abundance of the fluctuations of P. micans during seasonal changes.

The 3-D structures and seasonal cycles of the circulation patterns, temperature, salinity, and density were examined in real bottom topography. The "river/lake" scenarios (i.e., the weak versus strong flushing throughflow) were captured on a monthly basis. The freshwater runoff of the line source significantly contributes to the basin-scale cyclonic circulation which can't be seen in previous simulations without freshwater runoff (Mooers and Wang [3]). Wind forcing due to the orographic effect substantially contributes to the circulation patterns in the Sound. Multiple circulation regimes (cyclonic, anticyclonic, and their combination) characterize the complexity of the system which depends on the intensity of the GOA water throughflow, freshwater discharge of the line source, and the synoptic wind. A winter circulation is characterized by a high flushing regime due to high throughflow and northeast winds, while the spring pattern is dominated by a basin-scale anticyclonic gyre. The summer (July to September) circulation is controlled by a basin-scale cyclonic gyre due to the maximum freshwater influence along the coastline. The autumn circulation is driven by a combination of the throughflow and the northeast wind-driven flow. The simulated cyclonic gyre in summer and late fall is supported by observations.																			1462-6098		1-85312-686-1				1999	3						57	66																WOS:000084928500006

Arctic relicts and elements of the Lake Baikal fauna are found. In macroinvertebrate communities, chironomid larvae dominate (by abundance and biomass), as do oligochaetes (by abundance). The lowest quantitative parameters are recorded in autumn-winter, and the highest parameters, in spring (March-April). Then they abruptly decline owing to emergence of amphibiotic insects.

Summer-averaged surface temperature increases with increased air temperature, decreased ice cover, and decreased wind speed. Differences in heat content between model runs with differing initial temperatures (a proxy for winter ice cover) decrease over the course of the season, but significant differences present in late spring persist through the summer season. Interannual variability in wind speed is the predominant driver of variability in the vertical stratification scale.

J	Schmeling, M				Schmeling, M			Seasonal variations in diurnal concentrations of trace elements in atmospheric aerosols in Chicago	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA												Atmospheric aerosols are solid or liquid particles dissolved in air, which can change their chemical composition frequently depending, on various parameters such as wind speed and direction. In this study, diurnal atmospheric aerosol filter samples, taken at Loyola University Chicago's Air Monitoring Station, are discussed with respect to variations in trace elemental composition at different seasons. The samples collected, were digested in a microwave oven and analyzed by total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectrometry. To aid interpretation of the samples, meteorological parameters were recorded and back trajectory analysis was employed. Four days, based on average meteorological conditions, were selected for each season as example to obtain preliminary insight into trace elemental variations. The results indicate that elemental concentrations vary during seasons and depend on major wind patterns (speed and direction). The differences were most pronounced in summer, where most elemental concentrations were found to be lowest of all seasons due to onshore (cast) wind from Lake Michigan, depriving the air parcel of larger particles by deposition into the lake. In spring and fall the elemental concentrations determined were much higher, which can be attributed to the prevailing and often stronger westerly winds and associated higher particle freight. In winter the situation can be described as intermediate between summer and spring/fall with moderate elemental concentrations due to weaker winds and less stable wind directions.

Sixteen genera and 43 species of diatom were found in the surface sediments, and the dominant diatom genera were Aulacoseira, Ulnaria, Cyclotella, Navicula and Fragilaria. A redundancy analysis (RDA) and Monte Carlo permutation 20 test revealed that COD, pH, TP, conductivity and transparency were significant factors influencing diatom assemblage change, meaning that the distribution of the diatom assemblages were mostly influenced by nutrient composition, light intensity and ion concentrations.																				2073-4441				FEB	2021	13	3							339	10.3390/w13030339	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13030339													WOS:000615610300001

The water reappears in the Giffre valley, more than 6 km away, at several springs. Whilst travelling underground, it mixes with water which has percolated from other places. As this region is occupied in the summer and autumn by tourists and grazing animals, the problem of water pollution could arise, as these springs are used for drinking water.																			1661-464X					JUL	1989	42	2					437	446																WOS:A1989AJ10400004

Removal of selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products and artificial sweetener in an aerated sewage lagoon	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A sewage lagoon serving the small municipality of Lakefield in Ontario, Canada was monitored in the summer, fall and winter to determine removals of carbamazepine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, triclosan, sucralose, HHCB and AHTN. Concentrations of these compounds in untreated and treated wastewater were estimated by deploying POCIS and SPMD passive samplers in the sewage lagoon. Passive samplers were also deployed at several points upstream and downstream of the point of discharge from the lagoon into the Otonabee River. LC-MS/MS and GC-MS were utilized to determine the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and sucralose, an artificial sweetener. Among PPCPs sampled by POCIS, the highest estimated concentration in untreated wastewater was ibuprofen sampled during the fall, at an estimated concentration of 60.3 ng/L. The estimated average concentration of sucralose was 13.6 ng/L in the untreated wastewaters. Triclosan, HHCB and AHTN in SPMDs were highest during fall season, at 30, 1677 and 109 ng/L, respectively. For all compounds except gemfibrozil, carbamazepine and sucralose, removals were highest in the summer (83.0 to 98.8%) relative to removals in the fall (48.4 to 91.4%) and winter (14.0 to 78.3%). Finally, the estimated concentrations of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan and HHCB were compared with predicted values obtained through application of the WEST (R) modeling tool, with a new model based on the River Water Quality Model No. I and extended with dynamic mass balances describing the fate of chemicals of emerging concern subject to a variety of removal pathways. The model was able to adequately predict the fate of these four compounds in the lagoon in summer and winter, but the model overestimated removals of three of the four test compounds in the fall sampling period. This lagoon was as effective at removing PPCPs as many conventional WWTPs, but removals were better during the summer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	SZALAI, AJ; DICK, TA				SZALAI, AJ; DICK, TA			DIFFERENCES IN NUMBERS AND INEQUALITIES IN MASS AND FECUNDITY DURING THE EGG-PRODUCING PERIOD FOR RAPHIDASCARIS-ACUS (NEMATODA, ANISAKIDAE)	PARASITOLOGY												Maturity, mass and sex were determined for individual Raphidascaris acus from northern pike, Esox lucius from Dauphin Lake, Manitoba [Canada]. Length, width and total fecundity of female worms; seasonal changes in worm numbers, growth and maturity; and inequalities in mass and fecundity were quantified for 8 sample periods between April and September. Recruitment of R. acus is most rapid in early spring and continues throughout summer. An accumulation of larvae over winter leads to a peak in the number of gravid worms in spring, while increased feeding by post-spawning pike on yellow perch, Perca fluviatilis, leads to lower levels of gravid worms throughout summer and early autumn. Gravid worms found in spring versus summer were similar with respect to all measured variables and do not appear to be from genetically distinct populations. The strength of the correlation between fecundity and mass for worms was variable between pike and between sample periods, and only weakly correlated when the data were pooled. Much of this variation could be attributed to continued growth of gravid worms after maturation. Worms found in June were smaller, less fecund and less variable and inequalities in mass and fecundity measured using Gini coefficients (GCs) and Lorenz curves (LCs) were most similar at this time. For all other sample periods inequality in fecundity was greater than the corresponding value for mass. Similarity between GCs based on mass and fecundity was maximum when the coefficient of variation (C.V.) for mass was greater than the corresponding C.V. for fecundity. These observations suggest that one must be cautious when applying GCs and LCs to the analysis of parasite populations.

Each isolate was examined by conventional techniques for 105 biochemical, cultural, morphological and physiological characters. The set of data was treated by single linkage clustering using the simple matching coefficient. At a similarity level of 75 to 80%, 108 strains (87% of total) were grouped into 98 clusters comprising at least 3, and up to 35 strains, each. The clusters were described by their spectrum of characters. Season-specific clusters for the spring, summer and autumn samplings could be identified. Besides a core of strains present at all seasons and depths, there were specialized components appearing under special environmental conditions. In winter, only strains belonging to the core could be detected.																			0003-9136						1982	94	1					38	52																WOS:A1982NU16100003
J	HARRISON, AF; PEARCE, T				HARRISON, AF; PEARCE, T			SEASONAL-VARIATION OF PHOSPHATASE-ACTIVITY IN WOODLAND SOILS	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Seasonal variation of phosphatase activity in 0-5 cm soils from 1.6 m2 plots in 48 English Lake District [UK] woodlands was studied. Six percent or 21% of the total variation in phosphatase activity at the assay temperature of 13.degree. C was seasonal if activity was expressed as phenol liberated g-1 soil or cm-3 soil, respectively. No seasonal pattern of activity at 213.degree. C was detectable within individual plots due to high within-plot spatial variation. By averaging the results of all 48 plots, a seasonal pattern was identified but this did not resemble the seasonal pattern of soil available P content. Two or possibly 3 peaks of activity occurred during the year, 1 in summer, a 2nd after leaf-fall in autumn and possibly a minor peak in spring. The highest activity occurred in mid-winter. When adjusted to field temperature, 19 or 37% of the total variation in phosphatase activity, expressed in terms of g-1 soil or cm-3 soil, respectively, was seasonal. The same 3 peaks of activity were still apparent, but their relative heights were altered, with maximum activity occurring in summer. After adjustment to field temperature, the seasonal pattern could be detected in many of the individual plots if activity was expressed in terms of cm-3 soil and reflected the seasonal pattern of soil available P. Soil phosphatase data should be expressed in terms of activity per unit soil volume and adjusted to field temperatures if the biological significance of the seasonal variation in activity is to be appreciated.																			0038-0717	1879-3428					1979	11	4					405	410		10.1016/0038-0717(79)90054-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0717(79)90054-3													WOS:A1979HH38700013

The succession of phytoplankton functional groups and the environmental variables in the lake were investigated from January 2013 to December 2015. The lake had strong radiation levels and a low-temperature amplitude because of its high elevation and strongly mixed water. It was highly affected by the subtropical monsoon precipitation, and its pollution sources were from diffuse pollution caused by rainfall runoff. Altogether 112 genera, 16 functional groups and 4 predominant functional groups, L-M (Microcystis), P (Melosira, Fragilaria, Closterium), T (Mougeotia), T (Psephonema aenigmaticum) and Y (Cryptomonas), were identified, and the predominant functional groups demonstrated strong seasonal variations. Group T (Mougeotia) dominated from the winter to early spring, with strong lake water mixing. Group P replaced group T (Mougeotia) as the dominate group of the phytoplankton community in the spring (March to May), with clear water and increased temperature. With the arrival of the monsoon rainy season in the summer, large amounts of external pollutants were brought into the lake via rainfall runoff, allowing group LM (Microcystis) to become dominant. Meanwhile, the intensive nutrient inputs after the rainstorm in the summer, combined with high temperatures and decreased radiation, led to the sustained growth of group LM in the autumn and even ultimately triggered Microcystis blooming. Group T (P. aenigmaticum) was a particular phytoplankton genus predominant in the autumn, which displayed a seasonal variation similar to that of group LM. This study underscores the usefulness of phytoplankton functional groups in studying phytoplankton succession in subtropical plateau lakes impacted by diffuse pollution, in which the succession of phytoplankton functional groups can be significantly affected by rainfall runoff, which altered variables such as nutrients, high temperatures and radiation.

J	Spencer, DM; Holecek, DF				Spencer, Daniel M.; Holecek, Donald F.			Basic characteristics of the fall tourism market	TOURISM MANAGEMENT												To mitigate the ill-effects of seasonality in the tourism industry, efforts to attract tourists during non-peak seasons must become more effective, but this can be accomplished only by better understanding the nature of low season markets. To enhance our understanding of the fall tourism market, this article presents insights gained from a telephone survey of households in the Great Lakes region. Fall tourists, compared to their summer counterparts, were found to be older, less likely to travel with children, and less active in recreation. Fall color viewing rarely motivated trips and was much more prevalent as an ancillary activity. Distinct types of fall tourists were identified based on patterns of participation in trip activities and whether trips began during the early, middle, or late fall. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial and temporal variation in microcystin concentrations during perennial bloom of Planktothrix agardhii in a hypertrophic lake	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Temporal and spatial variation in the concentrations of intra- and extra-cellular microcystins were studied in a hypertrophic lake with bloom of Planktothrix agardhii (Gomont) Anagnostidis et Komarek. Concomitantly with increase in water temperature (from 2 to 20 degrees C abundance of P. agardhii increased from 1.9 x 10(5) to 4.3 x 10(7) trichomes L-1. In autumn, in spite of temperature lower (14 degrees C) than in summer it was still very high. Mass development of P. agardhii (to 6 x 10(6) L-1 and higher) caused a severe decrease in water transparency (to 0.5 - 0.2 m in summer/autumn). The cyanobacterium density was relatively uniform within water column; only in summer (July) it was significantly higher (by about 30%) in surface than in bottom layer. From spring to autumn rnicrocystins (MCs) were mainly biomass-bound (up to 90 mu g MC-LR equiv. L-1), whereas the level of extra-cellular toxins was much lower (up to 2 mu g L-1) and relatively stable. Only in winter, high amounts of MCs (11.3 Pg L-1) were released from decaying biomass into water. The increasing concentrations of biomass-bound microcystins in the take water positively correlated (R-2 = 0.9863; y = -0.1285x(2) + 7.14x) with the abundance of P. agardhii and the highest concentrations of the intracellular MC fraction were found during the exponential phase of P. agardhii growth. In addition, the surface-sampled biomass of P. agardhii contained in autumn 2-fold more MCs (2.75 mu g MC-LR equiv. per 10(6) P. agardhii trichomes) than the bottom-sampled one (1.41 mu g MC-LR equiv. per 10(6) trichomes). This is the first report showing that despite the homogenous distribution of P. agardhii in water column of a shallow lake, various seasonal and spatial distributions of both extra-cellular and intracellular fractions of microcystins occur.					; Kornijów, Ryszard/AEX-3635-2022	Pawlik-Skowronska, Barbara/0000-0002-6485-2099; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					2008	44	2					145	150		10.1051/limn:2008015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn:2008015													WOS:000257209500006
J	Abdel-Aal, EI				Abdel-Aal, Eman Ibrahim			Species composition and diversity of epiphytic microalgae on Myriophyllum spicatum in the El-Ibrahimia Canal, Egypt	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The El-Ibrahimia Canal is one of the main irrigation sources in Egypt, that it supplies perennial irrigation to approximately 600 000 ha (one-fourth of the Egyptian cultivated land). An annual study on species composition of microalgae attached to the submerged hydrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum L. was carried out from midautumn 2016 to midsummer 2017. Epiphytic microalgae were represented by 109 species related to 66 genera. Diatoms were the most abundant group (66-95%) followed by green algae (3.3-25%). Aulacoseira granulata, Cyclotella ocellata, Cymbella affinis, Gomphonema parvulum, Navicula cuspidata, Navicula muralis, Nitzschia dissipata, Nitzschia hungerica, Staurosirella leptostauron, and Ulnaria ulna were the most dominant species. Regarding morphology-based functional groups (MBFGs) taxonomic approach, the epiphytic microalgae species were represented by six MBFGs (I, III, IV, V, VI and VII). The MBFG VI (mainly diatoms) was the leading group with a minimum average percentage of 59.9% during the summer season and a maximum of 95.06% during the winter season. The mean annual values of cell density fluctuated greatly between 8.6 x 10(6) (during the spring season) and 4.7 x 10(7) cells g(-1) plant wet weight (during winter season). The changes in microalgae biovolumes have the same trend as cell density, with mean seasonal values of 3.89 x 10(9), 2.56 x 10(10), 1.16 x 10(9), and 3.21 x 10(9) mu m(3) g(-1) plant wet weight during autumn, winter, spring and summer seasons, respectively. Diversity index values ranged between 2.0 and 3.0, revealing a light pollution status of the canal. In general, the species composition and diversity of epiphytic algae along the El-Ibrahimia Canal are highly dependent on site and the physico-chemical properties of canal water affected by agricultural practice around it.

Seasonal changes in partial, reverse diel vertical migrations of cisco Coregonus artedi	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The objectives of this study were to (1) document changes in partial, reverse diel vertical migrations (DVM) patterns of cisco Coregonus artedi in Ten Mile Lake, MN, U.S.A., throughout the year and (2) evaluate the mechanisms that may cause shifts in migration behaviour. Results indicated that C. artedi vertical distributions remained deep in the water column during the day and night of the spring and autumn, which was related to a low risk, low reward strategy. During summer, a partial migration occurred where a portion of the population remained deeper according to the low risk, low reward strategy, while the other portion performed a more extensive high risk, high reward reverse DVM. In winter, C. artedi did not migrate because there were only low risk, low reward conditions present at all depths. The extensive partial, reverse DVM during summer probably increased the growth potential of C. artedi, helping individuals survive in a lake with low zooplankton prey resources.

Relationships among phytoplankton production, species composition, chlorophyll a content, bacteria, zooplankton and a variety of abiotic environmental factors were studied. Productivity normally showed one peak in spring and another in summer, whereas a minimum was reached under the ice cover in Feb. or March. Maximum production rates in the depth profile ranged from 3-144 mg C .cntdot. m-3 .cntdot. day-1, integral production from 6-510 mg C .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1. Species of Cyanophyceae, Dinophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Chrysophyceae dominated alternately and showed significant differences in the level and variation of photosynthetic activity. Maximum activity was observed in summer. A high biomass increase during late winter and spring despite low primary productivity resulted from the immigration of the dominant blue-green alga, Oscillatoria limosa, from the sediment. Energy efficiency increased not only with depth in the light-limited parts of the euphotic zone but at all depths during bad weather conditions and during the decrease of irradiance in autumn.

Winter behaviour and energetics of free-swimming largemouth bass	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Bioenergetics models have many valuable applications for fishes, but often lack ecological realism due to limited data from free-living wild animals. Here we used heart rate loggers and accelerometers in wild largemouth bass (LMB; Micropterus nigricans) to characterize their bioenergetics during the winter (fall to late-spring) in a small lake. Activity, heart rate, and metabolic rate decreased over the fall, remained low over the winter, and peaked in the late-spring coinciding with spawning. Interestingly, LMB exhibited continued slow swimming over the winter period. Growth rates were predominately negative over the winter period; however, mass change was highly variable. Using an updated Wisconsin bioenergetics model, estimates of consumption indicated that overwinter feeding was likely occurring and simulations of winter fasting predicted greater mass lost than observed for most LMB; however, if fasting results in a reduction in metabolic rate, predicted losses suggest that some LMB may be able to fast through the winter. This study provides insights into ecologically realistic bioenergetics parameters for LMB and furthers our understanding of LMB winter behaviour and energy use.

Influence of Season, Sex, Age and Diet Composition on Mercury Concentration in Walleye Sander vitreus	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												We collected Walleye Sander vitreus (May-October) from Bitter and Twin lakes, South Dakota to assess seasonal- and diet-related variation in tissue mercury (Hg) concentration. The average Hg concentration in Walleye was 43-68% higher in the spring for Bitter (p < 0.008) and Twin Lakes (p < 0.017) compared with summer or autumn months. Bioenergetics analysis of Bitter Lake Walleye showed that consumption of fish prey (primarily Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas) increased from late summer through winter and was linked to increased Hg accumulation in Walleye the following spring. Mercury concentration varied significantly with Walleye age but was similar for comparably-aged male (0.62 mu g/g) and female fish (0.62 mu g/g). However, after adjusting for Walleye size (total length, mm), mean Hg concentration was greater in male (0.66 mu g/g) compared with female (0.50 mu g/g) fish, likely due to slower growth rate of male Walleye. At 425 mm, male Walleye in Bitter Lake were approximately 1 year older than female fish. These findings show that diet, age, and gender-related growth affect Hg concentration in Walleye and are important factors to consider in fish contaminant monitoring programs.

J	Kasten, J				Kasten, J			Inundation and isolation: dynamics of phytoplankton communities in seasonal inundated flood plain waters of the Lower Odra Valley National Park - Northeast Germany	LIMNOLOGICA												The flood plains of the Lower Odra are inundated in winter and spring and are desiccated in summer and autumn. Phytoplankton composition as well as its seasonal succession in permanent oxbows and separate lakes were investigated between 1993 and 1996. Solitary centric diatoms were the characteristic phytoplankton taxa of these flood plain waters. They dominated the main channel non-seasonally, the flood plains during the entire inundation phase and long periods of the isolation phase. Only during long phases of low mixing (maximal 1.5-2 months in summer) separate water bodies were dominated by Cyano- and/or Dinophyceae. This special feature of the Lower Odra Valley is explained by the Inundation-Isolation-Model of phytoplankton development influenced by inundation. Out of a high diverse algal spectrum of 495 taxa, specialities such as 9 endangered taxa and 6 halophilous taxa were discussed. Additionally, taxon specific cell-volumes and maxima of biovolumes were given.																			0075-9511					JUL	2003	33	2					99	111		10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80039-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80039-7													WOS:000184495500003

A bathymetric survey showed a deep basin (337m maximum depth) as well as great volume (34.4 km3). The drainage area is large (3.036 km2), 17 times its surface area. According to its physical and chemical factors, this lake is oligotrophic, monomictic temperate with winter circulation at 8.1.degree.C and thermal stratification in summer. Transparency is high (.hivin.x 10.2 m, Secchi disk). The main nutrients are in low concentration, with a vertical distribution nearly homogeneous during winter circulation and with an orthograde tendency during thermal stratification. The availability of these nutrients correlated to higher abundances in phytoplanktonic biomass. The greatest carbon assimilation per chlorophyll unit occurred in winter, although the primary productivity reached its highest level at the beginning of summer. The levels of primary productivity were low. Phytoplankton had a maximum in spring (October), belonging mainly to the species Rhizosolenia eriensis, Cyclotella stelligera Closterium acutum var. variabile, Sphaerocystic schroeteri. Diatoms are abundant in winter-spring, Clorophyceae in spring, Cyanophyceae in winter and beginning of spring. A species of calanoid copepod, Boeckella gracilipes, was identified in the zooplankton, together with one species of cyclopoid copepod, Mesocyclops longisetus, two species of cladocera, Eubosmina hagmanni and Daphnia pulex, and nine species of rotifera, dominated by Synchaeta stylata and Conochilus unicornis. The abundance maxima of the zooplankton coincided with those of the phytoplankton. The highest abundance was observed at beginning of summer.

SEASONAL VARIATION OF WATER MINERALISATION DEGREE FROM MOVILA MIRESII LAKE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON NEIGHBOURING SOILS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Braila plain has large areas occupied by lakes and ponds, some of them with a high degree of mineralisation. Movila Miresei lake is situated in the western part of Braila plain, its water being chlorosodic-sulphate, with large variations in salt concentration. In order to highlight seasonal mineralisation degree of Movila Miresei lake, water samples have been picked up in autumn and next spring. The two sets of values obtained highlight the following: water pH falls in moderately alkaline class; the Cl- anion is preponderant in the chemical water composition; anions and cation concentrations values are higher in autumn than in spring; the electrical conductivity had higher values in autumn than in spring; mineral residue values exceed the limit of 10.1 g/l, the water being strong salty water in terms of the degree of mineralisation; and comparing different anions and cations content allowed water classification of Movila Miresei lake in Group II, with water containing magnesium sulphate. The variation of mineralisation degree of water is reflected in the chemical characteristics of adjacent soil, and highlights the following: pH values higher in spring; the total soil soluble salt content decreases in spring, and the degree of saturation of the soil exchange complex with sodium does not vary.

Seasonal changes in photochemical properties of dissolved organic matter in small boreal streams	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in lakes and streams is significantly affected by photochemical transformation of DOM. A series of laboratory photochemical experiments was conducted to describe seasonal changes in photochemical properties of DOM. The stream samples used in this study originated from three different catchments in the southernmost part of the Boreal ecozone near Dorset, Ontario, Canada. A first-order kinetics equation was used to model photochemical degradation of DOM and the kinetic rate constant, K, was used as an indicator of photochemical properties of DOM. Kinetic rate constants from all three catchments showed a sinusoidal pattern during the hydrological year. K increased steadily during autumn and winter and decreased during spring and summer with a more than 3-fold range in each stream. The highest values were observed during spring melt events when DOM was flushed from terrestrial sources by high flows. The minimum rate constants were found in summer when discharge was lowest. K was strongly correlated with pH and iron. DOM molecular weight and specific absorbance at 254 nm also exhibited annual cycles corresponding to the seasonal cycles of terrestrial organic matter, but the relationships between these properties and K differed between seasons and may have been affected by previous exposure to solar radiation during transit from the catchment.

This wetland underwent a six-year drought that terminated at the end of 1996. At that time, inundation area and water level increased, diminishing macrophyte cover in some cases and enhancing a continuing eutrophication problem. Sampling was performed monthly from January 1996 to December 1998 in five shallow water sites. Zooplankton were a mixture of limnetic and littoral species (66 rotifer, 15 cladoceran, and 10 copepod taxa, plus unidentified oligotrichid and peritrichid ciliates), the composition of which changed coincident with the shift of the hydrologic conditions. The most common taxa were bdelloid rotifers and Lecane closterocerca. The microcrustaceans Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia curvirostris, and Acanthocyclops robustus were frequent. Ciliates were the most important component of zooplankton in terms of biomass, except in spring when cladocerans were dominant. Rotifer biomass was the lowest fraction of zooplankton. When community structure was described by taxonomic classes, mean biomass, or time biomass trajectories, only weak spatial patterns were found following the flux of water in the wetland. Each zoo-plankton group was distinctly affected by flood. Ciliates and rotifers increased biomass after the flooding, possibly as a result of the enhancement of eutrophication; cladoceran populations decreased after the flooding likely due to macrophyte loss that facilitated planktivorous fish control. Copepods increased biomass consequent to the stabilized water level. There was a clear seasonal trend of zooplankton biomass seemingly unaffected by flood. Ciliates and rotifers had fluctuating low biomass in winter-spring, with maximum biomass in summer-autumn; cladocerans appeared and peaked only in spring; copepods peaked in late winter and spring.

Here, we use meta-analysis techniques to test whether 18 lakes in northern, western, and central Europe respond coherently to winter climate forcing, and to assess the persistence of the winter climate signal in physical, chemical, and biological variables during the year. A meta-analysis approach was chosen because we wished to emphasize the overall coherence pattern rather than individual lake responses. A particular strength of our approach is that time-series from each of the 18 lakes were subjected to the same robust statistical analysis covering the same 23-year period. Although the strongest overall coherence in response to the winter NAO was exhibited by lake water temperatures, a strong, coherent response was also exhibited by concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus and soluble reactive silicate, most likely as a result of the coherent response exhibited by the spring phytoplankton bloom. Lake nitrate concentrations showed significant coherence in winter. With the exception of the cyanobacterial biomass in summer, phytoplankton biomass in all seasons was unrelated to the winter NAO. A strong coherence in the abundance of daphnids during spring can most likely be attributed to coherence in daphnid phenology. A strong coherence in the summer abundance of the cyclopoid copepods may have been related to a coherent change in their emergence from resting stages. We discuss the complex nature of the potential mechanisms that drive the observed changes.					; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021; Noges, Tiina/AAL-5373-2020	Jennings, Eleanor/0000-0002-9344-2056; Blenckner, Thorsten/0000-0002-6991-7680; Jarvinen, Marko/0000-0002-8107-8066; Teubner, Katrin/0000-0002-3699-2043; Straile, Dietmar/0000-0002-7441-8552; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				JUL	2007	13	7					1314	1326		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01364.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01364.x													WOS:000248945800003

Dinoflagellates had their greatest numbers in mid summer. Euglenoids and chrysophytes were present but in low numbers. The ratio of different groups showed that the lake is highly eutrophic. Copepods were abundant and examination of samples revealed that the cell volume of phytoplankton and length of filamentous algae affected zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton, consequently giving way to domination of Chlorophyta members larger than 60 mm in late spring and filamentous cyanobacteria species in summer months.

ORNITHOLOGICAL SCIENCE												We satellite-tracked Whooper Swans Cygnus cygnus wintering in northern Japan to document their migration routes and timing, and to identify breeding areas. From 47 swans that we marked at Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma, Miyagi Prefecture, northeast Honshu, and at Lake Kussharo. east Hokkaido we observed 57 spring and 33 autumn migrations from 2009-2012. In spring, swans migrated north along Sakhalin Island from eastern Hokkaido using stopovers in Sakhalin, at the mouth of the Amur River and in northern coastal areas of the Sea of Okhotsk. They ultimately reached molting/breeding areas along the Indigirka River and the lower Kolyma River in northern Russia. In autumn, the swans basically reversed the spring migration routes. We identified northern Honshu, eastern Hokkaido, coastal areas in Sakhalin, the lower Amur River and northern coastal areas of the Sea of Okhotsk as the most frequent stopover sites, and the middle reaches of the Indigirka and the lower Kolyma River as presumed breeding sites. Our results are helpful in understanding the distribution of the breeding and stopover sites of Whooper Swans wintering in Japan and in identifying their major migration habitats. Our findings contribute to understanding the potential transmission process of avian influenza viruses potentially carried by swans, and provide information necessary to conserve Whooper Swans in East Asia.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle and regulates biogeo-chemical and ecological processes in aquatic systems. Among the numerous studies on the effects of anthropo-genic activities on the quality and quantity of river DOM, few studies have focused on the influence of different artificially regulated flow on the composition, source, and fate of fluvial DOM. This study aims to elucidate the impact of different artificial regulation modes of river flows on the source, migration, and transformation of DOM. The optical properties of DOM were used to explore the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of DOM in the Yongding River Basin, where artificial regulation of river flows by cross-basin and inner-basin water transfers were implemented. Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis revealed four fluorescent substances of DOM in the water: one microbial humic-like (C1), one terrestrial humic-like (C2), one non-point source pollution humic-like (C4), and one tryptophan-like (C3) substance. Due to cross-basin water transfer from the Yellow River, the flow is the highest (21.79 m3/s) during spring, which was the reason that the signal of C2 was stronger during spring (71.45 QSU) compared to summer (57.12 QSU) and autumn (51.78 QSU). Due to inner-basin water transfer from upstream reservoirs, C3 derived from autochtho-nous sources were higher during autumn (130.81 QSU) than during spring (77.17 QSU) and summer (93.16 QSU). With no water transfer, more C1 were present at higher temperatures during summer (141.51 QSU) than during spring (126.73 QSU) and autumn (128.8 QSU). Moreover, C4 originating from urban and/or agricultural non-point source runoff increased during summer (57.07 QSU) than during spring (33.29 QSU) and autumn (52.27 QSU) because of increased rainfall. The different modes of artificial regulation of river flows changed the hydrological characteristics of the basin, which in turn altered the temporal and spatial distribution character-istics of the quantity and quality of DOM. The finding of this study can help promote the development of appropriate management strategies for artificial regulation of river flows in the basin. Furthermore, this study provides a basis for investigating the effects of different artificial flow regulations on the carbon cycles and ecological risks of rivers in the basin.

J	DRYDEN, SJ; VINCENT, WF				DRYDEN, SJ; VINCENT, WF			PHYTOPLANKTON SPECIES OF LAKE OKARO, CENTRAL NORTH ISLAND	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The species composition of the Lake Okaro (New Zealand) phytoplankton community was described as part of a detailed study of the lake ecosystem during 1979/80. The dimensions of each species were measured to estimate cell biovolume and to define the morphometric characteristics of each population. The algal dominants (> 50% of community biomass) were bloom-forming cyanophytes in summer through to early winter (Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz., Anabaena flos-aquae (Lyng.) Breb., A. spiroides Kleb.), centric diatoms in autumn and winter (Melosira granulata (Ehr.) Ralfs, M. granulata var. angustissima Mull.), and colonial chlorococcaleans in spring (Coelastrum microporum Naegeli, Micractinium pusillum Fresenius, Oocystis parva West and West, Actinastrum hantzschii Lagerh.). These algal communities were different to the communities recorded in Lake Okaro 10 years earlier. M. granulata dominated the winter plankton in 1980 but not 1970. Colonial chlorococcaleans were more important constituents throughout the year than during 1970, and a previously unrecorded, non N2-fixing blue-green alga (M. aeruginosa) produced water blooms from December 1979 to June 1980. The chlorococcalean and cyanophyte shifts suggest that further enrichment of this eutrophic water body has occurred over the decade 1970-80.

Spatial and seasonal variation in ecosystem metabolism are associated with aquatic macrophyte traits, shading, and water temperature in a shallow riparian pond	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												How much do traits of aquatic macrophytes affect rates of ecosystem metabolism in a shallow riparian pond? The factors that drive patterns of primary production and ecosystem respiration (ER) in wetlands remain poorly understood even though metabolism is one of the few ways that we can measure the response of an entire ecosystem to human intervention. We measured the metabolic rates of macrophyte patches in the spring, summer, and autumn by placing oxygen sondes in clear mesocosms embedded in the mud of a small, shallow pond (0.3-0.6 m deep) in central Utah, USA. We hypothesized that all patches (Chara, metaphyton, and Potamogeton foliosus) would be autotrophic (gross primary production [GPP] would exceed ER) in spring, whereas all patches (Chara, metaphyton, and Lemna) would be heterotrophic (ER > GPP) in summer. We also hypothesized that shading by the floating macrophyte, Lemna, would reduce the GPP of all submersed macrophytes, thereby producing heterotrophic conditions throughout the pond in autumn. As predicted, all macrophyte patches were autotrophic in spring, but the GPP of Chara and metaphyton was 1.5 and 1.4x greater than the GPP of P. foliosus, respectively. In summer, Chara and metaphyton maintained high rates of GPP, but net aquatic production (NAP = GPP - ER) was heterotrophic in all patches (Chara, metaphyton, and Lemna), and all patches produced long periods of nighttime hypoxia (between 9.5-15 h). Hypoxia in summer was likely caused by warm temperatures often exceeding 35 degrees C. In autumn under a mat of Lemna, GPP and ER were small, and hypoxia declined as temperatures declined. ER in this pond was driven by macrophyte respiration and the decomposition of macrophytes, not by the decomposition of allochthonous carbon as in most freshwater ecosystems. Light saturation of photosynthesis was common in summer when Chara produced the highest rates of GPP. Overall, rates of GPP were closely balanced by rates of ER such that NAP fluctuated between slight heterotrophy and slight autotrophy in all macrophyte patches in spring and summer before the pond was covered with Lemna. Traits of aquatic macrophytes (e.g., presence of vascular tissue, growth form) produced patchiness in rates of metabolism within a season, whereas hydrology and interactions among macrophytes (shading and allelopathic compounds) drove seasonal changes in metabolism.

The results show that (1) the frequency of single station ECEs (SSECEs) in winter increases from southeast to northwest, with a decrease before 2008 and then a significant increase. This trend abrupt change occurs in late winter. (2) When the SST in the North Pacific shows an "El-Nino-like" anomaly in winter, it triggers the negative Arctic Oscillation (-AO), positive Pacific North America (+PNA), and positive Eurasia Pacific (+EUP) atmospheric teleconnection patterns in the mid-lower troposphere. As a result, the ridge to south of Lake Baikal becomes stronger. Meanwhile, SST in the North Atlantic shows a "reversed C" negative anomaly with North Atlantic Oscillation (+NAO), (+PNA)-like and (+EUP)-like patterns, and the ridge to southwest of Lake Baikal becomes stronger. Furthermore, both cause the Siberian High to become weaker in the north and stronger in the south. With the weaker East Asia subtropical jet and stronger East Asia winter monsoon, these factors lead to a significant increase of SSECE frequency in North China. (3) When the SSTA shows an "El Nino-like" developing pattern from summer to autumn in the North Pacific, the winter SSECE frequency will be higher. (4) The purported mechanism between the mid-latitude SSTA and the winter SSECE frequency in North China is the following: the SSTA in the North Pacific in summer and autumn excites atmospheric teleconnection wave trains, and the Atlantic stores these anomaly signals. In winter, the interaction between the SSTAs in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic enhances the Eurasian teleconnection wave train. With the upstream fluctuation energy dispersing downstream, the wave train centers move eastward with the season, resulting in an increase in the frequency of the SSECEs.					; Zhao, Yong/Z-3231-2019	GaoHui, Hui/0000-0002-4381-1415; Li, Liping/0000-0003-0976-8051													1687-9309	1687-9317				MAR 9	2021	2021								8853457	10.1155/2021/8853457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/8853457													WOS:000631979500001

In order to evaluate the seasonal changes of the constituents of POC in a temperate sea area, the proportion of autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton biomass in POC was measured for different seasons. At both a coastal and an offshore station in the northern Baltic Sea, POC was dominated by unidentified detritus material. Autotrophic microplankton dominated the plankton biomass in spring, and free-living heterotrophic bacteria in autumn and winter. The remaining plankton groups were of minor importance. The ratio of autotrophic plankton carbon to chlorophyll a (chl a) was determined by frequent sampling, and varied between 5 and 70 (mug l-1/mug l-1), lowest in autumn-winter and highest in spring. Such variability makes it difficult to use constant conversion factors of chl a and POC to quantify plankton biomasses, and emphasizes the need for careful determination of conversion factors for specific environments and seasons.																			0171-8630					MAY	1993	95	1-2					133	139		10.3354/meps095133	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps095133													WOS:A1993LE69200013

Employing a systematic approach, 26 sampling stations were strategically selected to collect surface water samples at a depth of 50 cm during the midpoints of each season throughout 2019. Significant seasonal variations in water quality parameters and phytoplankton composition were observed. Predominant species included Chrysophyceae (38%) and Bacillariophyceae (32%), indicative of nutrient-rich conditions, particularly during spring and summer, as evidenced by the eutrophic state (Carlson Trophic State Index: 59.43 and 53.96, respectively). Summer exhibited the highest diversity (Shannon-Wiener Index = 2.27) and lowest evenness (Pielou's Evenness Index = 0.21). PCA and CCA analyses revealed season-specific preferences for nutrients and ions among phytoplankton species. Water temperature emerged as a crucial factor in spring and summer, while environments with elevated bicarbonate and alkalinity levels were less favorable during winter and fall. This study provides essential insights into Karun-4 Lake's dynamic ecological conditions, underscoring the necessity for ongoing monitoring to discern long-term trends and anthropogenic impacts for effective ecosystem management.					; Saadat, Mohsen/AAI-2739-2021; Avokh, Avid/AAG-6611-2020	Avokh, Avid/0000-0002-8458-8213; Zamani-Ahmadmahmoodi, Rasool/0000-0001-8375-9781; 													2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2024	14	7							158	10.1007/s13201-024-02222-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-024-02222-2													WOS:001250801400001
J	Courtois, R; Labonté, J; Ouellet, JP				Courtois, R; Labonté, J; Ouellet, JP			Movements and location of home range of Moose, Alces Alces, in eastern Quebec	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Fifty-seven Moose (Alces alces) were monitored by telemetry in eastern Quebec between 1989 and 1991, The 1034 telemetry locations allowed characterization of the movement pattern of juvenile Moose and adults of both sexes on a seasonal and yearly basis (i.e. summer, fall, winter). The population was characterised by restricted daily movements, large home ranges, and non-migratory animals. The minimum daily movements varied considerably between individuals but were estimated at 0.22 km/day. Summer minimum daily distances differed significantly (P < 0.01) between juveniles (0.34 km/d), adult females (0.14 km/d) and adult males (0.20 km/d). Minimum daily movements were more important in fall (0.28 km/d) than in winter (0.12 km/d; P < 0.05). In summer, minimum daily movements were intermediate (0.21 km/d) compared to fall and winter values. The total home range size, as estimated with the minimum convex polygon, was 112 km(2) and 131 km(2) respectively for adult females and males and 66 km(2) for juveniles. On an annual basis, home range sizes did not differ (P > 0.05) between juveniles and adults, nor between adult males and females. For females, the smallest home ranges (19 km(2)) were noted in fall. The space utilisation patterns of Moose in eastern Quebec could be influenced by the low population densities, the absence of efficient predators, the low incidence of lakes, and by the skewed sex-ratio towards females induced by heavy hunting.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1998	112	4					602	610																WOS:000079733000004

Our data suggest physical processes associated with deep mixing and inputs of suspended sediments combined to limit planktonic biomass, diversity, and determine vertical distribution. The lake was strongly stratified in summer with a surface mixed layer of 20 m gradually extending down to 100 in by May. Over 50 taxa of phytoplankton were recorded. Changes in vertical distribution of most planktonic groups coincided with changes in the depth of vertical mixing. Phytoplankton biomass increased through summer with a diatom-dominated peak in autumn. Cell numbers however, peaked in spring and were dominated by small chlorophytes. Phytoplankton photosynthetic production was highest in autumn but specific growth rates were highest in summer as a result of greater light availability combined with warmer temperatures. We suggest that large inputs of suspended sediments and glacial silt., may have limited the spring phytoplankton peak which occurs in a number of other temperate lakes. Bacteria and pico-phytoplankton biomass peaked in winter following the phytoplankton peak suggesting they were relying at least in part on scenescing phytoplankton cells For dissolved organic carbon. Diversity of ciliated protozoa was low (I I taxa), Cladocera were absent, and the only crustacean zooplankton found in significant numbers was Boeckella hamata. Ciliated protozoan abundance was low (maximum 4600 litre (1)) and peaked in summer (January-March). Copepod nauplii peaked in August and peaks in abundance of copepodites and adults followed in September and November-January respectively. Only two generations occurred during the year. The peak in copepod biomass followed phytoplankton peaks but lagged 1-2 months probably as a result of slow growth rates and the time for response to phytoplankton peaks.																			0028-8330					JUN	2001	35	2					239	253		10.1080/00288330.2001.9516995	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2001.9516995													WOS:000170521600004
J	Hodgkins, GA; Dudley, RW; Huntington, TG				Hodgkins, GA; Dudley, RW; Huntington, TG			Changes in the timing of high river flows in New England over the 20th Century	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The annual timing of river flows is a good indicator of climate-related changes, or lack of changes, for rivers with long-term data that drain unregulated basins with stable land use. Changes in the timing of annual winter/spring (January 1 to May 3 1) and fall (October 1 to December 3 1) center of volume dates were analyzed for 27 rural, unregulated river gaging stations in New England, USA with an average of 68 years of record. The center of volume date is the date by which half of the total volume of water for a given period of time flows past a river gaging station, and is a measure of the timing of the bulk of flow within the time period. Winter/spring center of volume (WSCV) dates have become significantly earlier (p < 0.1) at all 11 river gaging stations in areas of New England where snowmelt runoff has the most effect on spring river flows. Most of this change has occurred in the last 30 years with dates advancing by 1-2 weeks. WSCV dates were correlated with March through April air temperatures (r = -0.72) and with January precipitation (r = -0.37). Three of 16 river gaging stations in the remainder of New England had significantly earlier WSCV dates. Four out of 27 river gaging stations had significantly earlier fall center of volume dates in New England. Changes in the timing of winter/spring and fall peak flow dates were consistent with the changes in the respective center of volume dates, given the greater variability in the peak flow dates. Changes in the WSCV dates over the last 30 years are consistent with previous studies of New England last-frost dates, lilac bloom dates, lake ice-out dates, and spring air temperatures. This suggests that these New England spring geophysical and biological changes all were caused by a common mechanism, temperature increases. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Although the conditions for reproduction may seem unfavorable during winter, the lake is inhabited by a major endemic winter-reproducing amphipod species complex. Compared with Baikal's summer-reproducing amphipod species, the duration of a reproduction cycle in the winter-reproducing species is more extended. We hence hypothesized that in those species, reproduction-related processes dependent on external resources are scheduled to occur outside of winter when the conditions are more advantageous. To receive insights into the ongoing processes, we analyzed sex-specific seasonal proteome dynamics in Eulimnogammarus verrucosus as a representative of the winter-reproducing amphipod species. Individuals of the species were collected during five field samplings from the beginning of fall to the following summer (2019/2020) and their proteomes were analyzed. Especially, the female proteomes were dominated by sampling time point-specific hallmarks of reproduction-related processes and events. It was evident that the formation of the oocytes in female E. verrucosus already took place in the summer. Embryo development, not depending on external resources but fueled by the yolk reserves in the egg, proceeded over the winter, and juveniles hatched from the eggs in the following spring. Adjustments of the amphipods of both sexes to environmental winter conditions were reflected by abundance changes of digestive system-related enzymes, indicating a proteome response to seasonal diet changes, and of enzymes involved in RNA biosynthesis, protein folding, and homeoviscous adaptation processes, possibly related to decreasing water temperatures. The characteristics of the proteome dynamics revealed here, set in relation to season-specific environmental parameters, indicate a strategy of a cold-adapted amphipod to cope with the unique and extreme environmental conditions of Baikal, which is directed to the pace and timing of the resource-dependent reproduction-related processes.

Nutrient and environmental factors regulating western Lake Erie cyanobacterial blooms	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Over the past two decades, western Lake Erie has experienced recurring summer cyanobacterial blooms that pose severe negative impacts on human, animal, and ecological health. Previous research has identified a strong correlation between annual cyanobacterial bloom intensity and preceding spring (March-July) phosphorus loading from the Maumee river, the largest tributary to western Lake Erie, which is used to predict upcoming summer bloom severity. Maumee river spring phosphorus load, however, does not explain all the variation of bloom severity between years. Considering additional environmental parameters may help to better capture the physical and biogeochemical processes that regulate bloom severity, eventually leading to improved cyanobacterial forecasts which serve as an early warning for Lake Erie stakeholders. We aggregated various environmental parameters that may influence western Lake Erie cyanobacterial blooms to examine these factors as potential predictors for annual bloom severity. These included nitrogen and phosphorus loading from the Maumee river, freshwater discharge from the primary rivers and tributaries (Detroit, Huron, Raisin, Maumee, and Portage rivers), seasonal lake surface water temperature (mean winter, spring, and summer temperature), and Lake Erie winter ice extent and duration from 2002-2022. Empirical model results show that spring phosphorus loading, as total bioavailable phosphorus, from the Maumee river remains the dominant environmental factor controlling cyanobacterial blooms. However, additional environmental factors, such as Maumee river winter phosphorus loads and Lake Erie winter ice extent and timing, are likely important in modulating bloom severity, particularly in years with moderate phosphorus loads. Finally, we suggest incorporating mechanistic or rule-based models, in addition to empirical models, to better understand and predict annual cyanobacterial bloom severity. The updated models not only improve seasonal forecast accuracy which provides advanced warning of bloom severity to Lake Erie stakeholders, but also helps identify which factors we can better manage to reduce the frequency of severe blooms.

J	Li, XH; Ye, XC; Li, Z; Zhang, D				Li, Xianghu; Ye, Xuchun; Li, Zhen; Zhang, Dan			Hydrological drought in two largest river-connecting lakes in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, China	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Poyang and Dongting Lakes are two important river-connecting lakes with a complicated water system pattern in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Recently, extreme drought events occurred frequently in the two lakes. This study analyzed the characteristics and differences of hydrological droughts in Poyang and Dongting Lakes during the period of 1964-2016 and explored the correlation between drought and large-scale climate indices. The results showed that the hydrological droughts of Poyang and Dongting Lakes became increasingly serious. Especially after 2003, both lakes entered the dry season earlier and the intensity of drought was increased. The hydrological drought of Poyang Lake was more serious than that of Dongting Lake in spring (16.40%) and winter (14.26%), while the autumn drought in Dongting Lake (32.46%) was severer than that in Poyang Lake (27.65%). The spring droughts in the two lakes were significantly associated with droughts in their local catchments with the joint probabilities of 10.84 and 9.52%, while the autumn droughts were consistent with the hydrological droughts of the Yangtze River with large joint probabilities (26.39 and 27.76%). The changes in large-scale climate indices more significantly affected the drought in Poyang Lake than that in Dongting Lake, especially in autumn and winter.					; Li, Zhen/ABD-1362-2021	Li, Xianghu/0000-0001-9934-1822; 													1998-9563	2224-7955				JAN	2023	54	1					82	98		10.2166/nh.2023.110	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2023.110													WOS:000940996000006

The questions posed are derived generally from archaeological studies of Upper Paleolithic record in Europe. We document the active Nenets summer camps at lakes and the abandoned winter and spring camps in the open tundra and the forest tundra. Analysis of the floral and zoological resources shows that plant resources and fish are available predominantly in the summer while reindeer are abundant in these regions in fall and winter when they return from summer pastures further north. When natural resources are not available, groups supplement with food purchased at shops. Within these living camps, "structures evidentes" and "structures latentes" of classical French paleoethnology cannot be distinguished as clearly as at Upper Paleolithic sites: and architectural remains, ash from hearths, and other objects may be removed from the central areas towards the site peripheries. However the investigated camps preserve a discrete structure with interior living areas (including children's playgrounds), exterior areas with evidence of reindeer carcass processing, woodworking, and other activities, peripheral toss zones, and dispersed activity remains in the surrounding landscape.

The Sinos River sampling program included 86 sites, sampled from 1998 to 2014, covering lowland stretches and headwater streams. The Guaiba sampling program was conducted from February 2011 to March 2013 and comprised 59 independent samples. Six fish species using estuarine areas occur in the upper Patos basin, 250-500 km from the Patos Lagoon outlet to the Atlantic Ocean. Parapimelodus nigribarbis specimens ranged from 11.3 to 18.9 cm (median = 13.3 cm) in length, i.e., were adults (Sinos, n = 459; Guaiba, n = 149). The species was captured almost 500 km from the Patos outlet, as far as 180 km upstream in the Sinos main channel. In Guaiba Lake, the species was captured mainly in autumn, although it was more abundant in winter and spring in the Sinos River. Lycengraulis grossidens was captured in the Sinos Basin, restricted to the lower stretches in spring and summer months (n = 7). In Guaiba Lake (n = 134) the species occurred throughout the lake and year-round, and was ten times more abundant in spring. Most specimens were adult (8.2-26.9 cm, median = 20.0 cm). Most Micropogonias furnieri individuals (n = 63) were juveniles (10.7-33.4 cm, median = 14.2 cm). The species was not captured in the Sinos Basin. In Guaiba Lake M. furnieri occurred predominantly in the southernmost part (downstream) and was more abundant (> 10x) in winter. Genidens genidens (n = 27) was captured only in summer in the southern part of Guaiba Lake (closest to the outlet). Most individuals were adults (24.5-34.0 cm, median = 27.8 cm). Genidens barbus (n = 7) was restricted to spring and summer months and was captured only in southern (near-outlet) parts of Guaiba Lake, comprising mainly large juveniles and adults (31.5-68.0 cm, median = 37.9). Mugil liza (n = 13) appeared in spring in relatively low abundances but was widespread throughout Guaiba Lake during the summer. The species was not captured in the Sinos sampling program. The size profile comprised specimens nearing maturity (34.3-45.5 cm, median = 38.9 cm). Finally, we suggest possible biological cycles for these species that combine these new distribution data with published information.

Chlorophyll a time series from 56 north-temperate lakes and reservoirs were collected and general patterns in the seasonal distribution of Chl a determined for oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes separately. The magnitude of temporal variation is greater in eutrophic lakes (mean [Chl a] > 12 mg m-3) and is partitioned into discrete spring and fall blooms. Chorophyll a concentrations in oligotrophic lakes (mean [Chl a] < 7 mg m-3) are low for the first 4 months of the year, then increase through April and May. Synchronous summer depressions and fall blooms are not evident for oligotrophic lakes overall. Mean [Chl a] and mean annual air temperature were negatively correlated with the date of spring bloom. The date of spring bloom was not correlated with mean depth.

Ecology Of The Opossum Shrimp (Neomysis mercedis) In A Lower Snake River Reservoir, Washington	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												The opossum shrimp Neomysis mercedis has expanded its range from the lower Columbia River upstream 695 kilometers into Lower Granite Reservoir where it is now very abundant. We studied Neomysis ecology in the reservoir during 2011-2015 to better understand the physical and biological factors that shape their distribution as well as their potential role in the food web. Benthic densities in offshore habitats ranged from 19 to 145 mysids m(-2) in shallow (2-12 m) water and from 3 to 48 mysids m-2 in deep (> 12 m) water. Water velocity, depth, substrate, and seasonal interactions were important variables for explaining variation in Neomysis densities in offshore habitats. During spring, daytime densities in shoreline habitats (< 2 m deep) were variable, but nighttime densities generally decreased in summer following reproduction and as temperatures approached 23 degrees C. Neomysis were mainly collected from the water column during nighttime vertical tows in the downstream end of the reservoir when water velocities were low during summer and autumn. Reproduction occurred mainly in spring and early summer, but a second, smaller reproductive event was observed during autumn. The diet of Neomysis consisted primarily of detritus, rotifers, and copepods, but cladocerans were more prominent during summer and autumn. Physical factors like water velocity may have limited vertical migrations of Neomysis to feed in the water column and influenced use of different habitats in the reservoir. Neomysis are prey for a number of species, including juvenile salmon, but their relations are still largely unknown, and continued monitoring and research is warranted.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				MAY	2017	91	2					124	139		10.3955/046.091.0205	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.091.0205													WOS:000401932900004

For this purpose, we analysed 42 different water samples of running waters from Hesse and Thuringia and additionally of stagnant waters and of a spring from Hesse. For isolating L. lacteus, the baiting technique was used. The simultaneous limnochemical characterisation of the examined waters resulted in information on the trophic status of the lakes and the water quality classification of some rivers. L. lacteus occurred in all three types of waters examined. Based on the number of samples in which it occurred, L. lacteus seems to prefer rivers rather than stagnant waters. L. lacteus could be isolated during the whole year. Nevertheless, most isolates were obtained in winter. Hence, a preference for growth and propagation in winter is postulated.

For spring water the average radon concentration for spring, summer, autumn and summer were found to be 8.21 Bq/l, 8.94 Bq/l, 7.422 Bq/l, and 8.06 Bq/l, respectively, while for lake and streams the average values were found to be 0.43 Bq/l, 0.877 Bq/l, 0.727 Bq/l, 0.575 Bq/l respectively. The radon concentration level was higher in summer and lower in spring, and only two samples from spring water have radon concentrations more than 11.1 Bq/l recommended by the EPA. Total annual effective dose due to ingestion and inhalation has been estimated, the mean annual effective dose during the whole year for spring water was 0.022 mSv/y while for lake with streams was 0.00157 mSv/y. The determined mean annual effective dose in water was lower than the 0.1 mSv/y recommended by WHO.

J	Wei, J; Ji, XN; Hu, W				Wei, Jin; Ji, Xiaonan; Hu, Wei			Characteristics of Phytoplankton Productivity in Three Typical Lake Zones of Taihu, China	SUSTAINABILITY												In lake aquatic ecosystems, which form the material and energy base of lakes, primary production is critical. The present study addresses the characteristics of primary phytoplankton productivity and its relationship with environmental physicochemical factors in three typical zones (algae-type, transition, and grass-type) of the eutrophic Lake Taihu. Seasonal sampling was conducted, and black-white bottle oxygen measurement was used to determine the primary productivity in different water layers in the lake. The results show obvious temporal and spatial differences in the physicochemical factors and phytoplankton productivity in Lake Taihu. The water column productivity and respiration conformed to the following seasonal descending order, summer > fall > spring > winter, and the following regional descending order, algae-type zone > transition zone > grass-type zone. The seasonal proportions of primary productivity were approximately 40% in the summer, 25% in the fall, 20% in the spring, and less than 15% in the winter. The highest values of water layer productivity and respiration were mainly at a depth of 0.2 m and decreased with the water depth. The percentage of productivity at different water layers was 23% (0 m), 31% (0.2 m), 23% (0.4 m), 11% (0.6 m), 7% (0.8 m), and 5% (1 m). The optical compensation depth for Lake Taihu was about 0.8 times the transparency (SD). Spearman correlation indicated that the temperature (T) and water depth (D) had an obvious impact on productivity in all three lake zones. Multiple stepwise regression suggested that T, D, SD, and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) can be used to estimate productivity in different seasons/regions. The main influencing factors on phytoplankton productivity are T, D, Chl-a, and SD in the algae-type and transition zones and T, D, and total suspended solids (TSSs) in the grass-type zone.

The study showed that there was a strong non-linear relationship between Chl.a and environmental factors in spring and autumn, whereas there was a strong linear relationship in summer and winter. Chl.a was redistributed during the ice period, and its concentration in water generally exceeded that in the ice sheet. Characteristics of the ice sheet, including thermal insulation, transparency, and nutrient migration into the water, positively impact phytoplankton growth and reproduction. Therefore, there was no significant difference between Chl.a in winter water and Chl.a in summer water. Although there were differences in the environmental factors affecting the temporal heterogeneity of Chl.a over the four seasons, conductivity (Cond.) showed a significant linear or nonlinear effect on Chl.a throughout the year, indicating its important role in regulating the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton. Environmental factors driving the spatial heteroge-neity of Chl.a included the location of the water inlet channel, the distribution of Phragmites, and hydrodynamic conditions. These findings are valuable for understanding the seasonal variation of Chlorophyll-a and preventing eutrophication and algal blooms in cold and arid lakes.					; shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024; Wang, Shihuan/OBO-1586-2025	Yu, Haifeng/0000-0002-4406-3658; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				APR	2023	148								110133	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110133		MAR 2023											WOS:000959123500001

Assessment of water quality index and multivariate analysis of high altitude sacred Lake Prashar, Himachal Pradesh, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A study was carried out to analyze the physicochemical parameters of sacred lake during November 2015-October 2016. Keeping in view the purpose of the study different analysis has been done to check the water quality of the Prashar Lake. Water quality was evaluated seasonally by using water quality index (WQI), which reflect the defined and future use of water. Different statistical methods: Pearson's correlation, cluster analysis and principal component analysis, were executed for the water quality parameters. WQI ranged between 23 and 50 in different seasons (winter > spring > autumn > summer > monsoon). Cluster analysis of similarity indicated the relationship intensity between the seasons as cluster ranging 77-100% during the study period. PCA identified that water temperature, conductivity, turbidity, BOD, TDS, hardness, calcium, phosphate, sodium and potassium were main parameters which reduced the quality of water during the summer and monsoon seasons. The outcome revealed that the main factors which degrade the water quality in monsoon season were mainly entering of tourist-generated waste and surrounding erosion due to overgrazing on the Prashar Lake area.

Feeding Features of the Nine-Spined Stickleback Pungitius pungitius (Gasterosteidae) In Water Bodies of the North-West of Russia	JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												The diet of the nine-spined stickleback Pungitius pungitius has been studied in two water bodies in the north-west of Russia: in the subarctic lake Krivoe (Karelia) and the estuary of the Neva River (Leningrad Oblast). Diptera larvae (Chironomidae, Ceratopogonidae, Simuliidae, and Limoniidae) and planktonic crustaceans formed the basis of the food bolus of fish; however, their abundance and weight ratios differed in the studied water bodies. The seasonal changes of the dominant groups of food objects of the stickleback of Lake Krivoe have been revealed. Additionally to invertebrates and fish eggs, which form the basis of the stickleback diet in winter season, aquatic mosses as well as filamentous and diatom algae present in the fish diet in summer. The comparison of the nitrogen isotope composition of the muscles of stickleback, perch, and invertebrates shows that the stickleback of Lake Krivoe occupies the third trophic level, approaching predatory fish in delta N-15 values (5.2-8.6 parts per thousand). A specific feature of the diet patterns of P. pungitius is the transition from a diverse diet of the summer-autumn period to a monotrophic animal diet (chironomid larvae and fish eggs) of the under-ice winter-spring period.					; Berezina, Nadezhda/R-1968-2016	Berezina, Nadezhda/0000-0003-3057-5596; 													0032-9452	1555-6425				APR	2023	63	2					309	318		10.1134/S0032945223020029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0032945223020029													WOS:001120177500001

Growth and migration of parabolic dunes along the southeastern Coast of Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Our goal was to uncover the geomorphic history of large parabolic dunes along the southeastern coast of Lake Michigan. We mapped dune paleosols, obtained radiocarbon and OSL dates, and measured contemporary wind patterns, sand transport and sand deposition with arrays of anemometers, wind vanes, sand traps and pins. Dune paleosols were divided into 4 units. The Basal Soil was buried during the Nipissing I transgression. Older members of the Lower Entisol Series were buried by a pulse of dune growth corresponding with the rise to and fall from Nipissing II high lake levels. Younger members of the Lower Entisol Series were buried during the inland migration of parabolic dunes that ended with a period of stability marked by an Inceptisol (The Holland Geosol). The Inceptisol was buried during a period of remobilization beginning before the arrival of European settlers and continuing today. Measurements on a typical, large parabolic dune showed that sand was deposited on upper and mid lee slopes during the fall and winter. Over steepened slopes were maintained through the winter by ice between sandgrains. Slopes collapsed during the spring thaw and sand arrived at the base of the dune through mass wasting. Roughly 50% of deposition on the lee slope was associated with the two highest energy wind events. Very little deposition occurred in late spring and summer. Deposition along the lee slope reaches a maximum along the axis and falls off rapidly towards the limbs reflecting the topographic steering of winds within the trough.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				WIN	2006					39		209	214																WOS:000202961300039

Average sediment accumulation rates calculated from varve thicknesses range from 48 cm/yr, 3.4 km from Hubbard Glacier at the head of the Bay, to 14 cm/yr, 15 km away, Sediment accumulation rates estimated from Pb-210 dating of core sediments are in the same range, Deposits from the 1986 Russell Fiord outburst flood are identified from anomalously high Pb-210 activities in sediments indicating an alternative sediment source to Disenchantment Bay. Glacimarine varves are a dating tool for the barren proximal sediments commonly deposited near calving glacier termini. They yield paleoclimatic information because they are a product of both glacial ice in the sea and laminated sediments deposited from significant meltwater discharge found in a temperate to subpolar climate.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				MAY	1997	67	3	A				536	549																WOS:A1997XA56300017
J	Baffico, GD				Baffico, Gustavo D.			Spatial and seasonal changes in a naturally acidified river (Rio Agrio, Argentina) and their effect on epilithic algae	INLAND WATERS												This study investigated seasonal changes in the longitudinal pH gradient of a naturally acidified river and how the attributes of epilithic algae (biomass, abundance, diversity) react to these variations. Five sites were selected on the Rio Agrio river for in situ measurements, water sampling, and epilithic algae collection in different seasons from 2007 to 2018. Water pH increased along the length of the river, the average increase being highest in summer (from 2.5 to 7.0, acidity to neutrality) and lowest in spring (from 2.8 to 4.0, acidity to acidity). Conductivity and nutrient and ion concentrations decreased along the length of the river, showing a seasonal pattern of variation mainly influenced by the hydrological cycle. Epilithic algal biomass varied seasonally along the river, generally increasing in summer and decreasing in spring, with seasonal maximum values at different locations mainly associated with the dynamics of iron precipitation and nutrient availability. Species diversity and numbers were low at the most acidic site (regardless of season), but in the remaining sites these attributes tended to increase during summer-autumn and decrease during winter-spring. Statistical analysis showed that differences between sites responded mainly to the chemical gradient of the river and seasonality. Therefore, seasonal changes in the longitudinal chemical gradient of the river imposed differential, changing conditions on the epilithic algae present in each site, allowing identification of characteristic zones and their respective epilithic algal attributes. In the context of proposed models of ecosystem response to stress, similarities with systems acidified by anthropic activities are discussed.

Landscape Movements of Migratory Birds and Bats Reveal an Expanded Scale of Stopover	PLOS ONE												Many species of birds and bats undertake seasonal migrations between breeding and over-wintering sites. En-route, migrants alternate periods of flight with time spent at stopover - the time and space where individuals rest and refuel for subsequent flights. We assessed the spatial scale of movements made by migrants during stopover by using an array of automated telemetry receivers with multiple antennae to track the daily location of individuals over a geographic area similar to 20x40 km. We tracked the movements of 322 individuals of seven migratory vertebrate species (5 passerines, 1 owl and 1 bat) during spring and fall migratory stopover on and adjacent to a large lake peninsula. Our results show that many individuals leaving their capture site relocate within the same landscape at some point during stopover, moving as much as 30 km distant from their site of initial capture. We show that many apparent nocturnal departures from stopover sites are not a resumption of migration in the strictest sense, but are instead relocations that represent continued stopover at a broader spatial scale.

SEASONAL DYNAMICS AND WATER QUALITY ASSESSMENT IN SHILAN RESERVOIR, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Eutrophication, caused by excessive nutrient enrichment, is a major challenge to global aquatic ecosystems, particularly in regions with high anthropogenic pressures. Reservoirs, as critical water resources, are significantly impacted by nutrient dynamics influenced by climatic and hydrological factors. This study examines the seasonal dynamics of water quality in Shilan Reservoir, Linyi City, Shandong Province, China, emphasizing the impact of nutrient fluctuations on eutrophication and management strategies. Sampling at nine sites across four seasons revealed distinct seasonal trends in water quality indicators, including total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). TN levels in the summer ranged from inferior Class V (summer) to 6.20 mg/L (winter), while TP varied from 0.28 mg/L (spring) to 0.35 mg/L (winter), both exceeding permissible limits. Other parameters, such as pH, chemical oxygen demand, and biochemical oxygen demand, exhibited seasonal variations influenced by temperature and biological activity. Despite detectable levels of nitrate, iron, and manganese, these remained within acceptable standards, as did trace contaminants like heavy metals. The findings highlight a high nutrient load contributing to eutrophication, particularly in summer and autumn. The study underscores the need for targeted nutrient management strategies to control TN and TP, coupled with advanced monitoring technologies such as remote sensing for real-time assessments. These efforts aim to improve reservoir health and mitigate ecological risks, providing insights into sustainable water resource management under changing climatic conditions.

About once every 6 yr, the ice cover remains through the entire summer, creating a residual ice cover the following winter. Residual ice covers are more frequent in the last 10 yr (1986-1995) than in the 20 yr from 1959 to 1978, indicating a reduction in climate factors controlling ice decay. These factors are identified as the number of thawing degree-days, suggesting a tendency toward cooler summers over the last decade. We report year-round meteorology observations that indicate a mean annual temperature of about -15.2 degrees C, with similar to 500 thawing degree-days in summer. Following a residual ice year, spring lake-water temperatures are significantly greater than they are following nonresidual years. The increased temperatures can be attributed to the stabilizing effect of the residual ice pan the previous fall. Without an ice pan, convection cools the entire water column before the surface freezes. When the lake has an ice pan at the start of freezing, the surface freezes over quickly, effectively trapping water heated during summer. The warmer spring water temperatures act as negative feedback, decreasing the potential for a second consecutive residual ice year.

Seasonal Behavior of the CO2 Gas Exchange Process in the "Atmosphere-Water" System of Littoral Zone of Southern Baikal. 3. Autumn	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												This paper is the next in a series of publications dealing with the analysis of seasonal features of the carbon dioxide exchange process in the littoral of the Southern Baikal during the open-water period, and devoted to results obtained during the fall period. It is shown that variations in the concentrations of dissolved gases and biogenic elements in the surface waters of the Lake Baikal littoral during fall are opposite in character to the process observed during the spring-summer period. The concentrations of carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrates, and phosphates increase from the second half of September toward December. The sink of CO2 from the atmosphere into the water surface is still observed during early October in the Baikal littoral, with its diurnal budget being comparable in value to the daily average sink during the period of hydrological summer. The daily average CO2 flux reverses sign in November, and the lake surface becomes a source supplying carbon dioxide to the near-water atmosphere; the CO2 supply rate keeps increasing and reaches a maximum level during December, i.e., until the beginning of freezing-over period. At the beginning of this period, an additional small CO2 amount can be expected to be supplied to the atmosphere of the littoral zone due to the process of premorning freezing and a subsequent ice melt.

J	Weithoff, G; Rocha, MR; Gaedke, U				Weithoff, Guntram; Rocha, Marcia R.; Gaedke, Ursula			Comparing seasonal dynamics of functional and taxonomic diversity reveals the driving forces underlying phytoplankton community structure	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												In most biodiversity studies, taxonomic diversity is the measure for the multiplicity of species and is often considered to represent functional diversity. However, trends in taxonomic diversity and functional diversity may differ, for example, when many functionally similar but taxonomically different species co-occur in a community. The differences between these diversity measures are of particular interest in diversity research for understanding diversity patterns and their underlying mechanisms. We analysed a temporally highly resolved 20-year time series of lake phytoplankton to determine whether taxonomic diversity and functional diversity exhibit similar or contrasting seasonal patterns. We also calculated the functional mean of the community in n-dimensional trait space for each sampling day to gain further insights into the seasonal dynamics of the functional properties of the community. We found an overall weak positive relationship between taxonomic diversity and functional diversity with a distinct seasonal pattern. The two diversity measures showed synchronous behaviour from early spring to mid-summer and a more complex and diverging relationship from autumn to late winter. The functional mean of the community exhibited a recurrent annual pattern with the most prominent changes before and after the clear-water phase. From late autumn to winter, the functional mean of the community and functional diversity were relatively constant while taxonomic diversity declined, suggesting competitive exclusion during this period. A further decline in taxonomic diversity concomitant with increasing functional diversity in late winter to early spring is seen as a result of niche diversification together with competitive exclusion. Under these conditions, several different sets of traits are suitable to thrive, but within one set of functional traits only one, or very few, morphotypes can persist. Taxonomic diversity alone is a weak descriptor of trait diversity in phytoplankton. However, the combined analysis of taxonomic diversity and functional diversity, along with the functional mean of the community, allows for deeper insights into temporal patterns of community assembly and niche diversification.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2015	60	4					758	767		10.1111/fwb.12527	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12527													WOS:000351213000013

The majority of birds wintered in lakes in East Africa and the southeast Mediterranean was the most important stopover area. Larus f.fuscus along the eastern flyway travelled at a net travel speed of 399 and 177km/day during the autumn and spring migration, respectively, higher than published travel speeds for Dutch Larus fuscus migrating along the western flyway.

Seasonal changes in microbial community structure and activity imply winter production is linked to summer hypoxia in a large lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Carbon and nutrient cycles in large temperate lakes such as Lake Erie are primarily driven by phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms, although our understanding of these is often constrained to late spring through summer due to logistical constraints. During periods of >90% ice cover in February of 2008, 2009, and 2010, we collected samples from an icebreaker for an examination of bacterial production as well as microbial community structure. In comparison with summer months (August 2002 and 2010), we tested hypotheses concerning seasonal changes in microbial community diversity and production. Bacterial production estimates were c. 2 orders of magnitude higher (volume normalized) in summer relative to winter. Our observations further demonstrate that the microbial community, including single-celled phototrophs, varied in composition between August and February. Sediment traps deployed and collected over a 3year period (2008-2011) confirmed that carbon export was ongoing and not limiting winter production. The results support the notion that active primary producers in winter months export carbon to the sediments that is not consumed until the warmer seasons. The establishment of this linkage is a critical observation in efforts to understand the extent and severity of annual summertime formations of a zone of regional hypoxia in Lake Erie.					; McKay, Robert/P-3759-2017; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008; Saxton, Matthew/A-4426-2012; Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010	Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896; McKay, Robert/0000-0003-2723-5371; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077; LeCleir, Gary/0000-0002-0228-7557; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				FEB	2014	87	2					475	485		10.1111/1574-6941.12238	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12238								24164471					WOS:000331262700015

Seeds were dormant at maturity in autumn, and dormancy break occurred over a range of temperatures (5, 15/6, 20/10, 25/15 and 30/15-degrees-C), with 30/15-degrees-C being optimal. Seeds required light for germination. Seeds were buried in flooded and nonflooded soil in October and exposed to natural seasonal temperature changes. Seeds reach minimal dormancy (i. e., germinated over the widest range of temperatures) by the following June or July. Some dormancy loss occurred during winter, but the remainder took place as temperatures increased from February through May or June. After the initial (primary) dormancy was broken, exhumed seeds germinated to 80-100 % at 35/20-degrees-C and to 45-100 % at 30/15-degrees-C in all seasons of the year, while germination at 25/15-degrees-C reached a maximum (20-100 %) in summer and a minimum (0 %) in winter. Thus, seeds exhibited an annual nondormancy/conditional dormancy cycle. The temperatures required for germination of nondormant seeds overlap with those in the habitat from mid-May to mid- to late September. Consequently, seeds can germinate at any time during summer, whenever water levels drop and the mud is exposed.																			1146-609X	1873-6238					1993	14	5					693	704																WOS:A1993NP73100009
J	Saarni, S; Saarinen, T; Dulski, P				Saarni, Saija; Saarinen, Timo; Dulski, Peter			Between the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Siberian High: A 4000-year snow accumulation history inferred from varved lake sediments in Finland	HOLOCENE												Clastic-organic varved sediments from the boreal Lake Kalliojarvi, Central Finland, record changes in snow accumulation for more than 4000 years. The varve record was reconstructed using digital image analysis from 4132 varve yr BP to present with 2.2% counting error and is supported by paleomagnetic data. Two laminae are identified in a typical varve structure: (1) the minerogenic lamina, which accumulates during spring as a result of catchment erosion triggered by spring floods and (2) the organic lamina, which is composed of allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter that accumulates during summer, autumn, and winter. The minerogenic influx is related to variations in snow accumulation and follows the different phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Decreased snow accumulation is related to a weakened NAO phase. Thus, the minerogenic influx record provides additional information about NAO variation. The Fe/Mn ratio is related to changes in redox conditions at the lake floor. The oxygen availability in the lake floor depends on the duration of the ice cover during winter. Strengthened Siberian High (SH) causes colder autumn and winter temperatures and therefore leads to extended duration of ice cover. Fe/Mn can be considered as a proxy for SH. The sediment record suggests pronounced, generally positive but strongly fluctuating NAO phase, from ca. 4100 to 3200 varve yr BP. Periods of strengthened SH are observed at 3900-3600, 1900-1500, and 1200-750 varve yr BP. Our study suggests that NAO and SH operate individually, are not clearly linked, and do not entirely block each other.

Seasonal Movement Patterns and Summertime Use of Thermal Refuge Areas by Muskellunge in the Nontidal Potomac River, Maryland	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The nontidal Potomac River is Maryland's most popular freshwater fishery, largely due to the multiple angling opportunities and accessibility. Increasing popularity of the Muskellunge Esox masquinongy fishery has prompted further investigation of Muskellunge seasonal movement patterns and summer habitat use during thermally stressful periods. Radiotelemetry was used to investigate seasonal movement and summertime habitat use by Muskellunge in the Potomac River from 2017 to 2020. Movement was greatest during spring, with reduced movement during summer, fall, and winter. Potomac River main-stem temperatures during summer often exceeded levels considered stressful to Muskellunge. During thermally stressful periods, Muskellunge sought thermal refugia and movements ceased. A generalized linear mixed model predicted that (1) when daily average temperatures reached 24.0 degrees C, over 50% of the Muskellunge habitually occupied thermal refugia and (2) at 26.0 degrees C, greater than 90% of tagged Muskellunge were located in refuge sites. Aggregation of Muskellunge in thermal refugia during summer has implications for increased angling vulnerability and fishing mortality in a warming climate, which could potentially limit the quality of these sport fisheries in southern river systems.

J	Svensson, JE				Svensson, JE			Sex differences in habitat distribution of a planktonic copepod, Eudiaptomus gracilis	ECOGRAPHY												The spatial distribution of adult males and females in a population of the copepod Eudiaptomus gracilis was studied throughout one year. The sexes were markedly segregated in spring and under ice in late winter. This skewed distribution was mainly due to a strong concentration of females in deep water in the lake centre. Males were more evenly distributed but dominated in relative terms strongly over females near the surface and the littoral zone. Among females, those carrying eggs were most concentrated in deep regions. Also during summer, females in the lake centre showed a marked abundance peak in deep water but the distribution of egg-carrying females did not differ from ether females. During autumn and early winter, differences in the distribution of the sexes were minor. The distribution of the sexes is discussed in relation to predators, temperature, food, and mates. Female copepods are susceptible to fish predation when carrying eggs. Fish may contribute to the over-representation of females in deep regions by eating or scaring away this category of vulnerable prey from littoral areas and from the surface waters. The fish predation hypothesis does not accurately predict the seasonal occurrence of the skewed distribution, however. Feeding rate of fish is most likely low under ice. Reproductive advantages in the warmer deep water may have contributed to female choice of habitat in late winter. In spring and late winter proportionally fewer females near the surface and shore carried eggs, but they carried more spermatophores. This indicates that these females were more receptive to matings. Phytoplankton biomass was higher near the surface. Thus, males may have gained mating advantages and more food by avoiding deep water in the centre of the lake.																			0906-7590	1600-0587				AUG	1997	20	4					407	416		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00386.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00386.x													WOS:A1997XN46600010
J	Chomérat, N; Garnier, R; Bertrand, C; Cazaubon, A				Chomerat, Nicolas; Garnier, Robert; Bertrand, Celine; Cazaubon, Arlette			Seasonal succession of cyanoprokaryotes in a hypereutrophic oligo-mesohaline lagoon from the South of France	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The Bolmon lagoon (South of France) is an oligo-mesohaline coastal lagoon that has undergone intense eutrophication in the past decades, resulting from a strong concentration of human activities in its drainage basin. Consequently, it exhibits some characteristics typical of an advanced trophic state; namely, the disappearance of submerged vegetation, the permanently intense phytoplankton growth and the recurrence of cyanoprokaryote blooms. As cyanoprokaryote dominance in south-temperate saline lagoons is little reported, we carried out this study in order to understand the seasonal variations in the phytoplankton composition and biomass, and to analyse the influence of environmental parameters such as salinity, nutrients and climate on the seasonal succession of species. In this lagoon, the phytoplankton was permanently dominated by cyanoprokaryotes, probably because of high availability of nutrients, low light penetration in the water column and frequent turbulent mixing induced by wind. The two most abundant species Planktothrix agardhii (in winter-spring) and Pseudanabaena limnetica (in summer) have low light requirements and are well adapted to a high mixing frequency, which defines the S I functional group in Reynolds' typology for phytoplankton. Although widely studied in north-temperate lakes, blooms of these typically freshwater species are almost unreported in the Mediterranean area, especially in brackish ecosystems that are not their normal habitat. In the Bolmon lagoon, all their requirements for nutrients, light and mixing are satisfied and they seem to cope with a moderate presence of salt but P. agardhii was less competitive than P. limnetica at highest salinities, the latter being probably more halophytic. Contrary to the observations in lakes located at higher latitudes, the Mediterranean climate seems to induce a typical seasonal pattern of succession characterised by the dominance of P. agardhii (winter) - Chroococcales (spring) - Pseudanabaenaceae (summer) - P. agardhii (autumn, winter). The warm temperatures seemed to have a major influence on the phytoplankton succession, being responsible for the survival of Planktothrix during winter and its rapid and intense development in early spring. Intense mixing and high irradiance in summer promoted the development of Pseudanabaenaceae, as reported in another south-temperate lagoon, the Albufera of Valencia (Spain). The ecological success of Oscillatoriales observed in the Bolmon lagoon is a perfect example of a shift to the "turbid stable state" as proposed for freshwater shallow lakes only. Our work demonstrated that hypereutrophic Mediterranean lagoons can function very similarly to shallow lakes at higher latitudes; but the warmer climate and higher irradiances are probably responsible for differences in the seasonal pattern of species dominance.

Migration, homing and spatial ecology of common carp in interconnected lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The common carp, Cyprinus carpio, is a large, long-lived, fecund and mobile cyprinid, which evolved in complex inter-braided Ponto-Caspian rivers that experience both springtime flooding and freezing winters. Studies suggest adults often move to productive, shallow lakes and floodplains to spawn because they often lack egg predators and then return to deeper normoxic waters to overwinter. Whether these movements involve individuals consistently selecting, or homing to, the same spawning and refuge lakes as part of a strategy benefiting their reproductive success is unknown. To address this question, we examined the movements of 67 radio-tagged adult carp for 3 years in a watershed with 11 interconnected lakes. Carp were tagged and released into a centrally located, normoxic deep lake in spring and fall. Each spring over 95% of its adults left via a single stream and swam into one of 5 shallow lakes, with most individuals (84%) selecting the same lake(s) in which to spawn each year (median Bhattacharyya affinity coefficient of similarity of 0.82). Young were later found in those lakes without egg predators, which cannot survive winter anoxia. After spawning, carp spent summers moving between productive lakes in an individualistic fashion, presumably foraging, with most (89%) eventually returning to the same deep lake to overwinter (median Bhattacharyya affinity of 1.0). These movements appear to reveal a life-history tactic involving seasonal homing migration, first to a spawning location and later to winter refuges, that is well adapted to productive but highly heterogeneous and interconnected freshwater environments.					; Fieberg, John/Y-3988-2019	Sorensen, Peter/0000-0003-0321-1279; Banet, Nathan/0000-0002-8537-1702													0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2022	31	1					164	176		10.1111/eff.12622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12622		JUL 2021											WOS:000671757600001

Spatial and temporal dynamics of methane and carbon dioxide fluxes in a constructed wetland	JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING												Constructed wetlands (CWs) are increasingly adopted as a nature-based solution for wastewater treatment. However, given their affinity with natural wetlands and high degradation of organic pollutants, their classification as a sustainable 'green' technology is questioned due to potentially high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from natural wetlands and ponds have been widely studied, fluxes from CWs remain underexplored. To address this knowledge gap, CH4 and CO2 fluxes were measured from the Ingoldisthorpe integrated CW and an adjacent natural pond, located in the UK using the floating chamber method with gas chromatography, alongside climate and water quality monitoring. Mean seasonal CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.13 +/- 0.18 mg CH4 m-2 h- 1 (autumn) to 20.52 +/- 45.01 mg CH4 m- 2 h- 1 (spring), with ebullition contributing 25-93 % of total spring-summer CH4 flux. When CH4 was converted to CO2 equivalents, the CH4:CO2 seasonal ratio revealed a greater contribution of CH4 to the CW emission potential in spring-summer and CO2 (mg CO2 m-2 h- 1) in autumn-winter, resulting in a mean annual global warming potential (GWP) of 3.76 kg CO2-eq m- 2 year- 1. Temporal temperature variability significantly influenced CH4 ebullitive fluxes, while spatial variability of water depth and velocity were key drivers of CH4 and CO2 diffusive fluxes. The absence of ebullitive flux in the natural pond adjacent to the CWs was attributed to its lower eutrophic conditions than the CWs. However, no significant differences in overall GHG emissions were observed between the CWs and the natural pond. Overall, our findings capture the complex temporal and spatial variability of GHG fluxes in CWs, highlighting the importance of comprehensive sampling to inform more accurate GHG budgeting and support evidence-based design and management strategies for sustainable CW systems.					bending, Gary/A-1197-2010														2214-7144					AUG	2025	76								108130	10.1016/j.jwpe.2025.108130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2025.108130													WOS:001516555600001

Based on synchronous field sampling of the Shahe Reservoir and its inflowing rivers during different seasons, this study explored the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of DOM composition and the influence of river inputs using methods such as parallel factor analysis of three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), We obtained the following results, Reservoir DOM contained four components; humic substance Cl. protein-like tyrosine C2, protein-like tryptophan C3, and terrestrial humic substance C1, with C2 accounting for over 50% of the proportion at most sampling points. composition of reservoir DOM exhibited significant seasonal variation, with humic substance DOM components being lowest in spring, for the main component C2, the content proportions in spring, summer, autumn, and winter were 46.66%, 34.58%. 54.74%, and 56.00%, respectively. River inputs had a decisive impact on the spatial distributions of reservoir DOM, with the contents of components other than tyrosine, the main source of which was domestic sewage, being higher in the river mouth area. Although the DOM input from rivers to reservoirs was mainly terrestrial humic substance C1 (with proportions of 28.80%, 30.51%. 27.11%, and 22. 19% in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively), the degree of humification of DOM in Shahe Reservoir was low, indicating that autochthonous sources dominated the DOM in the reservoir. Autochthonous DOM in the reservoir was mainly related to algal proliferation, and the component of protein-like tryptophan C3 was lincarly significantly positively correlated with chlorophyll-a content (R-0.51, p<0.01). This study is of great significance for improving the water quality of drinking water reservoirs, reducing organic pollution, and ensuring the safety of residents' drinking water.

J	DEMOTT, WR				DEMOTT, WR			SEASONAL SUCCESSION IN A NATURAL DAPHNIA ASSEMBLAGE	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Descriptive data and field experiments were used to examine a seasonal succession between 2 planktonic grazers (D. rosea and D. pulicaria) in a small Vermont [USA] lake. Each year Daphnia populations hatched from resting eggs during May and both species produced numerous parthenogenetic generations before the appearance of males and ephippia in late Sept. During the 2 yr of study, D. rosea had an apparent advantage in spring and early summer, but was rapidly replaced by D. pulicaria during late summer and autumn. These shifts in the species balance were associated with reversals in reproductive success. The species with the higher birth rate also tended to have a lower mortality rate. An analysis of population structure, reproduction and mortality suggests that inter- and intraspecific competition, not fish predation, limited population growth. Field experiments in both small (3.8-l) and large (12,000-l) enclosures demonstrate that the demise of D. rosea during late summer was a direct consequence of competition with D. pulicaria, the outcome of field experiments was sensitive to seasonally changing conditions. During spring and early summer, when D. rosea had a reproductive advantage at low densities in the lake, it was also the stronger competitor at high densities within experimental enclosures. The shift in species advantage during summer seems associated with a changing resource base. In spring the food for grazers was composed mostly of highly edible flagellates, while resistant algae (mostly gelatinous greens) were predominant during late summer and autumn. Grazing experiments and observations on gut contents suggest how D. pulicaria was favored by this change in food conditions. Grazing experiments with a radioactively labeled flagellate (Chlamydomonas) show that the 2 Daphnia species had very similar feeding rates on this alga. Direct observations on the composition of gut contents demonstrate that they ingested virtually identical proportions of common phytoplankton species. Experiments with labeled natural algae and observations on the quantity of ingested algae indicate that D. pulicaria was more effective in utilizing resistant algae.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1983	53	3					321	340		10.2307/1942534	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942534													WOS:A1983RG23600004

Phytostabilization of heavy metals by the emergent macrophyte Vossia cuspidata (Roxb.) Griff.: A phytoremediation approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION												The present study was conducted to investigate the potential of Vossia cuspidata as a phytoremediator to accumulate heavy metals from polluted water bodies. Thirty-two quadrats, distributed equally in eight sites (six polluted sites along the Ismailia canal and two unpolluted sites along the Nile River) were selected seasonally for plant, water, and sediment investigations. Winter plants recorded the highest values of shoot height, diameter, and leaf width, but the lowest shoot density. Plants collected in autumn had the lowest values of leaf length, width, and area, while those collected in spring had the highest shoot density, with the lowest shoot height. Summer populations had the highest fresh and dry plant biomass, while winter plants had the lowest. Fresh production and dry biomass of V. cuspidata in the unpolluted Nile were significantly higher than those in polluted canals. Chlorophyll a and carotenoid concentrations were reduced under pollution stress. Spring plants accumulated the highest concentrations of Cr, Cu, and Pb in their root, and the lowest concentrations of Al, Cd, Cr, and Zn in their shoot. The bioaccumulation factor for most investigated metals, except Al, Cr, and Fe was greater than 1, while the translocation factor of all metals was less than 1, therefore this plant is considered to be a potential for these metals phytostabilization.

The mean water level fluctuation of the lake is 82 cm (HW-NW/year). The sandy bottoms in the regulated area freeze in winter, while the marshy and stony detritus bottoms remain unfrozen. The total mz biomass in the regulated area was permanently lower on the freezing bottoms than on the unfrozen bottoms, although summer recolonization of the freezing zone was very effective, especially in years with high floods. The decline in the biomass in the freezing zone was compensated for in the deeper, undisturbed zone, and thus mean total biomass in autumn in the whole littoral (0-3 m) was even greater in the areas with freezing bottoms (696 mg ODW m-2) than in those with unfrozen bottoms (433 mg ODW m-2). The biomass in the freezing zone decreased by 73 % during the winter, whereas that in the unfrozen zone was the same in autumn and spring. The winter samples suggest that freezing greatly reduced the number of taxa, while the bottom quality had a major effect on macrofaunal mortality which was 36 % during the winter on the bare sandy bottom but about 7-8 % on the freezing organic bottom and unfrozen marshy shore. The oligochaetes were the most important mz group in the sheltered sandy and detritus bottoms, while the isospod Asellus was dominant on the exposed stony and sandy bottoms, where the mean biomass (207 mg ODW m-2) was lower clue to the wave action.																			0003-9136					AUG	1993	128	1					73	90																WOS:A1993LX70100006

Spring migration of adults was brief (90% between 10 and 22 May); subadults migrated somewhat later, and sometimes lingered into the summer. Fall migration was more drawn-out (90% between 23 August and 14 October), with greater use made of sewage lagoons. The proportion of juveniles seen in fall flocks varied between 0 and about 85%, but was usually < 30%. Large flocks of Bonaparte's Gulls, almost all adults, often remained on Lake Winnipeg well after the main fall movement along the Winnipeg River. Such birds may contribute to a second migration wave reported for the lower Great Lakes. Observations on molt, and association of vagrant gulls with flocks of Bonaparte's Gulls were summarized.

SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND WATER QUALITY IN A CHINESE EUTROPHIC RIVER	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												To collect information about the community structure of zooplankton and to study how zooplankton respond to environmental conditions, zooplankton samples were collected from seven stations in a heavily polluted river (the Nanfei River, China). Samples were collected in March (spring) and June (summer) 2014, September (autumn) and December (winter) 2013. A total of 275 species of zooplankton belonging to 79 genera were identified, the total zooplankton abundance was 193 040 ind./L. Protozoa and rotifer comprised a high proportion of species number and abundance of zooplankton. The upper reaches had higher greater species number and lower abundance than those in middle and lower reaches, and at the entrance of Chaohu Lake. The species number and abundance of zooplankton were the highest in autumn, and the lowest in winter. The habitats of Nanfei River had high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, revealed by unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustering analyses on environmental factors and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) clustering analyses on zooplankton abundance. In addition, water quality of upper reaches was better than the middle and lower reaches, and the entrance; and better in autumn than in other three seasons in terms of species number, abundance, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index. Results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicate that the combination of water temperature, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, pH, chemical oxygen demanded, soluble phosphate, and conductance rate were responsible for the variations in zooplankton community structure. Results of the present study indicated that zooplankton communities of the Nanfei River had obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and the environmental factors played an important role in the changes in zooplankton community in Nanfei River.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					1417	1442		10.15666/aeer/1503_14171442	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1503_14171442													WOS:000403811200101

Turbidity is a physical parameter commonly used to estimate water quality. Revealing the spatiotemporal variations in turbidity can help determine the risk areas of water turbidity to achieve efficient protection and management of water re-sources. Here, we conducted continuous field observations and monitoring of turbidity in Baoan Lake (114 degrees 39 '-114 degrees 46 ' E, 30 degrees 12 '-30 degrees 18 ' N), a shallow lake (average depth: 2.27 m) in southeastern Hubei Province, China, from July 2019 to May 2022, to perform gradient analysis and determine risk levels of water turbidity. Results showed that the average turbidity of the Baoan Lake varied within the range of 9.0-48.8 NTU. Water turbidity fluctuated, reaching peaks in summer or autumn, and troughs in winter. The overall variation of water turbidity in spring and summer ranged within 15 NTU, while in autumn and winter it was over 29 NTU. The turbidity of Zhuti and Qiaodun Lakes (ZL and QL, respectively) was often higher than that of Xiaosihai and Biandantang Lakes (XL and BL, respectively), showing a turbidity decrease from southeast to northwest, espe-cially in winter. A gradient function describing the spatial variation in turbidity was summarized. The parameters of the function had implicit meanings for spatial variations in turbidity. Parameter a influenced the form of the fitting curve. Parameters b and c reflected the range of turbidity values. The two points of the second derivative of the function were considered to indicate the radius of the risk area in a concentric manner. The methodology proposed to identify the risk levels of water turbidity entails the calculation of the risk values for different seasons. Thus, this study provides a new tool for quantifying spatial gradient variation of water turbidity and a new method for determining high-risk areas and risk levels of water turbidity.					zeng, zhuo/KHX-1685-2024; Liu, Xiujun/HMP-1605-2023														1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2023	147								109928	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109928		JAN 2023											WOS:000963017900001

SEASONAL DIFFERENCES IN MIGRATION COUNTS OF RAPTORS: UTILITY OF SPRING COUNTS FOR POPULATION MONITORING	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												Long-term monitoring is important for ensuring effective conservation of raptor populations. Raptors also can serve as indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem condition. Therefore, effective monitoring of raptor populations yields the added benefit of helping to evaluate the status of ecosystems. Spring counts of migrating raptors at concentration points may contribute to these goals, particularly by providing insight into the vital demographic rates underlying population trends. Although much is known about the monitoring value of autumn migration counts in North America, little research has addressed the value of spring counts. We compared counts at seven spring watchsites to those at seven autumn watchsites matched by region (Southwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast) to assess the value of spring counts for population monitoring. Our analyses suggested that population indexes derived from spring migration counts provided estimates of population change that differed overall from autumn migration counts in the same region. The concordance of spring and autumn trends was higher in the Southwest anti Northeast than in the Great Lakes region, suggesting greater variation in the seasonal representation of populations in the latter region. The average precision of spring trend estimates was better than for autumn estimates in the same region in two of three regions, anti the estimated rates of change often were lower in spring. Spring counts enhanced the ability to estimate population trends for species that are less common in autumn counts, including the Rough-legged Hawk (Buteo lagopus) and Red-shouldered Hawk (B. linealus). To realize fully the value of spring counts, we recommend the establishment of additional spring watchsites in areas that concentrate migrants in autumn, but do so to a lesser extent in spring, as well as additional research to define the populations sampled by autumn and spring counts.

J	FORSYTH, DJ; JAMES, MR				FORSYTH, DJ; JAMES, MR			SEASONAL-CHANGES IN SIZE SELECTIVE GRAZING BY CALAMOECIA-LUCASI (COPEPODA) IN AN EUTROPHIC LAKE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The calanoid copepod Calamoecia lucasi dominated the cladocerans Ceriodaphnia dubia and Bosmina meridionalis in Lake Okaro numerically dominated by phytoplankton cells less than 3-mu-m diameter in winter, Ceratium hirundinella in spring, Anabaena spiroides in mid summer and Microcystic aeruginosa in summer and autumn. C. lucasi was fed five different size fractions on eleven occasions throughout a year. Clearance rates were always highest when feeding on the three smallest size fractions but most carbon was ingested from the largest size fraction which, in terms of biovolume, always dominated the phytoplankton. A negative correlation existed between selectivity and particle size as the smallest size fraction was most often preferred. Although temporal changes in selectivity did occur selectivity did not appear to be strongly influenced by species succession and its associated changes in shape or taste of potential food or of total phytoplankton concentration. Preference was for cells in the 0-3-mu-m fraction in a system where most of the phytoplankton was more than 20-mu-m in size.																			0003-9136					JUL	1991	122	1					23	32																WOS:A1991GE95000002

The study revealed a slight seasonal decrease in the light utilization efficiency (alpha-chl) from 0.078 to 0.056 mg C (mg chl a-1) h-1 (W m-2) from winter to early spring, as well as a small increase in the photosynthesis light saturation (I(k); 29.4 and 45.5 W m-2, respectively) and in the diurnal assimilatory number [DAN; 19.6 and 24.0 mg C (mg chl a)-l d-1, respectively]. At the same time, respiration (R) fell drastically: in winter, when phytoplankton was dominated by dinoflagellates and coccolithophores, R was 29 % of maximum production (P(max)), while in spring, with diatoms dominating, R was 2.5 % of P(max). Chlorophyll a concentration also showed a drastic increase: from 0.73 to 2.15 Mg m-3 in the surface layer and from 20 to between 100 and 150 mg m-2 on an areal basis. These data suggest that the nearly 2-fold growth of primary production from winter to spring (275.2 +/- 163.5 and 581.4 +/- 232.4 mg C m-2 d-1, respectively) is accounted for by larger phytoplankton biomass and lower respiration. These changes were mainly brought about by an increase in diatoms: the increase of both production and chlorophyll a from winter to spring features an ever greater diatom contribution, reaching > 50 % in spring. A close relationship is suggested between the increase in primary production and the changes in the structure of seawater from winter to spring.

In fall and spring 85% of the 28 brown trout tracked by radio moved east from tagging sites. Movements frequently centered around original stocking sites, streams, and power plant outflows. Fish moved farther in spring (4.4 .+-. 2.5 km/d) than in fall (2.4 .+-. 1.7 km/d) seasons, but short-term movement rates did not differ between seasons (0.4 .+-. 0.1 km/h in spring vs. 0.4 .+-. 0.3 km/h in fall). Females moved farther and faster than males in the fall. Brown trout generally occupied shallow waters < 1 km from shore; 81% of temperatures occupied by trout were between 8-18.degree. C in spring (10.6 .+-. 2.3.degree. C) and fall (10.1 .+-. 3.9.degree. C), but turbidity appeared to influence presence or absence of trout near shore on a daily basis. In summer 78% of the 75 brown trout netted were in 8-18.degree. C water (12.6 .+-. 4.0.degree. C); 88% were caught in or within .+-. 3 m of the thermocline region. Brown trout occupied regions near the thermocline despite widely varying bottom depths and thermocline temperatures. All brown trout were netted within 3.2 km of shore in summer, most in water .ltoreq. 30 m deep; 70% were caught more than 3 m off bottom. The strong association of brown trout with nearshore and thermocline regions may distinguish their distributions from other salmonid species in Lake Ontario.																			0380-1330						1987	13	2					168	177		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71640-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71640-2													WOS:A1987J558000007

Samples were collected monthly from June 2002 to May 2004 from Lake Mascardi. Amphipods were measured and classified by developmental stages. Single and double infections of larval acanthocephalans were recorded and prevalence and mean intensity were calculated. An annual life cycle of H. patagonica could be inferred with recruitment of juveniles from spring to autumn. Males and females were found all year round but females were significantly more abundant. Single infections were mainly found in smaller juvenile amphipods during winter for A. tumescens and in intermediate and large male amphipods during spring and summer for Corynosoma sp. Double infections showed low values and were mainly found in intermediate sized amphipods during spring. A segregation of the infection by season, size and developmental stages of the host was recorded and would tend to avoid competition considering these two acanthocephalan species have different definitive hosts: fishes for A. tumescens and aquatic birds for Corynosoma sp.																			0932-0113	1432-1955				MAY	2007	100	6					1271	1276		10.1007/s00436-006-0420-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-006-0420-8								17216241					WOS:000246182500015

Winter temperature conditions (1670-2010) reconstructed from varved sediments, western Canadian High Arctic	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Advances in paleoclimatology from the Arctic have provided insights into long-term climate conditions. However, while past annual and summer temperature have received considerable research attention, comparatively little is known about winter paleoclimate. Arctic winter is of special interest as it is the season with the highest sensitivity to climate change, and because it differs substantially from summer and annual measures. Therefore, information about past changes in winter climate is key to improve our knowledge of past forced climate variability and to reduce uncertainty in climate projections. In this context, Arctic lakes with snowmelt-fed catchments are excellent potential winter climate archives. They respond strongly to snowmelt-induced runoff, and indirectly to winter temperature and snowfall conditions. To date, only a few well-calibrated lake sediment records exist, which appear to reflect site specific responses with differing reconstructions. This limits the possibility to resolve large-scale winter climate change prior the instrumental period. Here, we present a well-calibrated quantitative temperature and snowfall record for the extended winter season (November through March; NDJFM) from Chevalier Bay (Melville Island, NWT, Canadian Arctic) back to CE 1670. The coastal embayment has a large catchment influenced by nival terrestrial processes, which leads to high sedimentation rates and annual sedimentary structures (varves). Using detailed microstratigraphic analysis from two sediment cores and supported by R-XRF data, we separated the nival sedimentary units (spring snowmelt) from the rainfall units (summer) and identified subaqueous slumps. Statistical correlation analysis between the proxy data and monthly climate variables reveals that the thickness of the nival units can be used to predict winter temperature (r = 0.71, Pc < 0.01, 5-yr filter) and snowfall (r = 0.65, pc < 0.01, 5-yr filter) for the western Canadian High Arctic over the last ca. 400 years. Results reveal a strong variability in winter temperature back to CE 1670 with the coldest decades reconstructed for the period CE 1800-1880, while the warmest decades and major trends are reconstructed for the period CE 1880-1930 (0.26 degrees C/decade) and CE 1970-2010 (037 degrees C/decade). Although the first aim of this study was to increase the paleoclimate data coverage for the winter season, the record from Chevalier Bay also holds great potential for more applied climate research such as data-model comparisons and proxy data assimilation in climate model simulations.

Seasonal and diurnal variations of atmospheric mercury across the US determined from AMNet monitoring data	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Speciated atmospheric mercury observations collected over the period from 2008 to 2010 at the Environmental Protection Agency and National Atmospheric Deposition Program Atmospheric Mercury Network sites (AMNet) were analyzed for its spatial, seasonal, and diurnal characteristics across the US. Median values of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) and particulate bound mercury (PBM) at 11 different AMNet sites ranged from 148-226 ppqv (1.32-2.02 ng m(-3)), 0.05-1.4 ppqv (0.47-12.4 pg m(-3)) and 0.18-1.5 ppqv (1.61-13.7 pg m(-3)), respectively. Common characteristics of these sites were the similar median levels of GEM as well as its seasonality, with the highest mixing ratios occurring in winter and spring and the lowest in fall. However, discernible differences in monthly average GEM were as large as 30 ppqv, which may be caused by sporadic influence from local emission sources. The largest diurnal variation amplitude of GEM occurred in the summer. Seven rural sites displayed similar GEM summer diurnal patterns, in that the lowest levels appeared in the early morning, and then the GEM mixing ratio increased after sunrise and reached its maxima at noon or in the early afternoon. Unlike GEM, GOM exhibited higher mixing ratios in spring and summer. The largest diurnal variation amplitude of GOM occurred in spring for most AMNet sites. The GOM diurnal minima appeared before sunrise and maxima appeared in the afternoon. The increased GOM mixing ratio in the afternoon indicated a photochemically driven oxidation of GEM resulting in GOM formation. PBM exhibited diurnal fluctuations in summertime. The summertime PBM diurnal pattern displayed daily maxima in the early afternoon and lower mixing ratios at night, implying photochemical production of PBM in summer.

Aquatic plants might have an impact on the sediment denitrification of water body, especially in macrophytes-dominated lake; however, there were different opinions about it. Our hypothesis was that the sediment denitrification rates differ significantly in different vegetation zones and seasons because of direct and indirect effect of the aquatic plants. Therefore, we studied sediment denitrification in Dongping Lake, a typical macrophytes-dominated lake located in the north of China. The acetylene inhibition technique was used to quantify the sediment denitrification rates (DRs) in thePhragmites communis(P.communis) zone, aquaculture zone,Potamogeton crispus(P.crispus) zone and mixed vegetation zone in July (summer), October (autumn), December (winter) of 2015 and March (spring) of 2016. The results showed that the average DRs were significantly higher in theP.communiszone (69.0 +/- 91.6 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) than the mixed vegetation zone (8.70 +/- 5.44 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)), and the average DRs represented significant seasonal difference as in the order of winter (74.5 +/- 88.3 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) > autumn (15.7 +/- 18.6 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) approximate to summer (10.7 +/- 5.90 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) > spring (3.85 +/- 1.29 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)). The DRs generally decreased with the increasing of depth; however, significant increase of DRs with depth were found in certain seasons at the vegetated zones except the non-vegetated zone (the aquaculture zone) indicating the possible rhizosphere effect of aquatic plants on denitrification. The higher DRs and cycling rates of nitrate in theP.communiszone might be related to the larger biomass and oxygen transporting capacity ofP.communisthan those of the other aquatic plants. Winter peaks of DRs might be attributed to the higher NO(3)(-)load and the absence of the plant uptake. The high cycling rates of nitrate in Dongping Lake indicated an enhanced internal N cycling by aquatic plants. Sediment denitrification could remove about 537.7 t N every year, which was about 26.5% of annual TN loading in Dongping Lake.

Volatile selenium fluxes from selenium-contaminated sediments in an Australian coastal lake	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Environmental context Methylation of sedimentary selenium to volatile dimethylselenide is a natural remediation process for contaminated aquatic systems. We present flux estimates for the loss of dimethylselenide from sediments of an anthropogenically affected lake and observe a 6-fold difference between late autumn-early winter and summer. The loss of dimethylselenide represents a significant sediment loss vector, of the same order as the diffusive loss flux for inorganic selenium across the sediment-water interface. Abstract Overflows from ash dams associated with the operation of coal-fired power stations in Lake Macquarie, NSW, Australia, have been a historical source of selenium to the lake. Although dissolved selenium concentrations have been marginally elevated, sediments are the major sink. Methylation of sedimentary selenium to volatile dimethylselenide (DMSe) is known to be a natural remediation process. Sediments from north of Wyee Bay and the Vales Point Power Station were the subject of field sampling and monitoring to determine the extent to which selenium is being lost to the atmosphere as DMSe. Flux estimates were obtained by trapping volatile selenium species using benthic domes, followed by analysis in the field using a fully automated cryogenic trapping system with atomic fluorescence detection. The detection limit of the system was 0.1ngL(-1) for DMSe and 1ngL(-1) for dimethyl diselenide (DMDSe). Measurements in both summer and late autumn-early winter showed a distinct seasonal difference, with a higher summer DMSe flux of 53 +/- 25ng Se m(-2)h(-1) (+/- s.d.) compared with 8 +/- 5ng Se m(-2)h(-1) in late autumn-early winter. No DMDSe was detected. These fluxes are similar to those measured in Europe and North America, and represent an annual loss of 1.3kg of selenium per year from the nearby lake area. Lake-wide this would represent a significant loss to the atmosphere.					; BATLEY, Graeme/A-4805-2008; Ellwood, Michael/G-7390-2011	Schneider, Larissa/0000-0001-5276-2531; Ellwood, Michael/0000-0003-4288-8530													1448-2517	1449-8979					2016	13	1					68	75		10.1071/EN14228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EN14228													WOS:000367596000009

Over the three-study seasons (autumn, winter, and spring), phytoplankton abundance and biomass showed a gradual increase with the peak in spring season. During this study period, phytoplankton community comprised of 7 phyla, 80 genera, and 210 species. The dominating phyla were Chlorophyta 80 species, Bacillariophyta 46, and Cyanophyta 44 as well as other phyla of freshwater ecosystems except Xanthophyta. The phytoplankton density and biomass varied in the six sampling sites between a minimum of 257.42 x 10(4) cells/L to 1054.15 x 10(4) cells/L and 1.60 mg/L to 4.56 mg/L respectively. Spring season had higher biomass and density values than autumn and winter. Furthermore, the results indicated that the Shannon-Wiener (H') and Pielou evenness (J') indices of phytoplankton community were stable although with slightly higher values in spring. Based on the calculated indices, Tang-Pu reservoir could be considered mesosaprobic in all the three seasons. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that pH, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), transparency, chlorophyll a (Chl a), dissolve oxygen (DO), and water temperature (WT) were responsible for most phytoplankton community shift from Bacillariophyta and Cryptophyta to Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta in spring. These environmental parameters play an essential role in the community structure variation of phytoplankton in the downstream and upstream of Tang-Pu Reservoir. A decreasing phytoplankton abundance trend from the river area (inlet) to the lake (outlet) was also observed.

J	Salmaso, N				Salmaso, N			Seasonal variation in the composition and rate of change of the phytoplankton community in a deep subalpine lake (Lake Garda, northern Italy). An application of nonmetric multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal variations and spatial homogeneity of the phytoplankton community were followed, from spring 1991 to spring 1992, in four pelagic stations of a large deep subalpine lake (Lake Garda, Northern Italy). Both cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) applied to Bray & Curtis' dissimilarity matrices computed on density and biovolume data were employed; the Bray & Curtis index, calculated between pairs of chronologically contiguous samples, was also used as a measure of the community change rate over the temporal succession. In the tree diagrams obtained both from density and biovolume data, six groups of different size have been identified, with ordered sequences of samples within them. Superimposition of the results of cluster analysis on the NMDS configurations has allowed interpretations of the trajectories of the samples as a chronological and cyclical succession of compositionally homogeneous groups. A clear relationship between the community change rate and stability of the water column has been assessed. The specific composition of the six groups has been discussed in relation to environmental variables and in terms of adaptive strategies. During winter (winter-spring group) the turbulence of the water and the availability of nutrients favour the development of colonial Bacillariophyceae (Fragilaria crotonensis Kitten, Tabellaria fenestrata (Lyngb.) Kutz., Aulacoseira spp.), Cyanophyceae (Planktothrix agardhii (Gem.) Anagn. et Kom. and Planktolyngbya limnetica (Lemm.) Kom.-Legn. et Cronb.) and Cryptophyceae. In late spring group, with the stabilisation of the water column and silicon depletion, the diatoms give way to small, opportunistic species (Ankyra judayi (G. M. Smith) Fott, Cyclotella spp., Chroomonas acuta Utermhol) and larger species (Ceratium hirundinella (O. F. Mull.) Dujardin). The three summer groups are characterised by a development of Chlorophyceae (chiefly Chlorococcales), Cyanophyceae (mainly Chroococcales), Cyclotella spp. and Dinophyceae. With the autumn destratification the summer community undergoes a rearrangement principally in favour of Cyanophyceae and Cryptophyceae.

All analyses were performed at three localities and water depths in spring, summer, autumn, and winter 2019. Seven phytoplankton phyla comprising 139 taxa were detected at all three localities (Chlorophyta 58%, Bacillariophyta 14%, Cyanobacteria 9%, Chrysophyta 5%, Dinophyta 5%, Euglenophyta 5%, and Cryptophyta 4%). Winter 2019 was characterized by the presence of 36 unique species in all phyla except Euglenophyta. Bacterial diversity analyses showed that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia dominated the water intake locality at all three water depths (0.5, 10, and 20 m below the surface). In general, the physico-chemical parameters, phytoplankton, and bacterial community composition depended on the season and the water depth and showed that Bovan Lake was of satisfactory ecological status and water quality at all localities, and meets the needs for all intended purposes.

Throughout the annual period, primary production rates at the surface were less than 10 mg C/m3 per day, except during summer months when values reached 80 mg C/mg3 per day. Production rates increased during spring and summer months with depth, often to 40-100 mg C/m3 per day at depths of optimal light availability, 10-20 m. At depths of 40-50 m, production rates were attenuated, to less than 15 mg C/m3 per day. The only exception, which appears predictable from year to year, occurs during spring months in lower epilimnetic and upper hypolimnetic waters due to diatom production. Seasonal 3 mo. production during 1973 showed spring values exceeding 250 mg C/m2 per day, summer values exceeding 300 mg C/m2 per day and fall and winter values of 125 mg C/m2 per day. Annual mean production was calculated for 1973 as 212.7 mg C/m2 per day and it compared favorably with other published data on annual mean production rates for oligotrophic lakes. The observed daily range, based on biweekly measurements, was 66.4-336.6 mg C/m2 per day. The apparent low mean annual production rate for Lake Ohrid, characterized as oligotrophic despite its great depth and probable Pliocene age, is controlled by a host of interacting chemical physical factors which restrict the potential openwater phytoplankton productivity.																			0003-9136						1977	79	4					429	440																WOS:A1977DN10800001

Ingestion rates were measured using fluorescent microspheres in situ on three depths every 6(th) hour during 24 hours in summer in order to quantify diurnal variations and once at midday during autumn, winter and spring. Mixotrophic phytoflagellates composed a large part of the phytoplankton biomass (18-31 %) throughout the year. Nonetheless, calculations suggest that the mixotrophs only consumed between 0.5 and 4.4 % of the bacterial carbon production, with the highest consumption percentage in winter under ice. Two groups of algae, Cryptomonas spp. and Dinobryon spp., were commonly found with ingested prey and both exhibited significant diurnal differences in bacterial ingestion rates with the highest mean rates measured in late afternoon (0.50 and 0.27 bacteria cell(-1) hour(-1), respectively) and very low rates during night (0.09 and 0.06 bacteria cell(-1) hour). In Cryptomonas spp., ingestion rates also varied.somewhat over the year and bacterial ingestion was highest during winter (0.57 bacteria cell(-1) hour), possibly as a result of the lengthy impaired light climate.																			0003-9136					JUN	2003	157	3					289	307		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0157-0289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0157-0289													WOS:000184227800001

Italy) - Four years after the recovery from acidification by liming	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												The phytoplankton succession in Lake Orta, heavy metals and ammonium polluted for decades and subjected to liming intervention in 1989-90, was studied during 1994. The existence of three main succession stages, with different structures of the community emerged. Chlorophyta are the most important taxonomic group in every season. The spring community was dominated by chlorophytes, Dinobryon sertularia and Kephyrion sp., the summer by Synedra sp. and Westella botryoides, the autumn by Rhizosolenia eriensis and W. botryoides, the winter by Synedra a sp., R. eriensis and Synechococcus sp. The abundance of Chlorophyta, less important in other deep subalpine lakes, and the dominance of taxa able to thrive in polluted environments, could be related to the presence of trace metals in the sediments.

J	Zhang, H; Yao, B; Wang, SR; Wang, GQ				Zhang, Hao; Yao, Bo; Wang, Shengrui; Wang, Guoqiang			Remote sensing estimation of the concentration and sources of coloured dissolved organic matter based on MODIS: A case study of Erhai lake	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The use of satellite remote sensing to estimate coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and identify its potential sources is important for monitoring lake water quality and implementing management strategies. In this study, taking Erhai Lake as an example and based on MODIS/Aqua satellite images and in-situ measured data, we used empirical and semi-empirical methods to develop algorithms for CDOM and the fluorescence index (FI370) from remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(lambda)). The temporal and spatial distributions of the CDOM concentration and FI370 in Erhai Lake during 2013-2019 were retrieved. The results show the following. (1) The band ratio (Rrs (469)+Rrs(645))/Rrs(555) model could estimate the CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm (aCDOM(412)) (R2=0.507), and it was relatively stable. Using the band ratio Rrs(645)/Rrs(469) combined with the chlorophylla (Chl-a) APProach by ELimination (APPEL) model, a semi-empirical inversion model of FI370 performed with satisfactory accuracy (R2=0.550) and was more accurate than the empirical algorithm (R2=0.505). (2) During the period of 2013-2019, the CDOM concentration in Erhai Lake generally decreased from the northern to the central to the southern parts of the lake, and the CDOM concentration was higher in summer and autumn than in spring and winter. FI370 was higher in the northern and western coastal waters and lower in the central, southern and eastern parts of the lake. FI370 in autumn and winter was higher than that in spring and summer. CDOM was affected by both terrestrial and internal sources, and their relative contributions were not the same in different seasons. (3) For different Chl-a concentrations, different CDOM concentration models had better retrieval effects, i.e., Rrs(645))/Rrs(555) and (Rrs(469)+Rrs(645))/Rrs(555) had the best performance when Chl-a 10 mu g/L and Chl-a 10 mu g/L, respectively. The inversion models established in this study offer improved quantifications of the CDOM concentration and the FI370 in Erhai Lake, providing important support for monitoring water quality and implementing efficient management strategies.

J	Helfer, F; Zhang, H; Lernckert, C				Helfer, Fernanda; Zhang, Hong; Lernckert, Charles			Modelling of lake mixing induced by air-bubble plumes and the effects on evaporation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												One of the main concerns regarding water storage in Australia, and other semi-arid countries, is the high rate of evaporation that inevitably leads to significant water loss. In this paper, the use of air-bubble plume systems to reduce evaporation from large reservoirs is assessed. A destratification system was designed for a large dam based on its depth and stratification strength with the intention of destratifying the reservoir in a short time period. The model DYRESM was then used to simulate the water dynamics under destratification conditions. Different strategies for the operation of the aeration system were assessed, from 10-days operation periods at times of high evaporation rates to continuous operation over longer time spans. The modelled water column temperatures and evaporation rates were analysed and it was found that artificial destratification was only effective in reducing evaporation in spring. In summer, heat is added to the water at a rapid rate, and artificial destratification only helps reduce evaporation in the initial days of operation. The effect of artificial destratification in reducing evaporation in autumn depends on the operation of the system during summer. If operated in summer, the rates of evaporation in autumn will increase due to the additional heat added to the water during the summer. In winter, overturn takes place and artificial destratification has no influence on water temperatures and evaporation. It was concluded that aeration by air-bubble plumes would only be effective in reducing evaporation if the hypolimnetic water does not become warm when mixing takes place. This is an ideal situation, but is unlikely to happen in practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fernández, C; Parodi, ER; Cáceres, EJ				Fernandez, Carolina; Parodi, Elisa R.; Caceres, Eduardo J.			Phytoplankton structure and diversity in the eutrophic-hypereutrophic reservoir Paso de las Piedras, Argentina	LIMNOLOGY												This study aimed at analyzing the phytoplankton structure and dynamics in Paso de las Piedras Reservoir, Argentina, through the study of dominant species, diversity and similarity in relation with the abiotic environment. Samples were collected weekly or biweekly (January 2004-June 2005) at four sampling stations. The reservoir experienced a seasonal progression in phytoplankton composition that underlines six successional periods, each one characterized by the dominance of one or a few species. Cyanobacteria, green algae and diatoms were the most important constituents of the reservoir's phytoplankton. Cyanobacteria dominated during summer and early autumn, green algae during late autumn and early winter, and diatoms during winter and spring. A high abundance of R. lacustris (Cryptophyceae) was observed during late September and early October. The general pattern of species succession is coherent with the general model of plankton seasonal succession described by the PEG model; however, the major discrepancy is the extremely short clear water phase observed. Successional periods were associated with changes in abiotic variables, and they showed differences in ecological traits. Cyanobacteria-Dictyosphaerium, Cyclotella, Stephanodiscus and Anabaena-diatom periods were characterized by a low number of cells, high diversity, with both dominance and specific richness low. On the contrary, during Cyanobacteria and Cyanobacteria II periods, the highest abundance was observed associated with low diversity and high dominance.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2012	13	1					13	25		10.1007/s10201-011-0347-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-011-0347-3													WOS:000301482900002

This study investigates the environmental exposure and risks associated with EDCs in effluent and sludge from four WWTPs: Tangxi River (TXH), Zipeng Mountain (ZPS), Lianxi (LX), and Wang Xiaoying (WXY).Methods: Environmental exposure indexes of EDCs were assessed in the effluent and sludge of the four WWTPs across four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) from October 2017 to October 2018. Detection rates of various pollutants, their seasonal and spatial characteristics, and removal rates were analyzed. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used for source analysis under influent data, and an ecological risk assessment was conducted using the risk quotient (RQ) method.Results: The study found 4-n-nonylphenol (NP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) had 100% detection rates in the effluent of all four WWTPs, while only DEHP showed a 100% detection rate in the sludge. Bisphenol A (BPA) exhibited the highest concentration in the TXH effluent during autumn. Benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) was detected only in the sludge during spring and summer and in the effluent of TXH and WXY. PMF source analysis indicated industrial wastewater discharge as the primary source of pollutants. Ecological risk assessment revealed a high RQ for estriol (E3) in TXH effluent during autumn, and DEHP presented a potential carcinogenic risk through drinking water.Discussion: The findings highlight significant seasonal and spatial variations in EDC concentrations and removal rates across the WWTPs. The persistent presence of DEHP and the high-risk levels of E3 in specific seasons underscore the need for improved treatment processes and stricter industrial discharge regulations to mitigate EDC-related risks. Further research is recommended to explore advanced detection and degradation techniques for EDCs in WWTPs.

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Research has shown that the climate in northwest China has turned to warm-wet in recent decades. Does this mean that the entire northwest of China has become wet in the last few decades? In the context of the climate transition in northwest China, this paper investigates whether the Bosten Lake Basin (BLB) located in southern Xinjiang has been dry or wet in the last 30 years. We used the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) to investigate these changes. The results show that although the dry-wet changes indicated by the SPEI and TVDI exhibited slight spatiotemporal differences, the entire BLB reflected a tendency to be dry. That is, the BLB has not become wet during the climate transition in northwest China, but is developing a trend toward aridification. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) The SPEI indicated a drying trend in seasonal and interannual variations in plains; in mountains, except in spring and summer it has a drying trend, too. (2) The TVDI showed that although the drying trend in summer and winter was weaker than that in spring and autumn in the BLB, where some regions represented a significant tendency toward wetness owing to seasonal or annual changes, the entire study area has still become more dry.

Deer were sampled during two periods, diurnal (i.e. 0800 to 1959 h) and 24-h to determine if 24-h habitat use could be estimated from diurnal use patterns at the population level. No differences between diurnal and 24-h use were detected (P = 0.101) during winter, spring, summer, or fall, indicating that 24-h habitat use could be estimated (r(2) = 0.95, P < 0.001) from diurnal patterns when habitats were combined even during periods of intense unpredicted human disturbance (i.e. fall hunting with approx. 12 hunters/km(2)).

Specificity of zooplankton distribution in meteorite crater ponds (Morasko, Poland)	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												This study was conducted in order to define the most important factors responsible for the zooplankton community structure inhabiting four meteorite crater ponds, located near the city of Poznan (Poland). The functioning of the meteorite craters resembled that of other small water bodies, where seasonality, physical-chemical features (mainly chlorophyll a concentration, pH and conductivity) or biological parameters (lack of fish) structured zooplankton assemblages. Rotifer species richness and abundance were highest in the autumn (12 species and 5107 ind L-1 on average), while crustaceans prevailed in the summer (12 and 201, respectively). The dominating structure also depended on the season, with pelagic species occurring in the spring and autumn and mainly littoral species in the summer. Moreover, the temporary nature of the craters caused great differentiation in zooplankton among ponds and favoured organisms adapted to living in astatic reservoirs, e. g. bdelloids, Daphnia pulex or Macrocyclops viridis. The co-occurrence of a variable community of small crustaceans with large daphnids indicated the existence of an additional ecological niche - a thick layer of sediments. Despite the occurrence of adverse living conditions (oxygen deficiencies and periodic drying) and the eutrophic character of the waters, these ponds were a source of many rare species (e. g. Keratella paludosa), even in the status of dominants. Protective measures (a nature reserve) allowed the area of meteorite fall to remain quite natural, despite its location close to an urban area.

Chlorophyll-a, primary productivity and water quality variables were also measured. High light penetration was noticed during the winter and spring. The water is oligohaline, alkaline and very hard. Reactive nitrate was found in higher concentrations than nitrite, and there were low concentrations of reactive phosphate. Two peaks were noticed for chlorophyll-a concentrations during spring and autumn, whereas only one occurred during autumn for primary productivity. The study area may be characterized as typically mesotrophic. A total of 154 species of algae was identified, including 65, 89, 98 and 77 species of plankton, epipelic and epiphytic algae on Potamogeton lucens and on Ceratophyllum demersum, respectively. Only 25 species were common to all the different communities. Diatoms were the dominant group in the epipelic and epiphytic algae during the study period, as well as in the plankton during spring and autumn. Seasonal variations were clear in the total cell numbers of algae from different habitats.

Despite their crucial role in maintaining water quality and ecosystem stability in water diversion projects, a deeper understanding of the transport mechanism of phytoplankton in water diversion has yet to be thoroughly explored. A systematic investigation was conducted to better understand the ecological processes related to phytoplankton in the mammoth Middle Route of the South-North Water Diversion Project. Methods including beta-diversity partitioning, null model, and generalized linear model were applied to analyze the process and driving mechanism of the assembly of phytoplankton communities. Results indicated that the temporal and spatial variation of phytoplankton in the canal was mainly regulated and controlled by Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta. The beta-diversity of phytoplankton throughout various seasons was mainly driven by species turnover, and was less influenced by dispersal limitation. On a year-long time scale, stochastic processes dominated. However, the relative weights of stochastic and deterministic processes varied with seasons. Phytoplankton communities were primarily influenced by stochastic processes in summer and autumn, and by deterministic processes in winter and spring. Seasonal and season-related factors (e.g., water temperature, dissolved oxygen) had a much greater impact on the beta-diversity of phytoplankton than location and location-related factors (e.g., permanganate index). Further analyses showed that phytoplankton communities exhibited characteristics of stochastic assembly in summer and autumn. In winter and spring, however, the composition of phytoplankton communities was significantly regulated by the variations in turbidity, flow velocity, and dissolved organic matter. The above results revealed a unique mechanism: artificial water diversion projects weakened spatial heterogeneity via hydrologic homogeneity, thereby redirecting the main control axis of phytoplankton community assembly towards the temporal dimension. Based on the above findings, we recommend implementing seasonally differentiated real-time algae monitoring and a rapid response mechanism to more effectively address potential ecological risks, optimize water quality management, and ensure ecological safety in long-distance water diversion projects.

Anthony			Aircraft-based inversions quantify the importance of wetlands and livestock for Upper Midwest methane emissions	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We apply airborne measurements across three seasons (summer, winter and spring 2017-2018) in a multi-inversion framework to quantify methane emissions from the US Corn Belt and Upper Midwest, a key agricultural and wetland source region. Combing our seasonal results with prior fall values we find that wetlands are the largest regional methane source (32 %, 20 [16-23] Gg/d), while livestock (enteric/manure; 25 %, 15 [14-17] Gg/d) are the largest anthropogenic source. Natural gas/petroleum, waste/landfills, and coal mines collectively make up the remainder. Optimized fluxes improve model agreement with independent datasets within and beyond the study timeframe. Inversions reveal coherent and seasonally dependent spatial errors in the WetCHARTs ensemble mean wetland emissions, with an underestimate for the Prairie Pothole region but an overestimate for Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Wetland extent and emission temperature dependence have the largest influence on prediction accuracy; better representation of cou- pled soil temperature-hydrology effects is therefore needed. Our optimized regional livestock emissions agree well with the Gridded EPA estimates during spring (to within 7 %) but are similar to 25 % higher during summer and winter. Spatial analysis further shows good top-down and bottom-up agreement for beef facilities (with mainly enteric emissions) but larger (similar to 30 %) seasonal discrepancies for dairies and hog farms (with > 40 % manure emissions). Findings thus support bottom-up enteric emission estimates but suggest errors for manure; we propose that the latter reflects inadequate treatment of management factors including field application. Overall, our results confirm the importance of intensive animal agriculture for regional methane emissions, implying substantial mitigation opportunities through improved management.

J	Han, SZ				Han, Shuangze			Linkage of the preceding winter mid-latitude Eurasian atmospheric circulation with the spring northern East Asian snow cover	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Within the current study, the linkage between the preceding wintertime atmospheric circulation around the mid latitude Eurasia (MLE) and spring Asian snow cover is detected. The result suggests that following the primary atmospheric mode over the MLE during winter, the positive snow cover anomalies tend to appear over northern East Asia (EA) in the ensuing spring. This primary atmospheric mode featured by the negative-positive-negative anomalous geopotential height centers in the middle level around the MLE is conducive to the zonal wavenumber-1 component (ZWN-1) propagating upward into the stratosphere in winter. The poleward heat transportation anomalies connected with the strengthened upward wave activity contribute to the significant anomalous stratospheric warming and thereby a weaker than normal lower stratospheric polar vortex during spring. This abnormal lower stratospheric polar vortex then propagates downward and generates a significant tropospheric cyclonic anomaly around Lake Baikal, favoring the anomalous cooling and more snowfall over the region. The above condition finally results in the enhanced spring snow cover around northern EA. Moreover, the observed connection shown above can be reproduced in the historical simulation (1979-2014) of some coupled models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The result also implies that the time series corresponding to this primary atmospheric mode exhibit a potential to predict the spring snow cover over northern EA.																			0169-8095	1873-2895				SEP 15	2023	293								106926	10.1016/j.atmosres.2023.106926	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2023.106926		JUL 2023											WOS:001050711900001
J	Goetz, F; Sitar, S; Jasonowicz, A; Seider, M				Goetz, Frederick; Sitar, Shawn; Jasonowicz, Andy; Seider, Michael			Reproduction of Lake Trout Morphotypes at Isle Royale in Northern Lake Superior	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The reproductive biology of male and female lean, siscowet, redfin, and humper Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush was assessed by measuring the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and by histological analysis of the gonads over 2 years from spring to fall at sites surrounding Isle Royale National Park, Lake Superior. Whole livers, otoliths, and ovaries were also collected to measure hepatosomatic index (HSI), age, and fecundity. In general, GSIs increased from spring to summer in male and female siscowets, leans, redfins, and humpers, and this was accompanied by a large increase in the number of vitellogenic (>2.0 mm) follicles in females. Postspawned ovaries and regressing testes were predominant in all morphotypes by October but were also observed in September, indicating that some spawning occurred at least by September. Further, preovulatory siscowet females (GSIs > 10) and siscowet males with fully mature and even regressing testes were observed in the spring and summer, indicating that spawning occurs at least in the spring and fall in siscowets at Isle Royale. For all morphotypes, average male HSIs were significantly lower than female HSIs. Absolute fecundity was positively related to size and age for all morphotypes. Humpers had the lowest absolute fecundity. Leans, redfins, and siscowets had similar fecundity relationships. The results conclusively demonstrate that deepwater siscowet Lake Trout reproduce at least during the spring and fall at Isle Royale and that leans, humpers, and redfins reproduce during the fall. In lakes that exhibit sympatric populations of deepwater and shallow-water ecotypes of Arctic Char Salvelinus alpinus, the deepwater form also spawns in both spring and fall. Our data and those on Arctic Char suggest that there is an adaptive strategy for maintaining alternative spawning times in the deepwater ecotypes in these populations.Received June 20, 2016; accepted November 2, 2016						Sitar, Shawn/0000-0002-8868-3277													0002-8487	1548-8659					2017	146	2					268	282		10.1080/00028487.2016.1259660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2016.1259660													WOS:000395009100001

Feeding ecology of Acrossocheilus yunnanensis (Regan, 1904), a dominant fish in the headwaters of the Chishui River, a tributary of the Yangtze River	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Feeding ecology of Acrossocheilus yunnanensis, a dominant fish in the headwaters of the Chishui River, a tributary of the upper Yangtze River, was studied using the analysis of gut contents. From March 2015 to January 2016, a total of 543 individuals were collected and analyzed. The results showed that A. yunnanensis was an omnivorous fish mainly feeding on chlorophytes, diatoms, and aquatic insects. The trophic level was 2.69 +/- 0.62 (mean +/- SD), signifying A. yunnanensis as a primary or secondary predator. Dietary shifts were found among different ontogenetic stages and seasons. Specifically, young individuals fed primarily on aquatic insects and diatoms, whereas older fish fed mainly on chlorophytes. In spring, the preferred food item was aquatic insects and in other seasons, chlorophytes became the predominant prey. Diet composition showed no differences among individuals of different sex and diel periods. The feeding intensity of A. yunnanensis was not affected by diel periods, suggesting this species feeds continuously. However, its feeding intensity was significantly influenced by seasons. Pairwise comparison found that the feeding intensity was higher in spring and autumn than that in summer and winter, with minimum food intake in winter and maximum in spring. Analysis on Amundsen graph and niche breadth index indicated that A. yunnanensis might pursue an opportunistic and moderately generalized feeding strategy, which could explain why it has become the dominant fish species in our study area.																			1562-2916						2020	19	5					2688	2704		10.22092/ijfs.2020.122630	http://dx.doi.org/10.22092/ijfs.2020.122630													WOS:000577113700035

In this study, we investigated the distribution patterns of fish resources in Qiandao Lake, a large, deep-water lake in eastern China, using hydroacoustic methods. The results revealed pronounced spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the horizontal distribution of fish within the lake. Fish density peaked in autumn at 74.77 (+/- 5.59) ind./1000 m2 and reached its lowest level in winter at 14.65 (+/- 1.18) ind./1000 m2. Regionally, fish densities in the upstream (northwestern), midstream (central), and downstream (southeastern) areas were 84.80 (+/- 4.32), 64.16 (+/- 5.15), and 53.88 (+/- 8.78) ind./1000 m2, respectively, showing an increasing trend with distance from the dam. The vertical distribution of fish also exhibited seasonal and regional variation. In spring, summer, and autumn, peak target strengths were recorded in the -50 to -45 dB range, with most fish measuring 10-20 cm in length. In contrast, during winter, peak target strengths shifted to the -45 to -40 dB range, with the smallest proportion of fish falling in the 1-10 cm size category, while size distributions across other ranges were relatively uniform. Generalized additive model (GAM) analysis revealed that fish density was significantly influenced by environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, nitrite (NO2-), phosphate (PO43-), and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn). These findings suggest that fish distribution in lakes is shaped by regional variations in water quality, with additional impacts from human activities, including the opening of shipping lanes and fisheries management policies. This research provides valuable insights for optimizing fisheries management in large deep-water lakes.					; Lu, Xiaoli/D-7090-2012; he, xi/JXN-3817-2024; Lin, Haibin/ABI-8047-2020	hu, zhong jun/0000-0003-4550-562X; 														2073-4441				DEC	2024	16	24							3543	10.3390/w16243543	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16243543													WOS:001386824300001

The species is capable of reaching very high densities in the invaded ecosystems, with not only evidence for significant food-web effects on the native biota and habitats, but also negative implications to coastal fishers. Although generally considered a coastal species, it has been shown that round goby migrate to deeper areas of the Great Lakes and other inland lakes during the cold season. Such seasonal movements may create new spatio-temporal ecosystem consequences in invaded systems. To seek evidence for seasonal depth distribution in coastal marine habitats, we compiled all available catch data for round goby in the Baltic Sea since its invasion and until 2017. We furthermore related the depths at capture for each season with the ambient thermal environment. The round goby spend autumn and winter at significantly deeper and offshore areas compared to spring and summer months; few fish were captured at depths < 25 m in these colder months. Similarly, in spring and summer, round goby were not captured at depths > 25 m. The thermal conditions at which round goby were caught varied significantly between seasons, being on average 18.3 degrees C during summer, and dropping to a low 3.8 degrees C during winter months. Overall, the fish sought the depths within each season with the highest possible temperatures. The spatial distribution of the round goby substantially overlaps with that of its main and preferred prey (mussels) and with that of its competitor for food (flatfish), but only moderately with the coastal predatory fish (perch), indicating thereby very complex trophic interactions associated with this invasion. Further investigations should aim at quantifying the food web consequences and coupling effects between different habitats related to seasonal migrations of the round goby, both in terms of the species as a competitor, predator and prey.					; Huwer, Bastian/AAX-6093-2021; Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016; Behrens, Jane/ADK-2595-2022; Einberg, Heli/KMA-2829-2024; Smoliński, Szymon/IQT-1286-2023; Nõomaa, Kristiina/HKO-5219-2023; Ustups, Didzis/K-1750-2019; Polte, Patrick/KHY-5189-2024	Behrens, Jane Windfeldt/0000-0002-0136-9681; Smolinski, Szymon/0000-0003-2715-984X; Plambech Ryberg, Marie/0000-0002-4485-9576; Eschbaum, Redik/0000-0001-6382-9295; Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; Einberg, Heli/0000-0002-4045-5101; Oesterwind, Daniel/0000-0002-1093-4283; Florin, Ann-Britt/0000-0002-7531-2231; van Deurs, Mikael/0000-0003-2368-2502; Noomaa, Kristiina/0000-0002-9539-4932; Huwer, Bastian/0000-0003-4715-5918; Hussy, Karin/0000-0002-1993-6146; 													1387-3547	1573-1464				FEB	2022	24	2					527	541		10.1007/s10530-021-02662-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02662-w		NOV 2021											WOS:000714827100001

We used high-frequency in situ dissolved oxygen measurements to investigate the seasonal variability and factors regulating metabolism in a subtropical alpine lake in Taiwan between May 2004 and October 2005, specifically exploring how the typhoon season (from June or July to October) affects lake metabolism. 2. Gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R) both peaked in early summer and mid-autumn but dropped during the typhoon season and winter. Yuan-Yang Lake is a net heterotrophic ecosystem (annual mean net ecosystem production -39.6 mu mole O-2 m(-3)). 3. Compared to the summer peaks, seasonal averages of GPP and R decreased by approximately 50% and 25%, respectively, during the typhoon season. Ecosystem respiration was more resistant to external disturbances than GPP and showed strong daily variation during typhoon seasons. 4. Changes in the quality and quantity of dissolved organic carbon controlled the temporal dynamics and metabolic regulation. External disturbances (typhoons) caused increased allochthony, increasing DOC and water colour and influencing lake metabolism. 5. Seasonal winter mixing and typhoon-induced water mixing in summer and autumn play a key role in determining the extent to which the lake is a seasonal carbon sink or source to the atmosphere.

J	Berman, T; Pollingher, U; Zohary, T				Berman, T; Pollingher, U; Zohary, T			A short history of stability and change in phytoplankton populations in Lake Kinneret	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												From the beginning of detailed routine monitoring in 1968 (and probably before) until the end of 1993, annual and seasonal development of phytoplankton in Lake Kinneret showed a relatively constant pattern. In the late winter and early spring there were extensive blooms of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense, followed in summer and autumn by much lower standing stocks of predominantly nannoplanktonic chlorophytes. Although Microcystis spp. were prominent (usually concomitant with the dinoflagellates) in the early 1970s, subsequently this genus and other cyanobacteria were generally unimportant contributors to phytoplankton biomass. Since early 1994, however, a marked change in seasonal phytoplankton development has been noted. There were record high blooms of Peridinium in 1994 and 1995; in the following years, 1996 and 1997, no dinoflagellate bloom appeared. In the late summer and fall of 1994 an exceptional bloom of Aphanizomenon ovalisporum occurred; this was the first recorded instance of an outgrowth of a potentially toxic and N-2-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium in this lake. This organism has been observed in low numbers in each subsequent year. In 1995, 1996, and 1997 Microcystis also became prominent. Levels of primary production since 1994 have generally been higher than previous multi-annual averages. The quality of water in Lake Kinneret is to a large extent determined by the nature and activity of its phytoplankton community. Because of the lake's central role as a national supply source of good-quality water, the apparent breakdown of previously regular patterns of the annual and seasonal algal development is a cause for concern. Integrated research and monitoring are needed to fully explain the causes of the observed and ongoing changes and to provide guidelines for future management policies aimed at maintaining water quality in Lake Kinneret.																			0792-9978						1998	46	2					73	80		10.1080/07929978.1998.10676712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07929978.1998.10676712													WOS:000075969100002

Diurnal and Seasonal Variability of Near-Surface Oxygen in the Strait of Georgia	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Dissolved oxygen (O-2) concentrations in waters of the ocean surface mixed layer are generally close to thermodynamic equilibrium with atmospheric concentrations. However, near-surface O-2 levels are also affected by other processes, including primary productivity, and thus measurements of near-surface O-2 can in theory be used to estimate productivity. Here we discuss variations in near-surface O-2 concentrations in the Strait of Georgia by examining a variety of data sets, focusing primarily on ferry-based measurements over a 3-year period (2015-2017). Both diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations are quantified, and various fluxes into and out of the surface waters are estimated so that the degree to the measured oxygen variations representing biological activity can be assessed. On average, advective and vertical transport makes only a small negative contribution, while other budget terms show a strong seasonal cycle, lowest in winter, peaking in spring and slowly dropping to winter level during summer and autumn. For most of the year, the air-sea flux is the largest term, but the storage term is important during the spring blooms. Diurnal variations of 5-10% saturation in measured oxygen levels must therefore largely reflect diurnal cycles in productivity and respiration. We estimate respiration effects from the rate of decay of O-2 at night, which yields an average respiration rate of 459mmolm(-2)day(-1). This value is almost an order of magnitude larger than the other budget terms we have discussed, suggesting that a future focus on diurnal variations might provide most insight into biological processes in the Strait.

Lake Ontario water quality during the 2003 and 2008 intensive field years and comparison with long-term trends	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Phosphorus loading declined between the 1970s and the 1990s, leading to oligotrophication of the offshore waters of Lake Ontario during that time period. Using lake-wide data from the intensive field years of 2003 and 2008 and from available long-term data sets on several trophic state indicators (total phosphorus [TP], soluble reactive silica [SRSi], chlorophyll a and Secchi disc transparency [SDT]), we tested the hypothesis that oligotrophication of the offshore waters of Lake Ontario has continued in the 2000s. Significant differences between 2003 and 2008 include higher spring (April) TP, SRSi, and SDT in 2008, lower summer (July-August) SDT in 2008, higher summer chlorophyll a in 2008, and lower fall (September) TP, SRSi, and chlorophyll a in 2008. The decline in SRSi from spring to summer was greater in 2008 than in 2003. Change point and regression analyses on the long-term data revealed no trend in spring TP since 1996, in summer chlorophyll a since 1994, in spring SDT since 1998, in spring SRSi or SRSi decline from spring to summer since 1999, or in summer SDT since 2001.

The concentrations of inorganic N in the lake water were quite similar at all sites. The differences in the total N content of the Myriophyllum tissue site to site related directly to the levels of available sediment N, indicating a dependent upon the sediment as a N source. Myriophyllum tissue N concentrations (ash and moisture-free basis) were highest in spring, decreased steadily during the summer and increased again in the fall. Myriophyllum apparently grows very little during the winter, but continues to accumulate N. The death and decay of a considerable portion of the Myrophyllum in the fall contributes insignificant amounts of N directly to the lake water. N does not appear to be limiting M. spicatum growth in Lake Wingra.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1976	6	2					137	144		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01597.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01597.x													WOS:A1976BM81400005

The arithmetic activity concentrations for 226Ra, 232Th and 40K in the water samples were established to be 1.54 f 0.21, 2.39 f 0.0.33 and 77.94 f 1.70 Bq/L; 1.22 f 0.18, 2.38 f 0.31 and 63.79 f 1.48 Bq/L; 1.18 f 0.18, 1.89 f 0.30 and 51.30 f 1.33 Bq/L; 1.34 f 0.20, 2.30 f 0.32 and 68.14 f 1.56 Bq/L, for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. It was observed that 232Th was about twice as high as the WHO's recommended levels for drinking water. In wet seasons of spring and winter, Drinking water show higher average activity concentration than those in summer and autumn. The results obtained from ANOVA statistical tests showed that only 40K had a statistically significant difference in concentration throughout the four seasons (p = 0.029). Both the external and internal hazard indices (0.025 and 0.03) are significantly below the recommended value of one. The committed effective dose is measured at 0.70 mSv/y, while the annual effective doses for outdoor and indoor exposure are 0.006 mSv/y and 0.043 mSv/y, respectively. The calculated excess lifetime cancer risk due to water ingestion is 2.46 x 10-3, whereas the cancer risk for indoor and outdoor exposure is 0.02 x 10-3 and 0.15 x 10-3, respectively. With the exception of the annual committed effective dose and the cancer risk associated with water consumption, all hazard indices are significantly below the recommended global standards.																			0306-4549	1873-2100				FEB	2026	226								111883	10.1016/j.anucene.2025.111883	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anucene.2025.111883		SEP 2025											WOS:001575378400003

Seasonal Dynamics of Methanotrophic Bacteria in a Boreal Oil Sands End Pit Lake	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Base Mine Lake (BML) is the first full-scale demonstration end pit lake for the oil sands mining industry in Canada. We examined aerobic methanotrophic bacteria over all seasons for 5 years in this dimictic lake. Methanotrophs comprised up to 58% of all bacterial reads in 165 rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses (median 2.8%), and up to 2.7 x 10(4) cells mL(-1) of water (median 0.5 x 10(3)) based on qPCR of pmoA genes. Methanotrophic activity and populations in the lake water were highest during fall turnover and remained high through the winter ice-covered period into spring turnover. They declined during summer stratification, especially in the epilimnion. Three methanotroph genera (Methylobacter, Methylovulum, and Methyloparacoccus) cycled seasonally, based on both relative and absolute abundance measurements. Methylobacter and Methylovulum populations peaked in winter/spring, when methane oxidation activity was psychrophilic. Methyloparacoccus populations increased in the water column through summer and fall, when methane oxidation was mesophilic, and also predominated in the underlying tailings sediment. Other, less abundant genera grew primarily during summer, possibly due to distinct CH4/O-2 microniches created during thermal stratification. These data are consistent with temporal and spatial niche differentiation based on temperature, CH4 and O-2. This pit lake displays methane cycling and methanotroph population dynamics similar to natural boreal lakes. IMPORTANCE The study examined methanotrophic bacteria in an industrial end pit lake, combining molecular DNA methods (both quantitative and descriptive) with biogeochemical measurements. The lake was sampled over 5 years, in all four seasons, as often as weekly, and included sub-ice samples. The resulting multiseason and multiyear data set is unique in its size and intensity, and allowed us to document clear and consistent seasonal patterns of growth and decline of three methanotroph genera (Methylobacter, Methylovulum, and Methyloparacoccus). Laboratory experiments suggested that one major control of this succession was niche partitioning based on temperature. The study helps to understand microbial dynamics in engineered end pit lakes, but we propose that the dynamics are typical of boreal stratified lakes and widely applicable in microbial ecology and limnology. Methane-oxidizing bacteria are important model organisms in microbial ecology and have implications for global climate change.					; Furgason, Chantel/OMM-8822-2025; Sheremet, Andriy/IAP-7010-2023; Dunfield, Peter/C-3105-2009; Albakistani, Emad/JVO-1310-2024	Albakistani, Emad/0000-0002-8836-5578; Smirnova, Angela/0000-0002-3410-8349; Dunfield, Peter/0000-0002-9319-4697; Furgason, Chantel/0000-0003-3852-2413; Nwosu, Felix Chinweije/0000-0001-7154-6092; Verbeke, Tobin/0000-0002-0900-3254; Lindsay, Matthew B.

A cloud-free Terra image is available on average every day during the summer and early fall, every other day during spring and late fall, and every third day during the winter. MODIS-derived lake SWT exhibits a cool bias (similar to-1.5 degrees C) relative to in situ temperature observations gathered from three buoys and a slowly-moving watercraft. The dominant SWT signal is the annual cycle (with a range of 26 degrees C and peak temperature in mid-July) while the diurnal range is as large as 4 degrees C during the spring season. Year-to-year variations in SWT are largest during the fall with over 1 degrees C anomalously warm (cold) departures from the 8-year monthly medians observed during fall 2001 (2006). The MODIS imagery provides an updated SWT climatology for operational weather forecasting applications (e.g., lake-effect snow storm prediction) as well as for input into operational and research numerical weather prediction models.

Charlotte; Deng, Guiping			SEASONAL PATTERN IN THE HIGH-ELEVATION FLUVIAL TRAVERTINE FROM THE JIUZHAIGOU NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE, SICHUAN, SOUTHWESTERN CHINA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												The Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve on the Tibetan Plateau (Sichuan, southwestern China) is characterized by the deposition of fluvial travertine in a spectacular array of shoals, waterfalls, pool dams, and multicolored lakes. This is possibly the highest vegetated travertine setting of the world, from 2200 to 2900 m above sea level, an environment sensitive to minimal changes in temperature and precipitation regime. The evolution of the system is driven by two seasonal monsoon climate patterns with a wet spring-summer travertine deposition and then a dry fall-winter characterized by no precipitation or erosion. Spring and phreatic-vadose deposits transition from laminated columnar calcite to clotted micrite encrustation, possibly correlated with a mid-Holocene peak in precipitation and high lake levels in the northeastern Tibetan area connected to glacial advance. The most peculiar features are the fluvial shoals, a rather uncommon travertine surface consisting of two main superimposed facies of alternating weak-and strong-turbulence water flow. The low-turbulence facies consists of clotted micrite encrustation of mosses and cyanobacteria filaments, and platy calcite crystals covering algal filaments. The high-water-turbulence facies show seasonal alternation of diatom-rich bundles of Phormidium sp. (late spring) with algal Oocardium stratum levels (summer-fall). Upslope and downslope of the shoals, the precipitation of calcium carbonate results in the formation of prograding waterfalls and dam-pool systems that encrust macrophytes with microspar and clotted micrite. Encrusted chironomids larvae tubes are present in the waterfall walls up to an elevation of 2860 m, possibly the highest ever recorded. Early diagenetic processes such as dissolution of diatom frustules take place over the span of several years, a slower phenomenon compared to other travertine occurrences. In this high-elevation extreme setting, travertine sand and gravel bar deposits are produced by the exposure to severe weathering of a section of the valley that is bypassed through an underground karst system during the winter dry season. High-elevation travertine probably has a low preservation potential, but it appears to be more sensitive to climate changes than other depositional settings, especially in the Himalayan-Tibetan area, where the extent of the Quaternary glacial advances and retreats is still a matter of debate.					; Qiao, Xue/AAH-3453-2019; Lugli, Stefano/B-7963-2013	Reghizzi, Matteo/0000-0001-8589-096X; Qiao, Xue/0000-0001-7412-5090													1527-1404	1938-3681				MAR	2017	87	3					253	271		10.2110/jsr.2017.14	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2017.14													WOS:000396820400004

Nevertheless, some taxa like Cyclops insignis, Ceriodaphnia setosa and Macrocyclops distinctus are considered to be rare in Hungary. The microcrustacean assemblages exhibited apparent seasonal succession with typical seasonal species. There appears to be at least two main successional patterns in the five ponds. After general cyclopoid copepod dominance in winter (Cyclops strenuus and Cyclops insignis), at sites with higher proportion of open water and submerged vegetation, spring was characterized by the dominance of the large cladoceran Daphnia curvirostris, which declined during summer, when microcrustacean assemblages composed mainly of smaller, littoral cladocerans. At these sites, species richness and diversity reached their maximum in autumn. In the case of duckweed covered ponds, succession led to less diverse autumn assemblages with fewer species, dominated by Simocephalus exspinosus. Our results draw the attention to the importance of long-term investigations and the often neglected winter sampling in the accurate evaluation of species richness ((c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Molecular and phenotypic characterization of Photobacterium damselae among some marine fishes in Lake Temsah	MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS												Photobacterium damselae species are one of the most devastating bacterial pathogens in mariculture worldwide. Some species of Photobacterium are pathogenic for marine animals and human. They are the causative agents of photobacteriosis, formerly known as pasteurellosis. A total of (202) marine fishes of three different species were represented as: seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), seabream (Sparus aurata) and gray mullet (Mugil capitus) randomly collected from Lake Temsah at Ismailia governorate along the parallel Pelagic road to the lake in the governorate from August 2015 to July 2016. The clinical picture and gross lesions of the diseased fishes were recorded. Isolation and identification of suspected bacteria using traditional and molecular methods. Samples from affected organs were collected for studying the histopathological alterations of these pathogens. Fifty one fishes were found to be infected with Photobacterium damselae subsp. Piscicida. Seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) was the most infected fish species (23), followed by seabream (Sparus aurata) (18) finally gray mullet (Mugil capitus) was (10). 91fishes were found to be infected with P. damselae subsp. damselae, seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) was the most infected fish sp. (36), followed by seabream (Sparus aurata) (32), then gray mullet (Mugil capitus) (23). The results indicated that, the total prevalence of P. damselae subsp. piscicida in all examined species (25.24%), the highest seasonal prevalence was recorded in summer season (37.09%) followed by autumn (26%) then spring (20.37%) and winter (11.11%). On the other hand, the total prevalence of P. damselae subsp. damselae in all examined species (45.04%), the highest seasonal prevalence was recorded in summer season (67.74%) followed by autumn (52%) then spring (29.62%) and winter (19.44%). Molecular diagnosis with conventional PCR used to confirm the traditional isolation was applied by using specific primers of two genes (polycapsular saccharide gene and urease C gene). The histopathological studies of naturally infected marine fishes showed severe inflammatory reactions in different organs with accumulation of melanomacrophages and necrosis. The results confirm that P. damselae subspecies damsalea is the most prevalent pathogen between marine fishes, and seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) was the highly affected marine fishes in this study.					; El-Lamie, Maather/HMV-2851-2023; Dessouki, Amina/LLL-0263-2024; Bayoumy, Elsayed/A-4019-2015; Derwa, Hassan/HOA-7645-2023	Omar, Ahmed/0000-0002-4936-6340; Ismail, Mona M./0000-0002-4186-5145; Elsheshtawy, Hassnaa/0000-0001-8713-6995; Dessouki, Amina/0000-0001-5302-9438; Bayoumy, Elsayed/0000-0002-3106-6745; Derwa, Hassan/0000-0003-0364-5544; 													0882-4010					JAN	2018	114						315	322		10.1016/j.micpath.2017.12.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.12.006								29225092					WOS:000426226700050

Understanding how these species adapt to new environments is essential for their conservation and population recovery. However, behavioral adaption (particularly circadian activity patterns) of reintroduced Milu deer (Elaphurus davidianus), a special species disappeared in the wild for centuries, remains poorly understood during their initial release into historical range from captivity. We investigated the circadian behavioral rhythms of Milu reintroduced to the East Dongting Lake, using data transmitted by the GPS collars from winter 2020 to autumn 2022. The results showed that Milu's diurnal activity predominated over nocturnal activity (generally crepuscular pattern), with 1-4 activity peaks within a 24-hour period. From winter 2020 to autumn 2022, there were significant sexual differences in activity rhythms during winter 2020, summer 2021, summer 2022, and autumn 2022 (P < 0.05). Except for summer 2022 of male Milu (U2 = 0.09, P > 0.05), the deer exhibited pronounced activity concentration trends in the eight quarters. Moreover, human disturbance also influenced the circadian rhythm and activity levels of Milu. Our study indicated that Milu gradually adjusted their circadian activity rhythms after reintroduction to their historical habitat and revealed the remarkable behavioral plasticity of Milu. The reintroduction of Milu into nature reserves underscores the significant role of combining ex situ conservation with in situ conservation for the protection of endemic endangered species.																			2045-2322					OCT 7	2025	15	1							34833	10.1038/s41598-025-21345-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-21345-3								41057647					WOS:001589752000048

Monitoring the spatial-temporal changes in surface water can directly support the reporting of progress towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs) outlined by the government, especially for measuring SDG 6.6.1 indicators. In our study, we focused on Baiyangdian Lake, an important lake in North China, and explored its spatiotemporal extent changes from 2014 to 2020. Using long-term Sentinel-1 SAR images and the OTSU algorithm, our study developed an automatic water extraction framework to monitor surface water changes in Baiyangdian Lake at a 10 m resolution from 2014 to 2020 on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. The results showed that (1) the water extraction accuracy in our study was considered good, showing high consistency with the existing dataset. In addition, it was found that the classification accuracy in spring, summer, and fall was better than that in winter. (2) From 2014 to 2020, the surface water area of Baiyangdian Lake exhibited a slowly rising trend, with an average water area of 97.03 km(2). In terms of seasonal variation, the seasonal water area changed significantly. The water areas in spring and winter were larger than those in summer and fall. (3) Spatially, most of the water was distributed in the eastern part of Baiyangdian Lake, which accounted for roughly 57% of the total water area. The permanent water area, temporary water area, and non-water area covered 49.69 km(2), 97.77 km(2), and 171.55 km(2), respectively. Our study monitored changes in the spatial extent of the surface water of Baiyangdian Lake, provides useful information for the sustainable development of the Xiong'an New Area and directly reports the status of SDG 6.6.1 indicators over time.

Future changes of water budget of the Upper Volga catchment area were estimated from: past and present dynamics of the atmospheric, water and forest conditions, different climatic scenarios and SVAT (Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer) and hydrological models. Analysis of past climatological and hydrological data showed a large atmospheric and hydrological variability of the Upper Volga catchment. During the last 50-60 years the mean annual air temperature increased by 1.2 degreesC, and annual precipitation increased by 140 mm. However, no significant trend of annual runoff during the last 20 years could be found. Air temperature and precipitation changes were significant during winter and spring but very small in summer. Coniferous and mixed coniferous-broadleaf forests cover at present about 72% of the catchment area. During the last 30 years the area of natural coniferous forests (spruce, pine) decreased from 8.4% to 7% and the area of mixed forests increased from 52% to 59% of the total land area. Results of field measurements at a forest site showed a large variability of energy and water fluxes during the entire year. Transpiration of the boreal forest ecosystem measured using a sap flow method during the dry summer 1999 was limited by very dry soil water conditions. especially for spruce trees. and during the rainy summer 2000 probably by lack of oxygen in the rooting zone. Transpiration was about 10-20% larger for broadleaf trees (birch, aspen) than for spruce trees. Model estimations of possible changes in the hydrological regime of the Upper Volga catchment area for climatic scenarios suggest changes of evapotranspiration, surface runoff and soil moisture storage, Reduced snow accumulation, earlier melting, increased runoff reaction on precipitation in autumn and winter and drier soils in summer are the principal impacts on water resources of predicted future climatic changes. Surface runoff during the spring will be higher but summer and autumn runoff can be slightly suppressed by higher transpiration of deciduous tree species. Decreased summer precipitation and increased transpiration will result in decreasing ground water discharge, and lowering water levels of Volga river and of the Upper Volga lakes.

MiSeq high-throughput sequencing was conducted for the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene and was used to analyze the microbial community structure in sediments. Pearson correlation and redundancy analysis (RDA) were conducted to determine the relation between microbial populations and eutrophic factors. The results demonstrated four main patterns: (1) in the 36 samples that were collected, the classification annotation suggested 64 phyla, 259 classes, 476 orders, 759 families, and 9325 OTUs; (2) The diversity indices were ordered according to their values as with summer > winter > autumn > spring; (3) The microbial populations in the four seasons belonged to two distinct characteristic groups; (4) pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) had significant effects on the community composition and structure, which further affected the dissolved total phosphorus (DTP) significantly. The present study demonstrates that the microbial communities in Sancha Lake sediments are highly diverse, their compositions and distributions are significantly different between spring and non-spring, and Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria may be the key populations or indicator organisms for eutrophication.																				1660-4601				JUN 1	2019	16	11							1931	10.3390/ijerph16111931	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16111931								31159184					WOS:000472132900059
J	Huovinen, P; Ramírez, J; Caputo, L; Gómez, I				Huovinen, Pirjo; Ramirez, Jaime; Caputo, Luciano; Gomez, Ivan			Mapping of spatial and temporal variation of water characteristics through satellite remote sensing in Lake Panguipulli, Chile	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Central-southern Chile is characterized by a series of large lakes that originate in the Andes Mountains. This region is facing increasing anthropogenic impact, which threatens the oligotrophic status of these lakes. While monitoring programs are often based on a limited spatial and temporal coverage, remote sensing offers promising tools for large-scale observations improving our capacity to study comprehensively indicators of lake properties. Seasonal trends (long-term means) and intra-lake variation of surface water temperature (SWF), turbidity and chlorophyll a in Lake Panguipulli were studied through satellite imagery from Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI (1998-2018: SWT, turbidity), and Sentinel-2A/B MSI (2016-2017; chlorophyll). Remotely sensed data were validated against in situ data from monitoring database. Satellite-derived SWT (representing the surface skin layer of water, socalled skin temperature) showed good similarity with in situ (bulk) temperature (RRMSD 0.17. R-2 = 0.86), although was somewhat lower (RMSD of 2.77 degrees C ; MBD of -2.10 degrees C . Seasonal long-term means of turbidity from satellite imagery corresponded to those from in situ data, while satellite-derived predictions (based on OC2v2 algorithm) overestimated chlorophyll a levels slightly in summer-spring. SWT ranged from 8.0 degrees C in winter to 17.5 degrees C in summer. Mean turbidity (1.6 FNU) and chlorophyll a (1.1 mu g L-1) levels were at their lowest in summer. Spatial and seasonal patterns reflected the bathymetry and previously described mixing patterns of this monomictic lake: warming of shallow bays in spring extended to wider area along with summer stratification period, while mixing of the water column was reflected in spatially more homogenous SWT in fall-winter. Spatial heterogeneity in summer was confirmed by a clear separation of different lake areas based on SWT, turbidity and chlorophyll a using 3-D plot. Mapping of spatial and seasonal variation using satellite imagery allowed identifying lake areas with different characteristics, improving strategies for water resource management.

J	Raubitschek, S; Lücke, A; Schleser, GH				Raubitschek, S; Lücke, A; Schleser, GH			Sedimentation patterns of diatoms in Lake Holzmaar, Germany -: (on the transfer of climate signals to biogenic silica oxygen isotope proxies)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The seasonal sedimentation pattern of diatom valves in Lake Holzmaar was investigated during 1995 by deploying sediment traps at three different lake depths. According to the sedimentation pattern, the major reproduction zone of diatoms was restricted to the upper 6 m of the water body. The population growth started late in April and blooms of Cyclotella cf. comensis Grun., which dominates the plankton diatoms, and Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton were collected in traps during June and September, and July, respectively. During summer, the seasonal sedimentation pattern of each taxon, as collected in the upper traps, was reflected in the concentrations in the lowest trap. However, in May and from September onwards, the community composition in the lowest trap and augmented trapping rates suggest both sediment focusing and resuspension of bottom sediments. The temperature signals as recorded by delta(18)O values of diatom valves should, therefore, reflect integrated temperatures between 0 and 6 m depth. However, temperatures during summer and autumn are expected to be accentuated in the sedimentary record since the isotopic signal is weighted by both the number and the weight-mass of the valves. During summer, the transfer of these signals by the sedimenting diatoms retains the information pattern recorded, while in spring and autumn/winter additional influxes caused by resuspension may somewhat alter those temperature informations. The proxy signals finally stored in the sediments, may, therefore, not precisely represent the successive temperatures currently recorded during 1995 within mid-lake.

Eukaryotic assemblages of surface sediment biofilms collected in January, May and September 2002 were compared from 13 sampling stations along the river. Physicochemical data revealed extremely acidic conditions (the pH ranged from 0.9 to 2.5) with high concentrations of heavy metals, including up to 20 mg 1(-1) Fe, 317 mg 1(-1) Zn, 47 mg 1(-1) As, 42 mg 1(-1) Cd and 4 mg 1(-1) Ni. In total, 20 taxa were identified, including members of the Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Euglenophyta phyla as well as ciliates, cercomonads, amoebae, stramenopiles, fungi, heliozoans and rotifers. In general, total cell abundances were highest in fall and spring but decreased drastically in winter, and the sampling stations with the most extreme conditions showed the lowest number of cells, as well as the lowest diversity. Species diversity did not vary much during the year. Only the filamentous algae showed a dramatic seasonal change, since they almost disappeared in winter and reached the highest biomass during the summer. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed a high inverse correlation between pH and most of the heavy metals analyzed, as well as Dunaliella sp., while Chlamydomonas sp. was directly related to pH during May and September.

Therefore, it is of great significance to study the spatial-temporal variation of inorganic anions during the dry and wet atmospheric deposition to ensure the water ecological security of the South-North Water Diversion Middle Route Project (MRP). This study investigated the spatial-temporal variation of inorganic anions (F, Cl, NO3, and SO42) concentration and its sedimentation fluxes in dry and wet deposition, and their influence on water quality through 10 automatic dust rainfall collection devices installed in the Henan section of the MRP from October 2018 to October 2020. Results indicated that the anion concentration and deposition flux in dry and wet deposition varied in space and time, and SO42 was the highest anion in dry deposition (178.88 +/- 175.60 mg/L) and NO3 was the highest anion in wet deposition (52.02 +/- 24.63 mg/L). Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that there was a correlation between the wet deposition of anions (F, Cl, NO3, and SO42) and water quality in winter in the Henan section of the MRP (p < 0.05), and anions dry deposition fluxes have an effect on spring and winter water quality, while the wet deposition fluxes only have an impact on summer and autumn water quality due to the abundant precipitation in summer and autumn. This study could provide new data support for management measures such as strengthening the ecological environment and water quality protec-tion in the MRP.

J	Patelli, M; Leoni, B; Lepori, F				Patelli, Martina; Leoni, Barbara; Lepori, Fabio			Causes of Daphnia midsummer decline in two deep meromictic subalpine lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Daphnia are key organisms in pelagic food webs, acting as a food resource for fish and predatory zooplankton and regulating phytoplankton through grazing. Its population dynamic follows regular seasonal patterns, with spring peaks followed by summer population declines (midsummer declines, MSDs). Midsummer declines show high inter-annual variation, which has been attributed to different causes. However, the mechanisms controlling the MSD remain poorly understood, especially in deep stratified lakes. We tried to disentangle the factors causing Daphnia MSDs in Lake Lugano and Lake Iseo (in Switzerland and Italy), two deep peri-alpine lakes with similar trophic status and vertical mixing dynamics, characterised by phosphorus accumulation in the hypolimnion and variable mixing during late-winter turnovers. Specifically, we assessed the effects of three different hypothetical pathways according to which: (1) winter air temperature controls MSDs by influencing mixing depth during turnovers and epilimnetic phosphorus replenishment; (2) vernal air temperature influences MSD by accelerating the timing of spring population peak; and (3) summer temperature influences MSDs by increasing fish predation. We assessed the relative strength of these pathways using structural equation modelling on long-term datasets for the two lakes (29 years for Lake Lugano and 19 years for Lake Iseo). Between the hypothesised pathways, the one driven by winter air temperature (through P replenishment) influenced Daphnia abundance in spring in both lakes, but the effects propagated to summer Daphnia abundance only in Lake Lugano. Additionally, summer Daphnia abundance was influenced by the summer air temperature through a positive (although weak) effect. By comparison, vernal air temperature had no detectable effects on summer Daphnia abundance. The results revealed marked differences between the meromictic study lakes and the shallow hypertrophic water bodies that were the focus of previous research on Daphnia MSD, and also between the two study lakes. The influence of epilimnetic P replenishment on the summer Daphnia abundance in Lake Lugano, which was recovering from past eutrophication, may have reflected the greater susceptibility of deep, stratified lakes to P depletion after spring compared to shallow hypertrophic lakes or reservoirs. This effect might not have been detected in Lake Iseo because P was more consistently depleted during the study period (i.e. variance in the predictor was too low to detect an effect). This study highlighted the complexity of the effects of climate variability on Daphnia MSD in deep lakes, showing that the responses can differ even between two neighbouring lakes with similar vertical mixing dynamics and trophic status. At the same time, the results suggest that future increases in winter air temperature, caused by global warming, may cause critically low densities of Daphnia during spring and summer and compromise the ability of zooplankton to control phytoplankton biomass.					; Lepori, Fabio/F-8966-2012	Lepori, Fabio/0000-0002-6438-9452; Patelli, Martina/0000-0002-7029-9875; LEONI, BARBARA/0000-0001-9448-9457; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2020	65	4					731	744		10.1111/fwb.13462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13462		DEC 2019											WOS:000503974100001
J	Zhou, J; Zhao, JH; Zhi, R				Zhou, Jie; Zhao, Junhu; Zhi, Rong			Possible causes of the anomalous characteristics of autumn rain in western China in 2017	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												We analyzed the anomalous characteristics of autumn rain in western China (ARWC) (26.2-36 degrees N, 101.9-111.8 degrees E) in 2017 and the related large-scale atmospheric circulations based on new monitoring indicators published by the China Meteorological Administration in 2015 and the National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data. We found that the characteristics of autumn rain in the southern (33-36 degrees N, 101.9-111.8 degrees E) and northern (26.2-33 degrees N, 101.9-111.8 degrees E) regions of the monitoring area were different. The onset date of autumn rain in the north (south) of the monitoring area in 2017 was 14 (16) days earlier than in normal years, which is in the 4th (4th) place since 1961. The end of the autumn rain was 5 days later (earlier) than in normal years. The autumn rain period was 54 (63) days long, 19 (11) days longer than in normal years. The autumn rainfall in the north (south) of the monitoring area was 234.1 (322.2) mm, 72.6% (74.4%) higher than that in normal years. The amount of autumn rain in the southern region is in the second place since 1965. The cause of this significantly early onset of the ARWC in 2017 was the advanced transition of the East Asian atmospheric circulation system from a summer pattern to a winter pattern. The westerly jet in the upper troposphere appeared about 10 days earlier than in normal years. The meridional circulation of a west-high and east-low pattern was observed in the mid- and lower troposphere in the mid- and high latitudes of Eurasia. This circulation configuration resulted in an early onset of the ARWC. As a result of the influence of the persistent warming of the Indian Ocean basin-wide mode from spring to summer, the west Pacific subtropical high was extremely strong (the second strongest since 1981) and its westernmost point was greatly extended to the west (the second greatest extension since 1981) during the autumn rain period. The intensity of the moisture flux from the southwest of the western Pacific subtropical high was stronger than usual and the low trough of Lake Baikal was also strong. Cold air from the north and the abundant warm, humid water vapor from the south converged in western China, resulting in more precipitation during the autumn rain period.

J	HARPER, PP				HARPER, PP			ASSOCIATIONS OF AQUATIC INSECTS (EPHEMEROPTERA, PLECOPTERA, AND TRICHOPTERA) IN A NETWORK OF SUB-ARCTIC LAKES AND STREAMS IN QUEBEC	HYDROBIOLOGIA												As part of an impact assessment of large hydroelectric projects in the James Bay drainage in Northwestern Quebec, the aquatic insect communities were studied in a network of rivers, lakes and streams during the summer of 1975. Thirty-eight emergence traps operated over the ice-free season yielded 10,888 insects (5559 Ephemeroptera, 2817 Plecoptera, and 2512 Trichoptera), representing 148 species (respectively 44, 18, and 86), most of temperate and boreal affinities. There was no arctic element. Similarity analyses and clustering procedures on the emergence series revealed the existence of distinct insect communities in the river (fast and slow sections), the streams (fast and slow), the lakes and the bogs, each characterized by a particular assemblage of species. Many of the species were more or less ubiquitous and differences between communities were marked more by changes in the dominance of the species and differences in the frequency distributions, than absolute shifts in the species lists. The yields in the traps set in fast water were much greater than those in slow running water, and these in turn greater than those of standing water. By comparison with more southerly sites, the seasonal succession of species was retarded in the spring and early summer, but was not shortened appreciably in the fall. The usual emergence patterns associated with these taxa was observed, namely those of spring, sumemr and autumn species.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 17	1990	199	1					43	64		10.1007/BF00007833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007833													WOS:A1990DU43900007

While rotifers of more than one genus often dominated a sample, the dominant form tended to be one species. Generally, stations with high population densities had low species diversity. Turbulence, silt, and some other edaphic factors appeared to be more important than industrial or domestic wastes, during winter and early spring, in reducing the number of species of rotifers in the biota. During the summer and fall, differences in the abundances of dominant species appeared to be the best criterion for indicating differences in water quality or pollution.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1966	11	1					83	+		10.4319/lo.1966.11.1.0083	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1966.11.1.0083													WOS:A19667707600010

The Importance of Spring Mixing in Evaluating Carbon Dioxide and Methane Flux From a Small North-Temperate Lake in Wisconsin, United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												In limnological studies of temperate lakes, most studies of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions have focused on summer measurements of gas fluxes despite the importance of shoulder seasons to annual emissions. This is especially pertinent to dimictic, small lakes that maintain anoxic conditions and turnover quickly in the spring and fall. We examined CO2 and CH4 dynamics from January to October 2020 in a small humic lake in northern Wisconsin, United States through a combination of discrete sampling and high frequency buoy and eddy covariance data collection. Eddy covariance flux towers were installed on buoys at the center of the lake while it was still frozen to continually measure CO2 and CH4 across seasons. Despite evidence for only partial turnover during the spring, there was still a notable 19-day pulse of CH4 emissions after lake ice melted with an average daytime flux rate of 8-30 nmol CH4 m(-2) s(-1). Our estimate of CH4 emissions during the spring pulse was 16 mmol CH4 m(-2) compared to 22 mmol CH4 m(-2) during the stratified period from June to August. We did not observe a linear accumulation of gases under-ice in our sampling period during the late winter, suggesting the complexity of this dynamic period and the emphasis for direct measurements throughout the ice-covered period. The results of our study help to better understand the magnitude and timing of greenhouse gas emissions in a region expected to experience warmer winters with decreased ice duration.

However, the long-term effects of dredging on chromium (Cr) contamination remain unclear. This study was conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of sediment dredging on Cr contamination in Lake Taihu, six years after dredging was performed. In this study, high-resolution equilibrium dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) sampling techniques were used for sampling total dissolved Cr and DGT-labile Cr(VI) at the sediment water interface. The results show that the vertical averaged concentrations of total dissolved Cr in summer (112.6 +/- 28.8 mu g/L) and winter (115.3 +/- 29.9 mu g/L) in the non-dredged site were above the fisheries water quality standard (AEPC, 2002). They were 38% lower in overlying water and 20% lower in sediment pore water in the dredged site in winter, while in summer the reduction was not evident. The concentration of total dissolved Cr in the dredged site was significantly higher in spring and autumn than those in the non-dredged site, which was probably caused by the large rainfall and river discharge during the two seasons. The vertically averaged concentrations of DGT-labile Cr(VI) in both the non-dredged and dredged sites did not exceed the drinking water quality standard requirements (WHO, 1993). Modeling of DGT-induced fluxes from sediment into overlying water showed a higher response time (T-c) and lower adsorption rate (k(1)) and desorption rate (k(-1)) in the dredged site except in summer, indicating that sediment dredging decreased Cr mobility in sediments. Overall, these results confirm that sediment dredging decreased the risk of Cr contamination in winter in Lake Taihu.

J	Twomey, L; Thompson, P				Twomey, L; Thompson, P			Nutrient limitation of phytoplankton in a seasonally open bar-built estuary: Wilson Inlet, Western Australia	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The potential for nutrient limitation to affect the phytoplankton community was assessed from 1997 to 1998 in Wilson Inlet, Western Australia. Samples of the endemic phytoplankton community were assayed by giving them nutrient mixes deficient in one of the following: nitrogen, phosphate, silicate, iron, trace metals, or vitamins. When ranked from those treatments with the most potential to limit phytoplankton biomass to those with less potential, the bioassay results suggested that N>P>>Si>Fe, and trace metals and vitamins were never potentially limiting In summer and autumn, the bioassay data suggested that nitrogen and phosphorus were the nutrients with greatest potential to constrain phytoplankton biomass, Though the concentrations of soluble nutrients were high in winter, bioassays indicated that the phytoplankton community was potentially nutrient limited. Physical conditions such as high flow rate, greater turbidity, lower temperature, and greater light attenuation contributed to lower phytoplankton growth rates during winter. The bioassay data implicated that the phytoplankton biomass was least Likely to be constrained by dissolved inorganic nutrients in spring than any other time of the year. In spring the endemic phytoplankton community responded to salinity-stratification induced sediment-nutrient release with a marked increase of biomass, Nitrogen was the nutrient with greatest potential to limit the phytoplankton biomass during spring. The bioassay data conflicted with the dissolved inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus molar ratios, which suggested that P was more likely to limit the phytoplankton biomass during spring. The discrepancy between the two data sets was probably caused by inaccuracies in measuring the concentration of dissolved inorganic phosphoras in spring. Therefore, the results from the current study suggest that the Redfield paradigm, based on the ratio of dissolved inorganic nutrient concentration, provided an inadequate description of phytoplankton nutrient limitation in Wilson Inlet.

Here, we examined the influence of sex, age, and season on the carcass composition of American Wigeon (Anas americana) in the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas during the migration and wintering periods. Wigeon (N = 621) were collected from late fall through early spring, and carcass components (lipid, protein, and mineral) were estimated for each bird. Overall, carcass mass and lipids increased from autumn to early or midwinter and declined thereafter. However, over-winter changes in carcass reserves differed among sex and age groups. Wigeon of different sex and age groups maintained lipid and protein reserves to different degrees and used those reserves through the winter at different rates. The lack of premigratory fattening suggests that wigeon in the SHP must obtain most of the resources necessary for reproduction en route to breeding grounds, and highlights the importance of suitable stopover locations on their migratory routes. Changes in mean structural size of wigeon sampled during the nonbreeding season, in conjunction with genetic data, suggest that the wintering population in the SHP was composed of birds from several breeding populations. Our research will aid migratory bird biologists in determining how wigeon that differ in sex and age meet their over-winter resource needs, and in evaluating the responses of wigeon to habitat conservation and management efforts.

J	BURN, CR				BURN, CR			THE HYDROLOGIC REGIME OF MACKENZIE RIVER AND CONNECTION OF NO CLOSURE LAKES TO DISTRIBUTARY CHANNELS IN THE MACKENZIE DELTA, NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Mackenzie Delta lakes have been classified by the seasonal duration of their connection to Mackenzie River. ''No-closure'' lakes are determined on the basis of minimum summer water level. Such lakes may become disconnected from the Mackenzie in autumn or winter, as water level falls or if the sills between lakes and distributary channels are frozen through and so sealed. Water level in the central delta rises continuously after late November - early December, at first because discharge into the delta increases once the Mackenzie drainage basin has frozen over, and then as sea and channel ice thickens in the outer delta, impounding discharge. Since 1973 this seasonal increase in stage from its minimum in early December to the level on 1 April has been between 29 and 95 cm. Between 1987 and 1994, the rise in stage near Inuvik has been slightly greater than increases in lake-ice thickness (30-68 cm). Channels and lakes that are connected to the Mackenzie discharge system in December may remain connected throughout winter. A critical sill elevation for connection of such lakes to the river system is the minimum stage minus mid-December ice thickness. Recently, these elevations have been from 1.0 to 1.6 m lower than late summer water levels. Lakes with sill elevations still lower may remain connected to the Mackenzie throughout the year. In 1993-1994, only 3 of 16 ''no-closure'' lakes surveyed near Inuvik remained open to the Mackenzie discharge throughout winter, representing 2% of the lakes in this portion of the delta.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JUL	1995	32	7					926	937		10.1139/e95-078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e95-078													WOS:A1995RZ63400010

Specific species for the near-bottom water layer were not recorded but numbers of crustaceans were frequently higher in this layer than numbers noted in the pelagial. The food availability may be one of the reasons for the abundance of filter-feeders close to the bottom. Bosmina longirostris and Eudiaptomus graciloides formed aggregations in particular parts of the lake at various seasons. In autumn the highest densities of these species were in the near-bottom layer and closer to the shore, in winter-close to the bottom in the deepest part of the lake, in spring and summer-in pelagial and in waters close to the shore.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	83	3					411	418		10.1007/BF02187038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02187038													WOS:A1981MG88200008

Bioenergetics and growth of young-of the-year northern pike (Esox lucius) and burbot (Lota lota) exposed to metal mining effluent	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												We hypothesized that exposure to metal mining effluent would reduce the ability of young-of-the-year fishes to accumulate energy reserves to survive the overwinter period (known as "winter stress syndrome") in a Canadian boreal forest watershed. Northern pike (Esox lucius) and burbot (Lota Iota) were collected immediately before and after winter from a reference lake and two lakes receiving effluent. Unexpectedly, total body lipid and triglyceride, and liver triglyceride levels were greater in effluent-exposed pike and burbot in both fall and spring. However, there were no lake or season differences in growth indices of length, weight, muscle RNA/DNA ratio, or muscle protein levels in pike. In addition, total lipids and triglycerides in burbot were greater in, spring compared to fall, while no seasonal differences were observed in pike, suggesting that burbot continued to feed during winter. Findings do not support the winter stress syndrome hypothesis and suggest possible direct and indirect effects of metal mining effluent on lipid dynamics of juvenile fishes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, three strategies including irrigation depth reduction, changing planting dates and crop rotation in crop patterns of Urmia city were assessed for improvement of water productivity to mitigate the crisis of Lake Urmia. For this purpose, the AquaCrop simulation model was applied. The effects of the three strategies were investigated with four indicators: (i) total water productivity (TWP); (ii) economic water productivity (EWP); (iii) farmers' benefit (FB); (iv) dry yield (DY). The results showed that a 60% reduction of current irrigation depth for winter wheat, winter barley, forage maize and tomato and a 40% reduction for sunflower substantially increased TWP and EWP without considerable reduction in DY and FB. Early planting dates for autumn planting crops (wheat and barley) and delaying planting dates for spring planting crops led to a decreased irrigation requirement and increased benefit from rainfall. For the autumn planting pattern, selecting winter barley reduced water consumption by 2170 m(3) ha(-1) compared to winter wheat, and for the spring planting pattern, selecting forage maize decreased water consumption by 2080 and 3150 m(3) ha(-1) compared to sunflower and tomato, respectively.

A combination of process studies in situ and analysis of historical water quality data suggests that nitrogen fixation was not the principal mechanism for acquiring nitrogen and unlikely to be the mechanism whereby C. raciborskii gains a competitive advantage. Ammonium was the preferred nitrogen source, followed by nitrate then nitrogen fixation. 3. Ammonium uptake rates in the euphotic zone were higher in the summer and autumn months compared with winter and spring coinciding with lower ammonium concentrations. Nitrate uptake rates did not appear to vary seasonally and were lower than those for ammonium in the summer, but similar in winter. Nitrate concentrations were higher in winter than summer and generally higher than ammonium concentrations. 4. Ammonium and nitrate uptake rates were similar at light intensities between 10% and 100% of surface light, contrasting with primary productivity which peaked between about 10 to 20% of surface light. Thus the phytoplankton population was adapted to low light conditions but remained able to utilise dissolved inorganic nitrogen over a wide range of light conditions. 5. The ammonium pool in the surface waters was relatively small compared with the phytoplankton uptake rates, and ammonium must therefore be rapidly recycled through the food web over periods of less than 1 h. Short-term depletion may result, during which time the higher concentrations of nitrate are likely to provide a supplementary supply of nitrogen. 6. The dominance of C. raciborskii in this reservoir is more likely to be due to a superior ability to scavenge and store the low concentrations of phosphate, and a superior adaptation to the low light conditions exacerbated by artificial mixing.

By Dec. 31, 1974, 910 (23.3%) had been recovered. Tag return data indicate that tagged inconnu comprise 4 major populations: Kobuk-Selawik, lower Yukon, Kuskokwim and Minto Flats. Inconnu undertake rapid downstream postspawning migrations to wintering areas in lower reaches of large rivers (Yukon, Kuskokwim) or slightly brackish inlets (Hotham Inlet, Selawik Lake), then begin slow upstream migration before spring ice breakup, with nonspawning fish traveling to summer feeding areas and spawners migrating to spawning grounds during summer and fall. Minto Flats fish are nonanadromous. Three fish, tagged in the lower Yukon River and recaptured in the Koyukuk River, migrated upstream 1035-1156 km, averaging 13.8 km/day. The longest migration recorded was nearly 1600 km.																									1977	34	1					129	133		10.1139/f77-016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-016													WOS:A1977CT39800016

One extreme event stands out in 1983, in association with the anomolous extent of the El Nino current in the Pacific Ocean. Winter conditions in 1983 in Lake Ontario appear to be within the warmest 5% of winters on record: this is reflected in air and water temperatures and in the very early onset of full thermal stratification of Lake Ontario. The data provide a means of assessing the spring conditions of any particular year and also provide some predictive capability should one wish to schedule experiments to take advantage of particular thermal structures in spring or early summer.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1987	44	12					2225	2229		10.1139/f87-273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-273													WOS:A1987M856600021

Seasonal differences in bacterial community composition following nutrient additions in a eutrophic lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												P>We examined the effects of nutrient amendments on epilimnetic freshwater bacteria during three distinct periods in the eutrophic Lake Mendota's seasonal cycle (spring overturn, summer stratification and autumn overturn). Microcosm treatments enriched solely with phosphorus containing compounds did not result in a large bacterial community composition (BCC) change or community activity response (assessed via alkaline phosphatase activity, APA) relative to the controls during any season. Treatments enriched with carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds resulted in a dramatic BCC change and a large APA increase in the autumn and spring seasons, but only treatments receiving carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (CNP) exhibited similar responses in the summer season. Despite the fact that the amendments created similar CNP concentration conditions across seasons, the BCC following amendment greatly varied among seasons. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that many common freshwater bacterial lineages from the Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria class and Bacteroidetes phylum were favoured following nutrient (CNP) addition, but individual taxa were generally not favoured across all seasons. Targeted quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the abundance of the Actinobacteria acIB1 cluster decreased in all microcosms during all three seasons, while the Flavobacterium aquatile (spring) and ME-B0 (summer) clusters of Bacteroidetes increased following CNP addition. These results suggest a particular bacterial group is not universally favoured by increased nutrient loads to a lake; therefore, efforts to predict which bacteria are involved in nutrient cycling during these periods must take into account the seasonality of freshwater bacterial communities.					; McMahon, Katherine/I-3651-2012	McMahon, Katherine D./0000-0002-7038-026X; 													1462-2912					APR	2011	13	4					887	899		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02387.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02387.x								21138514					WOS:000289116700005

Jun; Li, Siyue			Daily and seasonal variations of CO2 and CH4 diffusive emissions in the largest urban lake of China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lakes are an important source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), but current research is still fragmented and overlooks daily and seasonal variability of the greenhouse gas emissions in urban lakes. In this study, we conducted high-resolution field measurements on CO2 and CH4 diffusion during the daytime over three seasons in the largest eutrophic urban lake in China. The lake showed a clear daily sink-source shifting of CO2 in the autumn and summer days, but acted as a source of atmospheric CO2 in the spring days. Strong declining trends of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and flux (FCO2) from morning to afternoon were observed across different seasons. Specially, CO2 measurements at 11:00-13:00 in autumn and spring and at 8:30-9:30 in summer had the least deviation to the daily means. Unlike with CO2, the lake served as an important source of atmospheric CH4 throughout the study period. CH4 fluxes were higher in the morning than in the afternoon. The peak flux was typically observed in two-time intervals: 8:00-11:00 in the autumn and spring, and 15:00-19:00 in the summer. Relationships between declining rates of daily pCO2 and FCO2 and ambient factors revealed that water temperature, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a had a great potential for predicting daily variation in lake CO2 diffusive fluxes. Ammonia-nitrogen seemed to have played a role in influencing the daily fluctuation of CH4 fluxes. The study reveals that urbanization and eutrophication amplify the daily variability in CO2 and CH4 emission fluxes from urban lakes, while they also introduce additional uncertainties when single-timepoint sampling approach is employed. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating urban lakes and diel carbon dynamics for accurately estimating the carbon budget of lacustrine ecosystems.

J	FOUDA, MM				FOUDA, MM			LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES OF 4 SMALL-SIZE FISHES IN THE SUEZ CANAL, EGYPT	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Of 35 species collected from the shores of the Suez Canal and its lakes, five were abundant year round. Sihouettea aegyptia and aphanius dispar are of Red Sea (warm water) origin, whereas Pomatoschistus marmoratus, Aphanius fasciatus and Atherina boyeri are Mediterranean species. S. aegyptia and A. dispar are distributed throughout the Suez system whereas A. fasciatus is restricted to the northern canal. P. marmoratus and A. boyeri have not spread southward beyond the Bitter Lakes. Salinity is the main limiting factor for the distribution of Mediterranean species. S. aegyptia and A. dispar are dominant in the Bitter Lakes (salinity 44 parts per thousand), whereas P. marmoratus and A. boyeri are abundant in Timsah Lake (salinity 7.8-41.6 parts per thousand). There was considerable interannual and monthly variation in the relative abundance of each species. The populations were dominated by a single age group, and life spans were no more than 2 years. Rapid growth was evident during the first spring in P. marmoratus and A. boyeri and during the first summer, early autumn in S. aegyptia and A. dispar. The relative abundance of each food item in the diet varied with fish size and season. S. aegyptia, P. marmoratus and A. dispar fed mostly on harpacticoid copepods, polychaetes, demersal eggs, diatoms and blue-green algae whereas A. boyeri fed mostly on planktonic copepods. The warm water species are summer spawners, whereas the temperate species are autumn-winter spawners.																			0022-1112					APR	1995	46	4					687	702		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1995.tb01104.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1995.tb01104.x													WOS:A1995QW42700009
J	Wang, YF; Sun, XG; Yang, XQ				Wang Yan-Feng; Sun Xu-Guang; Yang Xiu-Qun			Role of snow depth in the influence of El Nino on summer climate anomalies over East Asia	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION												Utilizing the datasets of Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) NOAH land surface model, GPCC monthly mean rainfall and NCAR/NCEP global monthly mean reanalysis from 1948 to 2010, and the methods of filtering, composite and linear correlation, the characteristics of Eurasian snow depth anomalies in El Nino mature winter, its influences on soil moisture after snow melting, and finally on East Asian summer monsoon are investigated, and the main conclusions are as follows: In El Nino mature winter, the snow depths in regions of Iranian Plateau, northeast of Balkhash Lake, and south of Tibetan Plateau increase remarkably, so are the related snow melting and soil moisture. The above-mentioned three regions are identified as the key regions for snow depth to store and extend the El Nino signals. In spring, the snow begins to melt, and the soil moisture increases correspondingly, thus the El Nino signals are transmitted from winter snow depth to soil moisture in spring. As a result, sensible heat flux decreases and latent heat flux increases, and the atmospheric circulations are greatly influenced. The anomalous soil moisture in the Iranian Plateau is most important for the East Asian summer monsoon in El Nino decaying summer, since it has similar impact pattern on the anomalous summer precipitation as the El Nino composite. The spring and summer soil moisture in both the south of Tibetan Plateau and the northeast of Balkhash Lake increase simultaneously, which significantly contribute to the increased precipitation in North China. Therefore, to investigate and predict the East Asian summer monsoon variabilities by using El Nino signal, the roles of snow depth in storing and modulating El Nino impacts in those key regions should be considered.

An investigation of the seasonal and depth distribution of populations of autotrophic picoplankton (0.2-2-mu-m), nanophytoplankton (> 2 < 20-mu-m) and larger microalgal plankton (> 20-mu-m) was carried out over 2 1/2 years. 1988-90, in Llyn Padarn, a mesotrophic upland lake in North Wales. 2. Cell numbers of picophytoplankton ranged from < 10(2) to > 10(6) cells cm-3. Maximum numbers of nanoplankton were c. 10(4) cells cm-3 and the greatest abundance of microalgal plankton, diatoms, reached 12 x 10(3) cells cm-3. 3. Three types of picoalgae were distinguished: coccoid to oval Synechococcus-Synechocystis, the rod-shaped Synchecococcus capitatus Bailey-Watts & Komarek and Chlorella minutissima Fott & Novakoa, with maximum numbers of 1.2 X 10(6), 37.8 X 10(3) and 44.1 x 10(3) cells cm-3, respectively. 4. Picophytoplankton exhibited periods of exponential growth: the first in spring, and the second in August-September with an intervening population minimum in early to midsummer. Specific rates of population increase for picophytoplankton were low, with minimum apparent generation times of 3.8 days in summer 1989. 5. Nanophytoplankton included seven species of phytoflagellates and two non-motile species. These algae were present for about 10 months in each year exhibiting a fluctuation in population density of 10(2)-10(3) cells cm-3. 6. There were spring and autumn maxima in chlorophyll a concentrations in the lake water corresponding to the growth of planktonic diatoms. Maximum total biomass concentration was 35 mg m-3 chlorophyll a, whereas pico, nano and microphytoplankton had individual maxima of 7.7, 8.4 and 31.0 mg m-3 chloropbyll a, respectively. Picophytoplankton often contributed > 60% of the total algal chlorophyll a in the epilimnion. 7. The growth patterns and seasonal periodicities of the three size-categories of planktonic algae in Llyn Padarn were distinct. Picophytoplankton persist throughout much of the year with periods of very low abundance, < 100 cells cm-3, occurring in winter and midsummer. Thus for much of the year, there was a large inoculum of these cells in the lake to initiate growth leading to the population maxima in spring and late summer. Nanoplankton populations, a diverse assemblage, fluctuated in numbers over the period February-November; no population decline in midsummer comparable to picophytoplankton was observed. The larger microphytoplankton exhibited classical seasonal periodicity, namely diatom growth in spring and late summer-autumn with growth of large-celled chlorophytes in the intervening summer period.																			0046-5070					DEC	1991	26	3					453	480		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb01412.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb01412.x													WOS:A1991HC04600012

Whole-lake dissolved inorganic 13C additions reveal seasonal shifts in zooplankton diet	ECOLOGY												Sustained whole-lake additions of C-13-enriched dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), intended to increase experimentally the delta C-13 of DIC in the epilimnion of a small lake with high dissolved organic carbon (DOC), were made during three seasonal periods (spring, summer, and autumn). Coupled with carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of zooplankton and several of their putative food sources, these additions were used to investigate seasonal changes in the relative contributions of different food sources to zooplankton diet in the lake. Four main potential food sources were considered: phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria (HB), methanotrophic bacteria (MOB), and green sulfur bacteria (GSB). Because the number of potential food sources exceeded the number of isotopes analyzed, a computer program (IsoSource) was used to estimate the range of possible contributions of the various food sources. During all three periods the added inorganic C-13 quickly increased the epilimnetic DIC delta C-13 by between 18 parts per thousand and 21 parts per thousand above the initial value of approximately -21 parts per thousand. This C-13 enrichment of DIC was rapidly transmitted to the particulate organic matter (POM), which included photosynthetic phytoplankton. In spring and summer, delta C-13 of both adult and juvenile Daphnia increased by similar to 10 parts per thousand, indicating that Daphnia utilized autochthonous carbon. However, this C-13 labeling of Daphnia was not so obvious during the autumn period, when their delta C-13 generally decreased. According to the IsoSource model outputs based on both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, Daphnia utilized all four potential food source types during spring, summer, and autumn, but in different proportions. The possible contribution of phytoplankton to Daphnia diet was substantial (25-71%) in all seasons. The possible contributions of the bacterial food sources were more variable. The possible contribution of GSB was minor (0-20%) at all times and negligible in autumn. The possible contribution of HB was higher but very variable. Methanotrophic bacteria always made a significant contribution to Daphnia diet and were likely the single most important food source in autumn. Since both HB and MOB in this high-DOC lake probably depend largely on allochthonous organic carbon, our results highlight the seasonal variability in the potential importance of ecosystem subsidies in lake food webs.					; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020	Tiirola, Marja/0000-0001-5589-3748; Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264; 													0012-9658					FEB	2008	89	2					463	474		10.1890/07-0702.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-0702.1								18409435					WOS:000254124200018
J	SVEDANG, MU				SVEDANG, MU			THE GROWTH DYNAMICS OF JUNCUS-BULBOSUS L - A STRATEGY TO AVOID COMPETITION	AQUATIC BOTANY												The macrophytic cyperid Juncus bulbosus, which assimilates only free CO2 has recently invaded acidified lakes in Northern Europe, where its expansion has been linked to elevated free CO2 levels in the water. During the summers of 1984-1986 the biomass of Juncus bulbosus was monitored in the slightly acidic Lake Anketjarn on the Swedish west coast. Comparable seasonal trends were repeated each year with the highest biomass developing in May, followed by a decline during the summer. Growth experiments in situ showed that the specific growth rate reached its minimum in August. The patterns were similar at 0.5 and 1.5 m depth, but usually the rate was slightly higher at 0.5 m. The decline in Juncus biomass and growth rate coincided with a fall in CO2 concentration in the water, and an increased epiphytic cover on the Juncus plants. Long term growth experiments showed that Juncus plants at 1.5 m depth continued to grow during the winter and following spring, while plants at 0.5 m died during the winter. Plants grown in vitro at different temperatures had the ability to grow even at 4.degree.C. Thus, the life cycle exhibited by J. bulbosus in Lake Anketjarn may reflect a strategy to avoid competition for inorganic carbon with other primary producers in the lake. Through utilization of a very low light compensation point and the ability to grow at low temperatures, J. bulbosus may have the capacity of effective production and uptake of the rich CO2 supply early in spring, possibly even under the ice, as soon as light allow positive photosynthesis.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				JUL	1990	37	2					123	138																WOS:A1990DT82300002

Collections of immatures from dip nets and Surber samples were augmented with adult specimens taken in sweep nets and hand-picked from streamside rocks. Species (73) distributed among 60 genera in 7 orders were collected. Based on the diverse composition of the community dominated by organisms intolerant of organic enrichment, water quality in Stoney Brook is not significantly degraded. Community composition varies seasonally, with a trend toward a declining proportion of facultative organisms and increasing proportions of saproxenous and saprophobic organisms from winter through spring and into summer. Benthic diversity in Penitentiary Glen compares favorably with that in similar, relatively undisturbed northeastern Ohio streams, but the identity and proportional distribution of aquatic taxa varies considerably between streams.																			0030-0950						1984	84	3					113	119																WOS:A1984SW14100008

White bass recruitment was erratic in these lakes. The relative abundance of age-0 white bass, as determined by means of bottom trawling during late summer and early fall, was positively related to both precipitation and air temperature during the previous spring. Based on its otolith, the oldest white bass collected was age la. Growth through age 6 was faster in the lakes studied than an average for eight Midwestern states despite the lack of gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum as a prey base in those lakes. White bass and walleyes Stizostedion vireum coexist in most of the large glacial lakes in eastern South Dakota. Diet overlap between age-0 white bass and age-0 walleyes in one study lake was high in July but then declined through September. Diet overlap between age-1 and older walleyes and white bass was at a seasonal high during May and declined throughout the summer. In both May and September, diet overlap decreased as fish length increased; white bass relied more on macroinvertebrates, while walleyes were more piscivorous. Biotelemetry was used to track the daily and monthly distributions of white bass in Lake Poinsett. Fish were offshore during the summer and winter; during the spring and fall. they were in shallow waters near shore, which may be related to spawning and feeding activities. White bass tended to be closer to shore during the evening crepuscular period across seasons. Significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) but weak (r less than or equal to 0.50) correlations were found between the distance of white bass from shore and environmental variables (temperature, cloud cover, precipitation, and moon phase). but no multiple regression model explained more than 26% of the white bass distribution. Harvesting of white bass by anglers was seasonal, with the highest catches in the spring.

J	Salmaso, N				Salmaso, Nico			Interactions between nutrient availability and climatic fluctuations as determinants of the long-term phytoplankton community changes in Lake Garda, Northern Italy	HYDROBIOLOGIA					2nd European Large Lakes Symposium (ELLS)	AUG 10-14, 2009	Norrtalje, SWEDEN					Major focus in interpreting phytoplankton changes in specific typologies of waterbodies or in single lakes is directed towards nutrients and climatic dynamics. During the last 35 years, Lake Garda (Northern Italy; A = 368 km(2), z (max) = 350 m, V = 49 km(3)) underwent a significant increase of phosphorus in the water column, from ca. 10 mu g P l(-1) to 18-22 mu g P l(-1). At the multi-decadal scale, the increase of the trophic status had a positive impact on the growth of Cyanobacteria (mainly Oscillatoriales) and, partly, diatoms, as demonstrated by the long-term ecological research carried out since the beginning of the 1990s in the deepest zone of the lake. Conversely, the increase of Peridiniales (mostly Ceratium hirundinella) in the recent years appeared also associated with the interannual variations of lake temperature. At the seasonal and annual scale, the development of the large diatoms and Oscillatoriales during the periods of their maximum growth (early spring, and summer and autumn, respectively) was strongly controlled by the extent of spring vertical water mixing and nutrient fertilization of surface waters, which, in turn, were negatively dependent on the air and water temperatures in winter and early spring. Therefore, contrary to the positive impact of milder winters on phytoplankton growth in many lakes of high latitudes, warmer winter temperatures in deep oligomictic lakes of lower latitudes can determine periodic shifts towards more oligotrophic conditions and a minor development of diatoms and specific harmful cyanobacterial groups (Oscillatoriales). The complex relationships between the explanatory and response variables were tested by applying Path Analysis (Structural Equation Modeling). This multiequational technique has great potential for studying causal relationships in temporally ordered variables. The results highlight the necessity to study the consequences of climatic fluctuations on the phytoplankton communities at different temporal scales and complexity, also including the indirect effects of climatic dynamics mediated by the morphometric, morphological and hydrological characteristics of lakes, and the possible synergic or opposite effects with other forcing variables, including nutrients.

Suitability of Wetlands for Migrating and Breeding Waterbirds in Illinois	WETLANDS												Wetland-dependent bird populations may be limited by habitat in regions where wetland loss and degradation are pervasive, such as the midwestern United States. However, available spatial datasets, such as the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), may overestimate habitat availability if total wetland area includes wetlands unsuitable for wetland-dependent species. During 2016-2017, we assessed proportional coverages of wetland vegetation and inundation depth typically associated with suitable waterbird habitat relative to the NWI. We also modeled these data as a function of local and landscape characteristics during spring, summer, and autumn for three guilds of wetland-dependent, migratory birds. Suitable waterbird habitat conditions based on actual wetland characteristics measured comprised a small portion of the NWI. Shallowly inundated (<45 cm) emergent, aquatic bed, and forested wetlands suitable for foraging dabbling ducks comprised 29% of NWI area in Illinois during spring migration. Inundated emergent vegetation (Typhaspp.) for migrating and breeding secretive marsh birds comprised 5% of NWI polygons during summer. Mudflats for migrating shorebirds comprised 6% and 4% of NWI polygons in summer and autumn, respectively. Wetlands with greater vegetation complexity and connectivity to other wetland types had the greatest suitable area across bird guilds and periods. These findings will inform conservation planners estimating waterbird habitat area and generating model-based habitat objectives using the NWI.					; Matthews, Jeffrey/JJC-2123-2023	Blake-Bradshaw, Abigail/0000-0002-6224-3687; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2020	40	6					1993	2010		10.1007/s13157-020-01276-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-020-01276-7		SEP 2020											WOS:000567767100003

Until now, little has been known about the seasonal bacterial communities of the surface water of adjacent freshwater urban lakes. This study reported the bacterial communities of three adjacent freshwater lakes (i.e., Tangxun Lake, Yezhi Lake and Nan Lake) during the alternation of seasons. Nan Lake had the best water quality among the three lakes as reflected by the bacterial eutrophic index (BEI), bacterial indicator (Luteolibacter) and functional prediction analysis. It was found that Alphaproteobacteria had the lowest abundance in summer and the highest abundance in winter. Bacteroidetes had the lowest abundance in winter, while Planctomycetes had the highest abundance in summer. N/P ratio appeared to have some relationships with eutrophication. Tangxun Lake and Nan Lake with higher average N/P ratios (e.g., N/P = 20) tended to have a higher BEI in summer at a water temperature of 27 degrees C, while Yezhi Lake with a relatively lower average N/P ratio (e.g., N/P = 14) tended to have a higher BEI in spring and autumn at a water temperature of 9-20 degrees C. BEI and water temperature were identified as the key parameters in determining the bacterial communities of lake water. Phosphorus seemed to have slightly more impact on the bacterial communities than nitrogen. It is expected that this study will help to gain more knowledge on urban lake eutrophication.

Therefore, 22 Alabama Bass and 20 Redeye Bass were implanted with radio tags and tracked every 3 weeks for 37 weeks from December 2010 to September 2011 to describe seasonal patterns in movement and habitat use in the Tallapoosa River, Alabama, below R. L. Harris Dam. Additionally, fish of each species were tracked weekly every 2 h over the course of 10 h to assess the effects of altered flows on movement and habitat use by the two species during different periods of the hydrograph (base, rising, peak, and falling flows). Movement of both species was strongly associated with season, with the highest movement in the spring. Total home range (95%) and core areas (50%) of both species were similar, but Redeye Bass total home range was inversely related to fish size. Alabama Bass were typically found in fine-sediment substrates and increasingly used more woody debris for cover from winter to summer, whereas Redeye Bass were typically found in rocky substrate and only used woody debris in summer. Neither Alabama Bass nor Redeye Bass daily movement appeared to be affected by the altered flow; however, Alabama Bass were found closer to shore in vegetated or woody debris habitat during high flows in spring and summer. In contrast, Redeye Bass showed little lateral movement in the river or change in habitat use in response to higher flows in most seasons but, similar to Alabama Bass, were found in shoreline vegetated habitats more often during high flows in spring. These shifts in habitat during different flows should be further investigated to evaluate possible life-history strategies.

Variability in the vertical distribution of chlorophyll in a spill-managed temperate reservoir	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Perkins KR, Rollwagen-Bollens G, Bollens SM, Harrison JA. 2019. Variability in the vertical distribution of chlorophyll in a spill-managed temperate reservoir. Lake Reserve Manage. XX:XX-XX. Phytoplankton form the base of pelagic food webs, and as aquatic systems come under increasing pressure from environmental stressors, managers are becoming more concerned about how these pressures may result in changes to phytoplankton distribution and abundance. The vertical distribution of phytoplankton, including the phenomenon of subsurface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) maxima (SCM), is known to vary widely, with a combination of biotic and abiotic processes hypothesized to be driving this variation. We examined how the vertical distribution of Chl-a generally, and SCM specifically, varied over 4 years (2013-2016) in a managed temperate reservoir (Lacamas Lake, Washington, USA) that experiences rapid (2-3 weeks) release of water from within the epilimnion each autumn. Seasonally, a strong thermocline developed each spring at depths of 5-10 m, and persisted throughout summer and early autumn. Although temperature varied somewhat between years, elevated concentrations of Chl-a occurred in spring and summer of each year. In addition, pronounced SCM of 30-60 mu g/L at depths of 2-8 m were observed each year, and were nearly always above the thermocline. There was no "seasonal deepening" of SCM in Lacamas Lake, as has been observed in several other lakes and oceans, and annual drawdown events in early fall had little to no effect on SCM in Lacamas Lake. We recommend that more process-oriented studies be undertaken to fully understand which biotic and abiotic processes are driving the formation and maintenance of SCM in lakes and reservoirs, and how SCM are modulated by different reservoir drawdown practices.					; Harrison, John/F-2280-2011; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/Q-5520-2017	Bollens, Stephen/0000-0001-9214-9037; Harrison, John/0000-0002-0677-5478; Perkins, Kaitlin/0000-0002-5802-5708; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/0000-0002-5127-5720													1040-2381	2151-5530				APR 3	2019	35	2					119	126		10.1080/10402381.2019.1566935	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2019.1566935		APR 2019											WOS:000470438600001

Soil-environment-mediated seasonal changes in microbial structure require further investigation. However, the factors driving seasonal variations in the microbial abundance and diversity in the Daihai wetlands remain unclear. This study employed high-throughput sequencing technology to examine the bacterial community structure and diversity in the lakeshore zone of Daihai across different seasons and to explore the seasonal variations in the bacterial community structure and the influence of driving factors. The results indicated that Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota dominate in spring and Pseudomonadota abundance further increases in summer, while organic-matter-decomposing microorganisms (e.g., Actinobacteriota and Bacteroidota) dominate in autumn. Microbial diversity indices indicated a significantly greater diversity in spring than in summer and autumn (p < 0.05). Changes in environmental variables were strongly associated with bacterial community changes, with variations in total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and soil moisture content being identified as potential key factors influencing seasonal bacterial diversity trends. Furthermore, bacterial community assembly in spring is driven by both stochastic processes and environmental selection, suggesting that abundant nutrients and organic matter promote bacterial diversity. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for wetland ecosystem restoration and conservation.					yao, zhi/LYP-1225-2024; Yin, Zhen-Yu/W-3531-2019															2071-1050				DEC	2024	16	24							11221	10.3390/su162411221	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su162411221													WOS:001387237900001

In order to explore hydrochemical distributions in a mountain-oasis ecosystem in Central Asia, surface water and groundwater samples from the Kaidu River basin were collected over four seasons. pH values, major ions, total dissolved solids (TDS) and stable isotopes were determined during the period from 2016 to 2017. The results showed: (1) that most water bodies in the study areas were mildly alkaline and that hydrochemical distributions showed significant seasonal and spatial variation; (2) that delta D and delta O-18 in surface water and groundwater showed enrichment in summer and autumn and poverty in spring and winter, with higher delta O-18 values appearing in the oasis area and lower delta O-18 values appearing in the mountain area; (3) that most of the water bodies in the study areas were of HCO3-Ca2+ type, with the hydrochemical types of groundwater presenting obvious spatial inconsistency relative to surface water; (4) that rock weathering was the main factor controlling hydrochemical composition in the study areas and that human activities had an influence on the groundwater environment in the oasis area; (5) and that surface water-groundwater interactions also displayed spatial inconsistency, especially in summer. The interaction between river water and groundwater was more obvious in the traditional oasis area, especially in spring and summer. The results will be important for regional water resource management and sustainable water utilization.

J	SMITH, JD				SMITH, JD			SEASONAL TRANSMISSION OF RAPHIDASCARIS-ACUS (NEMATODA), A PARASITE OF FRESH-WATER FISHES, IN DEFINITIVE AND INTERMEDIATE HOSTS	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The seasonal transmission of Raphidascaris acus was studied in two small lakes on Manitoulin Island, Ontario [Canada]. Dragonfly nymphs and caddisfly larvae, acting as paratenic hosts, contained second-stage larvae. Several fishes, including percids and cyprinids, were intermediate hosts with second, third, and fourth-stage larvae in the liver. Yellow perch, Perca flavescens, was the most important of these. Intensities were up to 928 and increased with length and age of the perch; prevalence was 100%. Abundance of R. acus tended to be higher in females but was not related to condition of the perch. Second-stage larvae were acquired from invertebrates in summer and developed to the fourth stage by November. They became surrounded by fibrous capsules during the next summer but remained alive for at least another year. The longevity of larvae in the intermediate host may ensure survival of the parasite through periods of low host abundance after winterkill. Northern pike, Esox lucius, was the definitive host. Abundance of R. acus tended to be greater in larger pike but was not related to sex or condition of the fish. The parasite was acquired in late fall. Prevalence was 100% and mean intensities were over 200 in winter and spring, declining to 64-100% and less than 15, respectively, in summer. Mature worms were present from early spring through summer. Seasonality of infection in the definitive host is not attributable to seasonal availability of larvae in perch. Instead it may be controlled by timing of predation on perch and rate of development and longevity of the parasite. Transmission to pike apparently continues in summer. Low intensity may result from low recruitment rate and rapid turnover of the parasite population.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				AUG 30	1986	16	4					295	308		10.1007/BF00842985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00842985													WOS:A1986D965100010

Feedback between zebra mussel selective feeding and algal composition affects mussel condition: did the regime changer pay a price for its success?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We investigated the role of algal composition on pumping, clearance, assimilation, pseudofaeces and faeces production, feeding time budgets, and condition of zebra mussels from spring to autumn at two sites in Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron) and one site in western Lake Erie. Size-fractioned chlorophyll was used to distinguish between feeding on small (< 53 mu m) and large (> 53 mu m) size fractions, and mussel feeding behaviour was quantified by video observations. 2. Mussel pumping, clearance and assimilation rates varied among sites, particularly during summer, when phytoplankton composition varied considerably among sites. Lowest values were seen at the inner-bay site of Saginaw Bay, low to moderate values at the outer-bay site of Saginaw Bay, and high values at the Lake Erie site. Clearance, pumping and assimilation rates were all highly positively correlated (R-2 = 0.76) with per cent contribution of flagellates to total algal biomass and negatively correlated with per cent of Microcystis aeruginosa (R-2 = 0.63). The negative effects on pumping rate (as determined by clearance rate on the < 53 mu m fraction) of Microcystis, which occurred in the > 53 mu m fraction, could be mitigated by the presence of flagellates in the < 53 mu m fraction. 3. Visual observations of mussel feeding showed evidence for poor seston quality during summer negatively affecting feeding rates. High faeces production during times of low assimilation rate was suggestive of poor assimilation efficiency and/or viable gut passage of grazing resistant algae. Long periods of time not filtering by the mussels during some Microcystis blooms and lack of production of a filtering current during one experiment were suggestive of intoxication from microcystin or other secondary compounds. 4. Clearance and feeding rates of the mussels in Saginaw Bay were high during spring and autumn and very low in summer, particularly at the inner-bay site. Condition of the mussels (mass : length ratio) was highest in spring and lowest during summer. This seasonal variation probably reflected high food assimilation rate during autumn and spring and low assimilation rate and reproduction during summer. The condition of mussels throughout the year was higher at the outer-bay than the inner-bay site, reflecting better feeding conditions at the former. Mussel selective feeding may have been responsible for the poor quality of food at the inner bay site; therefore, we postulate that a regime shift in phytoplankton composition promoted by the mussels fed back into lowered condition of the mussels.

Various germination tests showed that plantlets from the early harvests were non-viable. Viability increased towards the end of the growing season and, at the last harvest, approximately 90% of the plantlets were capable of germinating. Plantlets showed no innate dormancy. The majority of plantlets were not dehisced from the panicle and establishment was largely through the collapse of the culm. Seeds of the closely related species, F. ovina, dehisced in July and exhibited a low primary dormancy. This could be broken by stratification and was lost after 2-3 mo. dry storage. Plantlets retained a greater capacity than seed to germinate at low temperature (3.degree. C) and field observations show that F. vivipara plantlets establish after culm collapse in the autumn while F. ovina seeds may not germinate until the following spring. Plantlets were capable of surviving for at least 25 wk under conditions of high relative humidity and low temperature in the laboratory, suggesting that they can survive the winter if they do not reach a suitable substrate for establishment.																			0028-646X	1469-8137					1978	81	3					745	751		10.1111/j.1469-8137.1978.tb01649.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1978.tb01649.x													WOS:A1978GF08500029

To estimate the seasonal and spatial distribution of APAHs in dustfall in Shanghai, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were the analytical methods applied to the dustfall samples collected in this area from Dec. 2004 to Oct. 2005. Forty-one APAHs were found and divided into six groups which were alkyl naphthalenes (ANAs), alkyl phenanthrenes (APHs), alkyl anthracenes (AANs), alkyl fluoranthenes (AFLs), alkyl pyrenes (APYs) and alkyl chrysenes (ACHs). ANAs and APHs were two dominant APAHs in the proportion of more than 50%. The concentrations of total APAHs ranged from 1.6 to 9.0 mu g g(-1). The ratios of APAHs to TPAHs (PAHs plus APAHs) fell into the range of 28 similar to 50%. The APAH levels were found to be higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. In terms of spatial distribution, concentration of APAHs was found to be higher in western Shanghai than eastern Shanghai. The source analysis showed that dustfall APAHs mainly derived from vehicle emissions and used crankcase oil. The annual fluxes of APAHs and PAHs in dustfall in urban Shanghai were 0.53 similar to 2.97 T and 0.96 similar to 5.34 T, respectively.

The total PCBs concentration (in pg/m(3)) ranged from 31.28 to 650.33 (mean: 273.77) and showed a significantly seasonal variation as summer > autumn > spring > winter. Gas PCBs accounted for 80.79% of total PCBs. The fraction of each gas PCB homolog increased with the decreasing chlorine atoms. The contribution of gas PCBs to total PCBs showed a strong seasonal variation with summer (94.07%) > autumn (78.91%) > spring (78.19%) > winter (56.02%). Tri-, tetra-and penta-PCBs were the predominantly homologs in Tianjin atmosphere. The natural logarithm of partial pressure of PCBs were well correlated with the inverse absolute environmental temperature (R = 0.79). The steep slope of -4933.64 obtained from Clausius-Clapeyron (C.C) plot indicated the influence of local PCBs sources. In generally, the C. C slopes and the surface-air exchange enthalpy (Delta H-SA) for different PCB homologs increased with the increasing chlorine atoms. The fraction of particle bound PCBs were underestimated for PCBs with P-L(0) > 10(-3.85) Pa and overestimated for PCB congeners with P-L(0) < 10(-3.85) Pa by Junge-Pankow model. The logarithm of particle/gas partitioning coefficients (log K-P) of PCBs were well correlated with the logarithm of respective sub-cooled vapor pressures (log P-L(0)) (R = 0.72) and the octanol-air partition coefficient (log K-OA) (R = 0.77). The slopes for log K-P against log P-L(0) and log K-OA plots were -0.44 and 0.48, deviated significantly from the expected -1 and +1 for the equilibrium state of gas/particle partitioning, possibly explained by the emission of PCBs and particles from the local industries and other sources. The TEQ concentrations (fg/m(3)) for 12 dioxin-like PCB congeners ranged from 35.628 to 612.796 with the mean value as 144.878.

During summer, 1-yr-old birds were recovered significantly farther from their natal colony than were older birds. Cormorants nesting in Canada and the northern United States from Alberta to the Gulf of St. Lawrence migrated in winter primarily to the southern United States between Texas and Florida. There was considerable mixing and overlap in winter of nesting populations from widely divergent areas. From 38 to 70% of the birds from Saskatchewan through the Great Lakes region were recovered in the lower Mississippi Valley as were 10% of the birds from such disparate areas as Alberta and the New England coast.

The potential metabolic support provided by the oxidation of neutral lipids and protein was calculated from these values. The fat levels of hares were low, 30 g (2.5% of the body wt), and showed little variation by gender or season. Carcass protein levels were .apprx. 20% of the wet carcass weight in both genders and did not vary seasonally. These reserves together represent about 4 days resting metabolic support during winter, 4-5 days'' support under spring conditions, and 6 days'' support under summer breeding conditions. The weight of selected major skeletal muscles and organs did not vary seasonally in either gender, indicating that hypertrophy and proteolysis were not occurring in this population. These metabolic reserves would not buffer chronic dietary inadequacies during winter existence and reproduction, and snowshoe hares must adopt a foraging strategy which maintains energy and N balance on a very short-term basis.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1983	61	6					1339	1345		10.1139/z83-180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z83-180													WOS:A1983QZ17600020

In northern China, mean maximum temperature (T-max) above 31 degrees C and high frequencies of hot days are concentrated in June-July. SSTAs in the NNA in the previous December-April have a significant positive relationship with the mean T-max from the Yellow River Basin to the north of the Yangtze River in June-July, and this significant positive correlation still exists after removing the trends. Correlation and composition analysis suggests that the NNA SST and high temperature in northern China are connected by the mid-latitude wave-train circulation anomalies across the Atlantic and Europe. Warm SSTAs in the NNA in winter and spring favour anticyclonic circulations in the NNA, Western Europe and the south of Lake Baikal, and cyclonic circulations in the northeastern North Atlantic and the Ural Mountains. The positive height anomaly and anticyclonic circulation in the south of Lake Baikal tend to result in downward motion and high temperature in northern China. The linkage between winter-spring North Atlantic SST and high temperature can be used to facilitate seasonal prediction of extreme high temperature in China.

J	Onandia, G; Miracle, MR; Vicente, E				Onandia, Gabriela; Rosa Miracle, Maria; Vicente, Eduardo			Primary production under hypertrophic conditions and its relationship with bacterial production	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												In shallow hypertrophic lakes where light availability restricts the growth of macrophytes and benthic phytoplankton, pelagic phytoplankton modulates importantly ecosystem production and the energy transfer to heterotrophic bacteria. Diel and seasonal variations in primary production (PP) were studied in the hypertrophic Albufera de Valencia (Spain). Additionally, the relationship between PP and heterotrophic bacterial production (BP) was assessed. PP was extremely high, exceeding most values reported for hypertrophic lakes to date. PP displayed marked diurnal variations defined by the solar radiation curve. Likewise, PP changed importantly across seasons. Minimum PP coincided with maximum water transparency and short water residence times in winter, whereas maximum PP was observed in late spring associated with high chlorophyll a. The spring PP maximum contrasted with the summer maximum often observed in hypertrophic lakes. When compared to spring PP values, summer PP values were lower as a result of strong nitrogen limitation. In contrast to PP, BP remained fairly constant across seasons. Nonetheless, there was a joint diminution during increased water transparency followed by an increase in early spring. Phytoplankton was always the most relevant input to particulate carbon production, but the BP/PP ratio showed clear seasonal variations. The BP/PP ratio was minimum in spring, low in summer and highest in winter. The extracellular dissolved organic carbon released by phytoplankton was sufficient to meet bacterial carbon demand in all experimental dates, suggesting that allochthonous carbon sources play a minor role in sustaining BP, though they cannot be excluded. However, we hypothesize that high availability of dissolved organic carbon might explain the lack of coupling observed between BP and PP.					; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2014	48	4					447	463		10.1007/s10452-014-9497-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-014-9497-9													WOS:000344800800008

Unfortunately, it completely dried out in 2021 due to sufficient rainfall, groundwater withdrawal and global climate change. In 2022, the lake started to hold water again. This study is important because it is one of the last studies before the lake dries up and first study to evaluate some heavy metals and selenium pollution using some indices. In this study, which was carried out between October 2019-July 2020, some heavy metals and selenium concentrations were determined in water of Karatas, Lake seasonally and evaluated pollution degree of lake water using some indices and statistical analysis. Water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen levels were measured in situ using YSI 556 MPS. For heavy metal analysis, water samples were taken, acidified to a pH of <2, stored at 4 C-degrees and analyzed directly using ICP-OES (Agilent 5110). Pb and Se in all seasons were below detection limit. The analyzed metals sorted as; Cd < Mo < Cr < Cu < Mn < Zn < Ni < Fe. Generally, heavy metals were increased in autumn and decreased in spring. According to some water quality standards for drinking water, Fe levels were higher than the permissible levels for drinking water in all seasons (TSE, 2005; EPA, 2018; EU, 2020), Mn in autumn (TSE, 2005; EPA, 2018; EU, 2020), Ni in autumn and summer (TSE, 2005; EU, 2020). Water Quality Index (WQI), Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI) and Heavy Metal Evaluation Index (HEI) values were calculated in Karatas, Lake to determine pollution degree. Depend on WQI results, lake water was in good category in autumn, winter and spring while poor category in summer. The lake water samples based on HPI and HEI values are in the low contamination category. The lake is still struggling with environmental problems. If necessary precautions are not taken for the future of the lake, the lake may dry out again. The results of this study will help the authorities in terms of preventing re-drying, sustainability of the lake and management of the region. This study will be also a reference for future studies.					; TEKİN-ÖZAN, SELDA/AHE-1909-2022	TEKIN OZAN, SELDA/0000-0002-8756-8859; TUNC, Meryem/0000-0002-6559-6664													0025-326X	1879-3363				FEB	2024	199								115927	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115927	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115927		DEC 2023						38141580					WOS:001147935000001

In Switzerland, rivers and lakes underwent an abrupt warming. A month-by-month comparison of water temperatures before and after the late 1980s CRS shows seasonal differences in the magnitude of the warming, which was stronger in winter, spring, and summer than in autumn. In lakes, the magnitude of the increase and the abruptness of the change diminished with increasing depth. Surface temperatures showed the most consistent abrupt warming. Hypolimnetic temperatures also increased, but the change was gradual in 3 of the 4 lakes studied. The abrupt warming in the late 1980s contributed substantially to the overall increase in temperature that has occurred in water bodies in Switzerland over the last few decades.

Predicting larval metamorphosis ofPacificlampreyEntosphenus tridentatusthrough measurements of length and mass	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The utility of length and mass measurements to predict the larval metamorphosis of Pacific lampreyEntosphenus tridentatus was evaluated. During 2004-2008, larvalE. tridentatuswere collected from Cedar Creek (Washington, USA) in either the spring or autumn, measured for total length and total mass, reared in captivity and monitored for metamorphosis. The minimum total length, total mass and condition factor of larvae that were observed to go through metamorphosis were 102 mm, 2.0 g and 1.52, respectively. Logistic models indicated that total length and condition factor in both spring and autumn were the most significant variables for predicting metamorphosis of Pacific lamprey during the subsequent summer. Mass in the autumn also appeared important to predict whether metamorphosis occurred in the subsequent summer. Collectively, all models using specific minimums of total length, total mass or condition factor of larvae as criteria for them to metamorphose were sometimes (5 of 14 cases) able to predict the percentage of larvae that would metamorphose but rarely (1 of 12 cases) able to predict which individual larvae would metamorphose. Similar to other anadromous species of lampreys, the size and condition of larvalE. tridentatushave utility for predicting metamorphic fate.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				SEP	2020	97	3					804	816		10.1111/jfb.14436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14436		AUG 2020						32558927					WOS:000555300800001

We use a process-based distributed snow model driven by an ensemble of eight statistically downscaled global climate models (GCMs) to project future changes under policy-relevant globalmean temperature (GMT) increases of 1.0 degrees C to 3.0 degrees C above the pre-industrial period. Results indicate that basin scale seasonal warmings generally exceed the GMT increases, with greater warming in winter months. The majority of GCMs project wetter winters and springs, and drier summers, while autumn could become either drier or wetter. An analysis of snow water equivalent (SWE) responses under GMT changes reveal higher correlations of snow cover duration (SCD), snowmelt rate, maximum SWE (SWEmax) and timing of SWEmax with winter and spring temperatures compared to precipitation, implying that these variables are predominantly temperature controlled. Consequently, under the GMT increases from 1.0 degrees C to 3.0 degrees C, the basin will experience successively shorter SCD, slower snowmelt, smaller monthly SWE and SWEmax, earlier SWEmax, and a transition from snow-dominated to rain-snow hybrid regime. Further, while the winter precipitation increases for some GCMs compensate the temperature-driven changes in SWE, the increases for most GCMs occur as rainfall, thus limiting the positive contribution to snow storage. Overall, this study provides a detailed diagnosis of the snow regime changes under the policy-relevant GMT changes, and a basis for further investigations on water quantity and quality changes.

The magnitudes of these fluxes and the processes driving them are still uncertain, particularly for subarctic and Arctic lakes where direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 emissions are often of low temporal resolution and are rarely sustained throughout the entire year. Using the eddy covariance method, we measured surface-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2 during 2.5 years in a thawed fen and a shallow lake of a subarctic peatland complex. Gas exchange at the fen exhibited the expected seasonality of a subarctic wetland with maximum CH4 emissions and CO2 uptake in summer, as well as low but continuous emissions of CH4 and CO2 throughout the snow-covered winter. The seasonality of lake fluxes differed, with maximum CO2 and CH4 flux rates recorded at spring thaw. During the ice-free seasons, we could identify surface CH4 emissions as mostly ebullition events with a seasonal trend in the magnitude of the release, while a net CO2 flux indicated photosynthetic activity. We found correlations between surface CH4 emissions and surface sediment temperature, as well as between diel CO2 uptake and diel solar input. During spring, the breakdown of thermal stratification following ice thaw triggered the degassing of both CH4 and CO2. This spring burst was observed in 2 consecutive years for both gases, with a large inter-annual variability in the magnitude of the CH4 degassing. On the annual scale, spring emissions converted the lake from a small CO2 sink to a CO2 source: 80% of total annual carbon emissions from the lake were emitted as CO2. The annual total carbon exchange per unit area was highest at the fen, which was an annual sink of carbon with respect to the atmosphere. Continuous respiration during the winter partly counteracted the fen summer sink by accounting for, as both CH4 and CO2, 33% of annual carbon exchange. Our study shows (1) the importance of overturn periods (spring or fall) for the annual CH4 and CO2 emissions of northern lakes, (2) the significance of lakes as atmospheric carbon sources in subarctic landscapes while fens can be a strong carbon sink, and (3) the potential for ecosystem-scale eddy covariance measurements to improve the understanding of short-term processes driving lake-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2.

Examination of the potential relationship between droughts, sulphate and dissolved organic carbon at a wetland-draining stream	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Rising dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations observed at a number of sites in the northern hemisphere over recent decades are the subject of much debate, and recent reports suggest a link between DOC patterns in surface waters and changes in sulphate (SO4) related to droughts or deposition. In order to investigate the potential influence of changes in SO4 concentration on DOC patterns in south-central Ontario, we used long-term (1980-2001) stream monitoring data from a wetland-dominated catchment (Plastic Lake-1 subcatchment, PC1) that has been the focus of intensive investigations of both SO4 and DOC dynamics. Annual average volume-weighted DOC concentration increased significantly between 1980 and 2001, whereas SO4 concentration declined, but the decrease was not significant due to large increases in SO4 that occurred during drought years. There was no relationship between SO4 and DOC in annual data series; however, seasonal analyses indicated significant negative correlations between SO4 and DOC concentrations in spring (March-April-May), summer (June-July-August) and fall (September-October-November). In spring, DOC concentration was negatively correlated with flow whereas SO4 concentrations increased with flow, and their opposing relationships with discharge explain the negative correlation between SO4 and DOC in this season. In summer and fall, low SO4 concentrations occur during periods of low flow as a result of microbial SO4 reduction, whereas correspondingly high DOC concentrations in the summer and fall can be attributed to optimal conditions (i.e. stagnant flow, warm temperatures) for DOC production in the wetland. Increases in SO4 (and acidity) following droughts were not associated with declines in DOC; instead the primary impact of droughts on DOC was to limit DOC export due to diminished stream flow. Rather than an acidification effect, we suggest that negative relationships between SO4 and DOC were either directly (spring) or indirectly (summer/fall) caused by underlying relationships with hydrology.

J	Biddanda, BA; Cotner, JB				Biddanda, BA; Cotner, JB			Love handles in aquatic ecosystems: The role of dissolved organic carbon drawdown, resuspended sediments, and terrigenous inputs in the carbon balance of Lake Michigan	ECOSYSTEMS												During the unstratified (winter) and stratified (summer) periods of 1999 and 2000, we examined carbon (C) dynamics in the upper water column of southern Lake Michigan. We found that (a) bacterial respiration (BR) and planktonic respiration (PR) were major sinks for C, (b) C flux through bacteria (CFTB) was diminished in winter because of reduced bacterial production (BP) and increased bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) at colder temperatures, and (c) PR exceeded primary production (PP) during the spring-summer transition. Draw-down of dissolved organic C (DOC), resuspended organic matter from the lake floor, and riverine organic matter likely provided organic C to compensate for this temporal deficit. DOC in the water column decreased between winter and summer (29-91 mg C m(2) d(-1)) and accounted for 20%-53% of CFTB and 11%-33% of PR. Sediment resuspension events supported elevated winter heterotrophy in the years that they occurred with greatest intensities (1998 and 2000) and may be important to interannual variability in C dynamics. Further, riverine discharge, containing elevated DOC (5X) and dissolved P (10X) relative to lake water, peaked in the winter-spring season in southern Lake Michigan. Collectively, terrigenous inputs (river, stream, and groundwater discharges; storm water runoff; and atmospheric precipitation) may support approximately 10%-20% of annual in-lake heterotrophy as well as autotrophy. Terrestrial subsidies likely play a key role in the C balance of even very large lakes, representing a critical linkage between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

Velocity variations and hydrological drainage at Baltoro Glacier, Pakistan	CRYOSPHERE												Glacial meltwater directly influences glacier dynamics. However, in the case of debris-covered glaciers, the drivers of glacier velocity and the influence of supraglacial lakes have not yet been sufficiently analysed and understood. We present a spatio-temporal analysis of key glacier characteristics for Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram from October 2016 to September 2022 based on Earth observation data and climate parameters extracted from the High Asia Refined analysis (HAR) data set. For the glacier variables, we used surface velocity, supraglacial lake extent, melt of snow and ice, and proglacial run-off index. For climate variables, we focused on air temperature and precipitation. The surface velocity of Baltoro Glacier was characterized by a spring speed-up, summer peak, and fall speed-up with a relative increase in summer of 0.2-0.3 m d - 1 (75 %-100 %) in relation to winter velocities, triggered by the onset of or an increase in basal sliding. Snow and ice melt have the largest impact on the spring speed-up, summer velocity peak, and the transition from inefficient to efficient subglacial drainage. The melt covered up to 64 % (353 km 2 ) of the entirety (debris-covered and debris-free) of Baltoro Glacier and reached up to 4700 m a.s.l. during the first melt peak and up to 5600 m a.s.l. during summer. The temporal delay between the initial peak of seasonal melt and the first relative velocity maximum decreases downglacier. Drainage from supraglacial lakes (3.6-5.9 km 2 ) contributed to the fall speed-up, which showed a 0.1-0.2 m d - 1 (20 %-30 %) lower magnitude compared to the summer velocity peak. Most of the run-off can be attributed to the melt of snow and ice. However, from mid-June onward, the lakes play an increasing role, even though their contribution is estimated to be only about half of that of the melt. The observed increase in summer air temperatures leads to a greater extent of melt, as well as to a rise in the number and total area of supraglacial lakes. This tendency is expected to intensify in a future warming climate.

Here, we report new Holocene paleovegetation records based on the concentrations and distributions of leaf wax long chain (C-28-C-32) n-acids and stable carbon isotopes of leaf wax C-28 n-acid from Lake Balikun, arid Central Asia. The long chain (C-28-C-32) n-acid concentrations show two distinct terrestrial vegetation degradation and desertification events during periods of 12.0-7.8 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal. yr BP) and 5.8-3.6 ka, indicating dry climate conditions. We reconstructed Holocene C-4 plant relative abundance variations (ranging from 0 to 49%) based on stable carbon isotope records of leaf wax C-28 n-acid. The C-4 plants show large fluctuations in the early Holocene, high abundance in the mid-Holocene and a decrease of 40% after 3.6 ka, which is likely driven by precipitation seasonality. In Lake Balikun, the C-4 grass expansion during 7.8-5.8 ka indicates significantly increased summer precipitation, resulting in a wet climate during the warm mid-Holocene. In contrast, C-3 plant expansion indicates the increased contribution of precipitation in winter and spring seasons during the late Holocene. According to our results, we propose that the regional and temporal differences in the Holocene optimum moisture and moisture-temperature relationships are likely attributed to asynchronous precipitation in the winter-spring and summer seasons, linked to the interaction of westerlies and the Asian summer monsoon.					jiaju, zhao/ABZ-9580-2022	An, Cheng-Bang/0000-0002-4443-0518; Zhao, Jiaju/0000-0003-1077-634X													0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 15	2022	592								110905	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110905	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110905		MAR 2022											WOS:000793174800003

Application of a distributed catchment model to investigate hydrological impacts of climate change within Poyang Lake catchment (China)	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												The extreme cycles of flood and drought in the Poyang Lake catchment (China) place immense pressure on the region's water users and ecosystems. This study examines potential impacts of future climate change in the Poyang Lake catchment using the popular regional climate model, COSMO-CLM, and a distributed hydrological model, WATLAC. Near-future projections (2016-2035) indicate that the mean annual precipitation and temperature are expected to increase over the catchment, with the exception of some northern regions. Relative to the baseline period (1986-2005), the monthly mean precipitation is projected to increase in spring, summer and autumn (March-October), and to decrease in winter (November-February), with the most significant changes in September (62%) and January (-39%). Projected increases in monthly mean temperatures range from 0.3 to 1.4 degrees C, 0.2 to 0.7 degrees C, and 0.2 to 1.2 degrees C for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) climate scenarios RCP2.6, 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. Winter temperatures are expected to increase significantly regardless of the climate scenarios. WATLAC simulations indicate that future climate changes will lead to increased high flows in summer and reduced low flows in winter, in terms of both frequency and magnitude, suggesting a high likelihood of an increase in frequency and severity of flooding and droughts in the Poyang Lake catchment.					; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; 													0029-1277	2224-7955				DEC	2016	47			1			120	135		10.2166/nh.2016.234	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2016.234													WOS:000391003300009

Seasonal variation in dietary overlap between yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in backwater lakes of a large river	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												When large river ecosystems exhibit shifting habitat mosaics and fish community composition, understanding spatial-temporal dietary patterns may inform season-specific dietary overlap between species. Backwater areas of the Mississippi River exhibited an ecological shift to a macrophyte-dominated clear water state with an associated increase in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) abundance from 2005 to 2010. This exploratory study assessed diet patterns and overlap between the more newly abundant yellow perch and previously established bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). We examined the gut content of both species in three backwater contiguous lakes of Mississippi River Lower Pool 4. We removed stomach content of bluegill (n = 61) and yellow perch (n = 189) from May 2018 through January 2019 and categorized stomach content remains to the lowest identifiable taxonomic level. Bluegill and yellow perch exhibited overlapping generalized feeding strategies during spring, summer, and fall and non-overlapping specialized feeding strategies during winter. Yellow perch diets in the winter were significantly different from all other seasons (all pairwise ANOSIM p < 0.05, R statistic > 0.36). In winter, 99.7% of prey fish volume in yellow perch occurred in large-size-class fish. During the winter, age-0 bluegill made up 97% (by volume) of the prey fish found in large-size-class yellow perch. Yellow perch and bluegill diets overlapped the least in winter (ANOSIM p < 0.05; Schoener's Index = 0.10) and the most in spring and fall (ANOSIM p > 0.05; Schoener's index = 0.41 and 0.50), respectively. Overall, dietary overlap between yellow perch and bluegill varies seasonally. Due to the limited sample size of this study, follow-up research is needed to further assess seasonal and size-dependent patterns and to assess if competition and or predation from the newly abundant yellow perch population is affecting bluegill abundance, recruitment and growth.

J	Wang, X; Fox, AD; Cong, PH; Cao, L				Wang, Xin; Fox, Anthony D.; Cong, Peihao; Cao, Lei			Food constraints explain the restricted distribution of wintering Lesser White-fronted Geese Anser erythropus in China	IBIS												More than 90% of the Lesser White-fronted Geese Anser erythropus in the Eastern Palearctic flyway population winter at East Dongting Lake, China. To explain this restricted distribution and to understand better the winter feeding ecology and habitat requirements of this poorly known species, we assessed their food availability, diet and energy budgets at this site through two winters. Lesser White-fronted Geese maintained a positive energy budget when feeding on above-ground green production of Eleocharis and Alopecurus in recessional grasslands in autumn and spring to accumulate fat stores. Such food was severely depleted by late November and showed no growth in mid-winter. Geese fed on more extensive old-growth Carex sedge meadows in mid-winter where they were in energy deficit and depleted endogenous fat stores. Geese failed to accumulate autumn fat stores in oneyear when high water levels prevented the Geese from using recessional grassland feeding areas. Fat stores remained lower throughout that winter and Geese left for breeding areas later in spring than in the previous year, perhaps reflecting the need to gain threshold fat stores for migration. Sedge meadows are widespread at other Yangtze River floodplain wetlands, but recessional grasslands are rare and perhaps restricted to parts of East Dongting Lake, which would explain the highly localized distribution of Lesser White-fronted Geese in China and their heavy use of these habitats at this site. Sympathetic management of water tables is essential to maintain the recessional grasslands in the best condition for Geese. Regular depletion of fat stores whilst grazing sedge meadows in mid-winter also underlines the need to protect the species from unnecessary anthropogenic disturbances that enhance energy expenditure. The specialized diet of the Lesser White-fronted Goose may explain its highly restricted winter distribution and global rarity.					; Fox, Anthony/I-7465-2013	Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; 													0019-1019	1474-919X				JUL	2013	155	3					576	592		10.1111/ibi.12039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12039													WOS:000320550900013

The diet of C. kelberi presents a dynamic in three different periods: winter months were characterized by low feeding activity and a high concentration of undetermined fish; increase in feeding activity occurred in the spring, with Tilapia sp. being the dominant food item; and a high rate of cannibalism was observed in the summer and early fall. The plasticity in the composition of the diet was marked by quantity of prey available during the different periods of the year, and the reproductive period.																			1679-6225					OCT-DEC	2010	8	4					819	824		10.1590/S1679-62252010005000008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1679-62252010005000008													WOS:000286320400011

Annual growth rings were observed on the external surface of the shell. According to the number of growth rings, there were 6-ring groups of C. japonica in Tamayu site. In Hikawa site, 3-ring groups were observed where 0-ring group was dominant among the groups. The mean shell length of each ring group was higher at Hikawa site compared to Tamayu site. Shell growth was high from spring to autumn, and very low during winter. Growth pattern in soft tissue differed between 1-ring group and 2 or 3-ring groups. The latter groups decreased their weight from June to September 1992. Settled juveniles appeared throughout the year. The density of juveniles was high from spring to autumn, and very low in winter. Many C. japonica juveniles settled in each site, but reduction level of post-settled juveniles was higher at Hikawa site than Tamayu site.																			0021-5392	1349-998X				JUL	2001	67	4					678	686																WOS:000170809700014

The densities of the oligochaete infrapopulations were positively correlated with water temperature, declining in the autumn, reaching their lowest levels in winter and rising in spring and summer to their highest levels. This pattern was also influenced by the annual reproduction and mortality cycle within the snail population. Most importantly, however, in snails shedding cercariae of the hemiurid trematode, Halipegus occidualis, densities of the oligochaete were significantly higher than those in uninfected snails. The continually accessible and nonmotile cercariae of this trematode were especially vulnerable to predation by Ch. l. limnaei which enhanced the rate of asexual reproduction (by building) of the oligochaete.																			0003-0031					APR	1991	125	2					195	205		10.2307/2426223	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426223													WOS:A1991FP08800004

Wet deposition is a factor that strongly influences the atmospheric input at LNR. Despite the relatively low atmospheric concentration levels of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and HCB, heavy precipitation can increase the deposition of these compounds in summer. The airborne HCHs exhibited a "bimodal" pattern, with higher concentrations in spring and autumn and lower concentrations in summer, the latter of which are results of high surface input into the ground along the transport routes of these compounds from South and Southeast Asia to southwestern China The HCB at LNR mainly originates in mainland China The deposition fluxes are influenced by the enhanced washout of atmospheric particles in the rainy season and increased particle-associated content in winter. The potential sources of o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT, and PCBs are distributed widely over low-latitude western areas and eastern China Atmospheric transport and deposition in spring and summer contribute a significant proportion of the total fluxes annually when air masses originating in Southeast Asia arrive, increasing rainfall at LNR. The foggy local weather may also enhance this deposition, eventually leading to the accumulation of pollutants at LNR.					yu, yongfu/CAH-6797-2022; zhou, jiayi/IQW-6977-2023; Huang, xu/JDD-1638-2023														1680-8584	2071-1409				JUL	2019	19	7					1483	1492		10.4209/aaqr.2018.08.0286	http://dx.doi.org/10.4209/aaqr.2018.08.0286													WOS:000475933100003

These lakes are hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions, but with substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity across the Arctic. We measured dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations in thermokarst lakes of Central Yakutia and their seasonal patterns over a yearly cycle. Lakes formed over the Holocene (alas lakes) are compared to lakes that developed over the last decades. The results show striking differences in dissolved greenhouse gases (up to two orders of magnitude) between lake types and seasons. Shallow lakes located in hydrologically closed alas depressions acted as CO2 sinks and strong sources of diffusive CH4 during some seasons (ebullition was not assessed). Recent thermokarst lakes were moderate to extremely high sources of diffusive CO2 and CH4, with considerable accumulation of greenhouse gas under the ice cover (winter) or in the deepest water layers (summer), highlighting the need to include spring and autumn as critical periods for integrated assessments. The water column was stratified in winter (all lake types) and especially in summer (recent thermokarst lakes), generating anoxia in bottom waters and favoring CH4 production and storage, particularly in the most organic-rich lakes. The diffusive fluxes measured from thermokarst lakes of this typical taiga alas landscape of Central Yakutia are among the highest presented across Arctic and subarctic regions.					; Desiatkin, Aleksei/G-1918-2016; Hatté, Christine/G-7837-2011; Fedorov, Alexander/K-2478-2016	Laurion, Isabelle/0000-0001-8694-3330; Hughes-Allen, Lara/0000-0002-6974-6957; Bouchard, Frederic/0000-0001-9687-3356; Fedorov, Alexander/0000-0002-4016-2149; Costard, Francois/0000-0002-8308-2691; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2021	66			1	SI		S98	S116		10.1002/lno.11665	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11665		DEC 2020											WOS:000600501600001
J	Caithamer, DF; Gates, RJ; Tacha, TC				Caithamer, DF; Gates, RJ; Tacha, TC			A comparison of diurnal time budgets from paired Interior Canada Geese with and without offspring	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Diurnal activities of paired (male and female together without offspring) Interior Canada Geese (Branta canadensis interior) were compared to those of parents (pairs with offspring) of the Mississippi valley Population (MVP) during fall through spring 1984-1985 and 1985-1986. Activities of parents with different numbers of offspring also were compared. The dominant activities of geese were alert, resting and feeding behaviors, which together averaged greater than or equal to 70% of the diurnal period regardless of social class, habitat, year, season or location. For both males and females, parents spent more time alert than pairs during fall, winter and spring. Parental vigilance probably benefitted young by allowing them greater access to food. Generally, the costs of maintaining this parental vigilance were apparently spread across several activities so that time spent resting or feeding did not differ between parents and pairs. The only exception was for females at Union County Conservation Area (CA) in fall, when the behavioral cost of parental vigilance was less time feeding. Parent males with greater than or equal to 3 offspring rested less than those with only one offspring. In lake habitats, females with two offspring fed more than females with three offspring. It is suggested that for Interior Canada Geese, diurnal time constraints on parents during fall-spring have only minor influences on the evolution of optimal brood size when compared to constraints during the nesting season.

J	MAULOOD, BK; BONEY, AD				MAULOOD, BK; BONEY, AD			PHYTOPLANKTON ECOLOGY OF THE LAKE OF MENTEITH, SCOTLAND	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The 1st seasonal ecological study carried out on the phytoplankton of the Lake of Menteith was recorded. All measured nutrients reached maximum levels during the winter, with Si showing particularly high concentrations (up to 85 .mu.g at Si l-1). During the summer period, PO4, NO3 and Si showed almost complete exhaustion in surface waters. The lake water was consistently alkaline, never falling below pH 7, while the alkalinity ranged from 20-24 mg CaCO3 l-1. The nutrient status of the main inflow had a rapid effect on the water quality of the lake. The region of the lake under investigation showed no thermal stratification at any period of the year, although continuous thermal gradients were recorded in the winter. The continual circulation of the water mass probably prevented O2 saturation from falling below 77% even following a large phytoplankton bloom and subsequent decomposition. From an examination of net phytoplankton samples, the Lake of Menteith could be described as blue-green or blue-green/diatom in nature. From the quantitative study, large pulses of Melosira, Asterionella and Fragilaria were recorded in the spring. The disappearance of the species appears to be related to Si limitation. The summer growth of Asterionella may be promoted by a N source other than NO3 and NO2, both of which were reduced to critical levels. This alternative source of combined N may have been contributed by N2-fixing algae in the lake. Species of Anabaena [A. circinalis, A. flos aquae and A. spiroides] were recorded, all of which produced large populations during the year.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	79	2					179	186		10.1007/BF00006125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006125													WOS:A1981LP99000010

Thus, we measured daily concentration gradients of carbon gases (CO2 and CH4) in mesohumic Lake Paajarvi during the mixing periods in autumn 2004 and spring 2005 and calculated and compared the fluxes using three different methods: the boundary layer diffusion model (Delta CO2 and Delta CH4), floating static chambers (FC), and changes in gas storage. CO2 fluxes were higher in autumn than in spring, whereas CH4 fluxes were lower in autumn than in spring. The method based on changes in storage underestimated the fluxes whereas the floating chambers and the boundary layer diffusion models resulted in similar estimates. However, the chambers always yielded somewhat higher fluxes. Total Delta CO2 flux in autumn was 883 mmol m(-2) and in spring, 666 mmol m(-2), whereas total Delta CH4 fluxes were 0.60 mmol m(-2) and 0.80 mmol m(-2) in autumn and spring, respectively. We calculated gas transfer velocities (k(600)) to explain the near surface exchange mechanism and the difference between the results based on diffusion models and chambers. Wind speed and k(600) showed significant correlation. In spring the transfer velocity at similar wind speed was higher compared to the autumn. Weekly measurements of algal primary production and community respiration revealed that the lake was net heterotrophic in autumn as well as in spring. Our study showed that the excess CO2 from the lake metabolism contributed significantly to the CO2 fluxes during the mixing periods, violating the primary assumption used in the storage method.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				NOV 12	2009	114								G04007	10.1029/2009JG000923	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JG000923													WOS:000271861800001

Heavy metals contaminating water and fish from Fayoum Governorate, Egypt	FOOD CHEMISTRY												The distribution of some heavy metals in water and fish from Fayoum Governorate (Egypt) was studied in samples collected throughout two successive years (1997/1998 and 1998/1999). Water from Lake Qarun, a private fish farm and "Sanhour River" was found to contain heavy metals at concentration levels lower than those found in fish from the first two ecosystems. The heavy metals showed differential bioaccumulation in fish organs (e.g. flesh, head, viscera), and the accumulation pattern (as total heavy metal residues) was seasonally as follows: summer > autumn > winter > spring. Moreover, the relative accumulation of total heavy metals in the studied fish showed the following pattern: "Mousa fish" (Solea aegyptiaca) < "Bolti fish" (Tilapia sp.) < the shrimp (Penacus sp.) < "Bouri fish" (Mugil sp.). Among the analyzed metals (e.g. zinc, iron, manganese, copper, cadmium, chromium, nickel, lead, cobalt, tin), lead and cadmium were found in fish at mean concentrations above the permissible limits proposed by FAO.

The median fledging date was 1 August (N = 29). We radiotagged 11 fledglings, nine of which also received wing markers. The median date of migration from natal areas was 13 September (N = 15). The interval between fledging and migration varied from 32 to 70 d (median = 42 d, N = 15). Juveniles appeared to migrate alone, joining other eagles at foraging sites. GNP adults remained on their nesting territories when juveniles departed. One juvenile wintered 130 km from GNP. Others migrated as far as 1000 km. Six migrated to southern Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and California. Three moved west to Washington or British Columbia. Two juveniles from the 1988 Lake McDonald nest migrated separately to the Pacific Coast. By 1991, one Lake McDonald adult had been replaced; the juvenile produced that year migrated south to Idaho. This contrast suggests that juveniles inherited distinct migration direction ''programs'' from different parents. Early autumn migration departures of GNP juveniles also may be genetically determined; we found no evidence that they remained locally to feed on autumn spawning runs of kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in GNP. At least 10 of the 11 radio-tagged juveniles survived their first winter. During spring migration, four juveniles passed through or near GNP. Nine summering sites or last known spring locations were in Alberta or British Columbia, Canada. There is no evidence to date of marked juveniles returning to breed in GNP natal areas.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				JUN	1996	30	2					79	89																WOS:A1996UW19400005

Both lakes were weakly inversely thermally stratified. Dissolved oxygen concentration was at saturation (11-15 mg l(-1)) in the top 3 m layer, but declined to near anoxic levels near the sediments. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in the deep lake were at saturatino in most of the water column and approached anoxic levels near the sediments only. Nutrient concentrations in both lakes were fairly high, and similar in both lakes during ice cover. Total phosphorus concentrations generally ranged between 10-20 mu g l(-1), NH4-N between 16-100 mu g l(-1), and DSi between 0.9-1.9mgl(-1); these concentrations fell within summer ranges. NO3-N concentrations were between 51-135 mu l(-1) during ice cover, but occured at trace concentrations (<0.002 mu l(-1)) during the summer. The winter phytoplankton community of both lakes was dominated by flagellates (cryptophytes, chrysophytes) and occasionally diatoms. Dinoflagellates, Cyanobacteria and green algae were poorly represented. Cryptophytes often occured in fairly high proportions (20-80%) throughout the water column, whereas chrysophytes were more abundant just beneath the ice. Zooplankton population densities were extremely low during ice cover (compared to maximum densities measured in spring or summer) in both lakes, and were comprised largely of copepods.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0018-8158					MAY 19	1995	304	3					221	234		10.1007/BF02329316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02329316													WOS:A1995RH46200006

A one-dimensional model of vertical stratification of Lake Shira focussed on winter conditions and ice cover	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												In meromictic lakes such as Lake Shira, horizontal inhomogeneity is small in comparison with vertical gradients. To determine the vertical distribution of temperature, salinity, and density of water in a deep zone of a Lake Shira, or other saline lakes, a one-dimensional (in vertical direction) mathematical model is presented. A special feature of this model is that it takes into account the process of ice formation. The model of ice formation is based on the one-phase Stefan problem with the linear temperature distribution in the solid phase. A convective mixed layer is formed under an ice cover due to salt extraction in the ice formation process. To obtain analytical solutions for the vertical distribution of temperature, salinity, and density of water, we use a scheme of vertical structure in the form of several layers. In spring, the ice melts as top and bottom. These processes are taken into account in the model. The calculated profiles of salinity and temperature of Shira Lake are in good agreement with field measurement data for each season. Additionally, we focussed on the redox zone, which is the zone in which the aerobic layers of a water column meet the anaerobic ones. Hyperactivity of plankton communities is observed in this zone in lakes with hydrogen sulphide monimolimnion, and Lake Shira is among them. The location of the redox zone in the lake, which is estimated from field measurements, coincides with a sharp increase in density (the pycnocline) during autumn and winter. During spring and summer, the redox zone is deeper than the pycnocline. The location of pycnocline calculated with the hydro physical model is in good agreement with field measurement data.					; Mooij, Wolf/C-2677-2008; Genova, Svetlana/B-3287-2013; Rogozin, Denis/AAE-8113-2019; Andrei, Degermendzhi/P-8042-2015	Andrei, Degermendzhi/0000-0001-8649-5419; Genova, Svetlana N/0000-0002-6220-5277; Mooij, Wolf/0000-0001-5586-8200; Belolipetskii, Victor/0000-0002-4909-7857; 													1386-2588					SEP	2010	44	3					571	584		10.1007/s10452-010-9327-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-010-9327-7													WOS:000285338600009

Heat and water budgets over Nam Co were estimated throughout the year. Latent and sensible heat fluxes from the lake are very small from spring to summer and larger from fall to early-winter. Although the land surface over the Tibetan Plateau supplies heat energy to the atmosphere during the pre-monsoon and monsoon periods, a deep lake such as Nam Co releases a large amount of heat in the post-monsoon period. Annual evaporation from the lake was 658 mm, much larger than the annual rainfall of 415 mm and also more than two times the annual evaporation from the land surface. The diurnal variation of surface. air temperature difference over the lake showed a reverse phase of that over land in the monsoon period, a condition that likely affects the convective activity over the lake.					zhang, jiezk/AHH-8525-2022; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018	Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005													1349-6476						2009	5						172	175		10.2151/sola.2009-044	http://dx.doi.org/10.2151/sola.2009-044													WOS:000273746300044

We studied the allochthony (share biomass of terrestrial origin) in cladoceran, calanoid and cyclopoid micro-crustacean zooplankton from late winter to fall during two years in a small humic lake (Sweden). The use of allochthonous resources was important for sustaining a small population of calanoids in the water column during late winter. However, in summer the calanoids shifted to 100% herbivory, increasing their biomass several-fold by making efficient use of the pelagic primary production. In contrast, the cyclopoids and cladocerans remained at high levels of allochthony throughout the seasons, both groups showing the mean allochthony of 0.56 (range in mean 0.17-0.79 and 0.34-0.75, for the respective group, depending on model parameters). Our study shows that terrestrial organic matter can be an important resource for cyclopoids and cladocerans on an annual basis, forming a significant link between terrestrial organic matter and the higher trophic levels of the food web, but it can also be important for sustaining otherwise herbivorous calanoids during periods of low primary production in late winter.

Three life-history patterns are represented. First, Monoecious annual species germinate easily and rapidly aft er inundation, they grow quickly and initiate sexual reproduction at the expense of vegetative expansion, produce relatively few, large oospores and die in winter. Second, Dioecious annual species are slower to germinate than Monoecious annuals, they grow more slowly, but also initiate sexual reproduction early in life. They usually produce large numbers of small oospores and die in unfavourable seasons. Both winter-growing and summer-growing Dioecious annuals were represented in experiments. Third, Dioecious perennials germinate after a lag time and establishment; vegetative growth and expansion takes place early in spring. Reproduction in Dioecious perennials is stimulated by increasing water temperatures and other environmental cues. Vegetative reproductive organs are produced in autumn and individual shoots can be very long-lived. Life-history parameters such as germination requirements, establishment requirements and timing of vegetative growth and reproduction can be important in determining the distribution patterns in charophytes.																			0067-1924						1999	47	3					383	397		10.1071/BT97086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT97086													WOS:000081899900011

The spatiotemporal change of ET0 and the drought response over Poyang Lake watershed of China from 2011 to 2100 are the main concern in this work. Based on the meteorological data and the output of the general circulation model (GCM) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), we used the Penman-Monteith formula and downscaling model to calculate the history and future ET0 in Poyang Lake watershed, respectively. Major results are drawn as follows. First, the annual average ET0 decreased during 1961-2014 and the average ET0 of the basin is high in the north and south, but low in the middle. The ET0 was most dominated by sunshine duration in the spring, summer, and fall and by relative humidity in the winter. Second, the downscaling model has a good simulation effect, and the GCM data-downscaling simulation results are significantly improved after the deviation correction. Third, under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, ET0 in the Poyang Lake watershed will increase over the next three periods, with the middle future (2041-2070) as the largest increase period. The spatial distribution of ET0 is generally high in the east and low in the west. Fourth, under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the drought index (DI) of the watershed showed an increasing trend, the seasonal distribution of DI is fall > summer > spring > winter, and the Ganjiang River subbasin will be the key prevention area for future drought risks. The results can provide basic data support for the optimal management of water resources and scientific response to the impact of climate change on agricultural production in the watershed for associated policymakers and stakeholders.

J	LANDIN, J				LANDIN, J			SEASONAL PATTERNS IN ABUNDANCE OF WATER-BEETLES BELONGING TO HYDROPHILOIDEA (COLEOPTERA)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Populations of Hydraena britteni Joy., Limnebius aluta Bedel (Hydraenidae) and Helophorus brevipalpis Bedel, H. strigifrons Thoms., Hydrobius fuscipes L. and Anacaena limbata Fabr. (Hydrophilidae) were studied from the break up of the ice until autumn or freezing at 3 different shores of a lake near Stockholm, Sweden. The beetles were generally found to frequent the zone immediately at the water''s edge. Both larvae and imagines inhabit the uppermost 2 or 3 cm of the substrate. Two patterns in the seasonal abundance were found: (a) Maximal abundance during spring, minimal during summer, and sometimes a new, smaller maximum during late summer and autumn (H. britteni, H. strigifrons, H. fuscipes, A. limbata and perhaps L. aluta); (b) An abrupt peak in abundance during July-Aug. and very low abundance at other times (H. brevipalpis). Type (a) is probably the general one in this region and type of habitat. It fits a univoltine life cycle, where the beetles breed during early summer and hibernate as adults. Type (b) is shown by a univoltine species much disposed to flight. The peak coincides both with its dispersal phase and the emergence of the new generation. Patterns similar to type (a) are also shown by Laccophilus spp. (Dytiscidae) and Haliplus spp. (Haliplidae) according to the literature. The pattern of type (a) of most Hydrophiloidea seems to be geared to the amounts of plant remnants in the littoral, imagines and some larvae being most abundant when the amounts are maximal, i.e., during spring. The plant material probably offers food and cover. It disintegrates rapidly during summer and a new maximum is reached next spring. The pond-like habitat, which may develop behind reeds, is compared with ephemeral ponds. Both may be regarded as unstable habitats, each passing through a series of predictable changes. The difference is the final stage, often disastrous when a pond dries out, but seldom so in a lake when the water line moves outwards in the littoral during summer.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1976	6	2					89	108		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01594.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01594.x													WOS:A1976BM81400002

Being a cold stenotherm species, its distribution is primarily confined to deeper water layers. Based on the long-term observations from one of the largest spatially confined natural populations of this species in the Baltic Sea, we detected profound long-term variability of L. macrurus during 1958-2016: high abundances before the 1980s, then nearly disappearance in the 1990s and recovery in the 2000s. The main environmental parameters explaining the interannual variability of L. macrurus in spring were herring spawning stock biomass in preceding year, winter severity, and bottom water temperature in preceding summer. The effect of winter severity and water temperature was also non-linear. The sliding window correlation analysis pointed to a non-stationary relationship between the abundance of L. macrurus and the key variables. Given the observed pronounced seasonality in the population structure of L. macrurus (young stages dominated in the beginning of the year and only adults were left in the population in summer and autumn) we identified the dynamics of key environmental variables to understand this species under different ecosystem configurations and different combinations of drivers of change.

This study aimed to present the seasonal succession of phytoplankton and zooplankton and their interactions in highly variable, shallow estuarine Elblag Bay dominated by floating-leaved macrophytes. The ecosystem experiences temporary shifts between freshwater and brackish water due to the seasonal influx of freshwater from the river during winter and spring, and the substantial inflow of brackish water during summer and autumn. The seasonal changes of plankton in the bay were driven by several factors, among which the most important were water temperature, periodic brackish water inflow, and development of aquatic vegetation. After winter, phytoplankton began to develop first (March), followed by rotifers (April) and crustaceans (May). At the beginning of summer, zooplankton biomass decreased, which could favored the development of phytoplankton, however, the intense growth of algae was limited by shading by plant canopies and nutrient competition between macrophytes and phytoplankton. The development of vegetation was accompanied by an increase in the species richness and diversity of crustacean zooplankton with many plant-associated species. The results of our research indicate that the periodically changing habitat complexity (macrophytes, salinity) in the estuary bay limits the intense development of plankton but increases its diversity.

J	Wang, L; Cai, QH; Zhang, M; Tan, L; Kong, LH				Wang, Lan; Cai, Qinghua; Zhang, Min; Tan, Lu; Kong, Linghui			Longitudinal patterns of phytoplankton distribution in a tributary bay under reservoir operation	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												To investigate longitudinal patterns of phytoplankton distribution influenced by reservoir operation, weekly surveys were carried out in the mainstream of the Yangtze River and Xiangxi Bay of the TGR from February, 2008 to February, 2009. Using cluster analysis based on chlorophyll a, transparency, and relative water column stability, the longitudinal patterns in different water level fluctuations periods were identified. The mainstream zone, lacustrine zone, transitional zone and riverine zone could be successively distinguished from the mouth to the end of Xiangxi bay, but distinct differences existed in different periods, including the location and extent of each zone. In Periods I (spring) and II (summer and early autumn, flood season), the mainstream zone was relatively short, while in Periods III and IV (autumn and winter seasons), it became longer. At the end of Xiangxi Bay, it presented characteristics of a transitional zone in Periods I, III, and IV, while in Period II it could be recognized as the riverine zone. The correlations among chlorophyll a, transparency, and relative water column stability differed from the Yangtze River to longitudinal zones of Xiangxi Bay, influenced by various features of these regions.

J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			NUTRIENT INTERNAL CYCLING AND THE TROPHIC REGULATION OF GREEN LAKE, WISCONSIN	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Algal nutrients (Si, N, P) and dissolved O2 were studied in Green Lake, Wisconsin, in 1971-1972, and in 1978-1980 following a reduction of about 35% in total external P loading in Dec. 1976. Despite oxic conditions, there is more P in the hypolimnion than would be expected from the dissolved O2 and from classical Redfield stoichiometry. Because of a metalimnetic dissolved O2 minimum in late summer, the calculation and interpretation of the hypolimnetic oxygen deficit is affected by turbulent transport of dissolved O2. Vertical fluxes of P into the mixed layer are importatn in late sping and early summer, but, owing to metalimnetic P depletion, negligible between mid-July and mid-Oct. Vertical transport of Si into the mixed layer is negligible in summer and early fall compared with inputs from the land drainage basin. Although P is high at spring turnover, epilimnetic concentrations of P are low and Secchi transparency is high by mid-to-late summer. These seasonal changes are caused by sedimentation of P and low seasonal inputs from the drainage basin. This P is recovered in the hypolimnion and recirculated throughout the lake at fall overturn. It causes silica limitation of the diatom bloom each succeeding spring. The total P content of Green Lake and its seasonal partition among the layers were remarkably stable between 1971 and spring 1980, despite the reduction in external loading in 1976. The hypolimnetic O2 deficit also showed no significant change between the 1st and 8th decades of this century.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1985	30	2					347	363		10.4319/lo.1985.30.2.0347	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1985.30.2.0347													WOS:A1985AGF8500009

A very similar profile was observed for the two studied populations. The median age class dominated in the age structure, indicating good recruitment and viability. The reproductive period lasted approximately 10months (from September to June). Females at different gametogenesis stages were found during autumn, winter and spring. Gravid females were sampled during winter and spring, and larval release occurred from early spring to early summer. The number of embryos produced per female reached 84,000 per year. In Elmaleh stream, characterized by high salinity, reproduction of the mussel took place slightly earlier than in the other habitat (Sejenane). However, the variation in reproduction traits between the two populations was not significant (p>0.05). Similar patterns, but with a difference in the timing of the breeding season, were recorded for Spanish populations. The results highlight a reproductive plasticity of U. ravoisieri and an ability to tolerate harsh abiotic conditions. Nevertheless, salinity and temperature seem to have a stressful effect on different reproductive stages, mainly during the brooding period; negative correlation was found between condition index and the two parameters: Pearson's r=0.4-0.8; p<0.05. To avoid their adverse effects, U. ravoisieri appears to be able to adjust its reproductive cycle to the wet season when these parameters are moderate.

Simulation of Climate Change Effects on Hydropower Operations in Mountain Headwater Lakes, New Zealand	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Future climate change is expected to have wide ranging impacts on the hydrology of mountain rivers because of changes in the magnitudes and timing of rain and snow, as well as the significant spatial variability of topography and other catchment characteristics. In New Zealand, hydropower generation in mountain basins is the primary source of electricity and renewable energy resource in the country. The goal of this study was to simulate and evaluate the potential effects of climate change on hydropower operations in three mountain headwater lakes (lakes Pukaki, Tekapo, and Ohau) in the Upper Waitaki Basin of the central South Island. The TopNet hydrological model was used to estimate catchment runoff and lake inflows based on the 1990s (baseline), 2040s, and 2090s periods. Average temperature and precipitation results from an ensemble of 12 Global Circulation Models based on the IPCC 4th Assessment Report A1B emissions scenario were used as input to TopNet. Linked hydropower lake water balance models were developed and used to simulate hydropower operations including discharge, hydroelectric power generation, and spill based on TopNet future inflow predictions, projected electricity demand, and lake storage and outflow characteristics. Our results indicate that annual lake inflows increase under future climate scenarios, but that there are seasonal effects with increasing flows in winter and early spring, and summer flows decreasing somewhat as a result of increasing temperatures and greater winter rain with less snow. Although overall hydropower generation can increase with the increasing flows and projected electricity demand, the seasonal changes result in demand being met in winter and spring with potential shortfalls in summer and autumn. Maximum annual generation can be achieved for some generating stations, but generation will decrease at other stations and more spill will likely be required through the 2090s because of the seasonal changes. Therefore flood and drought risk could also increase for downstream areas. Results also indicate that by the 2090s electricity demand could exceed generation capacity for these headwater lakes.

The fatty acid (FA) composition of fish was also examined to describe seasonal and sexual differences and identify whether arachidonic acid (ARA) could be used as a biomarker of Hg toxicity. There was a trend for females to have lower (p < 0.062) Se concentrations than males. The concentration of Se for females during spring (mean +/- SD, 686 +/- 51 ng/g dw) was 15% lower than males (806 +/- 67 ng/g dw). Lower Se concentrations in females than males continued through summer and fall. Concentration of Hg for females during spring (152 +/- 39 ng/g ww) was also 59% lower than males (373 +/- 303 ng/g ww), but the difference was not significant (p > 0.2). The percent of lipids was greatest in fall and winter (3%) and comprised primarily of omega-3 fatty acids (35 g/100 g lipid). Fish condition as measured by percent lipids and relative weight was negatively (p < 0.02) related to Hg concentration for females and males. Lipid content for both sexes was also positively (p < 0.05) related to the Se:Hg ratio. Relative weight was positively related to the Se:Hg ratio for females during all seasons (p = 0.014), but only during spring and summer for males (p < 0.007). A low Se:Hg value was associated with an elevation in ARA for both sexes and a reduced hepatosomatic index in males. Data suggested that females transferred muscle stores of Se and Hg to developing oocytes during spring. This study generates hypotheses regarding the physiological drivers of seasonal and sexual variability in Hg, Se, and FA in LMB that may be applicable to other species and have implications for fisheries health and management.

The water samples were collected in spring, summer, autumn and winter of 2001, respectively. The bacterial L-arabinose resistance forward mutation test (ara test), along with the Ames test, was performed for the evaluation of time profile of mutagenicity of the surface water samples. The strong genotoxic potentials were detected in the near-shore area, especially in the vicinity to the major city. All the samples collected from the lake center and areas distant from dense human activity showed genotoxicity-free in year round time. Intensified human activity along the lake may play an important role for the genotoxic pollution. By comparison of the samples from year round, the winter samples showed the strongest mutagenic potential of all seasons, which indicates that meteorological and hydrological factors also affect the water quality. The impact of dense human activity, improper management and season change should be put into consideration for designing an effective remediation project in the lake basin area.

Ecology and Biology of Enallagma cyathigerum (Charpentier, 1840) (Odonata) under Unstable Water Conditions in the South of Western Siberia	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The peculiarities of ecology and biology of the damselfly Enallagma cyathigerum have been revealed as a result of long-term research in the Barabinsk forest steppe. The species lives in all permanent reservoirs (rivers, river channels, lakes, and ponds), where its most numerous populations have been identified. It also inhabits temporary reservoirs, surviving in them during periods of drying out due to the egg phase. Biotopic preferences in the choice of habitat have been found: larvae live only in nonreed hydrocenoses, which is associated with the ecological standards of the species. There has been a decrease in the number of E. cyathigerum during the last 20 years despite the increase in humidity in the region, which we explain by consequences of climate warming: weather disasters in summer and an increase in the temperature of air and, accordingly, of water in reservoirs, leading to deterioration of the hydrology of reservoirs and suffocation of aquatic organisms. The study of the development of E. cyathigerum in the Kargat River and Lake Fadikha in 2004-2006 has revealed a 1-year life cycle of the species, the population structure of which differs in the river and lake due to various hydrological and temperature regimes. The species population in the Kargat River was unified over all 3 years, while in Lake Fadikha it was unified in the high-water year of 2004, relatively unified in the low-water year of 2005, and divided into two seasonal groups (summer with wintering larvae and summer-autumn with wintering eggs) in the low-water year of 2006. This complicated population structure in Lake Fadikha in 2006 is a result of an increase in water temperature (due to an increase in the mean daily air temperature and a decrease in the water level in the lake) and is a kind of species adaptation to the deterioration of habitat conditions in the low-water period: eggs are present in the lake almost all year round (wintering and nonwintering), the age of larvae differs, and imagoes fly on land from spring to autumn. This adaptive feature of E. cyathigerum may partly explain its relatively high abundance, eurybiontness, and large range (almost the entire Palearctic).

Concentrations of dissolved CH4 in the water column ranged from 13 to 3,500 nM. A distinct seasonal pattern was observed, with higher CH4 concentrations in late summer and winter, and lower concentrations in late autumn and spring. Generally higher concentrations were found at the shallower sampling sites near the inputs of polluted rivers. Estimates of diffusive fluxes from the lake surface to the atmosphere varied from 0.54 to 28 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), peaking in summer when both dissolved CH4 concentrations and water temperatures were high. Concentrations of CH4 in the pore water in the upper 10 cm of bottom sediment fluctuated from 0.001 to 2.8 mM and were highest from summer to autumn. Bubble flux by ebullition ranged from 0 to 243 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) and was estimated to occur only from July to October when the pore water in the bottom sediment was more than about half saturated with CH4. CH4 production in the bottom sediment and bacterial oxidation of CH4 in the surface layer of the bottom sediment in 1993 were estimated from 17 to 300 mg CH4 m-2 d(-1) and 15 to 120 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The daily CH4 flux to the atmosphere from Lake Kasumigaura in 1993 averaged 31 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The present study suggested that shallow eutrophic lakes without an anaerobic hypolimnion might not be important sources of atmospheric CH4 despite the high primary production by cyanobacterial blooms in summer that are caused by huge nutrient loading resulting from human activities.

J	Li, B; Cai, QH; Zhang, M; Shao, ML				Li, Bin; Cai, Qing-hua; Zhang, Min; Shao, Mei-ling			Macroinvertebrate community succession in the Three-Gorges Reservoir ten years after impoundment	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Three-Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is one of the world's largest reservoirs, whose ecological effects have attracted much attention. Focusing on the macroinvertebrate community dynamics and its relationship with hydrological factors ten years after impoundment, we provide an overview of the macroinvertebrate community succession in the TGR including determining factors. Pioneer species in the TGR was Polypedilum scalaenum while Nais inflata became dominant during non-flooding seasons commencing the second impounding year with extremely high relative abundance (up to 97%). An increase of water-level fluctuation range in the third impoundment stage did not significantly alter the steady seasonal pattern of macroinvertebrate community which formed following the second impounding year. MRPP (Multi-response Permutation Procedure) analysis showed significant differences between-season (A<0.3, P < 0.01) except between summer and autumn (A = -0.0165, P = 0.773). Macroinvertebrate assemblages were evidently correlated with inflow discharge during flood seasons and water retention time during non-flood seasons. Macroinvertebrate density showed severe reduction in summer following high velocity inflow current, and disappeared in autumn following vast sedimentation. The macroinvertebrate community gradually became reestablished following reduction of inflow discharge and sedimentation and increase of water retention time in winter and spring.

In Japan, the mysid Neomysis awatschensis (Brandt, 1851) is commonly distributed in estuarine and shallow coastal waters with high productivity due to supply of nutrients from the watershed. The present study investigates the distribution and life history of the mysid N. awatschensis in relation to biotic and abiotic factors by monthly sampling from March 2014 to July 2015 at stations along the Yura River estuary, the central Sea of Japan. The Yura River physical conditions change seasonally and are affected by its discharge. Salt-wedge intrusions were frequently observed and found up to 18 km from the river mouth from April to December 2014 when river discharge was low, whereas in 2015 intrusions were less pronounced, possibly due to river mouth clogging. Clear seasonality was observed in mysid density, showing highest densities (up to 202 inds/m2) in spring and early summer in contrast with lowest densities (<16 inds/m2) from late summer to winter. Neomysis awatschensis appeared to change its reproduction characteristics in response to changes in the environment, large-sized females occurred in spring to produce large numbers of eggs and larvae during the high primary production period. In late summer, the population declined due to increasing mortality of juveniles at high temperatures. In autumn and winter, high river discharge and low temperature suppressed reproduction and survival in the mysid population. It is notable that N. awatschensis occurred within a salinity range of 0-32 and no clear influence of salinity on the mysid density was found. Those results suggest that reproduction is partially suppressed by variable and oligotrophic conditions in the Yura River estuary. Combined with the flexibility to seasonal changes in temperature and food availability, the great tolerance to acute salinity fluctuations allows N. awatschensis to maintain its population in the estuary.

Temporal Variation of Chemical Persistence in a Swedish Lake Assessed by Benchmarking	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Chemical benchmarldng was used to investigate the temporal variation of the persistence of chemical contaminants in a Swedish lake. The chemicals studied included 12 pharmaceuticals, an artificial sweetener, and an X-ray contrast agent. Measurements were conducted in late spring, late autumn, and winter. The transformation half-life in the lake could be quantified for 7 of the chemicals. It ranged from several days to hundreds of days. For 5 of the chemicals (bezafibrate, climbazole, diclofenac, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide), the measured persistence was lower in late spring than in late autumn. This may have been caused by lower temperatures and/or less irradiation during late autumn. The seasonality in chemical persistence contributed to changes in chemical concentrations in the lake during the year. The impact of seasonality of persistence was compared with the impact of other important variables determining concentrations in the lake: chemical inputs and water flow/dilution. The strongest seasonal variability in chemical concentration in lake water was observed for hydrochlorothiazide (over a factor of 10), and this was attributable to the seasonality in its persistence.

J	Westerberg, H; Sjöberg, N				Westerberg, Hakan; Sjoberg, Niklas			Overwintering dormancy behaviour of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) in a large lake	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Overwintering dormancy behaviour was studied in female silver eels in Lake Malaren in Sweden between 2008 and 2010. Depth choices and movements in relation to temperature were analysed from pressure and temperature records for 13 eels with implanted data storage tags, covering 17 overwintering periods and three intervening summer periods. Dormancy commenced in October-November as temperatures fell below 4-12 degrees C. Eels tended to remain motionless throughout the winter, with some short periods of activity signalled by small changes in depth distributions. During dormancy, the eel shows a clear avoidance of shallow areas <5m in favour of the 10-25-m-depth interval. Activity tended to resume 4-6months later in April-May as temperatures rose above 3-7 degrees C and ice cover broke, and eels spent more time at shallower depths of <5-10m. The majority of the eels were assessed as being in the silver eel stage at the time of tagging. During the autumn months, the diving behaviour, with frequent and large vertical excursions and periods at the surface, was similar to that seen in migrating eels in the Baltic and Atlantic Ocean. In spring and summer, the behaviour differed, being dominated by more gradual depth variations, implying that the eels reverted from silver eel migration behaviour to yellow eel foraging behaviour. Body weight declined during dormancy, but other studies of starvation over comparable time periods showed significantly higher average specific weight losses, implying that the Malaren silver eels must have fed between the end of dormancy and recapture.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2015	24	4					532	543		10.1111/eff.12165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12165													WOS:000361010500004

Based on plant cover, the lake was divided into five habitats, arranged in the order by plant structure complexity from complex to simple: Vallisneria spiralis habitat (V habitat), Vallisneria spiralis-Myriophyllum spicatum habitat (V-M habitat), Myriophyllum spicatum habitat (M habitat), Nelunbo nucefera habitat (N habitat), and no vegetation habitat (NV habitat). A modified popnet was used for quantitative sampling of small fishes. A total of 16 fish species were collected; Hypseleotris swinhonis, Ctenogobius giurinus, Pseudorasbora parva, Carassius auratus and Paracheilognathus imberis were the five numerically dominant species. In both summer and autumn, the total density of small fishes was about 10 ind m(-2). Generally, Ctenogobius giurinus, a sedatory, benthic fish, was distributed more or less evenly among the five habitats, while the other four species had lower densities in the N habitat and NV habitat, which had the simplest structures. The distribution of the small fish species showed seasonal variations. In winter, most species concentrated in the V habitat, which had the most complex structure. In spring, the fish had low densities in the N and NV habitat, and were more or less evenly distributed in the other habitats. In summer, the fish had a low density in the NV habitat, and were evenly distributed in the other habitats. In autumn, the fish had higher densities in the V-M and M habitats than in the others. Generally, spatial overlaps between the dominant species were higher in winter than in the other seasons. It was suggested that the variations in the importance of predation risk and resource competition in habitat choice determined the seasonal changes of spatial patterns in the small fishes in the Biandantang Lake.

Test result showed that the average reaction rate of the anammox process for the entire year is 137 +/- 77 mu mol N.m(-2).h(-1), contributing 10.4% to nitrogen gas evolution from the sediments. The anammox process in the lake has an obvious seasonal affect in the following order: summer (237 +/- 83 mu mol N.m(-2).h(-1)) > autumn (133 +/- 30 mu mol N.m(-2).h(-1)) > spring (90 +/- 24 mu mol N.m(-2).h(-1)) > winter (87 +/- 26 mu mol N.m(-2).h(-1)). A positive correlation (P<0.01) exists between the rates of the anammox process and denitrification.

Orographic effects combine with moisture-laden frontal systems originating in the Pacific Ocean to produce areas of very high precipitation on western slopes and dry basins of internal drainage on eastern hanks of the mountains. In the southern half of the region most of the runoff occurs during winter or spring, while in the northern part most occurs in summer, especially in glaciated basins, Analyses of long-term climatic and hydrological records, combined with palaeoclimatic reconstructions and simulations of future climates, are used as the basis for likely scenarios of climatic variations. The predicted hydrological response in northern California to a climate with doubled CO2 and higher temperatures is a decrease in the amount of precipitation falling as snow, and substantially increased runoff during winter and less in late spring and summer. One consequence of the predicted earlier runoff is higher salinity in summer and autumn in San Francisco Bay. In saline lakes, the incidence of meromixis and the associated reduction in nutrient supply and algal abundance is expected to vary significantly as runoff fluctuates. In subalpine lakes, global warming will probably will lead to increased productivity. Lacustrine productivity can also be altered by changes in wind regimes, drought-enhanced forest fires and maximal or minimal snowpacks associated with atmospheric anomalies such as Fl Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Reduced stream temperature from increased contributions of glacial meltwater and decreased channel stability from changed runoff patterns and altered sediment loads has the potential to reduce the diversity of zoobenthic communities in predominately glacier-fed rivers. Climatic warming is likely to result in reduced growth and survival of sockeye salmon in freshwater, which would, in turn, increase marine mortality. Further research activities should include expanded studies at high elevations and of glacier mass balances and glacial runoff, applications of remote sensing to monitor changes, further refinement of regional climatic models to improve forecasts of future conditions and continued analyses of long-term physical, chemical and biological data to help understand responses to future climates.

J	Santucci, VJ Jr; Wahl, DH				Santucci, VJ Jr; Wahl, DH			The effects of growth, predation, and first-winter mortality on recruitment of bluegill cohorts	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Previous work with centrarchid fishes suggests that recruitment success is higher for fish hatched early in the spawning season. Similar recruitment patterns have been shown for bluegills Lepomis macrochirus, but only in piscivore-free waters and at the northern extent of their range. We investigated the role of predation and first-winter mortality in governing bluegill recruitment. Spawning date distributions for larval bluegills taken in ichthyoplankton tows were compared with distributions for juveniles in shoreline rotenone samples from the fall and the following spring. Daily otolith rings were used to determine ages and spawning dates for bluegills in Ridge Lake, Illinois. during 3 years. Spawning took place from mid-May to mid-August of each year and produced several peaks in larval abundance. Differences between the spawning date distributions of larval bluegills and juveniles surviving to fall suggested that fish spawned early in the season experienced higher mortality than those spawned later. Extensive field sampling and bioenergetic model estimates of age-0 bluegill consumption by largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides indicated that predation was an important source of mortality for early-spawned fish. Estimates of bluegill abundance and size structure in fall and spring showed that losses over the first winter were high (75% to 88%); however, unlike in studies at more northern latitudes, there was little evidence of size-specific mortality. Our results suggest that predation is an important mechanism regulating the recruitment success of young bluegills and that early cohorts produced during protracted spawning must endure high mortality to become spring yearlings.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	2003	132	2					346	360		10.1577/1548-8659(2003)132<0346:TEOGPA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2003)132<0346:TEOGPA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000181732900015
