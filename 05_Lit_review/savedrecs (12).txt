This paper characterizes and compares the taxocenoses of fish from two different aquatic environments within a basin hidrographyc: the Praia das Pombas (Lago Guaiba) and the Lagoa Negra, both in the Parque Estadual de Itapua, Rio Grande do Sul, considering quali-quantitative composition of the ichthyofauna. Ecological and abundance indexes were evaluated in both spatial and temporal contexts, checking that occurs relationship between the structure of taxocenose these sites with environmental variables. We sampled a total of 61 species, with the richness the same in both locations (44 species). Both environments showed peculiar characteristics that reflected on the fish fauna in each location. It was observed that the pattern of distribution of the taxocenoses of fishes studied in the two environments is seasonal, since the abundance, biomass and diversity were higher in the hottest months of the year, spring and summer. The temperature and day-length the main factors that influenced in the distribution of the fish fauna of the Praia das Pombas and Lagoa Negra.

Radiocesium activity concentrations in lake water and a vertical structure of the water column considerably depend on radiocesium-enriched inflows of the coloured waters from the lake's swampy watershed. The global fallouts are mainly responsible for radiocesium inventory in lake sediments, where maximum values of radio cesium are found in the upper part of the water column above the similar to 5.4 m depth. The maximum values of radiocesium inventories in lake sediments are consistent with the respective densities of its deposits in the nearest forest soils. The main process of sediment activation is a direct sorption of radiocesium onto the sediment surface. Sedimentation rates in the lake mainly vary in the range of 3.5-5 mm yr(-1). The lake bottom feeding sources located mainly on the southern terrace as well as their related near-bottom flows reduce respective sedimentation and radiocesium inventories in sediments. The thermal regime of the near-bottom water in Lake Tapeliai in winter strongly depends on the meteorological conditions in autumn and may be classified as varying from super warm to moderately warm. Under conditions of a super warm regime, the elevated radiocesium concentrations in the near-bottom waters may be partially due to the thermodynamic mechanism of its release from the bottom sediments.

Sectioned otoliths were used to estimate age. Marginal zone analysis showed that annulus formation occurred during winter, in July and August. Maximum age estimates for T. rendalli and O. mossambicus were 16 and 10 years, respectively. Growth was described by the 3 parameter von Bertalanffy model as L-t = 238.74 (1-e(-0.636(t + 0.905))) mm TL for T. rendalli and L-t = 266.06 (1-e(-0.7904(t + 0.269))) mm TL for O. mossambicus. The length-at-50% maturity (Lm(50)) of male T. rendalli was 218 mm total length (TL) and 205 mm TL in females. In 0, mossambicus the Lm,, for males was 251 mm TL and for females 223 mm TL. Both species spawned throughout summer. Lake level was found to have no effect on spawning periodicity although recruitment was flood dependent.

J	Talling, J; Heaney, I				Talling, Jack; Heaney, Ivan			Novel tests of regular seasonality, types of variability, and modes of succession in lake phytoplankton	INLAND WATERS												The changing composition of phytoplankton communities was followed in 2 high latitude temperate lakes, Esthwaite Water and Windermere (North Basin), by a novel presentation method applied to ratings of semiquantitative abundance, distinguishing the most abundant component as "dominant," with the merits of rapidity and summary potential. Regular or irregular seasonalities were tested by sums of total sampling occurrences in successive weeks-of-year. Results for occurrence ranged from regular seasonality (e.g., the diatom Asterionella formosa) to widely diffused multiseasonal ("opportunistic"; e.g., Cryptomonas spp.) or aseasonal persistence (e.g., Aphanizomenon flos-aquae). Some abundant species occurred in abundance in blocks of adjacent years, between which was apparent discontinuity. Such discontinuity was in part related to known species-specific epidemics of fungal or protozoan parasitism (e.g., on Ceratium spp.) Conversely, dominance in adjacent years was likely to be favoured by over-winter survival in plankton or benthos from a prior year dominant (e.g., Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; Esthwaite Water 1982-1983) and perennating benthic stages such as cysts (Ceratium). Also distinguished were short periods of rapidly changing dominance, often involving cryptomonads, indicative of diverse prior competing subdominants at considerable concentration. One such period was marked by high consumption by Daphnia spp. in an annual clearwater phase.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2015	5	4					331	338		10.5268/IW-5.4.768	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-5.4.768													WOS:000362442500003

Lakes in Hot Water: The Impacts of a Changing Climate on Aquatic Ecosystems	BIOSCIENCE												Our planet is being subjected to unprecedented climate change, with far-reaching social and ecological repercussions. Below the waterline, aquatic ecosystems are being affected by multiple climate-related and anthropogenic stressors, the combined effects of which are poorly understood and rarely appreciated at the global stage. A striking consequence of climate change on aquatic ecosystems is that many are experiencing shorter periods of ice cover, as well as earlier and longer summer stratified seasons, which often result in a cascade of ecological and environmental consequences, such as warmer summer water temperatures, alterations in lake mixing and water levels, declines in dissolved oxygen, increased likelihood of cyanobacterial algal blooms, and the loss of habitat for native cold-water fisheries. The repercussions of a changing climate include impacts on freshwater supplies, water quality, biodiversity, and the ecosystem benefits that they provide to society.

J	Mezquita, F; Sanz-Brau, A; Wansard, G				Mezquita, F; Sanz-Brau, A; Wansard, G			Habitat preferences and population dynamics of Ostracoda in a helocrene spring system	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Habitat features and ostracod populations were monitored monthly between December 1995 and September 1996 in three contiguous pools of a Mediterranean helocrene spring. Principal-components analysis (PCA) of the physical and chemical properties of the water showed that seasonal variations were minor in the site closest to the source (pool 1). Conversely, the site the most distant from the source (pool 3) had the greatest variation in temperature and oxygen and calcium contents. Differences in limnological factors, especially the equilibrium system of carbonates, among sites were also clear from the results obtained with PCA. The cosmopolitan ostracod Cypridopsis vidua predominated in pool 1, where variations in oxygen content and temperature were minimal, and showed a univoltine reproductive pattern. The crenophilous species Potamocypris villosa and Herpetocypris intermedia were the most abundant ostracods at the other two sites, where the development of filamentous algae and Characeae produced a high oxygen concentration and an increase in calcium carbonate precipitation. The latter two species both produced two generations per year. The small size of springs and their position between interstitial and surface waters make them excellent systems for the study of ostracod ecology and the influences of environmental factors upon their life-history traits.

J	Jones, B; Peng, XT				Jones, Brian; Peng, Xiaotong			Amorphous calcium carbonate associated with biofilms in hot spring deposits	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Calcium carbonate nanoparticles are intimately associated with crystalline calcite and aragonite in the Eryuan, Gongxiaoshe, and Zhuyuan hot springs (water temperature >75 degrees C), which are located in Yunnan Province, China. The nanoparticles, <1 mu m long, are spherical to disc-shaped and commonly fuse together into small clusters. Their general appearance and lack of crystal faces or edges indicate that they are non-crystalline. Morphologically, these nanoparticles are similar to calcified nannobacteria or the constituent grains in amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), which can be formed by various biogenic and abiogenic processes. In the Chinese hot springs, the ACC is always found under, in, or on top of biofilms, commonly in close proximity to crystalline calcite and/or aragonite. Textural evidence indicates that the ACC probably developed in microdomains that develop in the complex biofilm hydrogels. Critically, there is no evidence to support the notion that the nanoparticles are calcified nannobacteria. In the Chinese springs, ACC appears to play a formative role in the development of wheat-sheaf arrays of aragonite crystals and some of the calcite crystals. Hollow cores in some of the aragonite bundles probably formed as ACC was dissolved and many of the aragonite crystals appear to have developed as ACC recrystallized. Similarly, layers of ACC that coat the surfaces of some calcite crystals could be diagenetically transformed into calcite. The development of ACC in hot spring systems may be widespread and may play a critical but transitory role in the development of crystalline CaCO3 in these high temperature environments.

This study focuses on the hydrochemical variations of groundwater and spring discharge in order to determine the major geochemical processes responsible for water quality and evolution across the western GAB. Regional hydrochemical trends within groundwater generally support the modern groundwater potentiometric surface and interpreted flow paths, highlighting that these approximately represent the long-term flow paths. Additionally, the regional chemical variations along the flow paths in the western GAB are complex, with their composition being a function of several controlling processes, including location of recharge, evapo-concentration, mixing and various water-rock interactions. These processes cause groundwater east of Lake Eyre to be predominantly of Na-HCO3 type, whereas groundwater originating from the western margin is of Na-Cl-(-SO4) type. The GAB springs appear to be discharging water predominantly from the main GAB aquifer, the J Aquifer; however, a component of the discharging water from several springs is from a source other than the J Aquifer. Current understanding of the hydrochemical variations of groundwater and spring discharge of the western GAB can help provide constraints on groundwater flow, as well as provide an understanding of the geochemical and hydrological processes responsible for water quality evolution.

Local farmers have constructed more than 9400 ha of raised fields for agricultural production in Baiyangdian Lake, the largest lake in the North China Plain. Most of the raised areas are 2-4 m higher than the water level and 30-50 m wide. The canals surrounding these platforms are 2-10 m wide. The objective of this research was to obtain experimental information on a number of processes that affect the agricultural production of the raised fields system, such as the cultivation of Phragmites australis. Since aquatic plants mature in spring and summer, the field experiments were conducted in May, 2011. The ecological environment and economic benefits were analysed and it was concluded that raised fields have a positive impact on the control of water quality. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V.

Using the size of otoliths and pharyngeal bones, we showed that grebes mainly ate the younger age-classes (2-yr. old and younger) of Bleak (Alburnus alburnus), 80% of all fish prey. Monthly rates of Bleak consumption by wintering grebes were estimated by multiplying daily food intake, extrapolated from the relationship between food biomass intake and water temperature in the different winter months, with the proportion of Bleak in the diet and with the number of wintering grebes present each month. Great Crested Grebes were most numerous in the study area in January-February and there were no significant differences in numbers between the two winters. Size of Bleak eaten increased from November to February and the biomass of Bleak consumed was highest at the end of winter, when water temperature was lowest. Overall in the western basin, grebes consumed between 640 kg (conservative estimate) and 1,000 kg (maximum estimate) of Bleak per winter, which corresponded to 10% to 20% of the annual commercial Bleak harvest in that area. We suggest that grebe predation on Bleak might increase the mortality rates in the younger age-classes of the fish, and thus contribute to a decrease in the stock, but that economic impact of grebe predation on gross annual income from the local fishery is negligible.

In South America, studies on the parasites from C. carpi are limited. The aim of the present study was to report on the macroparasites from wild C. carpio populations inhabiting the Neuquen River, which is at the southernmost distribution of C. carpio in Argentina. From spring 2011 to winter 2012, four seasonal samples of C. carpi were collected from the Neuquen River at the Ingeniero Ballester dam using gill nets. Fish were dissected and all organs were examined using microscopy. All macroparasites were determined and counted and their prevalences and mean intensities calculated. In total, 33 fish were examined and the following six parasites were recorded: the monogeneans Dactylogyrus extensus (gills) and Pseudacolpenteron sp. (in the canals of the scales along the lateral line system); the cestode Bothriocephalus sp. (intestine); the nematode Contracaecum sp. (liver and visceral fat); and the acanthocephalans Pomphorhynchus patagonicus (intestine and liver) and Polymorphus sp. (liver and wall of intestine). The monogenean D. extensus was the most commonly encountered species and had the highest prevalence and mean intensity of all parasites detected.

J	Erkinaro, J; Gibson, RJ				Erkinaro, J; Gibson, RJ			Interhabitat migration of juvenile Atlantic salmon in a Newfoundland river system, Canada	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Migrations of juvenile Atlantic salmon between habitats (both fluvial and lacustrine) were studied in a Newfoundland river system from May through September. Salmon parr showed poor site fidelity in fluvial habitats, and high rates of migration, especially in spring-early summer. Most habitat shifts were upstream from fluvial habitats to a lake at the head of a small tributary. In September, 10% of the salmon parr caught in the lake (n=275) had been marked in the main stem of the river or in the tributary stream (total n=641). The abundance of parr in the lake increased in May-June, then declined gradually to September. Most of the lacustrine immigrants were 1+ parr. Mature males were found amongst the autumnal emigrants. Salmon parr in the lake grew larger than those in the river, and lacustrine smelts captured in the lake were larger than those caught at the mouth of the river.

A method for quantifying the number of US lakes with cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms using satellite remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING AND MODELING OF ECOSYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY XV	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for Sustainability XV	AUG 22, 2018	San Diego, CA	SPIE				Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms are the most common form of harmful algal blooms in freshwater systems throughout the world. However, in situ sampling of cyanobacteria in inland lakes is limited both spatially and temporally. Satellite data has proven to be an effective tool to monitor cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes across the United States. This study uses data from the European Space Agency MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument to provide a national overview of the percentage of lakes experiencing a cyanobacterial bloom on a weekly basis for 2008-2011 and 2017. A total of 2,370 lakes across the contiguous United States were included in the analysis. Bloom percentage was calculated for nine United States climate regions to examine regional patterns. Changes in cyanobacterial bloom percentage followed the well-known temporal pattern of freshwater blooms. The percentage of lakes experiencing a bloom increased throughout the year, reached a peak around October, and decreased through the winter. Wintertime data, particularly in the northern latitude regions, was consistently limited due to snow and ice cover. With the exception of the Southeast and South climate regions, regional patterns mimicked patterns found at the national scale. The Southeast and South regions exhibited an unexpected pattern as cyanobacterial bloom percentage peaked in the winter rather than the summer. Several environmental factors and potential satellite limitations can possibly explain these findings. Results from this research can help establish a baseline of annual occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in inland lakes across the United States.

To investigate this possibility, we tested the sensitivity of terrestrial N2O emissions to an abrupt warming event by applying the ARVE-DGVM in combination with a novel scheme for process-based simulation of terrestrial N2O and NOx emissions at the Gerzensee site in Switzerland. In this study, we aim to quantify the magnitude of change in emissions for the abrupt climate change event that occurred at the transition from Oldest Dryas to Bolling during the last deglaciation. Using high-resolution multiproxy records obtained from the Gerzensee that cover the Late Glacial, we apply a prescribed vegetation change derived from the pollen record and temperature and precipitation reconstructions derived from delta O-18 in lake sediments. Changes in soil temperature and moisture are simulated by the ARVE-DGVM using the reconstructed paleoclimate as a driver. Our results show a pronounced increase in mean annual N2O and NOx emissions for the transition (by factor 2.55 and 1.97, respectively), with highest amounts generally being emitted during summer. Our findings suggest that summertime emissions are limited by soil moisture, while temperature controls emissions during winter. For the time between 14670 and 14620 cal. years BP, our simulated N2O emissions show increase rates as high as 1% per year, indicating that local reactions of emissions to changing climate could have been considerably faster than the atmospheric concentration changes observed in polar ice.

The measurement of lake depth was done through depth sounding method where GPS co-ordinates were recorded, then analysed, managed and presented using GIS for bathymetric map. The area of lake as given by aerial photograph was determined to be 3.07 hectares; while various litreatures enlisted the area as 2.65-5 hectares. The bathymetric map area calculation entailed that the area was 2.51 hectares (decreased by 500 square metres). The depth of the lake varied from 0.30 metre to 4.70 metres. The residence time, in which mean depth of water body act as vital role in resulting various trophic level. The lake was hypereutrophic and eutrophic at average phosphorus loading up to first 2.5 metre and onward depth respectively. The normalized phosphorous and chlorophyll concentrations during winter were found greater than in summer seasons.																			0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	1					29	39		10.3233/AJW-170004	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/AJW-170004													WOS:000394621100004

A recirculation facility consisting of three 1.8-m diameter circular fiberglass tanks (1722 l) and 90, 1.2-m diameter revolving plates (surface area 214 m) was designed for the study. Production of young-of-the-year threadfin shad in hatchery ponds increased from 72 kg/ha unfed fish in 1980 to 106-112 kg/ha when a feeding program was initiated in 1981-1982. Fish were harvested each year in mid-Sept. and transferred to the recirculation facility. A pilot study (Phases I and II) completed during the first 2 winters (1979-1980 and 1980-1981) of a 3-yr investigation, identified general culture methods and tested the recirculation facility. During Phase III (Sept. 15th-May 15th, 1982) the revolving late biofilters successfully reduced NH3-N and NO3-N levels, thereby maintaining acceptable water quality. Most fish readily accepted an artificial diet. Survival was 71-85% after an 8-mo. trial. Fish grew from 1.8 g at the beginning of the study to 5.8 g after 8 mo. Maximum density was limited to about 50 kg/tank when fish behavior, growth and survival were considered. The gonadosomatical index of female shad overwintered during Phase II increased from 1.7% at the end of the study to 12.1% after 5 wk following stocking. Fish held over during all 3 winters spawned in hatchery ponds and in a 20-ha State lake.																			0033-0779						1983	45	2					90	93		10.1577/1548-8659(1983)45[90:OTSTIC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1983)45[90:OTSTIC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1983RD57700007
J	Gido, KB; Matthews, WJ				Gido, KB; Matthews, WJ			Dynamics of the offshore fish assemblage in a southwestern reservoir (Lake Texoma, Oklahoma-Texas)	COPEIA												Reservoirs are relatively new ecosystems with fish assemblages that include both native and introduced species, Spatial and temporal variability in such fish assemblages is difficult to predict from ecological theory. We characterized the dynamics of an offshore fish assemblage of Lake Texoma by sampling multiple fixed sites fortnightly with gill nets from 1981 to 1984 (402 net-nights). Univariate and multi-variate analyses were used to quantify (1) variation of the fish assemblage in space and time, (2) spatial and temporal independence of samples, (3) persistence of species associations, and (4) correlations between the dynamics of the fish assemblage and environmental conditions. Overall, depth and season accounted for the greatest amount of variation in the fish assemblage in our study area. Much of this variation was the result of spatial and temporal fluctuation in the abundance of various age classes of Dorosoma cepedianum (Gizzard Shad), Morone saxatilis (Striped Bass), and Aplodinotus grunniens (Freshwater Drum). With the exception of a winter kill of the nonnative Dorosoma petenense (Threadfin Shad), the reservoir fish assemblage differed little among years. Species associations were constant across years during the warm season but not in cold seasons, Overall, the fish assemblage in our study area remained relatively consistent, in spite of considerable variability in reservoir volume, turbidity, and temperature.

J	Szczerba, A; Pla-Rabes, S; Tylmann, W				Szczerba, Agnieszka; Pla-Rabes, Sergi; Tylmann, Wojciech			Control of diatom and chrysophyte cyst dynamics by a meteorologically driven mixing regime in eutrophic Lake Zabinskie, northern Poland	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Ongoing climate warming has strong moderating control over aquatic processes, such as ice cover duration, length of the growing season, vertical mixing patterns, thermal stratification, and the availability of light and nutrients. These fundamental mechanisms in turn influence the population dynamics of aquatic organisms such as diatoms and chrysophytes. In our study, over 3.5 years with contrasting meteorological conditions, we investigated eutrophic Lake Zabinskie located in northeast Poland. By combining observational data of meteorological conditions, physicochemical variables measured in the water column, and modern sedimentation, we sought to explain the relationships between changes in meteorological conditions, dynamics of total fluxes and the taxonomic composition of diatoms and chrysophyte cysts. Our results show the direct influence of meteorological conditions on physicochemical conditions and their indirect influence on total diatom and chrysophyte cyst fluxes and taxonomic succession. The former refers to the importance of air temperature and wind speed in shaping the mixing regime of Lake Zabinskie, while the latter refers to the nutrient cycling driven by changes in the mixing regime, which in turn influences the formation of biotic signals in the sediment. Our study also revealed that the biotic response to unusual meteorological conditions that occurred in 2020 (i.e., warm winter without ice cover) differed from typical years in terms of the phenology of diatom and chrysophyte cyst blooms. However, this response was not as pronounced as in lakes with lower productivity and can be attributed to the already turbid conditions and high nutrient concentrations, which alter the threshold for noticeable changes to occur. The taxonomic composition of diatoms and chrysophyte cysts also changed in response to changes in meteorological conditions. Complex interactions between physical and chemical conditions masked the direct influences of meteorological conditions on lake biota under eutrophic conditions. Nevertheless, high-resolution monitoring enabled indirect links to be recognised. Both phenology and turnover in community composition responded to changes in meteorological conditions. These results show how ongoing climate change might affect biota in eutrophic lakes in the future.

J	Specziar, A				Specziar, A.			Life history patterns of Procladius choreus, Tanypus punctipennis and Chironomus balatonicus in Lake Balaton	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Life history patterns of the three most abundant chironomids were analysed in Lake Balaton by monitoring the population dynamics of larvae and the presence of pupal exuviae. Procladius choreus had two generations per year with at least two parallel cohorts during 1996-1999. Tanypus punctipennis had a trivoltine life cycle with occasional parallel cohorts, overlapping generations and long, interrupted emergence periods between 1997 and 1999. At Tihany, Chironomus balatonicus had only one detectable generation between 1995 and 2002. Meanwhile at Keszthely, the abundance of C. balatonicus larvae peaked from autumn to the beginning of summer in 1996/1997, 1998/1999 and 2000/2001, and it was continuously high from August 2001 to October 2002. However, between these abundance peaks there were long periods when larvae could not be found at all. The C extreme population dynamics of C. balatonicus suggests that living conditions may fluctuate around the limit of this species in Lake Balaton. Although C. balatonicus larvae practically were not found at both sampling sites from July 1997 to August 1998. and from July 1999 to August 2000, sporadic occurrence of exuviae during these periods proves that refuge areas should exist within the lake. Possible background of the uncommon population dynamics of C. balatonicus is discussed.					; Specziár, András/N-5656-2019	Specziar, Andras/0000-0001-6341-636X; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					2008	44	3					181	188		10.1051/limn:2008002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn:2008002													WOS:000259736500002

An similar to 37 kg meteoroid entered the atmosphere with a speed of 13.68 +/- 0.09 km s(-1) and was observed ablating from a height of 85 km down to 18 km, having slowed to 3.28 +/- 0.21 km s(-1). Despite the relatively steep 68.5 degrees trajectory, strong atmospheric winds significantly influenced the darkflight phase and the predicted fall line, but the analysis put the fall site in the center of Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre South. Kati Thanda has meters-deep mud under its salt-encrusted surface. Reconnaissance of the area where the meteorite landed from a low-flying aircraft revealed a 60 cm circular feature in the muddy lake, less than 50 m from the predicted fall line. After a short search, which again employed light aircraft, the meteorite was recovered on December 31, 2015 from a depth of 42 cm. Murrili is the first recovered observed fall by the digital Desert Fireball Network (DFN). In addition to its scientific value, connecting composition to solar system context via orbital data, the recovery demonstrates and validates the capabilities of the DFN, with its next generation remote observatories and automated data reduction pipeline.

Glacier mass balance interpreted from biological analysis of firn cores in the Chilean lake district	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The first analyses of biological components in glaciers of the Chilean lake district are presented based on microalgae biovolume, pollen and other microorganisms detected in shallow (similar to 10m) firn/ice cores. Three cores were retrieved, two at Volcan Mocho-Choshuenco (39 degrees 55' S, 72 degrees 02' W; summit at 2422 m a.s.l; east glacier at 2000 m a.s.l.), and one at the summit of Volcan Osorno (41 degrees 06' S, 72 degrees 30' W; 2652 m a.s.l.). Microalgae, protozoa and pollen quantified in the samples obtained from the two summit cores show clear fluctuations interpreted as seasonal signs. In contrast, delta D and many chemical species from the summit cores show strong dampening at depth, probably due to water percolation. The limited information provided by isotopic and chemical analyses is used to support the seasonal interpretation of biological parameters from the summit cores, with microorganism maxima inferred to occur in summer and pollen maxima in spring. A good comparison is found between mass-balance estimations from the Volcan Mocho-Choshuenco summit core and values obtained near that site by means of the stake method. it is concluded that biological analyses of firn/ice cores provide reliable estimations of annual and seasonal markers from these temperate glaciers.

Loss of this species is progressing globally, and there is concern over threats and its conservation. As part of the study which aims to conserve this endangered species, zoosporo-genesis of A. linnaei in Lake Akan, designated as a Special Natural Monument of Japan, was investigated. Materials encompassing three growth forms of A. linnaei: "aggregative", "free-floating", and "epilithic", were collected at five sites around the lake at regular intervals from spring to autumn of 2017 and 2018. Quadriflagellate zoospores were observed at three sites (one aggregative and two epilithic) in mid-August and early September with a reproducibility, but not at two sites (one aggregative and one free-floating). Percentages of zoospore-producing filaments were extremely low (maximum 1.3 %), and the result of statistical analysis by generalized linear model showed no significant difference among the study sites and periods in both years. These results indicated that the zoosporogenesis of A. linnaei, which has been thought to be an extremely rare event in the past, occurs regularly even though being low percentage. Such rare zoosporogenesis appears to provide a few initials for the ensuing generations and to contribute to maintaining the aggregative form through the continuation of vegetative growth.

J	Evans, DM; Day, KR				Evans, DM; Day, KR			Does shooting disturbance affect diving ducks wintering on large shallow lakes? A case study on Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Waterfowl hunting is widespread and common throughout Europe, affecting waterfowl populations directly through the kill and indirectly through disturbance. Freedom from such disturbance is an important part of waterfowl management. However, most studies of the effects of disturbance on duck populations have been site specific with few attempts to synthesis the results of these local studies and use them in management strategies. Lough Neagh has the largest surface area,of any freshwater lake in the British Isles. It is also relatively shallow with a mean depth of ca. 9 m. The seasonal effects of shooting disturbance on the daytime distributions and behaviour of wintering Pochard Aythya ferina, Tufted Duck A. fuligula, Scaup A. marila and Goldeneye Bucephala clangula was studied during the winter of 1998/1999. The nocturnal use of shoreline areas was also studied using an image-intensifing telescope. The distributions of wintering Pochard, Tufted duck and Scaup were shown to be affected by shooting disturbance on Lough Neagh. But because they were also shown to predominantly roost during the day, and were not observed to forage in the marginal areas of the Lough throughout the winter period at night, any energetic consequence of shoreline based shooting disturbance is likely to be small. Goldeneye predominantly fed during the day. It would be expected that diurnal feeding Goldeneye would show the biggest response to shooting disturbance during the day, but proportions observed in designated zones during and after the shooting season did not change significantly, confirming the lack of effect. Observation of Pochard and Tufted Duck engaged in various behaviours did show an increase in the proportion of ducks feeding, after the shooting season had closed. The increase was attributed to increased feeding prior to migration as opposed to being the result of the cessation of shooting disturbance. The most important factors to consider when applying conservation measures to diving duck populations wintering on lakes with similar attributes are identified and discussed.

J	Havens, KE; Beaver, JR				Havens, Karl E.; Beaver, John R.			Zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratios in shallow Florida lakes: an evaluation of seasonality and hypotheses about factors controlling variability	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We examined crustacean zooplankton data (excluding nauplii) from 15 shallow lakes in south and central Florida, spanning a range of sizes and Chlorophyll-a concentrations. Each dataset was comprised of monthly samples from 2 years (6 lakes), or monthly to quarterly samples from 10 or 12 years (9 lakes). We quantified relationships between the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio (BZ:BP) and measurements of BZ and BP at three levels of resolution: (1) sampling events; (2) seasonal means; and (3) period-of-record means and medians. For individual sampling events, variations in ZB explained most of the variation in BZ:BP and ratios were little affected by changes in BP. Seasonal declines in BZ:BP corresponded with declines in BZ, were not related to declines in biomass of edible algae, and happened in spring-summer when earlier studies indicated high densities of planktivorous fish. Period-of-record means and medians did not identify any relationships between the biomass ratio and either BZ or BP, suggesting that processes affecting the ratio operate at shorter time scales than multiple years. Short-term and seasonal changes in BZ:BP in Florida may be controlled by predation. Testing this hypothesis will require coincident sampling of plankton and fish over a number of years or experimental studies.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2013	703	1					177	187		10.1007/s10750-012-1357-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1357-9													WOS:000312782000013

However, the multi-seasonal CH4 efflux from lakes has been rarely studied. In this study, the C(H)4 efflux from Poyang Hu, the largest freshwater lake in China, was measured monthly over a 4-year period by using the floating-chamber technique. The mean annual CH4 efflux throughout the 4 years was 0.54 mmol m(-2) day(-1), ranging from 0.47 to 0.60 mmol m(-2) day(-1). The CH4 efflux had a high seasonal variation with an average summer (June to August) efflux of 1.34 mmol m(-2) day(-1) and winter (December to February) efflux of merely 0.18 mmol m(-2) day(-1). The efflux showed no apparent diel pattern, although most of the peak effluxes appeared in the late morning, from 10: 00 to 12: 00 CST (GMT + 8). Multivariate stepwise regression on a seasonal scale showed that environmental factors, such as sediment temperature, sediment total nitrogen content, dissolved oxygen, and total phosphorus content in the water, mainly regulated the CH4 efflux. However, the CH4 efflux only showed a strong positive linear correlation with wind speed within 1 day on a bihourly scale in the multivariate regression analyses but almost no correlation with wind speed on diurnal and seasonal scales.

Central Iran, covers a large area on the Iranian plateau, and SDS has been known as a prevalent phenomenon in certain parts of the region since ancient times. The frequency and severity of SDS have increased over the last two decades due to population growth and mismanagement of natural resources. Identifying SDS sources is the first step to combating this phenomenon and reducing its destructive impacts. Accordingly, this study employed a remote sensing approach based on the modeling of environmental parameters to identify high potential SDS sources in Central Iran. The proposed model was implemented through a multi-step masking procedure using 20-year time-series datasets of MODIS and TerraClimate products. According to the results, 5.3% of Central Iran is identified as high potential SDS sources. Among these, sandy sources have the largest share in terms of area (60.9%) and frequency of SDS occurrence (>50%). The highest seasonal frequency of SDS (76%) was in spring and summer. The highest yearly frequency of SDS was observed in 2008, which was 120% higher than the 20-year average (2000-2020). In sandy and salt plain sources, SDS formation is predominantly associated with natural factors. However, in lakes and alluvial sources, anthropogenic activities have been directly linked with variations in SDS frequency and extent. The occurrence of severe droughts has intensified the frequency of SDS emerging from all types of high-potential sources in Central Iran.					; amiri, fatemeh/L-7120-2017; alavipanah, seyed kazem/ABA-6179-2020	Alavipanah, Seyed Kazem/0000-0002-3554-111X; Soleimani, Masoud/0000-0002-5269-7829; 													1574-9541	1878-0512				SEP	2022	70								101724	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101724													WOS:000818615200002

Hydrodynamic models will increasingly be used to enhance these benefits. We present the first validation of a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model on a small shallow lake with high resolution and high frequency measurements. Lake Cr,teil, France (area 0.4 km(2), mean depth 4.5 m, and catchment area 1 km(2)) is a former gravel pit and now part of a regional park. The model Delft3D-FLOW was calibrated on a one-month period, with continuous measurements of temperature at five depths at the center of the lake and at three depths at two other stations, and with current speed profiles at the centre of the lake. The model was then verified on 18 1-month periods with similar temperature measurements. The model reproduced very well the temperature dynamics, including the alternation between mixing and stratification periods and internal wave patterns. The mean absolute errors over the five depths at the central point remained below 0.55 degrees C in spring and summer, the most favorable seasons for phytoplankton growth. Horizontal temperature differences, which rose up to 3 degrees C at the beginning of stratification periods, were also well reproduced, as well as current speeds.

J	Thibeault, JM; Seth, A				Thibeault, Jeanne M.; Seth, Anji			A Framework for Evaluating Model Credibility for Warm-Season Precipitation in Northeastern North America: A Case Study of CMIP5 Simulations and Projections	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Future projections of northeastern North American warm-season precipitation [June-August (JJA)] indicate substantial uncertainty. Atmospheric processes important to the northeast-region JJA precipitation are identified and a first evaluation of the ability of five phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models to simulate these processes is performed. In this case study, the authors develop a set of process-based analyses forming a framework for evaluating model credibility in the northeast region. This framework includes evaluation of models' ability to simulate observed spatial patterns and amounts of mean precipitation; dynamical atmospheric circulation features, moisture transport, and moisture divergence important to interannual precipitation variability; long-term trends; and SST patterns important to northeast-region summer precipitation.Wet summers in the northeast region are associated with 1) negative 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies centered near the Great Lakes; 2) positive 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies over the western Atlantic east of the Mid-Atlantic states; 3) northeastward moisture flow and increased moisture convergence along the Eastern Seaboard; 4) increased moisture divergence off the U.S. Southeast coast; and 5) positive sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies in the western Atlantic, possibly related to cold tropical Atlantic SSTs and southwest ridging of the North Atlantic anticyclone. Models are generally able to simulate these features but vary compared to observations. Models capture regional moisture transport and convergence anomalies associated with wet summers reasonably well, despite errors in simulating the climatology. Identifying sources of intermodel differences in future projections is important, determining processes relevant for model credibility. In particular, changes in moisture divergence control the sign of northeast-region summer precipitation changes, making it a critical component of process-level analyses for the region.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				JAN	2014	27	2					493	510		10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00846.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00846.1													WOS:000329773100001

In nutrient-limited environments, mobilization of sediment nutrients by groundwater can significantly affect periphyton (including epiphyton) development in shallow littoral zones and may affect other lake primary producers. We hypothesized that epiphyton growth in the littoral zone of temperate oligomesotrophic hard-water lakes could be stimulated by nutrient (especially P) supply via lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD). We compared the dry mass, chlorophyll a (chl a), and nutrient content of epiphyton grown on artificial substrates at different sites in a groundwater-fed lake and in experimental chambers with and without LGD. During the spring-summer periods, epiphyton accumulated more biomass, especially algae, in littoral LGD sites and in experimental chambers with LGD compared to controls without LGD. Epiphyton chl a accumulation reached up to 46 mg chl a/m(2) after 4 wk when exposed to LGD, compared to a maximum of 23 mg chl a/m(2) at control (C) sites. In the field survey, differences in epiphyton biomass between LGD and C sites were most pronounced at the end of summer, when epilimnetic P concentrations were lowest and epiphyton C:P ratios indicated P limitation. Groundwater-borne P may have facilitated epiphyton growth on macrophytes and periphyton growth on littoral sediments. Epiphyton stored up to 35 mg P/m(2) in 4 wk (which corresponds to 13% of the total P content of the littoral waters), preventing its use by phytoplankton, and possibly contributing to the stabilization of a clear-water state. However, promotion of epiphyton growth by LGD may have contributed to an observed decline in macrophyte abundance caused by epiphyton shading and a decreased resilience of small charophytes to drag forces in shallow littoral areas of the studied lake in recent decades.

Investigation of the methanotrophic communities of the hot springs of the Uzon caldera, Kamchatka, by molecular ecological techniques	MICROBIOLOGY												The methane-oxidizing microbial communities inhabiting the bottom sediments of 36 hot springs of the Uzon caldera (Kamchatka, Russia) located in the thermal fields Vostochnoe, Oranzhevoe, and Severnoe, as well as near the lakes Fumarol'noe and Khloridnoe and the Izvilistyi stream, were studied. Methanotrophic bacteria were detected by PCR and FISH in only 8 hot springs. The highest numbers of copies of the pmoA gene (molecular marker of methanotrophy) (2.8 x 10(7) and 1.1 x 10(7) copies/mL sediment) were detected in the Kul'turnyi and Kvadrat springs; however, in other springs, the numbers of the pmoA gene copies were significantly lower (5.4 x 10(3)-2.8 x 10(6) copies/mL sediment). By using the FISH method, only type I methanotrophs were detected in these springs, with their percentage ranging from 0.3 to 20.5% of the total number of eubacteria. PCR-DGGE analysis of the pmoA gene showed that the diversity of methanotrophs was extremely low (no more that two components). Analysis of the deduced PmoA amino acid sequences demonstrated that methanotrophic bacteria of the genus Methylothermus, closely related to representatives of two valid species, widely occurred in the thermal springs near Lake Fumarol'noe. Other bacteria differing considerably from the detected Methylothermus species were detected as well. In the springs with low pH values (2.6-3.8), methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria most closely related to the genera Methylomonas and Methylobacter were detected for the first time.

The default land cover data generally used in the WRF is based on the land use category of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which erroneously presents most land areas of the Korean Peninsula as savannas. To revise such a fault, a multi-temporal land cover data, provided by the Ministry of Environment of Korea, was employed to generate a land cover map of 2005 subject to the land use in Korea at that time. A new land cover map of 1989, before the construction of the Lake Shihwa, was made based on the 2005 map and the Landsat 4-5 TM satellite images of two years. Over the areas where the land use had been changed (e.g., from sea to wetlands, towns, etc.) due to the Lake Shihwa development project, the skin temperature decreased by up to 8 degrees C in the winter case while increased by as much as 14 degrees C in the summer case. Changes in the water vapor mixing ratio were mostly affected by advection and topography in both seasons, with considerable increase in the summer case due to continuous sea breeze. Local decrease in water vapor occurred over high land use change areas and/ or over downstream of such areas where alteration in wind fields were induced by changes in skin temperature and surface roughness at the areas of land use changes. The albedo increased by about 0.1% in the regions where sea was converted into wetland. In the regions where urban areas were developed, such as Songdo New Town and Incheon International Airport, the albedo increased by up to 0.16%.

These distinct ecosystems are often among the most severely polluted systems due to intensive human activities. Our study marks the first evaluation of aquatic invertebrates associated with plastic litter in two brackish ponds. We collected 43 items of plastic litter (including bottles and disposable plastics) during the winter and spring of 2022. Most of plastic litter (76.8 %) was colonized by aquatic invertebrates. A total of 495 individuals were observed on the plastic litter, with the number of individuals ranging from 1 to 54 (average = 13.4). The most abundant taxa were from the families Gammaridae, Serpulidae, and Sphaeromatidae. Invertebrates colonized both the external and internal surfaces of the plastic bottles. Plastic bottles trapped 25 % of the total biota. The internal entrapped taxa were mainly represented by gammarids, molluscs egg mass, and sphaeromatids. Open bottles could potentially serve as temporary or permanent traps for invertebrates colonizing their internal surfaces. We argue that the dispersal of species driven by plastics is possible but limited, just as water exchanges with the seas are limited. These brackish lakes could be transit areas, but more importantly, they could be hotspots for plastic litter.					; Mancuso, Monique/AFR-0505-2022; HOUSSA, RACHIDA/IVH-3466-2023	Maaghloud, Hind/0000-0002-5600-1016; HOUSSA, RACHIDA/0000-0002-4525-4528; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 20	2024	912								169177	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169177		DEC 2023						38072276					WOS:001160724800001

In this work, a review was carried out, based on literature data, of potentially toxic cyanobacteria occurrence in Tunisia. Microcystis, one of the most widely distributed toxic bloom-forming cyanobacteria genera, was represented by Microcytis wesenbergii, found only in Lebna water reservoir, and Microcytis aeruginosa recorded in different water bodies. The invasive potentially toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, reported for the first time in Tunisia in October 2004, was observed in the semi-arid to arid areas. The harmful genus Planktothrix was represented in Tunisian freshwater by the green-pigmented species P. agardhii. The filamentous cyanobacteria dominance is increasingly reported in Tunisia in eutrophic water bodies. This dominance increases especially during the summer-autumn period. Recently, potentially toxic cyanobacteria blooms have been reported in some reservoirs in the north east of the country. These blooms were generated by the potentially toxic Chroococcale Microcystis aeruginosa. Harmful cyanobacteria tend to spatio-temporal expansion in the Tunisian inland waters. The toxicological potential evaluated by several methods showed that none of the Tunisian strains were proved to be cylindrospermopsin nor saxitoxin producers. However, the majority of Microcystis were able to synthesize microcystin.

J	Reiss, RS; Lemmin, U; Barry, DA				Reiss, Rafael Sebastian; Lemmin, Ulrich; Barry, David Andrew			What role does stratification play during winter in wind-induced exchange between the multi-depth basins of a large lake (Lake Geneva)?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Detailed studies of wind-driven interbasin exchange in lakes, focusing on the underlying driving forces and how they are affected by stratification, are presently lacking. We therefore investigated how strati-fication modifies wind-induced exchange between the Petit Lac (PL) (depth 75 m) and Grand Lac (GL) (depth 309 m) basins of Lake Geneva in winter, using field observations, 3D hydrodynamic modeling and particle tracking. Early, weakly-stratified (December) and late, fully-mixed (March) winter condi-tions in the PL were compared for a typical, strong along-axis wind forcing. During early winter, two -layer exchange develops between the basins, with downwind surface outflow into the GL balanced by intense bottom inflow of deep, cold hypolimnetic GL water into the PL which is enhanced by baroclinic pressure gradients caused by upwelling in the GL. Furthermore, the transversal water-level setup gener-ates barotropic pressure gradients that balance Coriolis force acting on the outflow. This produces unidi-rectional along-wind epilimnion currents that strengthen interbasin exchange. In late winter, with the thermocline deeper than the PL bottom, upwelling in the GL does not reach the confluence and baroclin-icity plays no role, resulting in weaker exchange currents with a depth-veering structure in the upper lay-ers due to Coriolis force. In late winter, interbasin exchange decreases by 50 %, is more local, affects only waters near the confluence, and is more horizontal, with no deepwater upwelling from the GL. Our results suggest that prolonged winter stratification due to global warming will make wind-induced hypolimnetic interbasin-upwelling an increasingly important deepwater renewal process in large multi-depth basin lakes.(c) 2023 The Authors.

J	Wen, RL; Xiao, JL; Fan, JW; Zhang, SR; Yamagata, H				Wen, Ruilin; Xiao, Jule; Fan, Jiawei; Zhang, Shengrui; Yamagata, Hideki			Pollen evidence for a mid-Holocene East Asian summer monsoon maximum in northern China	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												There is a controversy regarding whether the high precipitation delivered by an intensified East Asian summer monsoon occurred during the early Holocene, or during the middle Holocene, especially in the context of the monsoonal margin region. The conflicting views on the subject may be caused by chronological uncertainties and ambiguities in the interpretation of different climate proxies measured in different sedimentary sequences. Here, we present a detailed record of the Holocene evolution of vegetation in northern China based on a high-resolution pollen record from Dali Lake, located near the modern summer monsoon limit. From 12,000-8300. cal BP, the sandy land landscape changed from desert to open elm forest and shrubland, while dry steppe dominated the hilly lands and patches of birch forest developed in the mountains. Between 8300 and 6000 cal BP, elm forest was extensively distributed in the sandy lands, while typical steppe covered the hilly lands and mixed coniferous-broadleaved forests expanded in the mountains. Our pollen evidence contradicts the view that the monsoonal rainfall increased during the early Holocene; rather, it indicates that the East Asian summer monsoon did not become intensified until similar to 8000 cal BP in northern China. The low precipitation during the early Holocene can be attributed to the boundary conditions, i.e., to the remnant high-latitude Northern Hemisphere i.e sheets and the relatively low global sea level.

Therefore, palaeoclimate data in this area are still patchy and late Quaternary climate development is only poorly understood. In the western Kalahari, salt pans (playas, ephemeral lakes) are common and can feature quasi-continuous sedimentation. This study presents the first climate-related biomarker record using sediments from the Omongwa Pan, a Kalahari salt pan located in eastern Namibia. Our approach to reconstruct vegetation and hydrology focuses on biogeochemical bulk parameters and plant wax-derived lipid biomarkers (n-alkanes, n-alkanols, and fatty acids) and their compound-specific carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions. The presented record reaches back to 27 ka. During the glacial, rather low delta H-2 values of n-alkanes and low sediment input exclude a strong influence of winter rainfall. n-Alkane and n-alkanol distributions and delta C-13 values of n-hentriacontane (n-C-31) indicate a shift to a vegetation with a higher proportion of C-4 plants at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum until the end of Heinrich Stadial I (ca. 18-14.8 ka), which we interpret to indicate an abrupt excursion to a short wetter period likely to be caused by a temporary southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Shifts in delta H-2 values of n-C-31 and plant wax parameters give evidence for changes to drier conditions during early Holocene. Comparison of this dataset with representative continental records from the region points to a major influence of summer rainfall at Omongwa Pan during the regarded time span and demonstrates the potential of southern African salt pans as archives for biomarker-based climate proxies.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 1	2020	543								109561	10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.109561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.109561													WOS:000518707600016
J	Glova, GJ				Glova, GJ			Density effects on juvenile shortfinned eel (Anguilla australis) cover preferences in replicate channels	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The effects of density on day-time cover preferences of juvenile (100-199 mm total length) shortfinned eels (Anguilla australis Richardson) were tested in replicate channels provided with natural (cobbles, macrophytes, woody debris) and artificial (shade, plastic pipes) cover during summer. The densities used were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, and 200 eels channel(-1) (each channel = 2.4 m(2)), with each density tested in triplicate, or better. Eels used cobbles and macrophytes almost exclusively, with cobbles being the most preferred and their use increased with increasing density; however, at 200 eels charmel(-1), escape behaviour was evident during the night. In tests at 100 eels channel(-1), with only woody debris, plastic pipes, and shade sections available, the eels occupied woody debris, pipes, and shade in decreasing order. In further tests at 100 eels channel(-1), with cobbles, macrophytes and woody debris included, but with plastic pipes partially buried in the substrate and shade sections lowered to within 20 mm of the bottom, still only cobbles and macrophytes were used. Finally, in tests of 10, 50, and 100 eels channel(-1), with cover in each channel consisting of cobbles, macrophytes, woody debris, fallen sod (clumps of natural stream bank with riparian grasses), and modified shade (i.e., lowered to within 20 mm of the bottom with macrophyte rootlets attached to underside), eels preferred cobbles, shade, and fallen sod in decreasing order at all three densities. Overall, the findings of this study do not lend strong support to the hypothesis that juvenile eels use a greater variety of cover with increasing population density.																			0028-8330					SEP	2002	36	3					483	490		10.1080/00288330.2002.9517103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2002.9517103													WOS:000179133600003

The well-exposed Quaternary deposits at Obruktepe (Denizli Basin, Turkey) provide an opportunity to reconstruct the three-dimensional sedimentary architecture of such a system. Integration of sedimentological, lithofacies and geochemical analyses reveals complexity in the lateral relationships between sedimentary environments, faults and geothermal spring carbonates. Five environmental systems are distinguished based on the lithofacies analysis: (i) vent; (ii) smooth slope; (iii) travertine-terrace; (iv) tufa-barrage; and (v) flood systems. Encrusting, baffling and settling sedimentary processes are reflected in data acquired at several scales, from lithofacies observations to the morphology and arrangement of geobodies, together with microfabrics and stable carbon and oxygen isotope data. Mean values of +4.9 parts per thousand delta C-13 and -8.74 parts per thousand delta O-18 Vienna PeeDee Belemnite reflect geothermal circulation of springwaters. The environmental distribution and lithofacies indicate a lateral continuum between travertine and tufa deposits within this hot spring system. This finding supports two depositional models in which water flow variation is the main control on both CaCO3 precipitation and the resulting formation of travertine and tufa. The proposed models address the factors responsible for the development of these complex mound-shaped carbonate spring deposits, and how they are related to fluid circulation at depth and in association with faults.

J	Leppi, JC; Arp, CD; Whitman, MS				Leppi, Jason C.; Arp, Christopher D.; Whitman, Matthew S.			Predicting Late Winter Dissolved Oxygen Levels in Arctic Lakes Using Morphology and Landscape Metrics	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Overwintering habitat for Arctic freshwater fish is essential, such that understanding the distribution of winter habitat quality at the landscape-scale is warranted. Adequate dissolved oxygen (DO) is a major factor limiting habitat quality in the Arctic region where ice cover can persist for 8 months each year. Here we use a mixed-effect model developed from 20 lakes across northern Alaska to assess which morphology and landscape attributes can be used to predict regional overwintering habitat quality. Across all lakes, we found that the majority of the variations in late winter DO can be explained by lake depth and littoral area. In shallow lakes (< 4 m), we found evidence that additional variables such as elevation, lake area, ice cover duration, and snow depth were associated with DO regimes. Low DO regimes were most typical of shallow lakes with large littoral areas and lakes that had high DO regimes often were lakes with limited littoral areas and deeper water. Our analysis identifies metrics that relate to late winter DO regimes in Arctic lakes that can aid managers in understanding which lakes will likely provide optimum DO for overwintering habitat. Conversely, lakes which predicted to have marginal winter DO levels may be vulnerable to disturbances that could lower DO below critical thresholds to support sensitive fish. In regions where lakes are also used by humans for industrial winter water supply, such as ice-road construction for oil and gas development, these findings will be vital for the management of resources and protection of Arctic fish.

The model calculates transient hydraulic head and a transient free surface in a two-dimensional, heterogeneous domain, with variable and transient boundary conditions (infiltration, evapotranspiration, surface water), and water and contaminant fluxes across the aquifer-wetland interface. Contaminant transport is also simulated, with contaminant sources located at the free surface, wetland, or within the saturated domain. The model was applied to assess groundwater-wetland interactions and the transport of septic-system-derived contaminants at Point Pelee, Ontario, Canada. The model successfully simulated the field observations of groundwater flow and contaminant plumes. Where the barrier bar is narrow, the seasonal reversal in the direction of groundwater flow is caused by differences in the elevation of the water surface of Lake Erie and that of the marsh. This, in turn, induces the contaminants to oscillate between movement towards the lake during the winter and towards the marsh during the summer. Hence, contaminant plumes are bimodal in shape. Where the barrier bar becomes wider, the lake and the marsh have less effect, and hence contaminants move in one direction. along the principal direction of groundwater flow towards the marsh.

"Sudbury Breccia" and "Huronian Breccia": spatial, sedimentological, and structural evidence for separate distinct breccia-forming events	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Rounded argillite clasts within the lower Gowganda Formation of the Huronian Supergroup near Whitefish Falls, Ontario, have been historically mapped as Sudbury Breccia, implying that their formation was initiated by the Sudbury meteorite impact event. Alternative genetic models proposed to explain the breccia at Whitefish Falls include formation through intrusion of diabase into wet sediment accompanied by soft-sediment deformation events. Outcrops in the Whitefish Falls area contain clear evidence for early post-depositional fracturing: flow of argillites into brittle fractured sandstones. Linking these geological processes suggests that the formation of the breccia at Whitefish Falls was generated by faulting of the Huronian sedimentary basin during the sedimentation of the Gowganda argillites. Using a GIS approach to compare the distribution of known breccia bodies with mapped lithology and structure, it is apparent that the term Sudbury Breccia has been applied to two types of breccias. First, true Sudbury Breccia, which is characterised by rounded heterogeneous clasts in an aphanitic matrix, is only found in proximity to the Sudbury Impact crater. The distribution of the second, primarily sediment derived, type of breccia, as seen at Whitefish Falls, is strongly associated with mapped faults and regional-scale basement discontinuities, as defined by gravity and magnetic data. Since this type of breccia is present throughout the entire Huronian sedimentary sequence, the term "Huronian Breccia" is more appropriate. This breccia is not the result of a single geological event but rather episodes of fault activity, as the geometry of the Huronian basin evolved over time.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JUL	2023	60	7					739	751		10.1139/cjes-2022-0003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjes-2022-0003		JAN 2023											WOS:000923160600001

Parasite burdens differ between sympatric three-spined stickleback species	ECOGRAPHY												The ecological theory of adaptive radiation states that differences in ecological circumstances among local populations are the cause of divergence that leads to speciation. The role of parasites in contributing to divergence has seldom been considered, despite their ubiquity and known selective effects. The potential for parasites to contribute to divergence between closely related taxa was examined by quantifying the variation in parasite burdens between sympatric three-spined stickleback species (Gasterosteus aculeatus complex) in two lakes in coastal British Columbia, Canada. In doing so the relative importance of geographical differences between lakes and trophic or microhabitat differences between species within lakes were evaluated. The entire metazoan parasite burdens of a total of 255 limnetic and benthic sticklebacks in Paxton and Priest lakes were assayed over five time points between spring and autumn. Despite their sympatric distributions, there were large differences in parasite burdens between benthic and limnetic sticklebacks within lakes and these were consistent across both lakes. In particular, limnetics suffered greater burdens of the parasites Schistocephalus solidus and Diplostomum scudderi and benthics had much higher burdens of parasitic glochidia (mollusc larvae). Parasite burdens also differed quantitatively between lakes, but in general such differences were less pronounced than those between the stickleback species. The documented differences in parasite burdens between stickleback species have potential to contribute to divergent selection on life history, immunological and secondary sexual characters that could contribute to reproductive isolation between the species.

Altaf; Leduc, Martin; Coulibaly, Paulin; McKenzie, Shawn			Future shift in winter streamflow modulated by the internal variability of climate in southern Ontario	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Fluvial systems in southern Ontario are regularly affected by widespread early-spring flood events primarily caused by rain-on-snow events. Recent studies have shown an increase in winter floods in this region due to increasing winter temperature and precipitation. Streamflow simulations are associated with uncertainties mainly due to the different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, global climate models (GCMs) or the choice of the hydrological model. The internal variability of climate, defined as the chaotic variability of atmospheric circulation due to natural internal processes within the climate system, is also a source of uncertainties to consider. Uncertainties of internal variability can be assessed using hydrological models fed by downscaled data of a global climate model large ensemble (GCM-LE), but GCM outputs have too coarse of a scale to be used in hydrological modeling. The Canadian Regional Climate Model Large Ensemble (CRCM5-LE), a 50-member ensemble downscaled from the Canadian Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble (CanESM2-LE), was developed to simulate local climate variability over northeastern North America under different future climate scenarios. In this study, CRCM5-LE temperature and precipitation projections under an RCP8.5 scenario were used as input in the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) to simulate streamflow at a near-future horizon (2026-2055) for four watersheds in southern Ontario. To investigate the role of the internal variability of climate in the modulation of streamflow, the 50 members were first grouped in classes of similar projected change in January-February streamflow and temperature and precipitation between 1961-1990 and 2026-2055. Then, the regional change in geopotential height (Z500) from CanESM2-LE was calculated for each class. Model simulations showed an average January-February increase in streamflow of 18 % (+/- 8.7) in Big Creek, 30.5 % (+/- 10.8) in Grand River, 29.8 % (+/- 10.4) in Thames River and 31.2 % (+/- 13.3) in Credit River. A total of 14 % of all ensemble members projected positive Z500 anomalies in North America's eastern coast enhancing rain, snowmelt and streamflow volume in January-February. For these members the increase of streamflow is expected to be as high as 31.6 % (+/- 8.1) in Big Creek, 48.3 % (+/- 11.1) in Grand River, 47 % (+/- 9.6) in Thames River and 53.7 % (+/- 15) in Credit River. Conversely, 14 % of the ensemble projected negative Z500 anomalies in North America's eastern coast and were associated with a much lower increase in streamflow: 8.3 % (+/- 7.8) in Big Creek, 18.8 % (+/- 5.8) in Grand River, 17.8 % (+/- 6.4) in Thames River and 18.6 % (+/- 6.5) in Credit River. These results provide important information to researchers, managers, policymakers and society about the expected ranges of increase in winter streamflow in a highly populated region of Canada, and they will help to explain how the internal variability of climate is expected to modulate the future streamflow in this region.

Role of edaphic, hydrologic, and land cover variables in determining dissolved organic carbon in Missouri (USA) reservoirs and streams	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												In Missouri, distinct geophysical gradients influence statewide patterns in water quality. Here, we quantify the spatiotemporal variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in reservoirs and streams and the edaphic, hydrologic, and land cover variables that account for cross-system variation. Datasets included statewide inventories collected over decades and studies with greater temporal resolution (n = >6350 DOC measurements). Among reservoirs, the smallest DOC concentration was measured in a spring-fed system within a forested watershed, and the largest was where agricultural biosolids were applied to the land (range 1.0-15.9 mg/L, overall mean 5.8 mg/L). Reservoir values increased from the southern forested Highlands (mean 4.7 mg/L) to the northern agricultural Plains (mean 7.0 mg/L). Stream DOC was similar to reservoir values (overall mean in streams 6.3 mg/L; Highlands mean 4.0 mg/L; Plains mean 6.6 mg/L), despite differences in study design and collection period. Reservoir DOC increased in spring, indicative of allochthonous loading, with small autochthonous additions during a broad summer peak. Temporal variability in DOC was low relative to macronutrients and chlorophyll in both reservoirs and streams, indicating DOC may be a sensitive and readily detected indicator of temporal change in these systems. In regression analyses, watershed features accounted for more than 60% of overall cross-system variability in DOC in both reservoirs and streams. Driver-response relations, however, differed between regions. This analysis extends our understanding of environmental influences on surface water chemistry in Missouri and indicates DOC is nearly as predictable as macronutrients using landscape-level features.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				APR 2	2024	40	2					177	195		10.1080/10402381.2024.2326057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2024.2326057		MAR 2024											WOS:001211426900001

Using long-term, high-frequency observations, we compared the diversity and the temporal variability in biomass and species composition of the ciliate community in large, deep, mesotrophic Lake Constance to that of the phytoplankton and rotifer communities in the same lake. Furthermore, we used boosted regression trees to evaluate possible environmental predictors (temperature, three prey groups, four predator/competitor groups) influencing ciliate net growth. The biomass of all ciliate species showed a common, recurrent seasonal pattern, often with peaks in spring and summer. The ciliate community was more diverse than the rotifer community, exhibited highly synchronous dynamics and its species were regularly encountered during the season. The top-down control by copepods likely contributes to the ciliates' synchronized decline prior to the clear-water phase when food concentration is still high. The high temporal autocorrelation of the ciliate biomasses together with the inter-annual recurrent seasonal patterns and the low explanatory power of the environmental predictors suggest that the dynamics of individual ciliate species are strictly controlled, yet it remains difficult to determine the responsible factors.

In 1997-1998, Lake Blanca (34degrees54'S, 54degrees50' W), a yellow-brownish shallow lake in Uruguay, suffered a severe water level reduction (associated with El Nino events between 1995-1997) that resulted in a massive fish kill and an extensive colonisation by Egeria densa. A clear water phase is established nowadays in the system (Secchi depth > 1 m), despite a fish community restricted to two small ornnivorous-planktivorous fish: Jenynsia multidentata and Cnesterodon decemmaculatus. We studied the effects of E. densa on bottom-up and top-down controls on phytoplankton by comparing physical, chemical, and biological characteristics between submerged plant beds and sites without plants, from autumn 2000 to autumn 2001. The water column had low to intermediate nutrient concentrations, and phytoplankton community was highly diverse with a low to moderate biomass (mean Chl-a = 10.6 mug l(-1)). The water level, recovered during the study, promoted a dilution process that explained the temporal pattern of many chemical variables. Macrophyte PVI represented 28-39% of the lake volume (annual mean biomass = 174 g DW m(-2)). The zooplankton community was generally dominated by copepods in terms of biomass. Fish and zooplankton were significantly associated with submerged plant beds. In spite of the high biomass and density of ornnivorous-planktivorous fish (115 kg ha(-1), 13 ind m(-2)), zooplankton strongly affected phytoplankton spatial and temporal variation. The most important differences of algal biomass between zones coincided with a high herbivorous zooplankton biomass and/or with plants occupying the entire water column during the low level period. Medium-sized zooplankton declined with fish reproduction. The consequent stronger predation of juvenile fish seemed to decrease macrophyte efficiency as a zooplankton refuge in summer. E. densa bottom-up mechanisms would also be present, contributing to maintaining clear water. Besides the usually described nutrient and light limitation, the internal production of humic substances could enhance the observed top-down effect.

Surface flow wetland (SFW) is a common natural wetland type, and is also used as a cheap and easy-to-build sewage treatment system for small and scattered settlements. However, seasonal variation patterns of MPs in sewage removed by SFW are still limited. Therefore, a field investigation was conducted in an SFW that has been operated for 17 years. The concentration of microplastics in the influent of the SFW (CMPs, in) ranged from 56 & PLUSMN; 6 to 250 & PLUSMN; 14 items L-1. The dominant plastic types were fibers and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). CMPs, in were high in summer and winter, significantly related to the seasonal dressing habits. The removal efficiencies of MPs in SFW were 48.03-92.32 % in different seasons, and the mechanisms of MP removal were different with traditional pollutants. Before flowing out occasionally or by heavy precipitation, MPs were primarily trapped in the SFW and underwent certain oxidation. Simulation experiments demonstrated that 47.5-92.9 % of MPs would be trapped in the SFW, and plants would significantly enhance the trapping capacities. This study sheds light on the seasonal variation characteristics and patterns of MPs in actual sewage, and clarifies the fate of MPs in a long-term operation SFW.

Long-term SST data show significant warming trends in these estuaries during both daytime (0.55 degrees C/decade) and nighttime (0.42 degrees C/decade) between 2000 and 2021. The warming rates are faster during winter (0.70 degrees C/decade and 0.67 degrees C/decade for daytime and nighttime, respectively) than during summer (0.48 degrees C/decade and 0.28 degrees C/decade for daytime and nighttime, respectively). Overall, the South Florida estuaries experienced rapid warming over the past two decades, 1.7 and 1.3 times faster than the Gulf of Mexico (0.33 degrees C/decade and 0.32 degrees C/decade for daytime and nighttime), and 6.9 and 4.2 times faster than the global oceans (0.08 degrees C/decade and 0.10 degrees C/decade for daytime and nighttime).					; hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012	shi, jing/0000-0002-3214-7440; 													1748-9326					JAN 1	2023	18	1							014003	10.1088/1748-9326/aca8ba	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aca8ba													WOS:000906992100001
J	STODDARD, JL; KELLOGG, JH				STODDARD, JL; KELLOGG, JH			TRENDS AND PATTERNS IN LAKE ACIDIFICATION IN THE STATE OF VERMONT - EVIDENCE FROM THE LONG-TERM MONITORING PROJECT	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Twenty-four low acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) lakes in Vermont have been monitored since 1980 to characterize their chemical variability, and to determine if they exhibit temporal trends in acid/base chemistry. Many of the lakes exhibit significant decreasing trends in SO42- and base cation (C(B)) concentrations, but few exhibit significant changes in pH or ANC. An examination of all trend results (significant and insignificant) suggests a tendency for ANC and pH values in these lakes to be increasing, but either the changes are too small, or the number of observations too small, for these trends to be significant. Data from these lakes suggest that the primary responses of surface waters in this region to declining rates of SO42- deposition are decreases in SO42- concentrations and rates of cation leaching from watershed soils. Decreasing rates of C(B) deposition may combine with lower rates of cation leaching to produce declines in C(B) that are very similar to measured declines in SO42-concentration. Vermont lakes exhibit their lowest ANC values in spring, attributable, for the most part, to dilution of C(B) concentrations during spring snow melt. Concentrations of SO42- are also more dilute in the spring, but C(B) decreases are greater, and the net effect is a lowering of ANC. One quarter of the Vermont lakes monitored exhibit strong seasonality in NO3 concentrations, with peak concentrations near 70 mueq L-1. In these lakes, spring increases in NO3- Concentrations are more important than C(B) dilution in producing minimal spring ANC values.

The applied multi-residue method comprised 111 OMPs covering compounds with wide range of physicalal-chemical properties. In total, 46 OMPs were detected at least once above limit of quantification (LOQ). DEET (diethyltoluamide), lamotrigine, bicalutamide, tolyltriazole, caffeine, carbamazepine, metoprolol, oxazepam, cetirizine, fexofenadine, lidocaine and tramadol were detected in more than 75% of the sampling points. The highest detected concentration was found for lamotrigine with 140 ng/L. The locations Ekoln and Vasterasfiarden were identified to be most affected by OMPs pollution. In the surface water (0.5 m depth) most highest concentrations of OMPs were observed in spring and lower concentrations in summer. Antihistamine demonstrated a seasonal trend that can be related to seasonal consumption patterns. The investigation of the vertical distribution of OMPs demonstrated that thermal lake stratification can lead to different concentrations within the water column. For instance, in February the highest concentration for most OMPs was observed in the deepest sampled water depth (30 m). Two industrial chemicals, tolyltriazole and tris(2-butoxylethyl)phosphate were detected frequently and it is recommended to incorporate these compounds more regularly in future analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to report the occurrence and distribution of OMPs representing such wide physico-chemical properties, including industrial chemicals, in a Swedish lake.

Sampling was carried out from October 2002 to May 2004. Altogether 23 benthic taxa were identified in XL and 21 taxa in YL. The density of benthos in XL was much lower than that in YL, but the biomass was about equal in the two lakes, being 1 423 ind/m(2) and 8.71 g/m(2) in XL and 4 249 ind/m(2) and 8.60 g/m(2) in YL. The dominant species were Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Branchiura sowerbyi, Aulodrilus pluriseta and Chironomus sp. in XL and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Aulodrilus pluriseta and Bellamya sp. in YL. Seasonal fluctuation occurred, showing richer species in summer and winter, but the density and biomass varied in different ways in the two lakes. Analyses on functional feeding groups indicate that collector-gatherers were predominant, but the relative abundances of other groups were different. Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the water depth, conductivity and chlorophyll a were the key factors affecting macrozoobenthic abundance in the lakes.

Gary			Over-wintering physiology of age-0 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and its implications for conservation stocking programs	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) occupy some of the most northerly distributions of any sturgeon species and experience extended overwintering periods when resources may be limited. Conservation stocking is currently used as a management tool to enhance lake sturgeon populations that are at risk or endangered. One of the most limiting components of the conservation effort is our understanding of energy requirements that allow age-0 lake sturgeon to survive their first winter. In this study, age-0 fish (mean mass 5.6 g +/- 0.5 S.E.; mean total length 12.7 cm +/- 0.4 S.E.) were held in groups of 12 individuals (10 total groups) and starved for a period of four weeks while being held at 1 +/- 1 A degrees C. This setting was intended to simulate winter conditions that occur in the Winnipeg River, MB, Canada. Post-winter fish condition and physiology were compared to pre-winter fish using survival, energy density, metabolic rate, glucose, triglyceride, protein, and cortisol production as metrics. While mortality was high (42%) during the experiment, results indicated that fish with total water content below 90% and energy density above 2000 J/g were more likely to survive. Whole body triglyceride, plasma triglyceride, plasma glucose levels, and standard metabolic rates were also found to significantly decline over time while whole body cortisol concentration increased. Understanding these thresholds will help in future refinements of rearing conditions, which look to improve the survival of age-0 lake sturgeon released into the wild pre-winter.

The predominance of Cl and Na, saturation indices of carbonate minerals, and Na/Cl and Ca/SO4 ratios of similar to 1 suggest that halite, sulphate, and carbonate are the solute sources. Integration of geochemical, delta O-18, and delta D values suggests that springs are mainly derived from meteoric water, ice-snow melt, and water-rock interactions. B concentrations range from 0.18 to 11.9 mg/L, with delta B-11 values of -4.37 parts per thousand to +32.39 parts per thousand, indicating a terrestrial source. The delta B-11-B relationships suggest B sources of crustal origin (marine carbonates with minor crust-derived volcanics); we did not identify a marine or deep mantle origin. The delta B-11 values of saline springs (+4.61 parts per thousand to +32.39 parts per thousand) exceed those of hot (-4.37 parts per thousand to +4.53 parts per thousand) and cold (-3.47 parts per thousand to +14.84 parts per thousand) springs; this has contributed to strong water-rock interactions and strong saturation of dissolved carbonates. Conversely, the global geothermal delta B-11-Cl/B relationship suggests mixing of marine and non-marine sources. The delta B-11-Cl/B relationships of the CD-LP-SM are similar to those of the Tibet geothermal belt and the Nangqen Basin, indicating the same B origin. These differ from thermal waters controlled by magmatic fluids and seawater, suggesting that B in CD-LP-SM springs has a crustal origin.

J	GEDDES, MC				GEDDES, MC			SEASONAL FAUNA OF SOME EPHEMERAL SALINE WATERS IN WESTERN VICTORIA WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO PARARTEMIA-ZIETZIANA SAYCE (CRUSTACEA-ANOSTRACA)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Seasonal changes in physical, chemical and biological aspects of 16 ephemeral saline lakes in the Lake Corangamite district of W Victoria [Australia] were studied. High temperatures, high salinities and low dissolved O2 levels were recorded in the summer months. The less saline lakes contained a halophilic fauna which included Branchinella compacta, Daphniopsis pusilla, Boeckella triarticulata and Mesochra sp. In the more saline lakes where salinity did not fall below 40.permill. at any time during the year, a truly halobiont fauna was present consisting of Parartemia zietziana, Calamoecia salina, C. clitellata, Microcyclops arnaudi, Australocypris robusta, Diacypris sp. and Platycypris sp. The occurrence of these halobiont species appeared to be controlled by salinity, new upper salinity records showing that all these species tolerate salinities well in excess of 100.permill.. Autecological studies on P. zietziana showed that development proceeded through 15 juvenile stages. Both subitaneous and resting eggs were produced with salinity being the controlling factor. Resting eggs hatched in response to a salinity drop over an approximate range of salinities of 50-200.permill.. In many populations development of the juveniles was retarded in stages 12-14. The length of adults was found to vary inversely with salinity. P. zietziana species occurs only in highly saline, astatic localities.																			0067-1940						1976	27	1					1	22																WOS:A1976BS54500001

Size frequency distributions of C. nipponensis larvae at Station 2 (13 m depth) and Station 3 (26 m depth) were usually bimodal with two cohorts. At Station 2, C. nipponensis larvae had a one-year generation time, while at Station 3, all C. nipponensis larvae took 1.5 years to develop into adults. At Stations 2 and 3, annual mean bottom water temperature and total effective temperature (degree-days above 2.5 degrees C) were 7.3 +/- 1.1 degrees C 1,760 degree-days (12 months; from April 1985 to March 1986), and 5.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C 1,753 degree-days (18 months; from April 1985 to September 1986), respectively. At Station 3, the low water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration during summer-fall might suppress the growth of C. nipponensis larvae. Bottom water temperature and low dissolved oxygen concentration were too low to allow the growth of C. nipponensis within a year. In these circumstances, the spatial seasonal variation in voltinism of C. nipponensis population is suggested in mesotrophic Lake Kizaki.																			0003-9136					DEC	1996	138	2					229	244																WOS:A1996VY76100007

Geothermal fluids with As concentrations ranging from 0.01 to tens of mg/L occur in different locations around the world, especially in geothermal systems along the boundaries of active plates. Leaching of reservoir rocks is the most important source of As in geothermal fluids. Arsenic exists in different As-bearing minerals in geothermal reservoirs with different temperatures, and the As concentrations in aqueous phase are affected by reservoir temperature to various degree. Arsenic concentration in geothermal waters depends on their genesis and geochemistry, with deep neutral chloride waters commonly containing much higher As concentrations than shallow acidic sulfate waters. During the upflow of geothermal fluids from the reservoir to the surface, As experiences a series of abiotic and biotic processes: oxidation, reduction, methylation and As-S redox cycling. Arsenic oxidation could happen under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Up till now a total of twelve aerobic As(III)-oxidizing bacteria have been isolated and thousands of clones harboring arsenite oxidase gene were detected in hot springs worldwide. As(III)-oxidizing rate of these isolates reached up to 1.27 mu M/min. In situ microbial arsenate reduction in geothermal environment was found in the bottom water of Mono Lake fed by hot spring waters, and several arsenate reducers were reported in some geothermal waters as well. Inorganic As could be methylated in hot springs by biological activity. Arsenic and sulfur often coexist in geothermal environments and undergo similar chemical and microbial redox transformations. In sulfidic hot springs, thioarsenates/thioarsenites can be formed preferentially by replacing several hydroxyl groups in arsenate and arsenite with thiol groups, respectively, and thioarsenites/ thioarsenates could be reciprocally transformed regardless of the presence of sulfur. Microorganisms in hot springs have been found to exert a profound influence on As and sulfur speciation by using them as both electron donors and acceptors, forming various thioarsenate species. Geothermal As from depth can be released into the surface or near-surface environments either via discharge of hot springs or geothermal wastewater, or via natural mixing of geothermal waters with local shallow groundwaters. Some rivers contaminated by geothermal As were estimated to discharge tens to more than one hundred tons of As per year. Understanding the biogeochemical behaviors of As in geothermal systems before and after mixing with shallow groundwaters and surface waters is therefore critical for the protection of water resources and the environment.

The diet of juvenile lake trout Salmo trutta L. in rivers of the Onega basin in autumn	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The diet of juvenile trout and the state of their food resources in autumn (September-November) were studied in two typical small rivers tributary to Lake Onega (Karelia) in 2003. The relationship between the composition of food objects among benthic and drifting invertebrates and the food spectrum of trout was analyzed. The results show that before freeze-up, despite the disappearance of aerial and terrestrial insects, juveniles trout continue active feeding. However, their feeding priorities change: they begin to take food objects directly from the bottom, as well as from the water surface and within the water column.					; Veselov, Alexey/E-3699-2012; Baryshev, Igor/AAD-4495-2021	Veselov, Alexey/0000-0002-2533-8118; 													1067-4136					MAR	2008	39	2					119	122		10.1134/S1067413608020070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1067413608020070													WOS:000254752500007

Factors and Processes of Salt Lake Formation on Baikal Shore	WATER RESOURCES												The article considers the conditions under which the water resources and chemistry are forming in the mineral Bormashovoe Lake, which lies on the Svyatoi Nos Peninsula on the eastern coast of Lake Baikal. The study was focused on water and free gas, which releases from bottom deposits and lakes in the Svyatoi Nos Peninsula. The results represent the analysis of water samples taken in ice-free and ice periods and studied to determine a wide range of chemical elements by up-to-date methods. The geological conditions existing in the region are considered. It is found that the rocks in the area near the lake are represented by eluvial deposits that have formed at intensive physical and, to a lesser extent, chemical weathering of granites. The recharge of the lake is shown to be mostly due to the discharge of fracture-vein and subsoil water, which form the specific geochemical pattern of lake water. In winter, the decomposition of organic residues of bottom sediments causes a change in the physicochemical conditions in lake water and increases its content of hydrocarbonate ion, calcium, magnesium, and rare-earth elements. Factor analysis was used to identify associations of elements which form under the effect of discharge of deep fracture-vein water, unconfined water enriched by decomposition products of rocks that had suffered the stage of frost weathering and lake water saturation by carbon dioxide in winter. Thermodynamic modeling showed that equilibrium exists in the lake with respect to calcite and dolomite, and the precipitation of carbonate minerals causes the accumulation of sodium and hydrocarbonate ion in water, making it soda water.

J	Steinman, A; Chu, XF; Ogdahl, M				Steinman, Alan; Chu, Xuefeng; Ogdahl, Mary			Spatial and temporal variability of internal and external phosphorus loads in Mona Lake, Michigan	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												A study was conducted in Mona Lake, a small eutrophic lake located in western Michigan (USA) to address the temporal and spatial variability of external and internal phosphorus loading. External P load varied among subbasins, which was mostly related to discharge, but also to land use. Black Creek, which drains lands with natural cover and agriculture, accounted for the majority of flow, and total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) load, to Mona Lake. However, the relative contribution of SRP load was greater in Little Black Creek, which flows through a mostly urbanized subbasin, than in Black Creek. The relative importance of internal loading was strongly related to season, as internal TP loads contributed only similar to 9% of the overall P load in April 2005, but similar to 68-82% of the overall P load in the summer and early fall seasons. Internal TP and SRP loading was greater under anaerobic than aerobic conditions. Mean anaerobic TP release rates ranged from 0.80 to 15.56 mg P m(-2) d(-1), varying with site and season. Spatial variability in both internal phosphorus loading and sediment P concentration was also evident. By taking into account the spatial and temporal variability of different loading sources, management practices can be targeted to optimize nutrient source control strategies.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014; Chu, Xuefeng/H-7285-2012	Chu, Xuefeng/0000-0003-0322-0271; Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305													1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2009	43	1					1	18		10.1007/s10452-007-9147-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-007-9147-6													WOS:000263159200001

Assessing ecological status of regulated lakes with littoral macrophyte, macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Anthropogenic alterations of hydrologic regime are a major stressor for aquatic ecosystems. In boreal lakes water levels are often drawn down several meters for hydropower production in winter, which may have negative impacts particularly on littoral biota. We examined macrophyte, macroinvertebrate, and fish assemblages in littoral zone of 30 regulated and non-regulated reference lakes in Finland. We applied community metrics which correspond to demands of EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) to (i) assess and classify ecological status of the lakes, and to (ii) estimate critical water level drawdown in winter that would allow for acceptable status ("Good" ecological quality class in WFD). All three organism groups indicated strong response to winter drawdown, but with rather high mutual variation. Macroinvertebrates showed the strongest response (r(2) = 0.73 between Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) and winter drawdown), followed by macrophytes (r(2) = 0.43) and fish (r(2) = 0.40). Mean-EQR over the three organism groups indicated that Good ecological status class was usually not attained if winter drawdown exceeded 3.46m, whereas minimum-EQR (lowest of the three groups, i.e. one-out, all-out principle) indicated a critical threshold of 1.76 m. Generally, our results suggest that monitoring and ecological status assessment of regulated lakes should focus on littoral biota which is most vulnerable to water level fluctuations.

Seasonal fluctuations in ionic concentrations drive microbial succession in a hypersaline lake community	ISME JOURNAL												Microbial community succession was examined over a two-year period using spatially and temporally coordinated water chemistry measurements, metagenomic sequencing, phylogenetic binning and de novo metagenomic assembly in the extreme hypersaline habitat of Lake Tyrrell, Victoria, Australia. Relative abundances of Haloquadratum-related sequences were positively correlated with co-varying concentrations of potassium, magnesium and sulfate, but not sodium, chloride or calcium ions, while relative abundances of Halorubrum, Haloarcula, Halonotius, Halobaculum and Salinibacter-related sequences correlated negatively with Haloquadratum and these same ionic factors. Nanohaloarchaea and Halorhabdus-related sequence abundances were inversely correlated with each other, but not other taxonomic groups. These data, along with predicted gene functions from nearly-complete assembled population metagenomes, suggest different ecological phenotypes for Nanohaloarchaea and Halorhabdus-related strains versus other community members. Nucleotide percent G+C compositions were consistently lower in community metagenomic reads from summer versus winter samples. The same seasonal G+C trends were observed within taxonomically binned read subsets from each of seven different genus-level archaeal groups. Relative seasonal abundances were also linked to percent G+C for assembled population genomes. Together, these data suggest that extreme ionic conditions may exert selective pressure on archaeal populations at the level of genomic nucleotide composition, thus contributing to seasonal successional processes. Despite the unavailability of cultured representatives for most of the organisms identified in this study, effective coordination of physical and biological measurements has enabled discovery and quantification of unexpected taxon-specific, environmentally mediated factors influencing microbial community structure.					; Heidelberg, Karla/L-2096-2017; Ugalde, Juan/E-7070-2010; Ugalde, Juan/GLV-2034-2022	Heidelberg, Karla/0000-0002-2645-8269; Banfield, Jill/0000-0001-8203-8771; Emerson, Joanne/0000-0001-9983-5566; Welch, Susan/0000-0002-2890-0065; Ugalde, Juan/0000-0001-6638-0817; 													1751-7362	1751-7370				MAY	2014	8	5					979	990		10.1038/ismej.2013.221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2013.221								24335829					WOS:000334912000003

The patterns were evaluated in the context of water quality goals for T and T-n for reservoir withdrawal and potential benefits of specified management alternatives. Exceedences of a proposed withdrawal T goal of 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F) and a conservative representation of the T-n goal of 15 NTU were demonstrated. The exceedences occurred in late summer during intervals of extensive drawdown for T and irregularly following runoff events for T-n. Conspicuous increases in T-n in the tributary and lacustrine portions of the reservoir were demonstrated in response to all monitored runoff events (n = 34). Lacustrine levels exceeded 75 NTU following several major events. The turbidity load from the tributary usually enters the reservoir as a turbid density current during runoff events, at a depth predicted well by stream temperature. The high frequency and vertical resolution attributes of the robotic monitoring (2 profiles per day for reservoir deployments) were invaluable in resolving impacts because these were usually attenuated within a week following events. The diminishment of reservoir T-n levels following events was demonstrated to be well represented by a first-order loss rate. The loss rate for the largest runoff event of the study (return interval similar to 25 y) was more than an order of magnitude lower than any other, indicating a difference in settling attributes of turbidity-causing particles for this extreme case. Benefits from a shift to delayed withdrawals for the existing intake, or installation of a multi-level intake facility, for improving status with respect to the water quality goals are suggested from the monitoring data. However, continuously meeting the Tn goals for particularly severe events may not be feasible through these approaches.

The molar C/N ratio and stable C isotope were used to identify the source of the organic matter as well as climate conditions. The evolution of Lake Wuxu was summarized wihtin two periods. During the first period (early to mid-Holocene), the lake received increased fluvially transported materials, reflecting variation in the summer monsoon with solar insolation. The lake level declined and water residence time increased because of reduced river discharge during the second period (late Holocene) corresponding to a weakening of the summer monsoon. The organic material revealed a major contribution from lake primary productivity, which showed identical patterns with a high-resolution isotope record from Dongge Cave, as well as total solar irradiance. Our record from Lake Wuxu indicates that the Holocene evolution of the Indian Summer Monsoon has been driven by the solar forcing at decadal/centennial to millennial time scales. Furthermore, an abrupt decline in the monsoon was detected at around 4.0 cal ka bp, which is probably caused by an increased frequency of EI Nino-Southern Oscillation events.					; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016; sun, weiwei/GQA-5041-2022	Wang, Yongbo/0000-0002-5350-1867; Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; 													0267-8179	1099-1417				AUG	2019	34	6					463	474		10.1002/jqs.3113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3113		JUL 2019											WOS:000479370600001

Fish biologists previously only knew San Francisco Estuary white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) to spawn in the Sacramento River, California. We assessed potential white sturgeon spawning locations by deploying artificial substrate samplers during late winter and spring of 2011 and 2012 from river kilometers 115.2 to 145.3 of the San Joaquin River. Collections of fertilized eggs, coupled with hydrology data, confirm that white sturgeon spawned within one and four sites in the San Joaquin River during wet (2011; n = 23) and dry (2012; n = 65) water-year conditions. Small pulse flow augmentations intended to benefit juvenile salmonids appear to have triggered white sturgeon spawning within this system.

Daily air temperatures from 1991 to 2010 indicated that onset of the Microcystis growing season has advanced by approximately 20days over the last two decades, and accumulated air temperature (from 1 March to 31 May) has increased significantly. Since 2005, Microcystis blooms have begun in May more frequently than in June. An increase in degree days for growth indicated that the early warming trend in spring would have benefitted Microcystis populations that overwintered on the sediment surface, by allowing them to grow, gain buoyancy and float into water column earlier in the year. Results of canonical correspondence analysis showed that both water quality (i.e. nutrient loading) and water temperature have affected phytoplankton community succession in spring over the past two decades. When nutrient concentrations are adequate to support Microcystis blooms, rising temperature promotes their earlier onset and proliferation, a phenomenon previously documented for temperate regions, and now demonstrated for this subtropical lake.

In this study, pollen-based quantitative reconstructions of the precipitation for Dajiuhu area since the late glacial period were produced by two appropriate approaches: Weighted Averaged Partial Least Squares (WAPLS) and Locally-Weighted Weighted-Averaging (LWWA). After numerical analysis, a modern pollen training set with a radius of 1000 km around the Dajiuhu Lake was established and two precipitation variables were selected for reconstruction. Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Summer Precipitation (MSP) reconstructed based on the two approaches had relatively high consistency (though the reconstructed value of LWWA is lower than that of WAPLS): (1) in the period of 16.0 ipitation was 10% lower than the mean value for the Holocene; (2) in the period of 10.0 cal ka BP - 7.0 cal ka BP, the precipitation reached an optima of the Holocene; (3) in the period of 7.0 cal ka BP - 4.0 cal ka BP, the precipitation was considerably lower than the mean of the Holocene; (4) in the period of 4.0 cal ka BP - present day, the precipitation fluctuated relatively drastically around the average line of the Holocene. The results indicated that the maximum intensity of the EASM in the data-covering period of the past similar to 16,000 years occurred in the early and middle Holocene, specifically from similar to 10.0 cal ka BP to similar to 7.0 cal ka BP. On the whole, our quantitative reconstruction results were highly coincident with the other proxy-based reconstructions of the changes in the East Asian monsoon. In the early and middle Holocene period when the monsoon was the strongest, synchronous changes in precipitation promoted regional expansion of mixed coniferous forests and broad-leaved forests. We preliminarily conclude that the periodic seasonal variation of longitudinal solar radiation gradient in summer at the low latitudes of the northern and southern hemispheres was the main controlling factor for precipitation in this region.					; Cao, Xianyong/L-7168-2019	Zhao, Lin/0000-0002-6496-0241; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				JUN 30	2019	521						175	184		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.05.033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.05.033													WOS:000483364800020

Water Dynamics and Morphometric Parameters of Lake Sevan (Armenia) in the Summer-Autumn Period According to Satellite Data	REMOTE SENSING												Here, we explore the dynamics of the waters of eutrophicated Lake Sevan in the modern period, using MSI Sentinel-2 satellite images of different months in different years (2017-2022) and SAR Sentinel-1 images of similar dates. The main objective of the study is to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of the horizontal circulation of this lake and to establish whether the scheme of cyclonic water circulation in the deep-water part of Large Sevan, given in a number of publications, which does not imply water exchange between its littoral and deep-water zones, corresponds to the real picture of currents in the surface layer of the lake in the summer-autumn period (period of pronounced water stratification and intense phytoplankton bloom). The analysis performed convincingly showed that there is no constant cyclonic gyre on the scale of the deep-water part of Large Sevan (approximate to 20 km) during the period under consideration. In most cases, non-stationary eddy dynamics are observed in Large Sevan, including mesoscale and submesoscale eddies, eddy dipoles (mushroom-shaped flows), and their packings. Often the entire deep-water part of Large Sevan is occupied by a two-cell (dipole) or even three-cell (cyclonic eddy with two anticyclones of similar size) water circulation. The time scale of the observed variability is several days. Such variable water circulation in different months (i.e., with different density stratification of water) of different years in a basin with a fairly homogeneous bottom and a slight indentation of the shoreline raises the assumption that the main reason for the non-stationary dynamics in Large Sevan is the variability of the wind effect on its surface layer. The cyclonic gyre in Small Sevan (8-9 km) is a permanent element of the circulation and maintains its position north of the strait between Small and Large Sevan. This gyre and attached anticyclonic eddies in the southern part of its periphery, as well as cyclonic submesoscale eddies in the northern part of Large Sevan, close to the strait, affect the water exchange between Small and Large Sevan in both directions. An additional objective of the study is a validation of the morphometric parameters of Lake Sevan (level, surface area, and water volume), contained in the near-real time HYDROWEB database, LEGOS, France (June 1995-January 2024), based on their comparison with the corresponding values of these parameters from gauging stations in Armenia. It is shown that, with a qualitative correspondence of the nature of lake level changes according to altimetric and instrumental measurements, its values in the HYDROWEB database exceed the data of gauging stations in most cases by 1-1.5 m in 1995-2012 and 0.5-0.6 m in 2013-2022, while the corresponding surface area and volume values according to HYDROWEB data turn out to be underestimated.

J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			GROWTH, SIZE, BIOMASS AND PRODUCTION IN CONTRASTING POPULATIONS OF TROUT SALMO-TRUTTA IN 2 LAKE DISTRICT STREAMS	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												(1) Resident brown trout Salmo trutta L. in Wilfin Beck were smaller than migratory trout (progeny of ''sea trout'') of similar age in Black Brows Beck. This investigation seeks an explanation for the size difference and examines its effect on biomass and production. (2) Mean sizes and growth rates for different life stages varied considerably between year-classes in both populations; they were not density-dependent. Water temperature and fry weight were the chief factors affecting growth in the first 3 years of the life cycle in Wilfin Beck and all the freshwater phase in Black Brows Beck. Food was not a limiting factor, except for the first autumn-spring period of the life cycle and for adults over 3 years old in wilfin Beck. (3) Variation in individual size (measured by C.V.) was not stable, but was inversely density-dependent in Black Brows Beck and decreased with age in Wilfin Beck, the latter relationship suggesting a greater intensity of natural (stabilizing) selection in Wilfin Beck. (4) Fish bomass at the end of the summer in Wilfin Beck (mean for 1966-72, 7.9 g m-2) was c. 60% that in Black Brows Beck (mean for 1967-83, 13.0 g ml-2) but annual production in Wilfen Beck mean (6.1 g m-2) was only 0.25% that in Black Brows Beck (mean 24.4 g m-2). Migratory behaviour, a major genotypic difference between the populations, ensured that larger trout did not remain to use resources such as food and space in Black Brows Beck, whereas these older trout remained in Wilfin Beck, forming a major part of the biomass whilst contributing little to annual production. (5) Agreement with a growth model indicated no genotypic differences in growth rates between the two populations. Smaller fry size at the start of the growth period, not lack of food, was chiefly responsible for the smaller trout in Wilfin Beck. The larger fry size in Black Brows Beck was related directly to egg weight which, in turn, was related to the larger fry size in Black Brows Beck was related directly to egg weight which, in turn, was related to the larger spawning females and to a higher proportion of the female''s resources being invested in egg production (30-37% of female''s total energy content in Black Brows Beck, 16-17% in Wilfin Beck). Some genotypic differences were therefore responsible for fry size and hence size differences between the two populations.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				FEB	1988	57	1					49	60		10.2307/4762	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4762													WOS:A1988L844000004

Shifting balance of thermokarst lake ice regimes across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The balance of thermokarst lakes with bedfast-and floating-ice regimes across Arctic lowlands regulates heat storage, permafrost thaw, winter-water supply, and over-wintering aquatic habitat. Using a time-series of late-winter synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to distinguish lake ice regimes in two regions of the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska from 2003-2011, we found that 18% of the lakes had intermittent ice regimes, varying between bedfastice and floating-ice conditions. Comparing this dataset with a radar-based lake classification from 1980 showed that 16% of the bedfast-ice lakes had shifted to floating-ice regimes. A simulated lake ice thinning trend of 1.5 cm/yr since 1978 is believed to be the primary factor driving this form of lake change. The most profound impacts of this regime shift in Arctic lakes may be an increase in the landscape-scale thermal offset created by additional lake heat storage and its role in talik development in otherwise continuous permafrost as well as increases in over-winter aquatic habitat and winter-water supply.

Due to pollution of the Krakow-Czestochowska upland aquifers, the chemical composition of spring waters in the area is anthropogenically modified, and far from the natural state. In order to generate a baseline diatom flora for springs, a paleolimnological study was applied as one of the best recognized and applied methods used to track long-term environmental changes worldwide. Little is known, however, about the direction and nature of such changes in aquatic environments fed by springs. The present article focuses on shifts in diatom assemblages preserved in sediments collected from a small pond, situated close to several spring outlets. They were interpreted as a record of environmental changes that had taken place during the last century. For most of the history of the pond-as recorded in this 84 cm long core-the diatom assemblage was dominated by small Fragilaria spp. The major shifts in species composition began in a core depth of 65 em with a decline in Fragilaria construens var. venter (Ehrenberg) Grunow and Fragilaria pinnata Ehrenberg complexes, and a concurrent increase in Achnanthidium. minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki. The second change was recorded at the depth of 45 cm with a sharp decline of A. minutissimum, which again was replaced by the small Fragilaria spp. In recent years, further changes in the diatom assemblage occurred, with a notable increase in Cyclotella delicatula Hustedt. The assemblage shifts recorded at this site appear to be consistent with environmental changes triggered by land use (e.g. agriculture intensity) and/or possible changes in spring water discharge.					; Wojtal, Agata/J-2829-2012	Witkowski, Andrzej/0000-0003-1714-218X; 													0167-8418		978-90-481-3386-4				2009	208						267	277		10.1007/978-90-481-3387-1_16	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-3387-1_16													WOS:000271240700016

We observed that the mortality of juveniles and adults did not increase with increasing pH in the range pH 9.0-10.5, which agrees with what is generally reported in the literature for cladoceran zooplankton and suggests that the threshold value for mortality is between pH 10.5 and 11.5. However, both egg mortality and the proportion of stillborn neonates increased at pH 10.0 and above, and the two clones differed in their sensitivities to pH. Consequently, pH already affects population growth rate markedly from pH 10.0 onward. Because pH values greater than or equal to 10.0 are common during spring and summer in many eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes due to intense photosynthetic activity, we expect that high pH has a much larger effect on the population structure of Daphnia and the community composition of microcrustacean zooplankton in such water bodies than was assumed previously.

Community composition of aquatic birds in lakes of Bangalore, India	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Observations were made on the occurrence, abundance, richness, and diversity of waterbirds in 15 major lakes in Bangalore city during 2008 - 2009. During the study period 35 species of aquatic birds were recorded. The number of aquatic bird species recorded at various lakes ranged from 23 to 35. The percent abundance of waterbirds recorded in the study lakes ranged from 2.46 to 21.49 and it was significantly different (p<0.05). The diversity and species evenness of waterbirds in the lakes ranged from 2.07 to 3.16 and 0.32 to 0.76, respectively. There was a significant difference (p<0.05) in the diversity and species evenness of waterbirds among different lakes. Species richness of the bird population ranged from 2.89 to 4.01 in the different study lakes and it was not significantly different (p>0.05). There was a variation in number of waterbird species recorded during summer, monsoon and winter seasons. Of the 35 waterbird species, Bubulcus ibis showed cent percent frequency, whereas less frequently (4.44%) observed species was Anas platyrhynchos. Among various waterbird species, Bubulcus ibis, Fulica atra, Tringa hypoleucos, Motacilla maderaspatensis, Phalacrocorax niger, Egretta garzetta, Charadrius dubius, Ardeola grayji, Halcyon smyrnensis and Motacilla alba were frequently encountered in most of the study lakes.

A 2-4 Ma period in the early Eocene was particularly influenced by substantial surface-water freshening, indicated by a 3-4 parts per thousand reduction of delta O-18 values. The magnitude of the delta O-18 decrease indicates a depletion in O-18 of surface waters by 2-3 parts per thousand relative to Eocene mean ocean water. This value is lower than that of coeval lakes reconstructed from freshwater gastropod delta O-18 values from the Paris Basin, suggesting that large rivers with high-latitude catchment areas drained into the North Sea. The period of surface-water freshening began close to the Palaeocene - Eocene thermal maximum, when relative sea-level fall, tectonic uplift and basaltic volcanism caused a temporary isolation of the North Sea. North Atlantic and North Sea surface waters became reconnected during a series of early Eocene transgressions.

Distinct and regular seasonal trends were observed in soil moisture and in streamflow: an important peak occurred in the spring during the rise of snowmelt while a lower peak was observed in the fall, where precipitation was more abundant and tree transpiration reduced. The lowest soil moisture values were observed from January to April, when infiltration was negligible. Monthly hydrologic fluxes and soil temperatures at different depths were simulated for the watershed using the FORHYM2 hydrologic model. Simulated monthly values of throughfall, snowpack height, soil and subsoil water contents, lake outlet streamflow, and soil temperature were generally in good agreement with observed values in terms of temporal synchronicity and magnitude. From 1989 to 1994, absolute mean monthly differences between observed and simulated values ranged from 1 (soil water and subsoil water contents) to 8% for streamflow. This is the first study confirming the ability of FORHYM2 to adequately simulate monthly soil and subsoil water contents for complete years over a relatively long period of time.

Continuous investigations of the population dynamics of Arctic charr at this lake have involved gill netting since 1939, collection of fishery catch-per-unit-effort data since 1966, and hydroacoustic surveys since 1990. Analysis of these and associated long-term data on the abiotic environment and other components of the fish communities revealed recently contrasting fortunes of the Arctic charr populations of the north and south basins, the latter of which has been significantly impacted by eutrophication while both basins have shown elevated water temperatures and increasing roach, Rutilus rutilus, populations. Despite the introduction of phosphate stripping in 1992 and some subsequent initial improvement, the hypolimnion of the south basin still remains significantly eutrophicated and the fishery catch-per-unit-effort in this basin is now at record low levels. In addition, the spatial distribution of roach has expanded to form significant components of the fish communities of inshore and offshore surface habitats, where this cyprinid may compete with Arctic charr for zooplanktonic prey. It is concluded that the Arctic charr populations of Windermere, particularly those of the south basin, currently face a number of significant environmental pressures and continued management action is required to ensure their survival.

Sexual maturation in stream residents from migratory populations of brook trout inhabiting Lake Superior tributaries	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												There is mounting evidence that populations of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) inhabiting bays and tributaries along the north shore of Lake Superior exhibit partial migration. In this system some fish originate in tributaries and move into the lake for much of the year, grow large and migrate back into tributaries to spawn, whilst other smaller fish reside in tributaries and grow slowly. This study determined whether the stream dwelling brook trout reach sexual maturity in the stream habitats, a criterion needed to distinguish partial migration from other forms of migration that could maintain divergent forms and life histories of brook trout. Maturational development was determined for fish collected in July and August. Sampling these populations during fall spawning was not permitted due to conservation concerns. Male and females sampled from tributaries displayed delta C-13 signatures and growth histories characteristic of stream residency. Assessment of maturational development suggested that 33% of females would have been expected to spawn in the fall of that year. Our findings demonstrate that a portion of fish residing in tributaries reach sexual maturity without adopting summer residency in the lake providing evidence for partial migration over other forms of migration. Improved understanding of the variation in migratory behaviour in these brook trout populations will contribute to their conservation and management in the face of lake-wide declines of the migrant fish.

Effect of agriculture and presence of American beaver Castor canadensis on winter biodiversity of mammals	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												Several metrics of biodiversity are used to assess the variability and abundance of multiple species across various ecological levels. Previous research suggests that biodiversity in agricultural areas is diminished due to habitat fragmentation and alterations to natural vegetation. Contrary to the effects of agriculture, the American beaver Castor canadensis has been shown to have a significant contribution to increased biodiversity. Our study focuses on the biodiversity of mammals in wetland areas of the southern mixed-wood boreal forest natural region of east-central Alberta, Canada. We compared various measures of biodiversity levels of mammals in the winter months between wetlands on agricultural land and wetlands in Miquelon Lake Provincial Park (MLPP). Similarly, we compared wetlands with active and inactive beaver colonies to determine differences in winter biodiversity of mammals and the amount of water coverage within a pond. We collected data using winter tracking surveys and analyzed the data using geographic information systems (GIS) techniques. We found that winter biodiversity of mammals was higher at the sites within the protected area (MLPP) than at those on agricultural lands. However, our data also suggest that forested areas surrounding agricultural wetlands may play an important role in maintaining biodiversity within agricultural areas. The presence of beavers alone was not a significant factor in relation to winter biodiversity, but the presence of the species was important for maintaining water levels of agricultural wetlands, which in turn plays a role in resource heterogeneity.

Inundating contrasting boreal forest soils: CO2 and CH4 production rates	ECOSCIENCE												Flooding boreal forest ecosystems for hydroelectric power generation may release substantial amounts of carbon (C) to the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. The objectives of this study were to evaluate CO2 and CH4 production rates using spring/fall (14 degrees C) and summer (21 degrees C) temperatures under non-flooded and flooded conditions. Incubation temperatures represented the mean annual air temperature in May and September (14 degrees C), and in July (21 degrees C). Greenhouse gas production rates were quantified using laboratory incubations of 2 contrasting soil types (Humo-Ferric Podzol [very dry, mineral] and a Histic Folisol [moist, organic]) collected at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada. The mean production rate of CO2 and CH4 in the headspace of the incubation jars was significantly influenced by temperature, flooding and soil type. Results showed that the mean CO2 (65 [Podzol]; 43 [Folisol]) and CH4 (0.06 [Podzol]; 0.06 [Folisol]) production rates (mu g.g(-1).d(-1)) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) at 21 degrees C and in flooded treatments from both soil types. The greatest CO2 and CH4 production rates (mu g.g(-1).d(-1)) occurred from the Folisol (110 [CO2]; 0.03 [CH4]) and the L and FH horizons of the Podzol (250 [CO2]; 0.05 [CH4]). Q(10) values showed that decomposition of soil organic matter was more temperature dependent in non-flooded treatments, with values ranging from 1.57 to 5.03, than in flooded treatments (1.31 to 3.58). The greatest loss of soil organic carbon relative to the original C content (g.m(-2)) occurred in the Ah horizon of the Podzol in non-flooded (0.01% [14 degrees C]; 0.02% [21 degrees C]) and flooded (0.02% [14 degrees C]; 0.03% [21 degrees C]) treatments and at both temperatures. Information presented in this paper helps to evaluate how 2 contrasting soil types (Podzol and Folisol) responded to flooding and provided further insight into the dynamics of greenhouse gas (GHG) production rates as a result of hydroelectric reservoir creation. This will aid in future planning, construction, and management of hydroelectric reservoirs to help minimize GHG emissions and boreal forest disturbance.

There were four treatments including: (1) conventional tillage (CT, basal fertilization without mulch), (2) conventional tillage with straw mulching (CTS), (3) optimized fertilization (OPF, split applications) and (4) no-tillage with straw mulching plus optimized fertilization (NTS + OPF). Results showed that CTS and NTS + OPF exhibited significant reduction of seasonal runoff and soil losses compared with CT (P < 0.05). OPF decreased runoff by 6-10 and soil loss by 9-27 % in the various years, but differences were not always statistically significant. Interestingly, winter wheat and rapeseed yields were on average higher in the conservation tillage and optimized fertilization treatment than in the CT treatment. Compared with CT, CTS reduced N losses by 14-25 %, OPF by 12-21 % and NTS + OPF 20-28 %. Similarly, CTS reduced P losses by 20-32 %, OPF by 11-21 % and NTS + OPF by 23-30 %. NTS + OPF was the most effective treatment for reducing nutrient losses. The reduction of runoff volume was mainly responsible for the decreased nutrient losses. Our findings indicates that conservation tillage and optimized fertilization may reduce N and P losses via runoff while maintaining or enhancing crop yields during the winter-crop growing seasons in the Chaohu Lake region.																			1385-1314	1573-0867				JAN	2015	101	1					93	106		10.1007/s10705-014-9664-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-014-9664-3													WOS:000347287800006
J	Lürig, MD; Best, RJ; Dakos, V; Matthews, B				Lurig, Moritz D.; Best, Rebecca J.; Dakos, Vasilis; Matthews, Blake			Submerged macrophytes affect the temporal variability of aquatic ecosystems	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Submerged macrophytes are important foundation species that can strongly influence the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, but only little is known about the temporal variation and the timescales of these effects (i.e. from hourly, daily, to monthly). Here, we conducted an outdoor experiment in replicated mesocosms (1,000 L) where we manipulated the presence and absence of macrophytes to investigate the temporal variability of their ecosystem effects. We measured several parameters (chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, dissolved organic matter [DOM], and oxygen) with high-resolution sensors (15-min intervals) over several months (94 days from spring to autumn), and modelled metabolic rates of each replicate ecosystem in a Bayesian framework. We also implemented a simple model to explore competitive interactions between phytoplankton and macrophytes as a driver of variability in chlorophyll-a. Over the entire experiment, macrophytes had a positive effect on mean DOM concentration, a negative effect on phytoplankton biomass, and either a weak or no effect on mean metabolic rates, DOM composition, and conductivity. We also found that macrophytes increased the variance of dissolved organic carbon composition and metabolic rates, and, occasionally in the observed period, increased the variance of phytoplankton biomass and conductivity. The observation that macrophytes decreased the mean but increased the variance of phytoplankton biomass was consistent with the model that we implemented. Our high-resolution time series embedded within a manipulative experiment reveal how a foundation species can affect ecosystem properties and processes that have characteristically different timescales of response to environmental variation. Specifically, our results show how macrophytes can affect short-term dynamics of algal biomass, while also affecting the seasonal build-up of DOM and the variance of ecosystem metabolism.

J	Kownacka, J; Calkiewicz, J; Kornijów, R				Kownacka, Janina; Calkiewicz, Joanna; Kornijow, Ryszard			A turning point in the development of phytoplankton in the Vistula Lagoon (southern Baltic Sea) at the beginning of the 21st century	OCEANOLOGIA												Phytoplankton community structure was studied from 2002 to 2016 in the Vistula Lagoon (southern Baltic Sea) in the context of the 2010 shift in its population, as well as the reason for this shift and its environmental impact. This evident shift was indicated by Multidimensional Scaling at the Bray Curtis similarity level of 31%. Before 2010, the primary components of phytoplankton were Cyanobacteria (up to 98% of the biomass, October 2007) and Chlorophyta (40%, July 2002). After 2010, the contribution of Cyanobacteria considerably decreased, and the proportions of other phyla increased. The total phytoplankton biomass positively correlated with phosphorus, and Cyanobacteria biomass with silica. Evident changes were also observed in the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton. Before 2010, the highest values of biomass occurred in autumn, and were related to high biomass of Cyanobacteria. Higher biomass has been recently reached in spring, during the dominance of Ochrophyta associated with Chlorophyta, Charophyta, and Cryptophyta. Generalised additive models showed a significant decreasing trend of the total phytoplankton biomass, Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, and flagellates, suggesting a decrease in eutrophication. This trend is concurrent with a considerable increase in the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass since 2010. The increased ratio, however, did not result from elevated zooplankton biomass, but from the drop in phytoplankton biomass. Therefore, the most probable reason for the decrease in phytoplankton biomass was the simultaneous decrease in the concentration of all nutrients. The potential additional impact of filtration by a new alien bivalve Rangia cuneata G. B. Sowerby I, 1832 is also discussed. (C) 2020 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

High Methane Emissions from a Midlatitude Reservoir Draining an Agricultural Watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Reservoirs are a globally significant source of methane (CH4), although most measurements have been made in tropical and boreal systems draining undeveloped watersheds. To assess the magnitude of CH4 emissions from reservoirs in midlatitude agricultural regions, we measured CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates from William H. Harsha Lake (Ohio, U.S.A.), an agricultural impacted reservoir, over a 13 month period. The reservoir was a strong source of CH4 throughout the year, emitting on average 176 +/- 36 mg C m(-2) d(-1), the highest reservoir CH4 emissions profile documented in the United States to date. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the largest CH4 emissions were during summer stratified conditions, not during fall turnover. The river-reservoir transition zone emitted CH4 at rates an order of magnitude higher than the rest of the reservoir, and total carbon emissions (i.e., CH4 + CO2) were also greater at the transition zone, indicating that the river delta supported greater carbon mineralization rates than elsewhere. Midlatitude agricultural impacted reservoirs may be a larger source of CH4 to the atmosphere than currently recognized, particularly if river deltas are consistent CH4 hot spots. We estimate that CH4 emissions from agricultural reservoirs could be a significant component of anthropogenic CH4 emissions in the U.S.A.

J	Patten, JM; Smith, SR; O'Brien, JJ				Patten, JM; Smith, SR; O'Brien, JJ			Impacts of ENSO on snowfall frequencies in the United States	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Changes in the frequency of occurrence of snowfall during El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are presented for the continental United States. This study is motivated by the need to improve winter climate forecasts for government agencies (i.e., U.S. Department of Transportation and Department of Energy) and winter entertainment facilities and the need for climatological studies. Daily snowfall data from 442 stations in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network are utilized. Selected stations each have more than 20 yr with 15 or more snowfall events per year during a 97-yr (1900-97) period of study. Three categories are created for each ENSO phase, based on the magnitude of daily snowfall amounts (in millimeters)-light: (0-50.8], moderate: (50.8-152.4], and heavy: (152.4-304.8]. Differences between neutral and cold or warm ENSO winters are created to show regions with increased or decreased occurrences in each snowfall category. Statistical tests are applied at each station to provide confidence levels for the identified changes in snowfall frequency. Simple field significance tests are completed for regions that show coherent ENSO signals. Results reveal several regions with significant changes in the frequency of occurrence of snowfall between neutral and cold or warm ENSO phases. For example, the Pacific Northwest has increased (decreased) occurrences of light, moderate, and heavy snowfalls during the cold- (warm-) phase ENSO winter, with the exception of light snows during the warm phase. Other regions with significant changes include the northern and eastern Great Lakes, the Northeast Corridor, and New England. The results may allow government agencies and private companies to mitigate adverse impacts of winter storms based on predictions of upcoming ENSO phases. Winter entertainment facilities, such as ski resorts, may actually benefit from these results. Combined with other winter-precipitation studies and the ever-improving ability to forecast each ENSO phase, this analysis of snow-event frequencies should aid in preparation for winter storms.

We collected fishes front five sections of Buncombe Creek (a tributary to Lake Texoma, Oklahoma-Texas) in each season of 1995, and compared assemblages in each section among seasons. We also compared assemblages in each section pooled over all seasons to the assemblage present in 1954-1955. We used measures of persistence (species composition, Jaccard's Index), stability (relative abundance, Percent Similarity Index), and Detrended Correspondence Analysis to compare assemblages within 1995 and between the two surveys. There was little change in assemblages throughout 1995, with high stability in the most upstream section. The most change occurred between spring and summer. We collected 31 of the 47 species caught in 1954-1955, plus five additional species. The assemblage in the most upstream section of the creek showed the least persistence and the least stability between the two surveys. Longitudinal differences in fish assemblages of the creek were more pronounced in 1954-1955 than 1995. We discuss the possible role of isolation of Buncombe Creek from the free-flowing portion of the Red River in the extirpation of Notropis buchanani, Labidesthes sicculus, and Fundulus zebrinus.					; Schaefer, Jacob/LYO-8595-2024	Schaefer, Jacob/0000-0002-3189-8525; 													0038-4909					SEP	2000	45	3					274	288		10.2307/3672830	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3672830													WOS:000089747200005

An Abnormally Early End of Hibernation of the European Fire-Bellied Toad (Bombina bombina) (Discoglossidae, Anura) in the Populations of the Medveditsa River Valley (Saratov Oblast)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												During the long-term studies of the phenology of anuran amphibian spawning migrations, which started in the Medveditsa River Valley (near the village of Uritskoe, Lysogorskii district, Saratov oblast, Russia) in 2009, an abnormally early end of the wintering period was recorded for the European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) in the spring of 2020, on March 13. In comparison to the average date of occurrence of this species at its spawning grounds (April 18), the abnormality accounts for more than a month. The water temperature in the shallow waters of the spawning reservoir on this day was 10.2 degrees C at a depth of 0.1 m, and 4.8 degrees C at a depth of 0.5 m, and did not differ significantly from the average values typical for this phase of the B. bombina annual cycle in adjacent populations. The possible significance of this abnormality for the reproduction of local populations of B. bombina is discussed.

Dynamics of auto- and heterotrophic picoplankton and associated viruses in Lake Geneva	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Microbial dynamics have rarely been investigated in Lake Geneva, known as the largest lake in western Europe. From a 5-month survey, we report dynamic patterns of free-living virus, bacteria and small phytoplankton abundances in response to a variety of environmental parameters. For the first time, we fractionated the primary production to separate the contribution of different size-related biological compartments and measured both bacterial and viral production in addition to experiments conducted to quantify the virus-induced bacterial mortality. We observed marked seasonal and vertical variations in picocyanobacteria, bacteria and virus abundances and production. The contribution of picoplankton and nanoplankton production to the total primary production was high (reaching up to 76% of total primary production) in November and the spring-summer transition period, respectively. The impact of viral lysis on both bacteria and picocyanobacteria was significantly higher than grazing activities. Virus-induced picocyanobacterial mortality reached up to 66% of cell removal compared to virus induced (heterotrophic) bacterial mortality, which reached a maximum of 34% in July. Statistical analyzes revealed that temperature and top-down control by viruses are among important factors regulating the picocyanobacterial dynamics in this lake. More generally speaking, our results add to the growing evidence and accepted view nowadays that viruses are an important actor of freshwater microbial dynamics and more globally of the functioning of the microbial food webs.

Generalized negative binomial distribution:: a promising statistical distribution for Oncomelania hupensis in the lake- and marsh-land regions of China	ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY												A new generalization of the negative binomial distribution (GNBD) is introduced and fitted to counts of Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum, made, in areas of Chinese lakeland and marshland, early in the winter of 2005 and late in the spring of 2006. The GNBD was found to fit the snail data better than the standard negative binomial distribution (NBD) that has previously been widely used to model the distribution of O. hupensis. With two more parameters than the NBD, the GNBD can integrate many discrete distributions and is more flexible than the NBD in modelling O. hupensis. It also provides a better theoretical distribution for the quantitative study of O. hupensis, especially in building an accurate prediction model of snail density. The justification for adopting the GNBD is discussed. The GNBD allows researchers to broaden the field in the quantitative study not only of O. hupensis and schistosomiasis japonica but also of other environment-related helminthiases and family-clustered diseases that have, traditionally, been modelled using the NBD.					; ONG, Seng Huat/B-9454-2010; Jiang, Wei/AAD-4758-2020	Jiang, Qingwu/0000-0001-8921-3317; zhang, zhijie/0000-0002-1276-787X; Ong, Seng Huat/0000-0002-4288-7637													0003-4983	1364-8594				SEP	2008	102	6					541	552		10.1179/136485908X311830	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/136485908X311830								18782493					WOS:000259611800008
J	LANDAU, R				LANDAU, R			GROWTH AND POPULATION STUDIES ON TILAPIA-GALILAEA IN LAKE KINNERET	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Between 1967-1977, catches of T. galilaea in Lake Kinneret [Israel] fell from an annual average of about 200 tons to a low of 70 tons in 1974, and then returned to their former level. Total yearly mortality was estimated at 1.84 between 1970-1976. Assuming a natural mortality of 0.94, total stock size averaged 300-700 tons in that period, while recruitment averaged < 0.7-3 million/yr. Broods [3] hatched in years of relatively high water levels (1970, 1971 and 1972) yielded especially low recruitment. The Von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (K) was estimated at 0.67, and final length (L.infin.) at 25-36 cm total length. First year growth, 23-152 mm, was closely related to final length, which appeared to be affected by genetic variation in the population. Yearly fluctuations in size distribution were attributed to changes in the proportions of fast- and slow-growers, and in the abundance of year-classes. Recruitment to the fisher, at 17-20 cm, occurred between ages 1+ and 3+. The highest growth rates for age-1 T. galilaea, 1-2% mean wt/per day, occurred in April and May, the Peridinium season. Only a small proportion of age-1 fish reached marketable size by July, when their food supply began to diminish. During the autumn months, there was hardly any length increment, and all T. galilaea became lean, especially the age-0 group. Recruitment of stocked fish could possibly be increased by introduction in Dec. and by use of fingerlings which are potentially able to grow to marketable size in less than 2 seasons.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	1					23	32		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01483.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01483.x													WOS:A1979GK32100003
J	He, WY; Chen, HP; Ma, JH				He, Wenyu; Chen, Huopo; Ma, Jiehua			Variations in Summer Extreme Hot-Humid Events over Eastern China and the Possible Associated Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study aimed to explore the changing characteristics of summer, compound, extreme hot-humid events over eastern China in recent decades and the associated underlying mechanisms. Results showed that the summer extreme hot-humid events over eastern China have tended to increase but with strong interannual variability in recent decades. Fur-ther analyses indicated that the summer sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the northwest Pacific (NW Pacific) and western tropical Pacific, and the May Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies are the key elements that are closely connected to the variations in extreme hot-humid events over eastern China. The positive SST anomalies over the NW Pacific in summer, on the one hand, could strengthen the local circulation patterns that lead to the anomalous anticyclonic cir-culation over eastern China. On the other hand, the positive SST anomalies over the western tropical Pacific excite an anom-aly pattern similar to the Pacific-Japan pattern that weakens the westerly jet and enhances the anticyclone circulation anomalies over the upper level of eastern China. Both of them provide favorable conditions for extreme hot-humid events over eastern China with increased moisture and temperatures. The sensitivity experiments by the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5), with SST forcing yield similar influencing processes to the observations. Additionally, the effect of SIC may be potentially responsible for the hot conditions in extreme hot-humid events over eastern China. The signal of declining May SIC could persist to summer and then influence the SST anomalies to its south, which could also pro-duce a beneficial background for extreme hot-humid events to increase over eastern China by exciting the Rossby wave train propagating southeastward across the Mongolia-Lake Baikal region.

The BKME-exposed fish also exhibited an increased age to maturity, smaller gonads, lower fecundity with age, an absence of secondary sex characteristics in males, and females failed to show an increase in egg size with age. Lower serum estradiol and testosterone concentrations and greater hepatic mixed-function oxidase (MFO) activity, as measured by conversion of diphenyloxazole and benzo[a]pyrene were also observed in the BKME-exposed fish. The level of MFO activity varied with season; differences could not be detected between sites during the spring spawning period, but were markedly elevated (up to ninefold) at the BKME site during the summer. The poorer performance of fish at the BKME site appears to be related to decreased levels of serum steroids and consequent abnormalities in reproductive development and carbohydrate metabolism, although the relationship of the changes in steroid levels with the increased hepatic enzyme activity remains to be established.

To address the debate over whether the Early or Middle Holocene represented the climatic optimum, it is essential to understand long-term vegetation dynamics and climate processes. In this work, by sampling a coastal section near Angulinur Lak. The sedimentary sequence of Angulinur Lake reveals four stages based on vegetation and climate reconstructions. The first stage (13718-11,139 cal. yr BP) was characterized by a desert steppe ecosystem dominated by Artemisia, Poaceae and Chenopodiaceae, the climate was cold-dry. The second stage (11139-8407 cal. yr BP) exhibited a transition to sparse forest-steppe vegetation, with Artemisia, Betula, and Ulmus as dominant taxa, the climate was cold-wet. The third stage (8407-4256 cal. yr BP) was characterized by a broad-leaved forest steppe dominated by Betula and Ulmus, the climate was warm-wet. The fourth stage (4256-2827 cal. yr BP) was marked by sparse forest-steppe dominated by Chenopodiaceae, Betula, and Ulmus, the climate was warm-dry. Pollen records reflect major climatic events, including the Younger Dryas (YD) and ca 8200 cal. yr BP event. Vegetation changes were driven by shifts in temperature and precipitation, while climate variability was closely linked to fluctuations in summer and winter monsoon intensity, modulated by multiple factors. The reconstruction supports the view that the Middle Holocene represented the Holocene Optimum. These findings enhance our understanding of Holocene climate dynamics in semiarid regions and offer insights for predicting future vegetation responses to climate change.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				OCT 1	2025	675								113123	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113123		JUL 2025											WOS:001530395200001

The meteoric origin of the spring waters is deduced from hydrochemical and environmental isotope (O-18, H-2, H-3) studies. The springs have high discharge (Q>100 1/s) and low ion concentrations because of fast circulation along the groundwater flow path in the aquifer.

Idil; Jeppesen, Erik; Beklioglu, Meryem			The influence of water level on macrophyte growth and trophic interactions in eutrophic Mediterranean shallow lakes: a mesocosm experiment with and without fish	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Water-level fluctuations are typical of lakes located in the semi-arid Mediterranean region, which is characterised by warm rainy winters and hot dry summers. Ongoing climate change may exacerbate fluctuations and lead to more severe episodes of drought, so information on the effects of water level on the functioning of lake ecosystems in such regions is crucial. 2. In eutrophic Lake Eymir, Turkey, we conducted a 4-month (summer) field experiment using cylindrical 0.8-m- (low-water-level) and 1.6-m-deep (high-water-level) mesocosms (kept open to the sediment and atmosphere). Fish (tench, Tinca tinca, and bleak, Alburnus escherichii) were added to half of the mesocosms, while the rest were kept fishless. Ten shoots of Potamogeton pectinatus were transplanted to each mesocosm. 3. Sampling for physicochemical variables, chlorophyll a (chl-a), zooplankton and per cent plant volume inhabited (PVI%) by macrophytes was conducted weekly during the first 5 weeks, and subsequently biweekly. Macrophytes were harvested on the last sampling date. During the course of the experiment, the water level decreased by 0.41 +/- 0.06 m. 4. Throughout the experiment, fish affected zooplankton abundance (-), nutrient concentrations (+), chl-a (+) and water clarity (-) most strongly in the low-water-level mesocosms and the zooplankton community shifted towards dominance of small-sized forms. The fishless mesocosms had a higher zooplankton/phytoplankton ratio, suggesting higher grazing. 5. Greatest macrophyte growth was observed in the low-water-level fishless mesocosms. However, despite high nutrient concentrations and low water clarity, macrophytes were also abundant in the fish mesocosms and particularly increased following a water-level decrease from midsummer onwards. Macrophyte growth was poor in the high-water-level mesocosms, even in the fishless ones with high water clarity. This was ascribed to extensive periphyton development reducing light availability for the macrophytes. 6. Our results indicate that a reduction in water level during summer may help maintain the growth of macrophytes in Mediterranean eutrophic shallow lakes, despite a strong negative effect of fish predation on water clarity. It is therefore probable that an expected negative effect of global climate change on water clarity because of eutrophication and enhanced top-down control of fish may be, at least partly, counteracted by reduced water level, provided that physical disturbance is not severe.					bucak, tuba/AAR-6109-2020; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Tavşanoğlu, Ülkü/AGK-9942-2022	Tavsanoglu, Ulku Nihan/0000-0001-8462-415X; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Bucak, Tuba/0000-0002-6710-0423													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2012	57	8					1631	1642		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02825.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02825.x													WOS:000306139300009

Results from more than 3500 water samples are available in a data set that compiles flow data and measurements of various water quality analytes collected between 1972 and 1995 in all seasons and under all flow regimes in Fall Creek and its tributaries. Data is freely accessible at and includes measurements of suspended solids, pH, alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chloride, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), sulphate sulphur (SO4-S), phosphorus (P) fractions molybdate reactive P (MRP) and total dissolved P (TDP), percent P in sediment, and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N). Methods, sub-watershed areas, and coordinates for sampling sites are also included. The work represented in this data set has made important scientific contributions to understanding of hydrological and biogeochemical processes that influence loading in mixed use watersheds and that have an impact on algal productivity in receiving water bodies.

While many of the key factors are well-known and have direct anthropogenic origins, climatic variability and change can also impact water clarity at various temporal scales, but their influence is less often studied. Building upon a recent examination of the univariate relationships between synoptic-scale weather patterns and water clarity, this research utilizes nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX models) to explore the multivariate climate-to-water clarity relationship. Models trained on the observation period (1997-2016) are extrapolated back to 1979 to reconstruct a daily-scale historical water clarity dataset, and used in a reforecast mode to estimate real-time forecast skill. Of the 20 regions examined, models perform best in Lakes Michigan and Huron, especially in spring and summer. The NARX models perform better than a simple persistence model and a seasonal-trend model in nearly all regions, indicating that climate variability is a contributing factor to fluctuations in water clarity. Further, six of the 20 regions also show promise of useful forecasts to at least 1 week of lead-time, with three of those regions showing skill out to two months of lead time.

J	Ali, G; English, C				Ali, Genevieve; English, Carolyn			Phytoplankton blooms in Lake Winnipeg linked to selective water-gatekeeper connectivity	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Lake Winnipeg was coined "Canada's sickest lake" and "the most threatened lake in the World" due to its recurrent algal blooms caused by nutrient-rich water inputs. While conceptual frameworks link bloom occurrence to hydrologic connectivity, data-based validation is lacking. We analyzed 355 multi-year satellite-derived images to quantify phytoplankton biomass in Lake Winnipeg and the timing of runoff activation and hydrologic connectivity in the Lake Winnipeg Watershed. Our analyses reveal that the majority of watershed runoff-producing areas exhibit a strong coupling between runoff activation and hydrologic connectivity: they are proximal to rivers and become hydrologically connected to them multiple times a year. Conversely, a smaller number of runoff-producing areas are located further upslope and connect to rivers much less frequently. The latter act as water gatekeepers by selectively enabling the downstream transfer of runoff from headwater regions. Major blooms in Lake Winnipeg only occur when 50% of the water gatekeepers enable headwater-downstream connectivity during 31.5% (or more) of the spring-fall period. We conclude that an explicit assessment of the timing of runoff activation and hydrologic connectivity serves as a predictor of bloom occurrence and provides new information about the influence of a small number of locations on Lake Winnipeg.

However, there is not enough knowledge about the seasonal changes of the metal distribution properties of aquatic plants. Our study focused on seasonal variation of some heavy metals in relation to their bioaccumulation and translocation in Nuphar lutea, a floating leaved, widespread plant that is important to wildlife. In this study, N. lutea, corresponding sediment and water samples were collected at different seasons from Lake Abant (Turkey) and analysed for their heavy metal content (Pb, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn and Cd). Accumulation and translocation of heavy metal ratios were calculated seasonally. It was found that Cr and Zn were actively transported from sediment to the root, where they accumulated especially in summer; it was also shown that Cu, Mn and Zn were not only taken up from the sediment but also from the surrounding water. The investigations suggested that translocation ratios for leaf/root of Pb, Cr, Mn and Zn reached their highest levels in spring. It was found that the bioaccumulation and translocation of heavy metals at different parts of N. lutea changes with respect to season and the type of heavy metal.

Restoration of the once clear water and aquatic plant communities from the present phytoplankton dominance is sought. (2) In the first two experiments, Alderfen Broad was isolated, by diversion of an inflow stream, without removal of its recently-deposited phosphorus-rich sediments. In the second, sediment was removed from Cockshoot Broad and dams were placed against the effluent-rich river Bure, but the Broad continued to be fed by a small stream draining an agricultural and fen catchment. (3) In four years (1979-82) after isolation of Alderfen Broad, the phytoplankton crop was greatly reduced and the water became clear. Net release of PO4-P from the sediment ceased and the Broad became dominated by Ceratophyllum demersum L. Then, because of the reduction in turbulence of the water column by the plants, and the organic matter supplied to the sediment surface in their decay, the mechanism for release of PO4-P from the sediment was reactivated and, in 1984, supported a large phytoplankton crop in the spring. The aquatic plant population declined. In 1985 there was both spring and summer phytoplankton growth, the latter probably supported by nitrogen-fixation, and the aquatic plant growth was negligible. (4) In Cockshoot Broad a reduction in phytoplankton growth followed soon after isolation and sediment-removal, and the water became very clear and has remained so. Part of the Broad has already recolonized with a diverse collection of aquatic plants. (5) The consequences of these results for the management of the rest of the Broadland waterway are discussed.

Here, we describe a suitable-habitat model for wintering geese in the Poyang lake region of China, based on the Maximum Entropy modeling. The spatiotemporal patterns of suitable habitats produced by the model are analyzed by using species occurrence data from satellite tracking and environmental variables derived from remote sensing data. The results show that the normalized difference vegetation index predictor-representing productivity and food availability-made a considerable contribution to model prediction power, while the contribution from terrain data is relatively low. Nearly one third of the area of the entire floodplain can provide suitable habitats for geese during wintering periods (25.50% for Bean goose Anser fabalis and 29.57% for Greater white fronted goose Anser albifrons). More than forty percent of the suitable habitats are located in the seasonally inundated sub-lakes, indicating that such sub-lakes play an indispensable role in maintaining goose habitats. In the sub-lakes, the area of suitable habitats for geese, per unit area, is 1.67-1.80 times than in the non-sub-lake areas of the floodplain. Therefore, the regulation of the sub-lakes during the dry season has important implications for the management of goose habitats. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Specimens comprising 3,030 duck swab samples and 1,010 environmental samples were collected from 101 duck farms. We isolated AIV of various HA subtypes, including H3, H4, H5, H6, H9, H10, H11, and H12. We sequenced the entire coding sequences of the genomes of 28 representative isolates constituting 13 specific subtypes. When the phylogenetic relationships among these isolates were examined, we observed that extensive reassortment events had occurred. Among the 28 Dongting Lake viruses, 21 genotypes involving the six internal genes were identified. Furthermore, we identified viruses or viral genes introduced from other countries, viral gene segments of unknown origin, and a novel HA/NA combination. Our findings emphasize the importance of farmed domestic ducks in the Dongting Lake region to the genesis and evolution of AIV and highlight the need for continued surveillance of domestic ducks in this region.

Temporal trends of mercury concentrations in Wisconsin walleye (Sander vitreus), 1982-2005	ECOTOXICOLOGY												The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has monitored mercury (Hg) in several species of fish since the early 1970s primarily for fish consumption advisory purposes. We selected skin-on fillets of walleye (Sander vitreus) from inland lakes collected over the years 1982-2005 to assess temporal trends of Hg concentrations. While individual lakes are of interest, sample sizes, and unbalanced collections across fish lengths, seasons, or years prevent estimates of temporal trends of walleye Hg concentrations within most lakes. We evaluated temporal trends over all lakes using mixed effects models (3,024 records from 421 lakes). Relationships between Hg concentrations and a suite of lake chemistry, morphometry, and other variables were also explored. Hg concentrations generally increased with walleye length but the relationship varied among lakes. The best-fitting mixed effects models suggested that the overall rate of change in walleye Hg across all lakes in the dataset varied with latitude. Hg in walleye decreased 0.5% per year in northern lakes, increased 0.8% in southern lakes, and remained constant in middle latitude lakes over the period of 1982-2005. Season of collection was also an important predictor variable. Hg concentrations were highest in walleye captured in the spring and lowest in the fall. Other variables such as gender, lake area, and total alkalinity were also important predictors.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				NOV	2007	16	8					541	550		10.1007/s10646-007-0160-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-007-0160-2								17653862					WOS:000250138800002

The natural lake Kwangpho was selected as a rearing site to provide the environment which matched most closely to black swan's natural habitats. Comparison of the climate data of Kwangpho with Australia and New Zealand led to the conclusion that it is necessary to increase winter temperature 10 degrees C for artificial rearing. In order to overcome the low temperature with renewable energy, a passive solar greenhouse with a water pond was introduced, where black swans were reared simultaneously while observing the microclimate such as air temperature, humidity and water temperature in winter. When the pond depth was 0.4 m and 0.8 m, there was no significant difference in indoor temperature, the depth fixed at 0.4 m to reduce pumping power by more than 50%. During the study, 80 mature black swans wintered safely and 13 pairs of them laid 74 eggs, the artificial hatching rate was 65% and the natural hatching rate was 53%. It was confirmed that the passive solar greenhouse with a pond can raise the winter minimum temperature 8-10 degrees C higher than outside, and in this microclimate it is possible to propagate the black swan and it is believed that the greenhouse has abundant potential to enable the artificial breeding as well as wintering of black swans, in temperate zone occupying wide area of the earth.																			0378-4320	1873-2232				MAR	2023	250								107199	10.1016/j.anireprosci.2023.107199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2023.107199		FEB 2023						36827817					WOS:000965528000001

A Comparison of Low Flow Estimates in Ungauged Catchments Using Regional Regression and the HBV-Model	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Estimates of a low flow index in ungauged catchments calculated by a regional regression model and a regional hydrological model were compared for a study region southwestern Norway. The regression method was based on a relationship between the low flow index and an optimal set of catchment descriptors, established using stepwise linear regression for homogeneous subregions. Subregions were distinguished according to the season in which the lowest flow occurs, summer (May to October) or winter (November to April), and the average July temperature was found to be the best index for determining the low flow season for ungauged catchments. Catchment descriptors characterising the presence of lakes and bogs, in addition to catchment length and indicators of climatic conditions, were found to be important in the regression models. A cross-validation procedure was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the model in ungauged catchments. A gridded version of HBV, a daily rainfall-runoff model was also applied as a regional hydrological model and was calibrated using the average Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient for log-transformed streamflow as the calibration criterion. A comparison of the two methods in 21 independent catchments indicates that the regression method generally gives better estimates of Q (c) in ungauged catchments than does the HBV model, particularly in those catchments with the lowest Q (c) values.

There is a need to update our knowledge of the distribution of ostracods in Iceland as they are an important link in these ecosystems as well as good candidates for biomonitoring. We analysed 25,005 ostracods from 44 lakes, 14 springs, and 10 cave pools. A total of 16 taxa were found, of which seven are new to Iceland. Candona candida (Muller, 1776) is the most widespread species, whereas Cytherissa lacustris (Sars, 1863) and Cypria ophtalmica (Jurine, 1820) are the most abundant, showing great numbers in lakes. Potamocypris fulva (Brady, 1868) is the dominant species in springs. While the fauna of lakes and springs are relatively distinct from each other, cave pools host species that are common in both lakes and springs. Icelandic non-marine ostracods include mostly generalist species, as well as species adapted to cold climates and resemble those of other north European countries while sharing very few species with the North American Arctic. Iceland is experiencing impacts from climate change and a booming tourism. It is possible to use selected freshwater ostracods as biomonitoring tools by constructing a detailed database of these species.

A novel approach for monitoring vertical profiles of boundary-layer pollutants: Utilizing routine news helicopter flights	ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH												Air quality varies greatly in space and time across urban locales. However, criteria pollutants are typically monitored routinely at a relatively small number of surface sites within each metropolitan area, and routine vertical profiles of pollution are typically unavailable. We illustrate that a news helicopter provides an effective sensor platform to provide spatiotemporal analyses and vertical profiles of pollutant concentrations. We are unaware of any other air quality study that has utilized routine helicopter flights, despite the ubiquity of helicopters in urban environments across the world. Particulate and ozone concentration profiles have been collected since 2015 from sensors installed on a news helicopter that travels primarily over the metropolitan areas of northern Utah. The air quality data are retrieved in real time, archived, combined with surface-based observations, and disseminated in terms of time series and maps on a website for research, forecasting, and public awareness. Large vertical variations in particulate pollution concentrations were observed during the 2015-2016 winter associated with meteorological cold-air pool episodes. During the 2015 and 2016 summer seasons, ozone concentrations frequently exhibited complex spatial and temporal variations arising from many interrelated factors, including local terrain-forced circulations, lake breezes, and distant wildfires.

Intraseasonal and Interannual Variability in North American Storm Tracks and Its Relationship to Equatorial Pacific Variability	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Extratropical cyclones play a principal role in wintertime precipitation and severe weather over North America. On average, the greatest number of cyclones track 1) from the lee of the Rocky Mountains eastward across the Great Lakes and 2) over the Gulf Stream along the eastern coastline of North America. However, the cyclone tracks are highly variable within individual winters and between winter seasons. In this study, the authors apply a Lagrangian tracking algorithm to examine variability in extratropical cyclone tracks over North America during winter. A series of methodological criteria is used to isolate cyclone development and decay regions and to account for the elevated topography over western North America. The results confirm the signatures of four climate phenomena in the intraseasonal and interannual variability in North American cyclone tracks: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA), and the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). Similar signatures are found using Eulerian bandpass-filtered eddy variances. Variability in the number of extratropical cyclones at most locations in North America is linked to fluctuations in Rossby wave trains extending from the central tropical Pacific Ocean. Only over the far northeastern United States and northeastern Canada is cyclone variability strongly linked to the NAO. The results suggest that Pacific sector variability (ENSO, PNA, and MJO) is a key contributor to intraseasonal and interannual variability in the frequency of extratropical cyclones at most locations across North America.

Hg-0 concentrations in sediments varied between 6.3 and 60.3 pg g(-1) (wet weight) which represented 7.4-28.4% of total mercury (HgT) concentration. Hg-0 concentrations were similar in both lakes. Hg-0 was rapidly adsorbed on sediments in controlled adsorption experiments and surface sediments sampled in summer had a stronger affinity for Hg-0 than deeper sediments and sediments sampled in fall. This adsorption was positively correlated to organic matter content and negatively related to particle grain size, pH and oxygen concentration in overlying water. This study demonstrates that Hg-0 is a prevalent species in sediments, but not in porewater, because of the high sorptive capacity of sediments towards Hg-0. Its potential availability towards Hg methylating bacteria remains to be determined. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Oren, A; Gurevich, P				Oren, A; Gurevich, P			Dynamics of a bloom of halophilic archaea in the Dead Sea	HYDROBIOLOGIA												After a period of more than ten years in which bacterial and algal community sizes were extremely small, a dense bloom of halophilic archaea developed in the upper 5-10 m of the Dead Sea water column in the summer of 1992. The development of this bloom followed a dilution of the upper water layer by winter rainfloods, which enabled the development of a short-lived dense bloom of the unicellular green alga Dunaliella parva. The dense archaeal community (up to 3.5 x 10(7) cells ml(-1) in June 1992) imparted a red coloration to the Dead Sea, due to its high content of bacterioruberin. Bacteriorhodopsin was not detected. High levels of potential heterotrophic activity were associated with the bloom, as measured by the incorporation of labeled organic substrates. After the decline of the algal bloom, archaeal numbers in the lake decreased only little, and most of the community was still present at the end of 1993. The amount of carotenoid pigment per cell, however, decreased 2-3-fold between June 1992 and August 1993. No new algal and archaeal blooms developed after the winter floods of 1992-1993, in spite of the fact that salinity values in the surface layer were sufficiently low to support a new algal bloom. A remnant of the 1992 Dunaliella bloom maintained itself at the lower end of the pycnocline at depths between 7 and 13 m (September 1992-August 1993). Its photosynthetic activity was small, and very little stimulation of archaeal growth and activity was associated with this algal community.

Together with the results of short- and long-time leaching of local rocks, REE and Y and Pb isotope ratios indicate that the Palaeozoic mica schists dominantly control the REE and Y signatures of the deep-seated Na-HCO3 waters. Marbles may also be involved, but their low REE contribution is overridden by the much higher REE and Y abundances in the mica schists. Palaeozoic gneisses can be excluded as source rocks by both Pb isotope ratios and REE leaching behaviour. The deep-seated waters either ascend rapidly in production wells and precipitate carbonate-silica scales at temperatures of about 200 degreesC or these waters ascend slowly to springs, become enriched in Ca2+, Cl- and SO42-, and discharge with temperatures up to 100 degreesC as fumaroles or hot springs. Some of these spring waters precipitate large amounts of travertine upon exsolution Of CO2. In contrast, the thermal Ca-HCO3-type of water from Pamukkale has its source in the regional Pliocene limestones. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this context, the Younger Dryas (YD) cold climatic reversal (similar to 12,800-11,500 cal yr BP), and the resulting vegetation response, is of considerable interest. In this study, we conducted pollen and grain-size analyses of a section spanning the interval of 17,600-8500 cal yr BP in a sediment core from Xingyun Lake, in Yunnan Province, southwest China. At the same time, the other 44 paleovegetation sites from Yunnan Plateau and elsewhere in China were reviewed. Our aims were to investigate the vegetation responses to climate changes during the YD and to integrate them with climate simulation results. During the YD climatic reversal, mean annual temperatures in Yunnan were similar to 1.5-2.4 degrees C colder than today. The vegetation response to the cooling during the YD was characterized by downward shifts in the elevation of vegetation zones. Notably, only a relatively small proportion of taxa, i.e., Abies, Picea, Pinus, Quercus (E), Quercus and Poaceae, were climatically sensitive during the YD, and changes in spring temperature were a major factor on the vegetation dynamics. In addition, there was a time lag in the vegetation response to the YD event in the Yunnan Plateau. Consistent with other records from China, the YD climatic reversal only caused a change in vegetation composition rather than vegetation type succession. Notably, there was a latitudinal gradient in the magnitude of the YD cold event in China and in the resulting vegetation response. Changes in both temperature and precipitation were responsible for the vegetation changes at mid-to-high-latitudes, whereas the vegetation dynamics at low latitudes were determined largely by changes in spring temperature.					; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022; Chen, Xuemei/KCL-6714-2024; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Lv, Feiya/ABB-8018-2021	Huang, Xiaozhong/0000-0002-2127-0451; Brenner, Mark/0000-0001-9837-012X; Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; 													0012-8252	1872-6828				FEB	2020	201								103080	10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103080													WOS:000520949700027

After onset of thermal stratification, the BBL is the first layer that turns anoxic, followed shortly afterward by the ME-L, while the HYP remains oxic and has relatively higher pH until later in summer. Thus, during the early summer, the HYP forms an oxygen-containing layer in-between two DO-deficient layers. Somewhat later, the HYP is characterized by still having significant levels of nitrate NO3, while in both adjacent layers nitrate is already removed through denitrification. The mechanisms controlling the gradual decline of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the HYP during the summer were studied. The seasonal mean lake-wide vertical eddy diffusion coefficient in this layer, evaluated from heat flux measurements, is approximately 4 x 10(-6) m(2) s(-1). The vertical oxygen flux due to diffusion from within the HYP toward its oxygen-deficient upper and lower boundaries accounts for most of the slow summer decline in DO in this layer. A smaller portion of this decline can be attributed to in-layer respiratory processes. The low turbidity, relatively high pH, and slow accumulation rate of NH4 in the HYP support the notion that the slower mineralization processes occurring in this layer result from relatively low ambient concentrations of biodegradable organic matter, most probably due to the short residence time of the particles settling through this layer.

Offline Implementation and Evaluation of the Canadian Small Lake Model with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme over Western Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												The Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), version 2, was run with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), version 3.6.1, in an offline regional test over western Canada. Forcing data were derived from ERA-Interim and downscaled using the fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5). The forcing precipitation field was adjusted using monthly data from the Canadian Gridded Temperature and Precipitation Anomalies (CANGRD) observation-based dataset. The modeled surface air temperature was evaluated against CANGRD data, the modeled albedo against MODIS data, and the modeled snow water equivalent against Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) and Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research (GlobSnow) data. The lake simulation itself was evaluated using the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) Reprocessing for Climate: Lake Surface Water Temperature and Ice Cover (ARC-Lake) dataset. Summer surface lake temperatures and the lake ice formation and breakup periods were well simulated, except for slight warm/cold summer/fall surface temperature biases, early ice breakup, and early ice formation, consistent with warm/cold biases in the climate simulation. Tests were carried out to investigate the sensitivity of the CSLM simulation to the default values assigned to the shortwave extinction coefficient and the average lake depth, and changing the former from 0.5 to 2.0m(-1) and the latter from 10.0 to 50.0 or 5.0m had minimal effects on the simulation. Comparisons of the average annual variations of the simulated net shortwave radiation, turbulent fluxes, snowpack, and maximum and minimum daily surface temperatures between the land and the lake fractions for tundra, boreal, and southern regions showed patterns consistent with those expected. Finally, a test of the CSLM over the large resolved lakes in the model domain demonstrated a performance comparable to that for subgrid lakes.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				JUN	2017	18	6					1563	1582		10.1175/JHM-D-16-0272.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-16-0272.1													WOS:000405926400002

We investigated the overall ecological effects after invasion and fast expansion of zebra mussels in eight lakes in Denmark belonging to the same watercourse systems but with different morphological and eutrophication characteristics. A few years after the invasion, most of the lakes had experienced profound changes in lake water quality, e.g. chlorophyll a had been reduced by 18-62% and Secchi depth had increased by 38-171%. Nutrient concentrations also decreased, total phosphorus to 37-64% and total nitrogen to 49-77% of pre-invasion concentrations. Seasonally, differences between both summer and winter phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations diminished, suggesting a change in internal nutrient cycling after the invasion. In most lakes, the abundance of submerged macrophytes rose substantially, and often coverage increased by a factor 10 or more, and the maximum colonisation depth increased by up to 5.4 m. Plant species numbers increased markedly in four of the six lakes with macrophyte data. The fish community changed towards higher dominance of potential piscivorous perch and an increase in their body size. The profound effects of zebra mussel invasion may affect lake management and how ecological quality should be interpreted.					; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012	Johansson, lsjau2000/0000-0003-0770-1451; Andersen, Per/0000-0002-5490-6436; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2025	852	2			SI		305	322		10.1007/s10750-024-05542-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-024-05542-1		APR 2024											WOS:001206255300003

Karst aquifers are globally widespread, providing critical water supplies and sustaining rivers and ecosystems, and are particularly susceptible to pollution. However, EOC distributions in karst remain quite poorly understood. This study looks at the occurrence of EOCs in the Croatian karst, which is an example of the "classical" karst, a highly developed type of karst that occurs throughout the Dinaric region of Europe. Samples were collected from 17 karst springs and one karst lake used for water supply in Croatia during two sampling campaigns. From a screen of 740 compounds, a total of 65 compounds were detected. EOC compounds from the pharmaceutical (n = 26) and agrochemical groups (n = 26) were the most frequently detected, while industrials and artificial sweeteners had the highest concentrations (range 8-440 ng/L). The number of detected compounds and the frequency of detection demonstrate the vulnerability of karst to EOC pollution. Concentrations of 5 compounds (acesulfame, sucralose, perfluorobutane sulfonate, emamectin B1b, and triphenyl phosphate) exceeded EU standards and occurred at concentrations that are likely to be harmful to ecosystems. Overall, most detections were at low concentrations (50 % <1 ng/L). This may be due to high dilution within the exceptionally large springs of the Classical karst, or due to relatively few pollution sources within the catchments. Nevertheless, EOC fluxes are considerable (10 to 106 ng/s) due to the high discharge of the springs. Temporal differences were observed, but without a clear pattern, reflecting the highly variable nature of karst springs that occurs over both seasonal and short-term timescales. This research is one of a handful of regional EOC investigations in karst groundwater, and the first regional study in the Dinaric karst. It demonstrates the need for more frequent and extensive sampling of EOCs in karst to protect human health and the environment.					; Terzic, Josip/LMO-4751-2024; Stroj, Andrej/O-6564-2019	Lukac Reberski, Jasmina/0000-0002-0154-8479; Selak, Ana/0000-0003-4932-9854; Terzic, Josip/0000-0003-3692-8305; Stroj, Andrej/0000-0001-9769-267X; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2023	621								129583	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129583		MAY 2023						37334317					WOS:001007097400001

The microbial communities of freshwater ecosystems are intimately linked water quality. These microbes interact with, utilize and recycle inorganic elements and organic matter. Here, we present three metagenomic sequence datasets (total of 182.9 Gbp) from different freshwater environments in Israel. The first dataset is from diverse freshwater bodies intended for different usages - a nature reserve, irrigation and aquaculture facilities, a tertiary wastewater treatment plant and a desert rainfall reservoir. The second represents a two-year time-series, collected during 2013-2014 at roughly monthly intervals, from a water reservoir connected to an aquaculture facility. The third is from several time-points during the winter and spring of 2015 in Lake Kinneret, including a bloom of the cyanobacterium Microcystis sp. These datasets are accompanied by physical, chemical, and biological measurements at each sampling point. We expect that these metagenomes will facilitate a wide range of comparative studies that seek to illuminate new aspects of freshwater microbial ecosystems and inform future water quality management approaches.

J	Bourque, CPA; Cox, RM; Allen, DJ; Arp, PA; Meng, FR				Bourque, CPA; Cox, RM; Allen, DJ; Arp, PA; Meng, FR			Spatial extent of winter thaw events in eastern North America: historical weather records in relation to yellow birch decline	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												An algorithm (Weather Reader) was developed and used to analyze daily weather records from all existing Canadian and American weather stations of eastern North America (in excess of 2100 stations), from 1930 through 2000. Specifically, the Weather Reader was used to compile daily minimum, mean, and maximum air temperatures for weather stations with at least 30 years of data, and was used to calculate accumulated degree days for winter thaw-freeze events relevant to yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) from beginning to end. A thaw-freeze event relevant to yellow birch was considered to take place when (i) the station daily maximum temperature reached or exceeded +4 degrees C after being below freezing for at least 2 months of the winter, (ii) sufficient growing degree days accumulated (> 50 growing degree days) to cause the affected yellow birch trees to prematurely deharden, and (iii) the daily minimum temperature dropped below -4 degrees C causing roots and/or shoots of dehardened trees to experience freeze-induced injury and possibly dieback. The threshold temperature of +4 degrees C represents the daily temperature above which biological activity occurs in yellow birch. The station growing degree day summaries were subsequently spatially interpolated with the Kriging function in GS(+(TM)) and mapped in ArcView((TM)) GIS in order to display the geographic extent of the most severe thaw-freeze events. The ArcView((TM)) maps were then compared with the extent of historically observed yellow birch decline. It was found that the years 1936, 1944, and 1945 were particularly uncharacteristic in terms of region-wide winter thaw-freeze extremes, and also in terms of observed birch decline events during 1930-1960. An overlay of suspected accumulated birch decline based on thaw-freeze mapping and observed decline maps prepared by by Braathe (1995), Auclair (1987), and by Auclair et al. (1997) for 1930-1960 demonstrated similar geographic patterns. The thaw-freeze projection for 1930-1960 was shown to coincide with 83% of the birch decline map appearing in by Braathe (1995) and 55% of the geographic range of yellow birch in eastern North America. Thaw-freeze mapping was also applied to two significant events in 1981. Greatest impact was recorded to occur mostly in southern Quebec and Ontario, and several American Great Lake States, specifically in northern Michigan and New York, where the greatest growing degree day accumulation prior to refreeze in late February (February 28th) was projected to have occurred; and in southern Quebec, most of Atlantic Canada, and Maine, prior to a late spring frost in mid-April (April 17).																			1354-1013	1365-2486				SEP	2005	11	9					1477	1492		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00956.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00956.x													WOS:000231396700007
J	Franke, U; Hutter, K; Jöhnk, K				Franke, U; Hutter, K; Jöhnk, K			A physical-biological coupled model for algal dynamics in lakes	BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY												A coupled model is presented for simulating physical and biological dynamics in fresh water lakes. The physical model rests upon the assumption that the turbulent kinetic energy in a water column of the lake is fully contained in a mixed layer of variable depth. Below this layer the mechanical energy content is assumed to vanish. Additionally, the horizontal currents are ignored. This one-dimensional two-layered model describes the internal conversion of the mechanical and thermal energy input from the atmosphere into an evolution of the mixed layer depth by entrainment and detrainment mechanisms. It is supposed to form the physical domain in which the simulation of the biological processes takes place. The biological model describes mathematically the typical properties of phyto- and zooplankton, their interactions and their response to the physical environment. This description then allows the study of the behaviour of Lagrangian clusters of virtual plankton that are subjected to such environments. The essence of the model is the dynamical simulation of an arbitrary number of nutrient limited phytoplankton species and one species of zooplankton. The members of the food web above and below affect the model only statically. The model is able to reproduce the typical progression of a predator-prey interaction between phyto- and zooplankton as well as the exploitative competition for nutrients between two phytoplankton species under grazing pressure of Daphnia. It suggests that the influence of the biological system on the physical system results in a weak increase of the surface temperature for coupled simulations, but a considerably higher seasonal thermocline in spring and a lower one in autumn.

The aim of the present study was to conduct a statistical analysis on Venerupis and Cerastoderma to investigate the difference between the two autochthonous clams according to the presence of metals, and to link metal concentrations to the reproductive cycle of clam during 2009-2010. Metal analysis was carried out with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Accuracy and precision were assessed by analyzing the certified standard matrix: mussel tissue NIST SRM 2976. The multivariate analysis was made using the SPSS 13.0 software package for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). In this study, the concentrations of some metals found in clam tissues showed seasonal cycles with higher values in summer than in winter. The significances of metal concentrations differences between Venerupis and Cerastoderma samples were estimated with Mann-Whitney U-test. The concentrations of Ag, As, Cd, Mn, Se and Zn show a significant p-level that suggests a difference between the two group samples. Statistical analysis showed that the link of metal concentrations to the reproductive cycles of Venerupis and Cerastoderma was not evident.					; Licata, Patrizia/AAM-5842-2020; Potortì, Angela Giorgia/M-9029-2016; Potorti, Angela Giorgia/M-9029-2016; LO TURCO, Vincenzo/GWC-5892-2022	LO TURCO, Vincenzo/0000-0001-6633-6920; Di Bella, Giuseppa/0000-0001-8103-6942; Potorti, Angela Giorgia/0000-0002-8608-2435; Dugo, Giacomo/0000-0003-0185-6591													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2013	185	9					7517	7525		10.1007/s10661-013-3116-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3116-4								23412955					WOS:000322485500031

The concentration of chlorophyll-a, an important index of water quality status, is often used to describe the extent of eutrophication. With the characteristics of rapidity, cyclicity, large-scale and low-cost, the technique of remote sensing plays a crucial role in quantitatively monitoring the status of water quality. MODIS is designed specifically for ocean color, and its Chlorophyll-a inversion models for case. water were already widely used. But for its lower spatial resolution, MODIS cannot satisfy the needs of monitoring the water quality in coastal case. waters, such as Laizhou Bay. The shorter cycle, the higher spatial of Landsat 8 OLI data has offered a great promise for case. water status quality monitoring. In this study we utilized two Landsat 8 OLI (Path/Row 120/034) images, for coastal waters around Laizhou city in summer and winter, to map the distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration. Optimal linear regression models between OLI band combination and concurrent in suit water quality measurements are developed respectively, and then are used to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration in different season. According to the chlorophyll-a concentration distribution map, the water quality of the coastal waters around Laizhou city is in a certain degree of eutrophication.																					978-90-824846-0-1				2015							12	17																WOS:000398996200003

Pollen results from a subalpine lake in the ISM area show that the Tsuga dumosa forest zone migrated at least 650 m upward during 18.6-7.1 kyr BP, indicating a gradual rise in mean annual temperature exceeding 3.9 degrees C. In response, grasses and deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved trees successively colonized the mountainous environment. By contrast, the area around a lake in the EASM area was gradually occupied by temperate deciduous trees. In both areas, the maximum monsoonal precipitation occurred during 7.1-6.4 kyr BP, coinciding with peak Holocene warmth, but lagging the peak in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation by 3.9-4.6 kyr, due to delayed ice melting in northern high latitudes. Our results indicate the synchronous strengthening of the ISM and EASM in response to warming-induced northward shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone.					; Leroy, Suzanne/D-3996-2009; Rioual, Patrick/H-5140-2018; Wang, Luo/A-1430-2009; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016	Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; Leroy, Suzanne/0000-0002-2556-2339; Rioual, Patrick/0000-0001-9491-9197; Wang, Luo/0000-0003-2217-8478; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 16	2019	46	7					3944	3952		10.1029/2019GL082084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082084													WOS:000465836200040

The results showed that the average values of PFs in the sediments were ranked in the order of Ca-P > Org-P > Al-P approximate to Fe-P > Ex-P > O-P. The mobile PFs, such as Al-P, Fe-P, Ex-P and Org-P influenced the TP concentrations in macrophytes free area. Only Ca-P was related with TP in macrophytes covered area, indicating the P stability of reed community sediment (RCS) and cattail community sediment (CCS). The other compositions of sediments, i.e. organic matter (OM), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and active-Fe were greatly decreased in the presence of macrophytes, while active-Al were slightly increased. OM and active-Al were found to be more significant related with PFs in OWS and RCS, while APA and active-Fe were related with PFs in the macrophytes covered sediments. Therefore, macrophytes induced the variation of sediment compositions and further influenced the distributions and stabilization of PFs. Moreover, cattail community performed better in declining the sediment compositions, P accumulation and its release. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Is winter worse for stressed fish? The consequences of exogenous cortisol manipulation on over-winter survival and condition of juvenile largemouth bass	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Over-winter mortality is an important selective force for warm-water fish (e.g., centrarchids) that live in temperate habitats. Inherent challenges faced by fish during winter may be compounded by additional stressors that activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis, either before or during winter, leading to negative sub-lethal impacts on fish health and condition, and possibly reducing chance of survival. We used experimental cortisol manipulation to test the hypothesis that juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) exposed to semichronic elevation in cortisol prior to winter would experience higher levels of over-winter mortality, physiological alterations and impaired immune status relative to control and sham-treated bass. Over-winter survival in experimental ponds was high, averaging 83%, and did not differ among treatment groups. Over the study period, bass exhibited an average increase in mass of 19.4%, as well as a slight increase in Fulton's condition factor, but neither measure differed among groups. Hepatosomatic index in cortisol-treated bass was 23% lower than in control fish, suggesting lower energy status, but white muscle lipid content was similar across all groups. Lastly, there was no difference in spleen somatic index or parasite load among treatment groups, indicating no long-term immune impairment related to our cortisol manipulation. The current study adds to a growing body of literature on glucocorticoid manipulations where field-based findings are not consistent with laboratory-based conceptual understanding of multiple stressors. This suggests that field conditions may provide fish with opportunities to mitigate negative effects of some stressors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To this end, statistical tests were carried out at a small dam reservoir to determine how chemical factors (e.g., nutrient concentrations) and physical factors (e.g., theoretical and relative residence times, temperature) influenced the chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration. Statistical tests revealed that, although phosphorus (P) concentration was significant for Chl-a, residence time had much stronger relationship to Chl-a concentration than chemical factors. In addition, the study verified that relative residence time (RRT) best explained the relation of water status to algae growth. RRT was found to be useful in identifying water status related to the summer algae bloom. Finally, this study raised the possibility of inhibiting summer algae growth by operating dam reservoirs moderately. These findings need to be seriously considered when reservoir operators establish effective strategies for water quality management in summer.

Such differential migration at the population level can be strongly determined by individuals showing different consistencies in migratory traits. By tagging individual cyprinid fish with uniquely coded electronic tags, and recording their winter migrations from lakes to streams for 6 consecutive years, we obtained highly detailed long-term information on the differential migration patterns of individuals. We found that individual migrants showed consistent site fidelities for over-wintering streams over multiple migratory seasons and that they were also consistent in their seasonal timing of migration. Our data also suggest that consistency itself can be considered as an individual trait, with migrants that exhibit consistent site fidelity also showing consistency in migratory timing. The finding of a mixture of both consistent and inconsistent individuals within a population furthers our understanding of intrapopulation variability in migration strategies, and we hypothesize that environmental variation can maintain such different strategies.

Late Permian siliceous hot springs developed on the margin of a restricted epeiric sea: Insights into strata-confined silicification in mixed siliciclastic-carbonate successions	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Hot springs are sources of carbonate minerals in modern settings; however, few fossil structures are recorded in successions older than the Quaternary due to their enhanced erosional potential. >4500 siliceous mounds are recognized in a well-defined level from the upper part of the Permian Teresina Formation (Paran ' a Basin, SE Brazil). Additionally, a new mound level is here reported for the first time about 15 m below the main occur-rence. Remarkable lithological, mineralogical, paleontological and geochemical features characterize the mounds of both levels, pointing to a hydrothermal origin. Therefore, these structures are here called as hot springs. These were originated subaerially, on the margins of a closing epeiric sea developed on a large intra-continental sag basin. Hydrothermal fluids were sourced from deep circulating basin waters that erupted through intraplate deep-rooted faults. Our data suggests that these hot springs were active during distinct cycles of base level variations. Strata-confined silicification was enhanced during periods of high evaporation and hydrother-mal exudation. Finally, the vertical and lateral facies associations of the Permian hot spring succession are compared with modern sites, and implications for the recognition of syn-depositional hydrothermally precipi-tated silica in ancient sedimentary basins are discussed.					; Assine, Mario/S-6150-2019; WARREN, LUCAS/GYE-0393-2022; Varejão, Filipe/J-3015-2015; Simoes, Marcello/C-2373-2012; Faleiros, Frederico/F-6138-2010; Riccomini, Claudio/G-1764-2010	Giovanini Varejao, Filipe/0000-0002-3776-9476; Gomes Rodrigues, Mariza/0000-0002-1015-5431; Riccomini, Claudio/0000-0002-7249-5706													0031-0182	1872-616X				OCT 15	2022	604								111213	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111213		AUG 2022											WOS:000855552600002
J	Grubb, TG				Grubb, TG			Wintering bald eagle trends in Northern Arizona, 1975-2000	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Between 1975 and 2000, 4,525 sightings of wintering bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) were recorded at Mormon Lake in northern Arizona. Numbers of wintering eagles fluctuated little in the 20 years from 1975 through 1994 (5.5 +/- 3.0 mean sightings per day). However, during the winters of 1995 through 1997 local record highs of 59 to 118 eagles increased mean sightings per day to 22.4 +/- 9.6. This dramatic population increase led to a major change in social behavior favoring consistent communal roosting; maximum roost counts of 2 to 8 eagles scattered among I I roosts in prior years shifted to maximums of 33 to 45 eagles regularly using 2 roosts during 1996 and 1997. Winter population averaged 58% adults and 42% immatures, but during 5 recent years of greatest numbers (greater than or equal to 40 eagles in 1989, 1995 through 1997, and 2000), the proportion of immatures increased to 58%. Local increases in the wintering eagle population at Mormon Lake were largely attributable to this greater proportion of immature bald eagles. Both age classes peaked in February, with adults more abundant during October through December and immatures more abundant from January through April. Weekly maximum counts for 1995 through 1997 indicated changing weather and prey conditions resulted in annual variation in local numbers and habitat use of wintering bald eagles.																			0038-4909					JUN	2003	48	2					223	230		10.1894/0038-4909(2003)048<0223:WBETIN>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909(2003)048<0223:WBETIN>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000183937100006

A difference in trophic ecology is the dominant means by which the species are ecologically segregated. Background: Sympatric fish species pairs in post-glacial lakes often feed on different resources, segregating available trophic resources. Organisms: Sympatric European winter-spawning Coregonus albula and the local endemic dwarf-sized spring-spawning Coregonus fontanae. Time and place: March-December 2005, Lake Stechlin, North Germany. Methods: By combining stomach content analyses and stable isotope analyses we compared consumption patterns of the two species at different depths over a 10-month period. Results: Stable isotope analyses and stomach content analyses both showed little trophic difference between the two species, but a significant effect of capture depth and body size on individual diet. Conclusions: The sympatric species pair in Lake Stechlin does not follow the expected pattern of niche segregation. Trophic divergence is not the dominant grounds for co-existence.

Voluminous literature examines urban socio-environmental interactions in tropical and temperate cities, whereas high-latitude cities are rarely considered. Here, we create a historical perspective on urban green (vegetation) and blue (water) spaces in a sub-Arctic city of Nadym in Russia. Our study explores a novel way to combine quantitative information from satellite imagery and biometric studies with qualitative information from interviews with stakeholders and residents. Such a joint analysis helps to understand dynamics of the urban green and blue space as well as its value for society. Furthermore, we propose objective indicators reflecting societal values of spaces in connection with recreational and ecological services. By contrast to temperate city studies, we found that green space is less used in summer, but still highly valued, deep lakes are used and valued more than warmer shallow lakes, and winter white space do not shrink but enhance the urban public space. Satellite images reveal inevitable loss of green space to urban construction and its remediation by artificial plantings (almost by 30% at present), whereas less valued blue space decreased almost three-fold. Interviews reveal that shallow lakes have reduced recreational values due to ice bottom and algae bloom. High values are attributed to deep artificial lakes, which are more than ten times deeper than natural lakes and do not freeze throughout in winter. Our biometric studies show that trees in urban environment are significantly taller than in the corresponding undisturbed areas. Since majority of the Arctic cities are built using very similar planning ideas and technologies, our findings shall help objective appreciation of green and blue spaces in other settlements.

J	Nagaoka, S; Arai, F; Danhara, T				Nagaoka, Shinji; Arai, Fusao; Danhara, Tohru			The Past 600 ka Explosive Eruptive History of Kirishima Volcano Based on Tephra Layers in Miyazaki Plain, Southern Japan	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI												The study investigates the past 1 Ma tephrostratigrapy of the Miyazaki plain in southern Japan. There are over 50 tephra layers, 80% of which originate from Kirishima volcano 25 km west of the plain. Several widely spread marker tephra layers in the layers and fission-track dating are used to establish tephrochronology. The explosive eruptive history of the volcano was reconstructed on the basis of tephrostratigraphy and tephrochronology. The history has two volcano groups: Pre-Kirishima 900-600 ka and Kirishima 600-0 ka. Pre-Kirishima volcanoes are unknown in detail. Kirishima volcano is divided into the Older Kirishima volcano, 600-330 ka, and the Younger Kirishima volcano, 330-0 ka. The Older Kirishima is characterized by calder-forming eruptions and large-scale pyroclastic flows, > 100 km(3) in volume. Older Kirishima consists of four stages: O1 (600-530 ka), O2 (530-520 ka), O3 (520-340 ka), and O4 (340-330 ka). The tephra of O1 includes over five crystal-enriched ash fall layers, which indicate that vulcanian and phreatomagmatic eruptions occurred intermittently at that stage. O2 is the first calder-forming stage, in which the Kobayashi-Kasamori pumice fall and pyroclastic flows and Kobayashi caldera were formed. The pumice falls and a co-ignimbrite ash fall of the pyroclastic flow were dispersed over 1000 km east of the source, and covered the western half of the main island of Japan. O3 tephra layers are composed of over ten tephra layers formed by intermittent plinian and phreatomagmatic eruptions. The latter indicates that lakes emerged in the caldera. O4 stage is a large-scale eruption with the Kakuto pyroclasatic flow and Kakuto caldera forming. The Kakuto pyroclastic flow was accompanied by a pumice fall and a scoria fall. They were small-scale scatterings near the source from small-scale eruptions, while the co-ignimbrite ash fall reached Kanto, which is 1000 km east of the source. The Younger Kirishima began with intermittent pumice and scoria falls soon after the O4 stage. The Younger Kirishima forms the main landform in the Kirishima volcano. Most of the Younger Kirishima tephra layers of more than twenty scoria and pumice falls were caused by plinian and sub-plinian eruptions accompanied by lava flows. The activity of the Younger Kirishima volcano is subdivided into four stages: Y1 (330-130 ka), Y2 (130-50 ka), Y3 (50-30 ka), and Y4 (30-0 ka) on the basis of thick soil and erosive horizon, which suggest quiet volcanic activity with no eruptions or only lava flow eruptions. Y1 includes over five tephra layers from sub-plinian eruptions in the western part of Kirishima volcano. There is a long quiet period between 240 ka and 130 ka. Y2 has six scoria falls, which show sub-plinian eruptions in the western part of the volcano. Y3 tephra is composed of Uchiyama pumice fall, Iwaokoshi pumice fall, and Awaokoshi scoria fall. Iwaokoshi from Onaminoike 40 ka old and Awaokoshi from Hinamoridake 30 ka old, were much larger eruptions than other tephra of the Younger Kirishima volcano. Forming stratovolcano at the source, they reach the Pacific Ocean and Miyazaki plain 50 km east of the source, while most of the Younger Kirishima tephra are distributed near Kirishima volcano. Y4 has more than ten pumice, scoria, and ash falls, which include historically recorded tephra layers. Of them, the Kirishima-Kobayashi pumice fall from Karakuni-dake 16.7 ka spread over the widest area, covering half of the Miyazaki plain and reaching the Pacific Ocean.																			0022-135X	1884-0884					2010	119	1					121	152		10.5026/jgeography.119.121	http://dx.doi.org/10.5026/jgeography.119.121													WOS:000446265800008

The nine watersheds have glacier coverage ranging from 0% to 63%. Our goal was to determine how air temperature and watershed land cover, particularly glacier coverage, influence stream temperature across the seasonal glacial meltwater hydrograph. Multiple linear regression models identified mean watershed elevation (related to glacier extent) and watershed lake coverage (%) as the strongest landscape controls on mean monthly stream temperature, with the weakest (May) and strongest (July) models explaining 86% and 97% of the temperature variability, respectively. Mean weekly stream temperature was significantly correlated with mean weekly air temperature in seven streams; however, the relationships were weak to non-significant in the streams influenced by glacial run-off. Streams with >30% glacier coverage showed decreasing stream temperatures with rising summer air temperatures, whereas those with <30% glacier coverage exhibited summertime warming. Glaciers also had a cooling effect on monthly mean stream temperature during the summer (July through September) equivalent to a decrease of 1.1 degrees C for each 10% increase in glacier coverage. The maximum weekly average temperature (an index of thermal suitability for salmon) in the six glacial streams was substantially below the lower threshold for optimum salmon growth. This finding suggests that although glaciers are important for moderating summer stream temperatures, future reductions in glacier run-off may actually improve the thermal suitability of some glacially dominated streams in Southeast Alaska for salmon.

J	Yodo, T; Kimura, S				Yodo, T; Kimura, S			Feeding habits of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in Lakes Shorenji and Nishinoko, Central Japan	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												Stomach contents of the largemouth bass collected from Lakes Shorenji (typical reservoir) and Nishinoko (typical swamp) were analyzed to determine its feeding habits and environmental adaptability. Main preys were a goby Rhinogobius sp(p). and shrimps Macrobranchium nipponense and Palaemon paucidense in Lake Shorenji, and a crayfish Procambarus clarkii and a shrimp M. nipponense in Lake Nishinoko. Fishes and crustaceans were the most important prey in Lakes Shorenji and Nishinoko, respectively. Principal preys changed ontogeneitically from the goby into bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and a cyprinid fish Tribolodon hakonensis in Lake Shorenji, and from a shrimp M. nipponense to the crayfish in Lake Nishinoko. The feeding activity was intense in summer and declined in winter. The bass may affect the ayu Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis population in both lakes. The bass has very flexible feeding habits, and this allows it to adapt easily to various feeding environments. The bass in Lake Nishinoko fed on larger amounts of prey organisms than that in Lake Shorenji. This fact may cause the higher growth rate of the bass in the former lake.																			0021-5392					JAN	1998	64	1					26	38																WOS:000084120100004
J	Ristau, K; Traunspurger, W				Ristau, Kai; Traunspurger, Walter			Relation between nematode communities and trophic state in southern Swedish lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The aim of this study was to examine whether littoral nematode community patterns are shaped by lake trophic state. It was hypothesized that trophic level is associated negatively with the proportion of omnivores and positively with the percentages of bacterial feeders, but not at all with the diversity, abundance, and biomass of freshwater nematodes. Sediment samples were taken at littoral sites of eight southern Swedish lakes of different trophy in spring and autumn 2007. Trophic level was found to strongly influence species richness, as oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes supported the greatest species numbers, whereas nematode abundance, biomass, and Shannon index were unaffected. Furthermore, our results indicated effects on the nematode community's trophic structure, with a larger proportion of predatory nematodes in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes but no differences in the other feeding types (bacteria, algae and suction feeders, omnivorous species). Multivariate analysis indicated a shift in species compositions along the threshold from mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions, with the presence of Tobrilus gracilis, Monhystera paludicola, Brevitobrilus stefanskii, and Ethmolaimus pratensis related to the latter. Nematode communities in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes were characterized by a similar species composition, with pronounced occurrences of Eumonhystera longicaudatula, Semitobrilus cf. pellucidus, Prodesmodora circulata, and Rhabdolaimus terrestris. Overall, the results suggested that lake trophic state is a major factor structuring littoral nematode communities, although intra-lake variations might be of importance as well.

Soils are accumulating most of the deposited Hg and MeHg, but transport of Hg and MeHg from the forested catchments into the lake ecosystems is enough to explain elevated concentrations of MeHg in fish in more than 10 000 Swedish lakes. An experimental roof was constructed to study effects of decreased atmospheric input on an entire forested catchment. The experiment started in April 1991, and decreases in the output of both MeHg and Hg occurred during 1991, 1992 and 1993. Runoff fluxes from the control catchment during the pre-treatment period were related to the experimental catchment using regression analyses. Since April 1991, after three year experiment, predicted compared to measured fluxes showed that Hg output decreased by 32% and MeHg by 28%. The decrease in Hg was most obvious during high water flows in winter/spring while MeHg decreased during all seasons of the year. The decreased input of Hg and MeHg to the Forest Roof Catchment is the most probable explanation to the rapid decrease in output of Hg and MeHg by runoff from the catchment basin.					; Munthe, John/AEX-9259-2022	Munthe, John/0000-0001-6118-5561; 													0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					415	424		10.1007/BF01189691	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189691													WOS:A1995RM44200046

Cell density of APP ranged between 0.3 x 10(5) and 10.1 x 10(5) cells ml(-1), overlapping the lower range of APP abundances given in the literature for hypereutrophic systems. The pattern of seasonal change in concentration of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (0.3-20.3 mu mol PI-1) was similar to that of cell density of APP, suggesting that phosphorus limitation on APP abundance. By contrast, nitrogen limitation seemed unlikely since the pattern of seasonal change in concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was different from that of APP cell density. We could not find any coupled oscillations between APP abundance and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, or between that of APP and ciliates. The dominant ciliate taxa, based on their cell densities, were Cinetochilum margaritaceum, Cyclidium glaucoma, Halteria grandinella, Strobilidium sp. and Urotricha spp. The relative contribution of the < 2 mum fraction to total chlorophyll concentration was seasonally high (up to 16.2%), indicating seasonal importance of APP abundance as food for heterotrophs.																			1386-2588					JAN	2003	37	1					37	43		10.1023/A:1022128306570	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022128306570													WOS:000182658800004

It is an ideal wintering place for wintering migratory birds, especially rare cranes. The construction of water conservancy facilities has changed the natural connection of Shengjin Lake, and the lake water level has been affected by changes. Human-made control, which in turn causes changes in the landscape pattern, affects the habitat of over wintering migratory birds. In order to explore the influence of water level fluctuations on overwintering migratory birds, in this paper land use types in Shengjin Lake were classified based on Landsat-8 (OLI) multispectral remotesensing images, water level data were combined and migratory bird population characteristics data were selected, the landscape patch spectral feature index was ranked, the water level change law of the Shengjin Lake wetland in different hydrological periods was analyzed, the spatiotemporal change characteristics of wetland landscape patch spectral characteristics were explored, the natural wetland landscape pattern and the habitat change pattern of overwintering migratory birds were explored. The results showed that spatially the large patches areas were dominant in the wet season, and the medium patches areas have reached the peak in the dry season. The landscape patterns were well distributed in the ebb and dry season. The overall landscape showed that the large patches areas were dominant, small and complex; the small patches distribution were scattered, huge and regular; and the small and medium patches areas were uniform and different. In terms of time, the landscape patterns were changed with the water level, the total numbers of patches were increased firstly and then decreased with the rising of water level, while the numbers of small patches were changed mostly and their stability was poor, which were easily affected by the fluctuation of water level. The shape indexes of large patches were influenced greatly by the water level, which the shape index of large patches was tended to be complicated when the water level raised. The shape indexes of large patches werethe largest in the flood period, and were tended to be long and narrow. The effects of landscape edge were tended to be obvious, and the heterogeneity of internal structure was decreased; the fragrance diversity index in the four hydrological periods were 1. 754 2 (Flood Period), 1. 571 7 (Wet Period), 1. 762 3 (Ebb Period), and 1. 790 1 (Dry Period) respectively. The indexes of fragrance diversity were decreased, and the diversity of landscape types were tended to be single. Winter migratory birds habitat areas were negative correlation with the water level, the areas of three types including grass land, mudflats and reed shoal were tradeoffs and long-term equilibrium. The grass land areas were accounted for the highest in the habitat area which played a leading role (68. 01%), the overall habitat areas were peaked in the late migratory birds wintering (in the dry season), which were benefited by wintering birds for foraging behavior activities. Based on this conclusion, it is suggested that artificially regulating the water level of Shengjin lake by controlling sluice during the dry season of over wintering (August to January of the following year) could increase the area of each habitat type and provide excellent habitat for over wintering migratory birds.

Threshold Changes in Winter Temperature and Precipitation Drive Threshold Responses Across Nine Global Climate Zones and Associated Biomes	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Globally, winter temperatures are rising, and snowpack is shrinking or disappearing entirely. Despite previous research and published literature reviews, it remains unknown whether biomes across the globe will cross important thresholds in winter temperature and precipitation that will lead to significant ecological changes. Here, we combine the widely used K & ouml;ppen-Geiger climate classification system with worst-case-scenario projected changes in global monthly temperature and precipitation to illustrate how multiple climatic zones across Earth may experience shifting winter conditions by the end of this century. We then examine how these shifts may affect ecosystems within corresponding biomes. Our analysis demonstrates potential widespread losses of extreme cold (<-20 degrees C) in Arctic, boreal, and cool temperate regions. We also show the possible disappearance of freezing temperatures (<0 degrees C) and large decreases in snowfall in warm temperate and dryland areas. We identify important and potentially irreversible ecological changes associated with crossing these winter climate thresholds.					; Siren, Alexej/HSH-9605-2023; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012; Harpold, Adrian/K-9262-2015; Casson, Nora/P-1915-2018; Arndt, Kyle/ABC-2565-2021	Contosta, Alexandra/0000-0002-1201-1765; Templer, Pamela/0000-0002-6570-3837; 													1543-592X	1545-2069					2024	55						271	300		10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110421-102101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110421-102101													WOS:001434081600020

In a field observation, we tested how seasonal variability in the taxonomic composition and density of zoopsammon communities at different shore heights is related to sand temperature, wave activity, sediment characteristics and vegetation cover in the two boreal lakes differing in their trophic state. The mesotrophic Lake Saadjarv had higher number of psammon taxa dominated by protists than the eutrophic Lake Vrtsjarv dominated by nematodes. Within each lake, vegetation cover and sediment characteristics explained the largest variability in the spatial and seasonal dynamics of zoopsammon communities. Seasonality differed among taxonomic groups and lakes. The seasonal variability differed slightly among the levels of shore heights with densities being highest at the water line in spring and early summer and upward the water line later on. Due to the presence of strong interaction of temporal and spatial variability in psammon communities, large covariation among environmental variables and a presence of many species-specific interactions with environmental factors, the future studies should test those impact attributes with experimental approaches at the highest taxonomic resolution possible.

The rates for gross community production were calculated from polynomial fits of community respiration and net community production data. The cardinal temperatures of gross community production were estimated from these equations. The optimal temperature was positively correlated to the in situ temperature. The natural population gave no evidence of being shocked due to experimental temperature manipulation. Frequency histograms of the temperature coefficients of community respiration and gross community production were distinct in this environment. Q10 values for respiration were greater than Q10 values for photosynthesis, in contrast to published observations from the Southern Ocean where they overlapped. It was argued that this was a consequence of the short-term temperature variability of the environment.

S.			Simulating the thermal behavior in Lake Ontario using EFDC	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The thermal behavior of Lake Ontario (spring warming, thermal bar formation, and summer stratification) is simulated using the three-dimensional thermo-hydrodynamic model, Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). The model is forced with hourly meteorological data from weather stations around the lake and flow data from Niagara and St. Lawrence Rivers. The simulation is performed from April to July 2011 on a curvilinear grid, with cells approximately 2 x 2 km(2) and bathymetty interpolated onto the grid. We implement model improvements by (a) updating the evaporation algorithm to ensure accurate simulation of evaporation rates and latent heat fluxes and (b) specifying appropriate solar radiation attenuation coefficients to ensure sufficient absorption of incoming solar radiation by the water column. The study also calibrated horizontal and vertical mixing coefficients. Results show that the model accurately simulated the overall surface temperature profiles with RMSEs between 1 and 2 degrees C and the vertical temperature profiles during the lake mixed phase with RMSEs <0.5 degrees C. Overall, the modified EFDC model successfully replicated thermal bar evolution. (C) 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to evaluate whether the effects of a mild winter on these primary producers are differentiated in two types of eutrophic lakes: phytoplankton-dominated (PDL), with a low proportion of SAV, and macrophyte-dominated (MDL), with extensive benthic vegetation. The physical and chemical parameters of the water, concentration of chlorophyll a, and the biomass of phytoplankton and SAV were investigated in four small eutrophic lakes (Eastern Poland) during the growing season after cold winters (CW) and mild winters (MW). In both types of lakes, the concentrations of soluble and total nitrogen were higher and the values of soluble and total phosphorus were lower after the MW than after the CW. The concentration of chlorophyll a and the phytoplankton biomass were always higher in the PDL than in the MDL, but the increase in both parameters in the vegetation season after the MW was statistically important only in the PDL. A poor underwater light climate was stressful for the SAV in the PDL, but not in the MDL. The MW had negative effects on phytoplankton diversity and the loss of light-demanding macrophytes. However, the biomass of primary producers in the MDL seems to be more resistant to climate warming, in comparison to the PDL.

Only four age-classes were represented in this normally abundant and long-lived species. By 1984 only one new age-class had been recruited into the population. As these fish spawned in the outlet stream in early spring, the potential toxicity of these waters was assessed at two snow-melt events. Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, of hatchery origin were held in the outlet stream as pH declined from 6.5 to 4.7 during a snow melt, late February. Trout showed a loss of 19% in plasma Na and 24% in Cl concurrent with gill Al concentration increasing from 10 to 250 mu g . g(-1) dry wt. At the mid-April snow melt,pH fell to 4.1, and rainbow trout held in the outlet showed a decline in plasma sodium of 42% and gill Al increased from 10 to 415 mu g . g(-1) dry wt. Control rainbow trout held in Harp L. at pH 6.3 showed no significant change in plasma and muscle ion concentrations, or in gill Al concentration. White sucker from nearby waters were held in Heeney Lake outlet, late April, and muscle Na and Cl declined significantly as gill Al concentration increased from 11 to 50 mu g . g(-1) dry wt during 48 hr exposure. White sucker held in Heeney L. outlet, mid-May, showed no significant change in plasma ions. No white sucker have been captured in Heeney L. since 1984 and the population is presumed to be extinct. Acid deposition has declined in recent years but lake and stream pH have not recovered and fish populations may still decline or disappear.

Climate change-induced desertification and the anthropogenic exploitation of hydric resources result in the progressive evaporation and salinization of inland water bodies in many areas of the globe. However, how this process impacts microbial communities and their activities in biogeochemical cycles is poorly known. Here, we take a space-for-time substitution approach and characterize the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities of two planktonic cell-size fractions (0.2-5 mu m and 5-30 mu m) from lakes of diverse trophic levels sampled along a salinity-alkalinity gradient located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB). We applied a 16S/18S rRNA gene metabarcoding strategy to determine the microbial community composition of 54 samples from 12 different lakes, from the low-salinity lake Zirahuen to the hypersaline residual ponds of Rincon de Parangueo. Except for systems at both extremes of the salinity gradient, most lakes along the evaporation trend bear actively forming microbialites, which harbor microbial communities clearly distinct from those of plankton. Several lakes were sampled in winter and late spring and the crater lakes Alchichica and Atexcac were sampled across the water column. Physicochemical parameters related to salinity-alkalinity were the most influential drivers of microbial community structure whereas trophic status, depth, or season were less important. Our results suggest that climate change and anthropogenic-induced hydric deficit could significantly affect microbial communities, potentially altering ecosystem functioning.

J	Wang, C; Bi, J				Wang, Ce; Bi, Jun			TMDL development for the Taihu Lake's influent rivers, China using variable daily load expressions	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												Influent river carrying nutrient pollutants from watershed loads makes a great contribution to the eutrophication in river-fed lake. It is scientific standard to make policies on river pollution control based on loading capacity of the river of interest. To control eutrophication in Taihu Lake has been the focal point of "The Twelfth Five-Year Guideline" proposed by Chinese government. The Taigeyunhe, Caoqiaohe and Yincungang Rivers which were the most polluted influent rivers in Taihu Lake Basin were scheduled for nutrient total maximum daily load (TMDL). A variety of mechanistic and empirical models are applied worldwide for TMDL development. However, model selection depends on management objectives, site-specific characteristics and availability of data resource. In this study, based on watershed characteristics and limited data, a nutrient TMDL is developed using flow and temporally variable daily load expressions. The simple and effective approaches specify allowable daily maximum loads for controlling on instantaneous high load and allowable daily median loads for achieving long-term TMDL allocation. For the entire river system, loading capacities are much lower during low flows. The maximum percent load reductions for biochemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen in spring and total phosphorus in winter can be obtained when pollution source inputs seasonally vary. This study provides local authority with two different alternatives in decision-making for pollution control on influent rivers and then to reduce external loads to the lake.

Thus, understanding the specific characteristics of nutrient (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) recycling from sediment is important for clarifying the processes and mechanisms of cyanobacterial growth and succession.Materials and methodsSediments and water samples were collected monthly from five sampling sites in Lake Chaohu for 1 year. N and P concentrations in surface and interstitial water were determined, and fractions of sediment organic matter, P, and iron were quantified. P adsorption characteristics were modeled with adsorption isotherms.Results and discussionDolichospermum was the dominant bloom species in the western lake in April, followed by Microcystis from May to September in the whole lake. The impulsive regeneration and release mode from iron-bound P and ammonium (NH4+-N) regeneration from sediment in spring triggered the Dolichospermum bloom. In early summer, continuous P release potential as well as nitrate accumulation and NH4+-N deficiency due to NH4+-N prior assimilation by Dolichospermum jointly drove the transition from Dolichospermum to Microcystis due to the energy saving and competitive advantage of rapid uptake and storage of inorganic P as well as a wide range of N utilization forms for Microcystis. All these facts put the Dolichospermum towards common N and P stress. Furthermore, in summer, NH4+-N rapid regeneration from organic algal detritus remineralization due to the decline of Dolichospermum developed Microcystis blooms.ConclusionsThe specific mode and pathway of N and P recycling from sediment determined the dominant algal species based on the particular N and P utilization strategies of the algae. Pulsed and a vast amount of P release facilitated the Dolichospermum growth, while continuous and a small quantity of P release was in favor of Microcystis growth. Organic N hydrolysis from Dolichospermum detritus further supported the development of a Microcystis bloom.

J	Akdim, B				Akdim, Brahim			Karst landscape and hydrology in Morocco: research trends and perspectives	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Moroccan karst has been the subject of study over the last two decades as a system, where landforms interact with groundwater, springs and human action. The literature review gone through in this article focuses on international publications, including French journals. It shows the complexity of the karst area and its local model diversity. The regimes of the aquifers, landforms and springs were reported in most mountain terrains and the local interactions between the karst aquifer, karst springs, landforms and human action were discussed. Even the Rif Mountain presents some karst aspects, mainly in its central part, the Atlas domain is more dominated by karst. The substrate types, tectonics, altimetry, climate, and vegetation roles are important in karst dynamics. Human factors impact the landscapes and the equilibrium of the hydrokarst system via resources overuse and management. Indicators of the present-day disequilibrium were evoked (turbidity of water in karst springs, geotechnical problems, erosion of the soil, etc.). These problems will be more complex in the future due to the human density increase and probable intense human activity in the rural areas. Sustainable management is therefore a challenging priority in the karst domain.

For monitoring water clarity over such lakes, this study utilizes machine learning models and data from citizen science to develop effective models for retrieving Secchi disk depth (SDD) in Canandaigua Lake, USA. Using Sentinel-2 band ratios as input, we trained random forest (RF), adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and support vector regression models using spatiotemporally distributed in situ data within 7 days of Senitnel-2 overpass. Each model was optimized using hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation was used for accuracy assessment to compare the models' effectiveness in retrieving SDD. The results indicate the superior performance of RF with an R (2) of similar to 0.74 and a root mean squared error of similar to 0.72 m. A feature importance analysis for RF indicated the high relevance of the blue and green bands ratio in the estimation of SDD. The RF model was subsequently employed to generate temporal maps for Canandaigua Lake, indicating that water clarity tends to be higher during the early summer months (May and June) but declines during late summer and fall (September and October). This pattern can be closely associated with the increased algal presence in the lake. The spatial variability of the SDD indicated the possibility of greater sediments entering from the southern part of the lake. This study can be expanded to encompass other Finger Lakes, offering a comprehensive understanding of water clarity in these lake systems.

The maximum age was usually 3+ to 4+, but the age 7+ was also recorded. The inflows of all reservoirs are populated mostly by 0+ to 2+ brook trout, while older specimens live in a lentic environment, migrating to lotic habitats only to spawn. The density of brook trout in streams ranged from 8 to 95 individuals per 100 m(2) during spring and summer, while that for reservoirs ranged between 31 and 290 individuals per ha. A strong negative correlation between the size of adult fish and population density in reservoirs was observed. The type of management influenced both density and growth of brook trout. Further introduction of this species in the central European area should be restricted to habitats where native salmonids cannot survive, such as acidified waters.

J	Putnam, AE; Broecker, WS				Putnam, Aaron E.; Broecker, Wallace S.			Human-induced changes in the distribution of rainfall	SCIENCE ADVANCES												A likely consequence of global warming will be the redistribution of Earth's rain belts, affecting water availability for many of Earth's inhabitants. We consider three ways in which planetary warming might influence the global distribution of precipitation. The first possibility is that rainfall in the tropics will increase and that the subtropics and mid-latitudes will become more arid. A second possibility is that Earth's thermal equator, around which the planet's rain belts and dry zones are organized, will migrate northward. This northward shift will be a consequence of the Northern Hemisphere, with its large continental area, warming faster than the Southern Hemisphere, with its large oceanic area. A third possibility is that both of these scenarios will play out simultaneously. We review paleoclimate evidence suggesting that (i) the middle latitudes were wetter during the last glacial maximum, (ii) a northward shift of the thermal equator attended the abrupt Bolling-Allerod climatic transition similar to 14.6 thousand years ago, and (iii) a southward shift occurred during the more recent Little Ice Age. We also inspect trends in seasonal surface heating between the hemispheres over the past several decades. From these clues, we predict that there will be a seasonally dependent response in rainfall patterns to global warming. During boreal summer, in which the rate of recent warming has been relatively uniform between the hemispheres, wet areas will get wetter and dry regions will become drier. During boreal winter, rain belts and drylands will expand northward in response to differential heating between the hemispheres.

Lidar vertical profiling of water vapor and aerosols in the Great Lakes Region: A tool for understanding lower atmospheric dynamics	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS												Results of a recently developed water vapor Raman lidar instrument at Environment Canada's Center for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE) are shown for selected days of summer and winter seasons. The basic components of the Raman water vapor lidar consist of a 30 Hz, Q-switched Nd:YAG high-powered laser utilizing the third harmonic (355 nm), beam steering optics, a 0.76 m Cassegrain telescope and three detection channels to simultaneously observe the vertical profiles of aerosols, water vapor, and nitrogen from near ground up to 9.5 km. By manipulating the inelastic backscattering lidar signals from the Raman nitrogen channel (386.7 nm) and Raman water vapor channel (407.5 nm), vertical profiles of water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR) are deduced, calibrated, and compared against WVMR profiles obtained from coincident and collocated radiosonde profiles. The average standard deviation, in the water vapor mixing ratio, is estimated to be less than 10% between the sonde and lidar measurements. In addition, comparisons between simultaneous WVMR profiles and aerosol profiles obtained from a simple aerosol backscatter lidar, also located at the CARE facility, provide insight into the complex dynamic mixing of the lower atmosphere and their subsequent impact on climate and air quality.

J	Zhao, X; Wang, SQ; Xing, GX				Zhao, Xu; Wang, Shenqiang; Xing, Guangxi			Maintaining rice yield and reducing N pollution by substituting winter legume for wheat in a heavily-fertilized rice-based cropping system of southeast China	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Substituting a N-fixing legume for winter wheat has recently been suggested as a feasible method for mitigating N pollution from heavily-fertilized rice/wheat cropping system in the Taihu Lake Plain of southeast China. To understand the agronomic and environmental value of planting legumes instead of wheat, a 3-year consecutive field observation encompassing six crop seasons was conducted to compare crop yields, chemical N inputs, and N losses for three crop rotation systems; rice/wheat (the control), rice/fava bean, and rice/milk vetch. Our data showed that 52.6-59.5% of the annual N input could be saved in the two rice/legume rotations as a result of no N fertilization in the legume growing season and the replacement of 13.2-25.7% of chemical N by leguminous N via crop residue incorporation in the rice season. This reduction in N fertilizer not only produced equivalent or slightly more rice yields compared to the control, but also reduced N loss by half. In terms of N loss, ammonia (NH3) volatilization during the rice season and N runoff in the winter season for the two rice/legume rotations were greatly reduced by 31.3-38.0% and 82.1-86.0%, respectively compared to the control. A decreasing trend was also found in N leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) in both seasons, NH3 volatilization in the winter season, and N runoff in the rice season for the two rice/legume rotations. The preliminary economic evaluation of yield benefits, fertilizer costs, and environmental costs related to N losses suggested that a mixed rice/fava bean and rice/milk vetch crop rotation (50% of each type) could ensure farmers' returns and achieve a half-maximum reduction in environmental risk. These results demonstrate that substituting winter grain/forage legumes for wheat may be a technically feasible, low-input solution to the N pollution problems in the intensive rice-based cropping systems in the Taihu Lake Plain.

J	Steinman, AD; Isely, ES; Thompson, K				Steinman, Alan D.; Isely, Elaine Sterrett; Thompson, Kurt			Stormwater runoff to an impaired lake: impacts and solutions	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Stormwater runoff can represent a significant source of pollutants to downstream water bodies. An integrated assessment was conducted for the Spring Lake watershed in western Michigan because of concerns that increased impervious land cover in the watershed, especially in sub-basins adjacent to Spring Lake, would result in greater stormwater runoff and pollutant loads. Spring Lake has a history of high total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and cyanobacterial blooms. An alum treatment, paid for by an assessment, was applied to Spring Lake in 2005 to control internal phosphorus loading; hence, there was an economic incentive for stakeholders to limit new phosphorus from entering the lake, which otherwise would reduce the long-term efficacy of the alum treatment. This study provides a novel six-step process that identifies priority areas and optimally reduces nonpoint sources of pollution. We identified a suite of best management practices to be placed in the watershed, assessed their optimal locations based on pollutant sources, and modeled the degree to which their implementation would reduce TP and total suspended solids. Application of the modeled best management practices (BMPs) resulted in a 15 % reduction in TP load and a 17% reduction in total suspended solid load. Reductions were not uniform throughout the watershed, with the greatest reductions closest to Spring Lake. We also developed a flow chart for BMP selection, which may be transferable to other watersheds with similar issues.

Ecosystem and Commercializing of Fish in a Rich-Minerals, Low-Salinity Closed Lake	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Wadi El Natrun is an elongated narrow depression in the Western Desert of Egypt. The depression characterized by many ancient alkaline salt lakes. These lakes are filled with water in winter and dried up in summer. Recently, some lakes become permanently dried, while others become submerged throughout the year as El Bieda Lake. El Bieda Lake has undergone ecological changes due to the prolonged extraction of minerals and the continual discharging of freshwater. This study investigates the recent biotic and abiotic changes of this lake and discusses its fisheries opportunities. The lake's water is well-oxygenated, rich with different inorganic nutrients, and characterized by a low salinity. Sodium and chloride ion concentrations are lower than the equivalent surface seawater, while magnesium, calcium, potassium, sulfate, and bicarbonate ions are higher. The lake has low plankton species richness with high biomass and high nutritional values. More recently, two cichlid species, Oreochromis aureus and Coptodon zillii, have colonized the lake. Summer characterized by a very low mortality for Oreochromis aureus and a poor representation of Coptodon zillii. However, both species shared the catch the rest of the year. The high biomass and nutritional quality of plankton communities, as well as the dense phytobenthic film, indicate that the lake is currently below its carrying capacity. The well-oxygenated water, high biomass of plankton and phytobenthic diatoms, and the expected changes in salinity suggest that introducing the euryhaline, commercially valuable, and fast-growing Mugil cephalus or Chelon ramada in El Bieda Lake is highly advisable.					; ALY, WALID/AAT-9608-2021; Al-Afify, Afify/ADI-1499-2022; Ali, Mohamed/AAT-3838-2020	Aly, Walid/0000-0002-5961-8214; Belal, Dalia/0000-0001-9998-1926; Al-Afify, Afify/0000-0002-9316-683X; Ali, Mohamed/0000-0003-0141-7791; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2023	234	10							626	10.1007/s11270-023-06637-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-023-06637-6													WOS:001072320500001
J	Jamieson, CD				Jamieson, CD			Coexistence of two similar copepod species, Eudiaptomus gracilis and E-graciloides:: the role of differential predator avoidance	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Habitat choice in relation to environmental factors of two coexisting calanoid copepod species, Eudiaptomus gracilis and E. graciloides, was studied in a mesotrophic lake and in large indoor mesocosms. Both species and sexes showed pronounced diel vertical migration (DVM) in the field. In 12 in deep mesocosms with free ranging fish DVM was observed and species increased day depth over time. No changes were observed in copepod day depth over time in experiments with fish kairomone. It is hypothesized that fish kairomone acts as an early warning system to copepods which respond by moving deeper, but only as far as the thermocline. For full DVM, a nearby mechanical stimulus is necessary. Thus, as fish go deeper to feed, copepods retreat. The response of copepods to fish predation, in the presence of low and high numbers of Daphnia, shows that copepods effectively use Daphnia as living shields to avoid predation. The two species adopt different vertical migration strategies depending on whether there are high or low numbers of Daphnia present. A dominant feature of mesocosm experiments was the night time aggregating (lekking) of E. gracilis males at the surface. When the spring and autumn percentages of risk takers in the epilimnion were compared, E. gracilis, particularly males, suffered the greatest cost.																			0018-8158					JUL 1	2005	542						191	202		10.1007/s10750-004-6947-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-6947-8													WOS:000231879200021

Starvation migration and massive mortality of Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) departing Mono Lake and its relation to restoration	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												In the autumns of 2014 and 2015 unprecedented numbers of Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) crashed along the central and southern California coast. Their origin was Mono Lake, California, one of the species' two main staging areas. We posit that efforts in 1994 to restore a falling lake to historic level conditions coincided with a prolonged period of rapid rise, weakened upwelling, and decline in the grebes' principal prey, brine shrimp (Artemia monica). This led to the starvation migrations and loss of most of the juvenile grebe cohort of perhaps >300,000 birds in each year. Adults avoided the mortality because of their better ability to dive for immature alkali flies (Ephydra hians). Even though the Eared Grebe is by far the most abundant bird at Mono Lake, its role in the ecosystem and the lake's importance to the continental population has been largely ignored. The starvation data, backed by several grebe and extensive limnological data, show that the extreme mortality rate in 2014-2015 can be traced to the negative effects of lake level rise. An adaptive management program that addresses the entire lake ecosystem is a prerequisite for future restoration efforts.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				APR 3	2025	137	2					196	210		10.1080/15594491.2025.2463742	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15594491.2025.2463742		APR 2025											WOS:001473621000001

The purpose of this study was to examine consequences of and possible adaptations by this population to spawning above the falls, by determining the extent of loss over the falls of age-0 young, the daily and seasonal patterns of such losses, and the seasonal pattern of movement upstream into the lake by the remaining young. We measured fish movements during 1989 and 1990 with traps placed at the outlet and at the falls, from fry swimup in July until October or November. Young went over the falls predominantly as newly swimming fry at night. In 1989 about 5000-9000 were lost downstream, representing an estimated 4-7% or less of young produced. Most young thus appear adapted to maintaining their position above the falls. A few started entering the lake in August and September, but only 95 in 1989 and 23 in 1990 had done so by the time observations were ended by the onset of wintery conditions. Most movement into the take appeared to occur sometime during the six to seven months of annual ice cover. This extended period of stream residence contrasts with early lakeward movements reported for other inlet-spawning, lacustrine grayling populations and maybe an adaptation for avoiding predation by large conspecifics in Deer Lake.																			0017-3614					DEC	1992	52	4					344	351																WOS:A1992KG35000008

Summer heatwaves promote blooms of harmful cyanobacteria	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Dense surface blooms of toxic cyanobacteria in eutrophic lakes may lead to mass mortalities of fish and birds, and provide a serious health threat for cattle, pets, and humans. It has been argued that global warming may increase the incidence of harmful algal blooms. Here, we report on a lake experiment where intermittent artificial mixing failed to control blooms of the harmful cyanobacterium Microcystis during the summer of 2003, one of the hottest summers ever recorded in Europe. To understand this failure, we develop a coupled biological-physical model investigating how competition for light between buoyant cyanobacteria, diatoms, and green algae in eutrophic lakes is affected by the meteorological conditions of this extreme summer heatwave. The model consists of a phytoplankton competition model coupled to a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model, driven by meteorological data. The model predicts that high temperatures favour cyanobacteria directly, through increased growth rates. Moreover, high temperatures also increase the stability of the water column, thereby reducing vertical turbulent mixing, which shifts the competitive balance in favour of buoyant cyanobacteria. Through these direct and indirect temperature effects, in combination with reduced wind speed and reduced cloudiness, summer heatwaves boost the development of harmful cyanobacterial blooms. These findings warn that climate change is likely to yield an increased threat of harmful cyanobacteria in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems.

J	Zhou, CY; Zhao, P; Chen, JM				Zhou, Changyan; Zhao, Ping; Chen, Junming			The Interdecadal Change of Summer Water Vapor over the Tibetan Plateau and Associated Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												In recent decades, long-term changes of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) water vapor and the associated mechanisms have not been investigated fully. This study aims to examine the interdecadal change of summer TP water vapor using the monthly mean European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis during 1979-2014. The results show a drier phase in the TP during 1979-94, with a subsequent wetter phase, which suggests an interdecadal variation of summer TP water vapor around the middle of the 1990s. This interdecadal variation is mainly due to a significant change of the water vapor export on the eastern boundary of the TP, which is closely associated with a summer atmospheric circulation anomaly near Lake Baikal. When a cyclonic (an anticyclonic) anomaly occurs near Lake Baikal, there is less (more) water vapor over the TP. On the interdecadal scale, the atmospheric circulation anomaly near Lake Baikal is related to an extratropical large-scale anomalous wave train over the northwestern Atlantic-East Asian region, with an eastward propagation of the anomalous wave energy from the Atlantic to East Asia. Climate model simulations further demonstrate an impact of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the northwestern Atlantic on the anomalous wave train. Both the extratropical tropospheric anomalous wave train and the anomalous atmospheric circulation near Lake Baikal are successfully simulated by changing the summer northwestern Atlantic SST. Therefore the warming northwestern Atlantic is an important factor contributing to the wetting TP in recent decades.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				JUL	2019	32	13					4103	4119		10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0364.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0364.1													WOS:000471935900004

The phenology of the subnivium	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The subnivium is a seasonal refuge that exists at the interface between the snowpack and the ground, and provides a haven for a diversity of species to survive extreme winter temperatures. Due to the fitness of many plants and animals being strongly influenced by winter conditions, much attention has been given to changes in the timing of snow cover extent and duration in seasonally snow-covered environments; however, these broad-scale characteristics do not capture the finer-scale dynamics of the subnivium. To study the factors associated with subnivium development, we quantified three critical phenophases of the subnivium: establishment, maintenance, and disintegration along a latitudinal and land cover gradient in the Great Lakes Region of North America. We hypothesized that subnivium phenophases would depend primarily on snow depth and air temperature, but that these would be mediated by latitude and land cover. We found that patterns in both establishment and disintegration were affected by latitude more than land cover, but that variability in the timing of early season snowfall events overrode the effects of both factors in subnivium establishment. In contrast, disintegration was predictably later in more northerly sites, regardless of interannual variation in weather patterns. We found that the subnivium was the result of a balance between ambient temperature, snow depth, and snow density, but that ambient temperatures constrained the system by contributing to the frequency of snowfall and inducing changes in snow depth and density. Areas in lake effect zones, characterized by high snow depths and persistent snow cover, may be the last refugia for subnivia-dependent species given the predicted shifting climate regimes of the 21st century.

Clearance, ingestion and assimilation rates were measured by labelling natural seston with 14C-bicarbonate and 3H-thymidine/leucine. The clearance rates (CRs) of Daphnia magna, the dominant species at the onset of spring, were low, very likely as a consequence of the high abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria in the lagoon. The CRs were nearly equal for phytoplankton and bacteria, corroborating the unselective feeding of Daphnia. Bacteria supplied approximate to 40 % of the planktonic carbon ingested by D. magna, and this carbon was assimilated with the same efficiency as that provided by phytoplankton. This suggests a strong coupling between the microbial loop and the classic grazer trophic web at the onset of spring in the lagoon and, consequently, an important contribution of the microbial loop to energy transfer to higher trophic levels (fish). The CRs of Bosmina longirostris, the dominant species in mid-spring, were also low probably because the food concentrations were well above the incipient limiting level. The CRs were higher for 1-15 mu M algae than for < 1 mu m bacteria, indicating positive selective feeding towards larger cells. Algae sized 3-15 mu m provided most of the planktonic carbon ingested by B. longirostris. Similarly, regarding the total mid-spring zooplankton community, phytoplankton contributed 90 % of the planktonic carbon ingested. This suggests that during the spring phytoplankton bloom when cyanobacteria dominate, the energy transferred to zooplankton via bacteria constitutes a smaller fraction than during periods of lower phytoplankton density. Finally, our results indicate that zooplankton consumed a very small proportion of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton production during the two studied periods, which highlights the reduced ability of zooplankton to control phytoplankton growth in hypertrophic systems.

Pollen analysis of core DS7-1SC (Dead Sea) showing intertwined effects of climatic change and human activities in the Late Holocene	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The Dead Sea sediment holds the archives of a complex relationship between ever-changing nature and ancient civilisations. Here the detailed pollen analyses of core DS7-1SC (off-Ein-Gedi) are presented for the first time. The record covers the last 2500 years. The facies changes from halite (when no freshwater flows in the Dead Sea) to laminites (when rainfall provides sufficient inflow for the Jordan and subsidiary rivers) a couple of times through the record. The pollen diagram (supported by the facies change) shows a wetter Roman-Byzantine period, which allowed intensive arboriculture and a wetter period at the end of the XIXth and beginning of the XXth centuries, the latter in good relation with historical and instrumental data. Based on radiocarbon chronologies on several pollen diagrams along the western Dead Sea shore, the transition to drier climates and the transition to pastoralism are suggested to take place between a few decades before the Islamic period and close to this transition. A high-resolution palynological study of the individual laminae forming the laminites (aragonite and gypsum in the summer versus detritics in winter) confirms the seasonal character of the laminae, but throws a note of caution as for their regular annual character.

The ecosystem had been stressed by the annual H+-deposition of around 0.43 kmol/ha. The spring water outflow corresponded to ca. 27% of the precipitation. Budgets for the precipitation input and spring water output gave good balance for Cl-,-0.01 +/- 0.09 kmol/ha, net gains for H+, NO3- and SO42-, and to the contrary, relatively large net losses for Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Si(as H4SiO4) and HCO3-, thus suggesting the dissolution of chemical weathered products of silicate minerals. Further, in spring water, some concentration relationships were found: CNa+ = 376.5-2.05CCl(-) (R-2=0.748), CNa+=12.69+0.5556CHCO(3)(-) (R-2=0.872) and CH4SiO4=130.0 + 1.108CHCO(3)(-) (R-2=0.816). Evidently, the spring water chemistry reflected probable geochemical changes in the soil layer of the watershed. Mass balance in the ecosystem and estimation of the spring water output of chemical weathered products were investigated.																			0049-6979					AUG-SEP	2001	130	1-4	2				805	810		10.1023/A:1013862308289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013862308289													WOS:000172011900105

Study focuses: This study evaluated the degree to which climate is changing in the region, and its impact on stream flow of watersheds simulated by Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5) emission scenario using six climate models including CanESM2, EC-EARTH, CNRM-CM5, HadGEM2-ES, NORESM1-M, and CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 by comparing the last thirty years of the past century (1971-2000) and the same years of this century (2071-2100). Bias correction for maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and rainfall data obtained from all climate models have been done using CMhyd software. The SWAT model is calibrated and validated using eleven sensitive hydrological parameters. New hydrological insights: The result revealed that the change in maximum temperature ranges from 2.93 degrees C (November) and 5.17 degrees C (March), and the change in minimum temperature also ranges from 3.08 degrees C to 4.79 degrees C on a monthly basis. Rainfall is expected to increase up to 29.75% (November) and decrease up to 9.26% (March) in different seasons. Due to the change in climate, a flow is predicted to increase up to 27.82%, 27.47%, 26.47%, and 24.97% in Ribb, Gilgel Abay, Gumara, and Megech watersheds, respectively, and it is also decreasing in winter and spring seasons. On average, the streamflow is expected to increase by 5.89%, 5.63%, 4.92%, and 4.87% in Ribb, Gumara, Megech, and Gilgel Abay watersheds, respectively.					; Phinzi, Kwanele/AAC-8786-2020	Phinzi, Kwanele/0000-0003-1865-7011; 														2214-5818				AUG	2022	42								101175	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101175		JUL 2022											WOS:000854013600003

Our results showed that among the total 133 species identified, Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta dominated the phytoplankton community. In spring, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta were the dominant phyla, and the dominant species included Chlorella sp., Chroomonas acuta Uterm., and Microcystis incerta Lemm.; the density of the phytoplankton ranged from 496 x 10(4) to 6256 x 10(4) cells/L with an average of 2384 x 10(4) cells/L. However, Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta became the dominant phyla in summer, and the dominant species were Chlorella sp., Leptolyngbya valderiana Anagn., and Nephrocytium agardhianum Nageli.; the density of the phytoplankton varied from 318 x 10(4) to 4630 x 10(4) cells/L with an average of 1785 x 10(4) cells/L. The density of the phytoplankton has increased significantly compared to the previous investigations in 2005. The index of Carlson nutritional status (TSIM) and the dominant genus assessment indicated that the majority of Baiyangdian Lake was in eutrophic state.																			1537-744X						2013									436965	10.1155/2013/436965	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/436965								23983633					WOS:000322700300001
J	Junge, FW; Bottger, T				Junge, FW; Bottger, T			Complex investigations of quaternary ice-dammed lake evolution in Central Germany	ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES												Geological-sedimentological (grain size; micromorphology, varve correlation) and geochemical (stable isotopes: O-18/O-16, C-13/C-12) investigations with ice-dammed lake sediments of the Dehlitz-Leipzig varved clay enable to elucidate in detail the palaeosedimentologic and palaeoclimatic conditions in the surrounding of the Elsterian Scandinavian inland-ice sheet a relatively short time before its maximum extension in Central Europe took place. For the space of lime between formation of the ice-dammed glacial lake and its run-over by Scandinavian inland-ice sheet the obtained results allow to distinguish at least Four evolutionary phases. Regarding the palaeosedimentologic relations in the ice-dammed glacial lake these four phases are characterized bg differences in the dynamics of sediment input, suspension density within the water body and existence/absence of stagnation events with syngenetic formation of carbonates under anoxic conditions. During the formation of glacial varves the obtained data seem to support the existence of small seasonal differences which can be due to very cold, long winter- and short, cool summer periods. In this way the time of the first Elsterian glacial maximum, reflected by the varved clays, can be classified as a typical glacial climatic period.																			1025-6016						1996	32	4					363	+		10.1080/10256019608234029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256019608234029								21892867					WOS:A1996WN97500007

The primary emphasis is on to spring and summer Simulium species. Principal component and correlation analyses were used to assess correlative relationships between species distribution and stream site variables. Fifty-five stream sites were sampled between May and August of 1987, 1988, and 1989. The spatial distribution of species examined was nonrandom and correlated with stream size (Simulium caledonense Adler & Currie, S. craigi Adler and Currie, S. tuberosum Lundstrom cytospecies AB, Prosimulium mixtum Syme and Davies) and proximity to lake outlets (S. tuberosum Lundstrom cytospecies FGH, S. vittatum complex Zetterstedt, S. decorum Walker). S. craigi, S. tuberosun AB, S. tuberosum FGH, and S. aureum Fries cytospecies C are reported from Newfoundland for the first time. Because this is the first cytotaxonomic investigation of the S. tuberosum complex from Newfoundland, notes on the cytology of the two sibling species are presented.																			0013-8746					JAN	1995	88	1					51	57		10.1093/aesa/88.1.51	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/88.1.51													WOS:A1995QC81600008

Since the 60's Lake Bourget, one of the largest in France, had been suffering from eutrophication which was checked in 1980 by the diversion of the main sewers entering the lake. A research program was implemented between 1987 and 1990, including an on-site sampling campaign conducted concurrently with thermal and biogeochemical modeling of lake behavior. The model helped provide a better understanding of the ecosystem, displaying some processes hitherto misunderstood: (1) Winter overturn does not reach the bottom of the water column when the weather is mild. This leads to a incomplete reoxygenation of the hypolimnion and to redox conditions inducing the release of orthophosphate from the sediment, (2) Grazing by herbivorous zooplankton is getting more important in the control of spring algal growth as eutrophication of the lake regresses, (3) Settling of particulate phosphorus seems a complex and very important process in Lake Bourget, showing high sedimentation rates for particulate mineral phosphorus.					; Tassin, Bruno/AAW-3517-2021; Vinçon-Leite, Brigitte/Y-1396-2019	Vincon Leite, Brigitte/0000-0002-0190-0209; TASSIN, Bruno/0000-0003-2586-4270													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 24	1995	300						433	442		10.1007/BF00024485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024485													WOS:A1995RB62500043

The number of preys identified in fish stomachs examined is 947. The mean digestive vacuity coefficient (CV) is 56.9%, with a low value in autumn (CV = 33%) compared to spring (CV = 80%). The diet consists mainly of crustaceans (Cladocera, Copepoda) with a main food index (MFI) of 70. Females live up to 5 years and males to 4 years. Their linear growth is described respectively by the following models of Von Bertalanffy: LT = 32.2 (1 - e0.36(t + 0.07)) and LT = 28.2 (1 - e0.41(t + 0.04)). Females grow larger than males, both having a majorant allometric coefficient of the length-weight relationship (3.36 in males, 3.42 in females). Their growth performance index is equal to 2.5 regardless of sex. This index ranks the growth of the population of the Ghrib dam among the best performing R. rutilus population.

Precipitation evolution of Central Asia during the last 5000 years	HOLOCENE												Central Asia is located at the confluence of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems. However, the number of Holocene climate records is still low in most parts of this region and insufficient to allow detailed discussion and comparisons to disentangle the complex climate history and interplays between the different climatic systems. Here, we present the first stalagmite record from arid Central Asia (south-western Kyrgyzstan) by using O-18, C-13, and micro x-ray fluorescence (mu XRF)-sulfur data spanning the last 5000 years. The cave hosting stalagmite Uluu-2 is ideally suited to identify past shifts in seasonal variations in precipitation in this part of the world. Comparison of instrumental and paleo-isotopic studies demonstrates that the Uluu-2 speleothem isotope composition faithfully records climate changes and responds to shifts in the proportion of moisture derived from mid-latitude Westerlies during the winter/spring season. The reconstructions suggest that the area was characterized by a dry climate from 4700 to 3900 yr BP, interrupted by a wet episode around 4200 yr BP. Further drier conditions also occurred between 4000 and 3500 yr BP. Wetter conditions were re-established at ca. 2500 yr BP, after another dry episode between 3000 and 2500 yr BP. With the exception of two short dry events (1150 and 1300 yr BP), the period after 1700 yr BP shows moderate to wet conditions. Regional comparisons suggest that the strength and position of the Westerly winds control climatic shifts in arid Central Asia, leading to complex local responses.					; Cheng, Hai/H-3413-2017; Breitenbach, Sebastian/AAB-1420-2019; Edwards, R./I-3124-2014; Wolff, Christian/GPG-1449-2022; CHENG, HAI/H-3413-2017	Schroder, Birgit/0000-0003-4807-6357; Breitenbach, Sebastian/0000-0001-9615-2065; Cheng, Hai/0000-0002-5305-9458; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JAN	2017	27	1					142	154		10.1177/0959683616652711	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616652711													WOS:000391442600013

Restoration measures and global warming lead to the same outcome, namely that reactive P moves from the sediments to the bottom waters. In this study, a vertical-compressed sediment P transport model was developed and coupled with a three dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic-ecological model (EcoLake). The proposed model was used to evaluate the effects of two different strategies (external loads reduction and global warming) on sediment P release flux and P concentrations in the water column of Lake Chaohu, the fifth largest shallow lake in China. The results found that the coupled model accurately reflected P transport in the water column, sediment, and dissolved reactive P (SRP) diffusion at the sediment and water interface. The degradable rate of rapidly degradable organic P (vp1) and adsorbed rate (kad) are the most sensitive parameters influencing sediment P release flux. The internal SRP loads caused by diffusion accounted for roughly 5% of the total external P loads, with higher values in heavily polluted lake basins (western and eastern) and during warmer seasons (summer and autumn). Sediment P release may have caused the current lake water SRP concentrations to increase by 31.1, 12.0, and 21.2%, in western, central, and eastern basins, respectively, due to the large difference of sediment SRP concentration between three basins. The SRP concentration in water responded to changing loads and water temperature strategies more in the western basin than in the other two basins. The sediment P release flux showed spatially contrary responses between two strategies. These findings have important implications with respect to the effects of sediment P release on water quality, and will assist water quality managers in developing appropriate P control measures.

However, their spatiotemporal shift and the driving forces remain still elusive. Eutrotrophic Dianchi Lake and mesotrophic Erhai Lake are the largest two freshwater lakes on the Yunnan Plateau (southwestern China). The present study investigated the spatiotemporal shift in both planktonic and sediment bacterial populations in these two plateau freshwater lakes at different trophic status. For either lake, both water and sediment samples were collected from six sampling locations in spring and summer. Bacterioplankton community abundance in Dianchi Lake generally far outnumbered that in Erhai Lake. Sediment bacterial communities in Erhai Lake were found to have higher richness and diversity than those in Dianchi Lake. Sediments had higher bacterial community richness and diversity than waters. The change patterns for both planktonic and sediment bacterial communities were lake-specific and season-specific. Either planktonic or sediment bacterial community structure showed a distinct difference between in Dianchi Lake and in Erhai Lake, and an evident structure difference was also found between planktonic and sediment bacterial communities in either of these two lakes. Planktonic bacterial communities in both Dianchi Lake and Erhai Lake mainly included Proteobacteria (mainly Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes, while sediment bacterial communities were mainly represented by Proteobacteria (mainly Beta- and Deltaproteobacteria), Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi, Nitrospirae, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Trophic status could play important roles in shaping both planktonic and sediment bacterial communities in freshwater lakes.					; Wu, Zhen/GZG-5518-2022; liu, yong/AAD-1467-2019; Liu, Yong/B-1826-2008	Wu, Zhen/0000-0001-8474-4274; Liu, Yong/0000-0001-8181-1080													0175-7598	1432-0614				MAY	2016	100	9					4161	4175		10.1007/s00253-015-7253-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7253-2								26711281					WOS:000373744000030

We compared accelerated-growth with spring yearling groups to evaluate (1) return rates of jacks and adults to spawning weirs and to the sport fishery, (2) growth rates, and (3) cost-benefit ratios. Returns to spawning weirs and Wisconsin anglers showed similar patterns. Return rates of jacks were similar for fish stocked as fingerlings and yearlings and were higher in the Root River than in the Kewaunee River for both stocking strategies. The weir and angler rates for adults were higher for fish stocked as yearlings than as fingerlings and were higher in the Root River than in the Kewaunee River for both stocking strategies. Estimated return rates of adults to Wisconsin anglers ranged from 0.0% to 5.4% for fish stocked as fingerlings and from 0.1% to 15.6% for fish stocked as yearlings. Estimated return rates of adults to the weirs ranged from 0.5% to 4.4% for fish stocked as fingerlings and from 0.4% to 11.0% for fish stocked as yearlings. For two year-classes, adult coho salmon stocked as yearlings were found to be significantly longer and heavier than adults of the accelerated-growth group at time of return. Despite higher noncapital costs to produce yearlings ($0.409) than fingerlings ($0,235), the higher return rates of the yearling group resulted in lower costs per returning fish at weirs ($6.84 for yearlings versus $8.27 for accelerated-growth fingerlings) and to anglers ($9.28 for yearlings versus $11.03 for accelerated-growth fingerlings).																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2001	21	1					147	155		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0147:ACOTMO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0147:ACOTMO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289000015

In China, ammonia pollution issues in the Liao River were highlighted from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment annual report. In this study, water quality criteria (WQC) for two types of ammonia (total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and un-ionized ammonia (NH3-N)) and related temporal concentration distributions and ecological risks in the Liao River were investigated. For sampling sites (2014) and national monitoring sites (2008, 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2018) of the Liao River, there were seasonal variations identified for TAN and NH3-N. More specifically, high concentrations of TAN and NH3-N occurred separately in winter and summer, and there were increasing trends for TAN and NH3-N from 2013 to 2018. The acute and chronic WQC values for TAN based on the toxicity values of the Liao River species were 16.86 and 4.39 mg/L (pH of 7.0 and temperature of 20 degrees C), and the acute and chronic WQC values for NH3-N were 0.067 and 0.017 mg/L. The exceedance probabilities of 5% species affected for long-term exposure of TAN and NH3-N were >= 30% in 2014. In addition, the increasing trend of concentrations and ecological risks posed by NH3-N from 2013 should be paying more attention. This study could provide useful information for ammonia environmental risk management in China and ecological risk assessment procedure for NH3-N and TAN exposure in similar surface waters worldwide.

The variance of productivity and the correlation between primary production and zooplankton biomass are functions of the time scale over which model results were averaged. The scatter of data around regressions of annual production versus nutrient loading represents internal system dynamics at a host of time scales, some of which may be regulated by fish populations. An important consequence of these dynamics in that variances and covariances of limnological variables are strongly related to sampling scale. Nutrient loading, hydrology, and spring mixing establish the potential summer productivity of lakes. The realized productivity depends in part on the configuration and dynamics of the food web, which are largely determined by the top carnivore in the system.

Decadal regulation of phytoplankton abundance and water clarity in a large continental reservoir by climatic, hydrologic and trophic processes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Large continental reservoirs are impacted by multiple stressors including climate change, watershed development, food-web alteration, water extraction, hydroelectric-power generation, and industrial aquaculture. Such complexity makes it difficult to identify the hierarchical relationships among regulatory processes, forecast effects of environmental change, or develop adaptive management strategies. Here we present a regression-based analysis of 19 years of limnological change in a representative main-stem reservoir within central North America to suggest that phytoplankton abundance and water clarity are regulated by hierarchical but independent mechanisms. The Qu'Appelle arm of Lake Diefenbaker, Canada, was monitored during summers (May-August) of 1995-2013 to evaluate the unique and interactive effects of continental climate systems, regional meteorology, river hydrology and limnological characteristics on phytoplankton abundance and water clarity. Regression models explained 48-52% of historical variation despite the absence of pronounced temporal patterns in monthly or summer phytoplankton abundance and water clarity. Phytoplankton abundance (mainly diatoms, flagellates) was correlated positively with soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations and inversely with the density of large herbivores, factors which were themselves correlated to variation in chemical conditions (oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon) and dissolved organic carbon content, respectively. In contrast, water clarity varied directly as a function of climate systems (producing warm, dry winters) and inversely with river flow. We conclude that anticipated climate change (warmer, less runoff) will improve water clarity in lacustrine regions of large prairie reservoirs on decadal scales by reducing inorganic turbidity, while nutrient fluxes associated with economic development may independently regulate algal abundance.

Its presence and development depend on biological, physical and chemical factors and in consequence it is an important indicator of ecosystem condition. Monitoring of phytoplankton production, measured as chlorophyll a concentration, is a useful tool for assessing the status of dam reservoirs. Modeled chlorophyll a concentrations are used as water quality indicators in locations not included in monitoring systems, in situations when the temporal resolution of the monitoring is not enough, and in assessments of the impacts of future activities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to find correlations between hydro- and thermodynamics and the chlorophyll a concentration for possible application in reservoir monitoring and management, using an ELCOM-CAEDYM model. The analysis included summer and fall which are most prone to algal blooms, and four phytoplankton groups identified as dominant in the reservoir based on periodic observations. Comparisons of simulated water temperature and both observed and simulated chlorophyll a concentrations confirmed that these variables are significantly correlated (correlation of hourly chlorophyll a and water temperature was 0.70, ranging from 0.55 to 0.81 in the bottom and surface water layers, respectively, while for daily outputs it was 0.74, ranging from 0.60 to 0.83). This relation was stronger than that of chlorophyll a to nutrient (N, P and Si) concentrations. What is more, the method used allowed the assessment of a much more detailed spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton groups compared with conventional monitoring techniques. The study indicated that the phytoplankton community was dominated by Chlorophytes and Diatoms with a larger share of Chlorophytes in shallow parts of the reservoir. This domination was weaker after short water mixing events in summer and especially after the fall turnover. The increase in phytoplankton diversity was estimated to occur mainly near the surface and in shallow parts of the reservoir. Most of the observed concentrations of individual phytoplankton groups differed from simulation results by less than 25% and the model reflected accurately 74% of observed trends in concentrations. Calculated chlorophyll a concentration was well matched to hourly monitoring data (mean squared error = 5.6, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient = 0.51, Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.72 and p-value = 0.0007). High compatibility of the model to the values measured in the reservoir make it a promising tool for the prediction and planning of actions aimed at maintaining good functioning of the reservoir.					; Babczyńska, Agnieszka/ABC-9525-2020; Wilk-Wozniak, Elzbieta/A-4218-2008	Dlugosz, Jacek/0000-0001-5216-3416; Wilk-Wozniak, Elzbieta/0000-0002-4929-6733; Ulanczyk, Rafal/0000-0002-1416-2372; Babczynska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-0000-789X; Woznica, Andrzej/0000-0003-3051-1816; Lozowski, Bartosz/0000-0002-3977-6514													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2021	121								106991	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106991	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106991													WOS:000604888900012

Spain) in the year 2000. Since 2005, a continuous control management programme has been carried out by the Environmental Regional Government. Management efforts aimed to reduce the population size, to contain the dispersal and reduce the probability of deliberate translocation into other rivers caused by illegal captures. A combination of techniques was used, including crayfish traps, manual removal from artificial refuges and electrofishing. In the 2005-2009 period, 31 374 specimens were captured. The mean catch rate per worker and day declined from 30.4 +/- 3.2 specimens in the first year to 9.8 +/- 1.7 in the fourth year, therefore suggesting a sharp decrease in population size. Summer was the period of mating and maximum yields, whereas minimum yields were obtained in Winter, coinciding with egg incubation in burrows. The results obtained and the experience gained will provide essential baseline information for the future management of non-native crayfish in the region.

Concurrent signals in sediment chemistry and diatom assemblages are recorded in the varved sediment sequence, and several distinct periods in the lake's response to climatic amelioration during the early Holocene period are revealed. Diatom-based transfer functions were used to estimate the lake's trophic status. In conjunction with high-resolution geochemical analysis, these data were applied to quantify the magnitude of natural nutrient enrichment. The inferred changes in the lake nutrient status are discussed with reference to the changing environmental conditions and development of the aquatic ecosystem. The major perturbation of the lake occurred with the rapid eutrophication at 9820 cal BP. Following a period of decreasing productivity due to a meromictic phase of Lake Holzmaar, an accelerated release of phosphorus from the sediment occurred and diatom-inferred total phosphorus concentrations increased rapidly. Longer hydraulic residence times in Lake Holzmaar are assumedly related to elevated evaporative transpiration rates and increasing temperatures. Indication of milder winter and increasing summer temperatures at this time is in agreement with interpretation of the pollen data and changes in the seasonal characteristics of the diatom assemblages.

J	Malm, J				Malm, J			Some properties of currents and mixing in a shallow ice-covered lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A study on characteristics of currents and mixing in a shallow ice-covered Russian lake is presented. The current velocity data are separated into four main components, mean velocity, uninodal longitudinal and transverse seiche currents, and "high"-frequency velocity fluctuations, using digital filters. The analysis of components shows that mean currents are most pronounced in early winter and are of the order of 1-10 mm s(-1) All three oscillatory components are, on average, of the same magnitude, 0.1-1 mm s(-1), and about the same as mean currents in midwinter, and do not show any pronounced differences during winter. Mean currents increase during the convective period in late winter up to several millimeters per second. Apart from possible local hydrodynamic instability, induced by salt fluxes at the ice and bottom boundaries, and local turbulence near the boundaries in early winter, the vertical mixing in early winter and midwinter in the lake appears to be determined solely by molecular processes.

J	HART, RC; JARVIS, AC				HART, RC; JARVIS, AC			INSITU DETERMINATIONS OF BACTERIAL SELECTIVITY AND FILTRATION-RATES BY 5 CLADOCERAN ZOOPLANKTERS IN A HYPERTROPHIC SUBTROPICAL RESERVOIR	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Cladoceran in situ feeding rates on natural bacteria labelled with [methyl-H-3]thymidine were studied in parallel with feeding rate determinations on C-14-labelled Chlorella in a hypertrophic subtropical reservoir (Lake Hartbeespoort) through spring and summer (1986/87). Community filtration rates (CFRs) on bacteria and algae were similar, but selection for Chlorella (relative to natural bacteria) increased from midsummer in association with declining bacterial density and increasing dominance of 'inedible' components of the natural phytoplankton. Species-specific filtration rates (SSFRs) were determined for Daphnia pulex/longispina, Ceriodaphnia reticulata, Diaphanosoma excisum, Bosmina longirostris and Moina micrura during their respective seasonal occurrence in the study period. SSFRs on algae and bacteria increased with body length (L, mm) in all species apart from Bosmina. Species-specific differences in absolute feeding rate (FR, ml animal-1 day-1), the slope of the FR-L relationship and bacteria selectivity were evident. The feeding rate of all cladocerans on bacteria is described by the power equation FR = 5.231L1.42. FR values on bacteria relative to FR values on algae averaged approximately 60% overall for all size classes of Daphnia, with ranges of 70-85, 58-79, 34-63 and 50-117% in various body length classes of Ceriodaphnia, Diaphanosoma, Bosmina and Moina, respectively. Size dependency was evident in certain taxa. Selectivity coefficients (SCs) were approximately 2 on average, indicating algal preferences in all taxa apart from Ceriodaphnia, whose SC was approximately 1 (unselective feeding). Food selectivity was independent of grazer size in Daphnia, Diaphanosoma and Bosmina, but algal preference increased with body size in Ceriodaphnia and particularly Moina. Estimates indicate that bacteria contribute relatively little (less-than-or-equal-to 3%) of the total dietary carbon intake of cladoceran zooplankters in Lake Hartbeespoort, thus challenging earlier views that bacteria are major dietary components of the summer grazer community in eutrophic waters. The findings are discussed in relation to other recent studies of freshwater zooplankton feeding ecology.																			0142-7873					MAR	1993	15	3					295	315		10.1093/plankt/15.3.295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/15.3.295													WOS:A1993KP15500003

Estimation of soil strength in fine-grained soils by instrumented free-fall sphere tests	GEOTECHNIQUE												The dynamic response of a sphere in soft clay is considered through field tests in which a 0.25 m dia. steel sphere was allowed to free-fall in water and dynamically penetrate the underlying soft soil. The test data, collected in a lake and a sea environment, relate to sphere velocities of up to 8 m/s, reaching sphere invert embedments close to ten diameters. An inertial measurement unit located within the sphere measured the motion response of the sphere during free-fall and penetration in soil. The resulting acceleration data were used within a simple framework that accounts for both geotechnical shearing resistance and fluid mechanics drag resistance, but cast in terms of a single capacity factor that can be expressed in terms of the non-Newtonian Reynolds number. The merit of the framework is demonstrated by using it as a forward model in a series of inverse analyses that calculate the undrained shear strength profile from acceleration data measured in free-fall sphere tests. The good match between these profiles and those obtained from 'push-in' piezoball penetrometer tests points to the potential for an instrumented free-fall sphere to be used as a tool for characterising the near-surface strength of soft seabeds.

The reservoir behaves as a warm monomictic water body that is stratified throughout the year except for a short mixing period in winter. During stratification, vertical circulation was very weak and the hypolimnion was anoxic. The metalimnion range and thermocline location were affected significantly by the outlet height. Spatial and temporal variations in turbidity indicate that suspended matter was predominantly clay minerals with low organic contents. The behavior of turbid currents entering the reservoir was determined by density differences between inflow and impounded water. Because of particle size, shape of suspended matter, and weak vertical circulation, the suspended matter persisted in the water column for months. The water clarity of the lacustrine zone was affected significantly by water level variation, which is considered a comprehensive effect of stratification, resuspension, landforms, and hydrologic condition of the reservoir. Management recommendations on withdrawal selection and water level regulation are proposed to improve water quality.

J	REED, A; CHAPDELAINE, G; DUPUIS, P				REED, A; CHAPDELAINE, G; DUPUIS, P			USE OF FARMLAND IN SPRING BY MIGRATING CANADA GEESE IN ST-LAWRENCE VALLEY, QUEBEC	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												In spring 1973-75, at least 165,000 Canada geese staged on the St. Lawrence river in Quebec [Canada]. Their overall numbers have increased by 36.5% since the mid 1960''s, but one area, Lake St. Peter, has been the site of a 6-fold increase. The introduction of maize and heavy spring flooding appear to have contributed to the build-up of goose numbers in Lake St. Peter by providing attractive food and roosting sites. During their spring stop-offs in Lake St. Peter, which averaged 32 days (1974-75), the geese flew twice daily to feed on agricultural land up to 13 km from the Lake. About 6 h/day were spent feeding. About 60% of goose feeding on farmland in spring occurred on grassland, 16% on fields of last year''s maize (standing and stubble), 12% on plowed grass and 12% on plowed maize. When compared to the availability of the different field types, the data indicate equal preferences for fields of grass and maize, and avoidance of plowed areas. Differences in usage and preferences were recorded in relation to field location, time of season and severity of flooding. Foods consumed by Canada geese on agricultural land included a wide variety of native and cultivated grasses (foliage, roots and seeds), waste grains and weeds. Grass foliage was the most important item and was consumed in all field types, followed by waste maize kernels. Clover and alfalfa, often readily available in grass fields, were rarely taken. Even heavy grazing by geese in spring did not result in a reduction of the yield of fodder at harvest 2-3 mo. later. A few farmers may have suffered minor economic losses when exceptionally severe goose grazing occurred. Present evidence indicates that in those rare situations where warranted concern for crop yields exists, the problem could be remedied by simple changes in farm husbandry and by the use of scaring devices. The threat of continually increasing numbers of geese in the area in future years may not materialize if spring flood does not continue at the extreme levels recorded in the early 1970''s and if maize becomes a crop of more widespread occurrence through the St. Lawrence.																			0021-8901	1365-2664					1977	14	3					667	680		10.2307/2402802	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2402802													WOS:A1977EG00500001

These data, plus profiles of porewater and sediment chemistry, demonstrated that in all of the lakes H+ was being actively consumed by both sulfate reducers and dentrifiers. Both of these microbial activities were assayed in sediments overlaid by oxygenated water, demonstrating that anoxic hypolimnia are not required for in situ alkalinity production. Neither short term experimental acidification nor long term atmospheric acidification had detectably inhibited the activity of these two types of bacteria. Both processes were active at pH 4.5. In lakes that were receiving significant quantities of both nitric acid and sulfuric acids, short term H+ consumption from dentrification was 1.5-2 times faster than H+ consumption by sulfate reduction. However on an annual basis, because of loss of reduced sulfur during fall and winter, long term H+ consumption by dentrification was estimated to be 4-5 times as large as H+ consumption by sulfate reduction.					; St. Louis, Vincent/G-6842-2011	Kelly, Carol/0000-0003-2473-7560; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1986	31	6					1267	1280		10.4319/lo.1986.31.6.1267	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.6.1267													WOS:A1986F578800006
J	BRADFORD, DF				BRADFORD, DF			WINTERKILL, OXYGEN RELATIONS, AND ENERGY-METABOLISM OF A SUBMERGED DORMANT AMPHIBIAN, RANA-MUSCOSA	ECOLOGY												Both larval and metamorphosed R. muscosa (mountain yellow-legged frog) overwinter for 6-9 mo. in ice-covered lakes and streams at high elevation (.ltoreq. 3700 m) in California and Nevada [USA]. In some winters almost all the frogs in shallow lakes (< 4 m deep) die. This mortality is associated with O2 depletion, which occurs most rapidly in shallow lakes. Tadpoles survive for months in nearly anoxic conditions when shallow lakes are frozen to the bottom. In the laboratory at low PO2 [partial pressure of O2], O2 metabolism of overwintering tadpoles at 4.degree.C differed from that of frogs. The critical O2 tension (Pc) of tadpoles (1.98 kPa [K Pascals]) was significantly lower than for frogs (4.04 kPa). Also, when PO2 was greater than Pc, the resting O2 consumption .ovrhdot.VO2 of tadpoles partially conformed to PO2; the resting .ovrhdot.VO2 of frogs was constant. At the atmospheric PO2 of their natural environment (PO2 .apprxeq. 13.3 kPa), however, the resting .ovrhdot.VO2 of tadpoles was not significantly different from that of frogs. Tadpoles apparently have 2 advantages over frogs during winter: a greater tolerance of low PO2 and a reduced consumption of energy and O2 at low PO2. Unlike a number of anuran species which become dormant on land at temperatures above 4.degree., the resting .ovrhdot.VO2 of metamorphosed R. muscosa overwintering at 4.degree. was nearly the same as for summer-acclimated individuals in air at 4.degree.. During 7 mo. of dormancy, the standard metabolic rate of both tadpoles and frogs remained constant. Resting .ovrhdot.VO2 of frogs in water at 4.degree., in air at 4.degree., and in air at 15.degree. was related to the 0.83-0.85 power of body mass.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1983	64	5					1171	1183		10.2307/1937827	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1937827													WOS:A1983RJ86800025

Seven maturity stages for ovaries and 5 for testes could be easily identified using external characters. The size at 1st maturity for females is around 97.5 mm and for males around 87.0 mm, the males being much smaller than females. Individuals of C. commersonii are batch or fractional spawners releasing eggs at seasonal spawnings during the prolonged breeding season. With an asynchronous breeding population, C. commersonii has an almost year-round breeding season with 3 peaks and a small summer break or premonsoon fall in spawning activity. The presence of fry and juvenile populations in the natural waters almost throughout the year with peak and lull periods also corroborate these findings. The average male to female ratio is around 1:2.5, the females outnumbering the males almost throughout the 2-yr period especially during lull periods in spawning activity. Fecundity ranged from 21,380-338,065 eggs, the curvilinear relationship between fecundity and weight of fish, standard length of fish, length of ovary and weight of ovary showing statistical significance at 1% level.																			0044-5231						1984	212	3-4					240	256																WOS:A1984SK44200014
J	HAIRSTON, NG; DILLON, TA; DESTASIO, BT				HAIRSTON, NG; DILLON, TA; DESTASIO, BT			A FIELD-TEST FOR THE CUES OF DIAPAUSE IN A FRESH-WATER COPEPOD	ECOLOGY												The freshwater calanoid copepod Diaptomus sanguineus switches each year in spring from making eggs that hatch immediately to making diapausing eggs that rest in lake sediments for an extended period. In lakes and ponds containing planktivorous fish, the timing of the switch is highly consistent between years and comes at the theoretically optimal time (late March) to avoid intense summer predation. In fishless ponds the timing comes 1-2 mo later. We investigate here the environmental cues used by the copepods to time the switch to diapause. Through the use of both field and laboratory manipulations, we show that temperature and photoperiod play central roles as diapause stimuli. A field manipulation of fish density failed to reveal either a direct induction of diapause or any more subtle effects of fish occurrence on diapause timing. The copepods made immediately hatching eggs under short-day or low-temperature conditions, and diapausing eggs under long days or high temperatures. There appears to be variation between individuals in their responses to temperature and photoperiod so that similar diapause phenologies are produced by different sensitivities to the environmental cues.

We hypothesized that environ -mental factors, such as sediment load, water surface slope, and precipitation, may impact the effectiveness of using phytoplankton diversity as a water quality indicator. To test this hypothesis, the Yellow River was selected for phytoplankton diversity and water quality assessments. We measured water quality parameters, calculated phytoplankton diversity indices, and collected data on geo-climatic variables at 130 sampling points in the Yel-low River mainstream over two seasons (spring and autumn) in 2019. The results of the water quality assessment based on phytoplankton diversity indices were compared with those based on water quality index (WQI). Cor -relation analysis, multiple stepwise regression, distance-based redundancy analysis, and regression modeling were used to explore the biogeographical patterns and drivers of phytoplankton diversity. According to the WQI, the water quality gradually deteriorated from the source to the estuary of the river. Three biodiversity in-dices (Margalef, Pielou, and Shannon-Wiener) indicated that the water quality varied dynamically in the middle reaches of the river. The actual relationships between the biodiversity indices and WQI did not fit well with the standard curves of water quality classification based on the respective biodiversity indices and WQI. Variation partitioning analysis indicated that water quality parameters, such as sediment and nutrient load, were the dom-inant drivers of variation in phytoplankton diversity in most cases, with the contribution ranging from 11.0% to 25.7%. Geo-climatic factors, such as water surface slope and annual mean precipitation, also affected phytoplank-ton diversity, with the contribution reaching 27.8%. Therefore, in sediment-laden rivers with a large geographical span and complex environment, phytoplankton diversity cannot be used as a suitable water quality indicator, al-beit it can reflect habitat changes to a certain extent.

J	Malmaeus, JM; Blenckner, T; Markensten, H; Persson, I				Malmaeus, JM; Blenckner, T; Markensten, H; Persson, I			Lake phosphorus dynamics and climate warming: A mechanistic model approach	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Model results in this work indicate that lakes may respond very differently to climate change depending on their physical character. A physical lake model and a mechanistic phosphorus model are combined with two temperature scenarios generated by a regional climate model (RCM) in three sites in central Sweden-Lake Erken and two basins of Lake Malaren (Galten and Ekoln). In the phosphorus model water mixing, mineralization, diffusion and biouptake are temperature dependent. In the simulations, Lake Erken is much more sensitive to climate warming than the two basins of Lake Malaren, and the reason is shown to be the much longer water residence time in Lake Erken (7 years), stressing the importance of internal lake processes. In Galten and Ekoln the water residence times are less than I year, and the effects of water temperature changes are small. In Lake Erken the concentration of epilimnetic-dissolved phosphorus is almost doubled in spring and autumn in the warmest climate scenario. Since the lake is mostly phosphorus limited, this means that the potential for phytoplankton production is almost doubled. The implication would be that in Lake Erken, and in other eutrophic lakes with long water residence times, eutrophication problems may become serious in the future, and that managers may need to take action today in order to maintain good water quality in these lakes.

Turkey is rich in biodiversity of freshwater fish and has a high level of endemicity of native ichthyofauna, which is vulnerable to such introductions. The Gelingullu Reservoir located on the Kizilirmak drainage in Central Anatolia has rich ichthyofauna with native and introduced fish species, including endemic species. The contents of the foregut of P. parva samples collected between Summer 2003 and Summer 2005 were examined. Seasonal and ontogenetic changes in feeding intensity were determined. P. parva mainly feeds on zooplankton such as Cladocera, Copepoda, and Rotifera. Members of the Bacillariophyta and Cyanobacteria were identified in high proportions in the foregut contents of P. parva particularly during summer. The feeding traits of this invasive fish may have an influence on the establishment of a successful population in Gelingullu reservoir.

The new reconstruction is based on nine different calibration approaches and errors were estimated conservatively. Summer temperatures of the last millennium are characterised by two warm (AD 1053-1171 and 1823-1996) and two cold phases (AD 1172-1379 and 1573-1822). Highest pre-industrial summer temperatures of the 12th century were 0.3 degrees C warmer than the 20th century mean but 0.35 degrees C colder than proxy derived temperatures at the end of the 20th century.

A Random Forest in the Great Lakes: Stream Nutrient Concentrations Across the Transboundary Great Lakes Basin	EARTHS FUTURE												Excess nutrient inputs from agricultural and urban sources have accelerated eutrophication and increased the incidence of algal blooms in the Great Lakes Basin (GLB). Lake basin management to address these threats relies on understanding the key drivers of pollution. Here, we use a random forest machine learning model to leverage information from 202 monitored streams in the GLB to predict seasonal and annual flow-weighted concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as nutrient ratios across the GLB. Land use (agricultural and urban land) and land management (tile drainage and wetland density) emerge as the two most important predictors for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; NO3- + NO2-) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP; PO43), while soil type and wetland density are more important for particulate P (PP). Partial dependence plots demonstrate increasing nutrient concentrations with increasing tile density and decreasing wetland density. In addition, increasing tile and livestock densities and decreasing forest cover correspond to higher SRP:Total Phosphorus (TP) ratios. Seasonally, the highest proportions of SRP occur in summer and fall. Higher livestock densities are also correlated with increasing N:P (DIN:TP) ratios. Livestock operations can contribute to the buildup of soil nutrients from excess manure application, while increasing subsurface drainage can provide transport pathways for dissolved nutrients. Given that both SRP:TP and the N:P ratios are strong predictors of harmful algal blooms, our study highlights the importance of livestock management, drainage management, and wetland restoration in efforts to address eutrophication in intensively managed landscapes.

Assessment of interconnection between surface water and groundwater in Sawa Lake area, southern Iraq, using stable isotope technique	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Interaction between surface water represented by the Euphrates River, natural springs, and Sawa Lake with groundwater ( 11 wells) in southern Iraq was investigated in this study. Water samples were collected for hydrochemistry and stable isotope ( H-2 and O-18) analysis. Sampling of water from determined stations ( 10 stations along the Euphrates, 3 springs, and Sawa Lake) were carried out during two stages; the first was in October 2013( dry season) and the second one was in March 2014 ( wet season). The aim of the research is to assess the interaction of groundwater-surface water, which includes Al-Atshan River ( branch of the Euphrates River), Sawa Lake, and the groundwater in the study area by using hydrochemistry and stable isotope techniques. The results indicate that surface waters have a different type of water from that of groundwater. In delta 2H and delta O-18 diagrams, all groundwater, springs, and Sawa Lake waters are plotted below the Global Meteoric Water Line ( GMWL) and the local meteoric water line ( LMWL) indicating the influence of evaporation processes and seasonal variation. The LMWL deviates by a d-excess about + 13.71 toward the East Mediterranean meteoric water line ( EMWL) indicating that the origin of the vapor source is the Mediterranean Sea. The river water has different isotopic compositions from that of groundwater, springs, and Sawa Lake. The final conclusion is that there is no clear influence of the groundwater on the river water while there is an intermixing between the groundwater in the different locations in the study area.

To protect receiving waters and to achieve services such as flood control and storm water quality mitigation, new wetlands are created in urbanized areas. However, our knowledge of greenhouse gas exchange in newly created wetlands in urban areas is currently limited. In this paper we present measurements carried out at a created urban wetland in Southern Finland in the boreal climate. We conducted measurements of ecosystem CO2 flux and CH4 flux (FCH4) at the created storm water wetland Gateway in Nummela, Vihti, Southern Finland, using the eddy covariance (EC) technique. The measurements were commenced the fourth year after construction and lasted for 1 full year and two subsequent growing seasons. Besides ecosystemscale fluxes measured by the EC tower, the diffusive CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the open-water areas (FwCO(2) and FwCH(4), respectively) were modelled based on measurements of CO2 and CH4 concentration in the water. Fluxes from the vegetated areas were estimated by applying a simple mixing model using the above-mentioned fluxes and the footprintweighted fractional area. The half-hourly footprint-weighted contribution of diffusive fluxes from open water ranged from 0% to 25.5% in 2013. The annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the studied wetland was 8.0 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), with the 95% confidence interval between 18:9 and 34.9 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), and FCH4 was 3.9 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1), with the 95% confidence interval between 3.75 and 4.07 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1). The ecosystem sequestered CO2 during summer months (June-August), while the rest of the year it was a CO2 source. CH4 displayed strong seasonal dynamics, higher in summer and lower in winter, with a sporadic emission episode in the end of May 2013. Both CH4 and CO2 fluxes, especially those obtained from vegetated areas, exhibited strong diurnal cycles during summer with synchronized peaks around noon. The annual FwCO(2) was 297.5 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) and FwCH(4) was 1.73 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1). The peak diffusive CH4 flux was 137.6 nmol C-CH4 m(-2) s(-1), which was synchronized with the FCH4. Overall, during the monitored time period, the established storm water wetland had a climate-warming effect with 0.263 kgCO(2)-eqm(-2) yr(-1) of which 89% was contributed by CH4. The radiative forcing of the open-water areas exceeded that of the vegetation areas (1.194 and 0.111 kgCO(2)-eqm(-2) yr(-1), respectively), which implies that, when considering solely the climate impact of a created wetland over a 100-year horizon, it would be more beneficial to design and establish wetlands with large patches of emergent vegetation and to limit the areas of open water to the minimum necessitated by other desired ecosystem services.

It is necessary to identify the factors causing the deterioration of water quality and to plan measures for their mitigation. Analyses of the external and internal nutrient loading were carried out for the hypereutrophic Raczynskie Lake. The study included flows from lake tributaries, stormwater runoff from impermeable areas and direct catchment impact as external sources of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as bottom sediments as an internal source of phosphorus. In the case of external sources, the largest load (about 80% of N and 67% of P) is supplied from croplands via the shoreline. Both external and internal loading was characterized by distinct seasonal variability. The loads from watercourses supplying the lake played the most significant role in spring, whereas the release of phosphorus from bottom sediments (accounting for 81.4% of the total P load) was responsible for cyanobacterial blooms in summer. In order to improve Raczynskie Lake water quality it is crucial to implement both in-catchment and in-lake measures by means of diversion of stormwater runoff, reduction of nutrient content in some of tributaries at their inflow to the lake (gabions filled with dolomite surrounded by macrophytes) and restoration treatments aiming at the inactivation of phosphorus in the water column and reduction of its release from sediments.					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018	Kowalczewska-Madura, Katarzyna/0000-0003-0243-1085; Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Dondajewska-Pielka, Renata/0000-0002-6761-0669; 														2073-4441				SEP	2022	14	18							2844	10.3390/w14182844	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14182844													WOS:000858849700001

The lake belongs to the national (LTER-Italy), European (LTER-Europe) and International (ILTER) long-term ecological research networks. Data were collected during the summer-autumn period in 2019-2021. Chironomids (Insecta, Diptera) and oligochaetes (Annelida, Clitellata) were identified to genus/species gr./species level by the authors. All 600 occurrence records are georeferenced and organised in a standardised Darwin Core Archive format. These data gathered along the littoral of Lake Maggiore will contribute to the development of common implementation strategies for shared and sustainable water management level of the lake, with particular reference to the protected natural areas (sites belonging to Natura 2000 network in Italy and to the Emerald Network in Switzerland). The authors strongly believe in the great potential of open access occurrence records in biogeographical studies and ecological research in the context of global environmental changes. For that reason, the dataset has been uploaded to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an intergovernmental free and open access biodiversity data infrastructure.

Spatial and temporal perspectives on spring break-up flooding in the Slave River Delta, NWT	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Spatial and temporal patterns of spring break-up flooding in the slave River Delta (SRD). Northwest Territories are characterized during three years (2003-2005) usign water isotope tracers and total inorganic suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations measured form lakewater samples collected shortly after the spring melt. Strongly contrasting spring melt periods led to a moderate flood in 2003, no flooding in 2004 and widespread flooding in 2005. Flooded lakes have isotopcally-depleted delta O-18(delta H-2) signatures, ranging between -19.2 parts per thousand (-145 parts per thousand) and -17.1 parts per thousand (-146 parts per thousand) and most have high TSS concentrations (>10 mg L-1) while non-flooded lakes have more isotopically-enriched delta 18O (delta 2H) signatures rnaging between -18.2 parts per thousand (-149 parts per thousand) and -10.6 parts per thousand (-118 parts per thousand) and low TSS concentrations (<10 mg L-1). These results in conjunction with the isotopic signatures of Slave River water and snowmelt are used to estimate the proportion of river- or snowmelt-induced dilution in delta lakes during the spring of each study year. Calculatins idicate river flooding caused dilution of similar to 70-100% in delta lakes, while snowmelt dilution in the absence of river flooding ranged form similar to 0-56%. A positive relationship exists between the spatial extent of spring flooding in the SRD and level and discharge on the slave river and upstream tributaries suggesting that upstream flow generation plays a key role in deltermining the magnitude of spring flooding in the SRD. parallel variations in the 46-year instrumental Slave River discharge record and flood stratigraphy in the active delta indicate that there is potential for extending the flood history of the SRD a development that will contribute to a more robust understanding of the drivers of histroic, contemporary and futrure flood frequency in the delta.

Geochemistry, water balance, and stable isotopes of a "clean" pit lake at an abandoned tungsten mine, Montana, USA	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The Calvert Mine is a small tungsten-rich (scheelite) skarn deposit in a remote, mountainous region of southwest Montana, USA. The open-pit mine closed in the 1970s and subsequently flooded to form a pit lake that is roughly conical in shape, 30 m deep and 120 m in diameter, with no surface inlet or outlet. The lake is holomictic with a groundwater flow-through hydrology and an estimated residence time of 2.5-5 y. Water isotopes show that the lake is at an approximate steady state with respect to water balance and has experienced 30% evaporation. The lake has a near-neutral pH, exceptional clarity, and extremely low concentrations of nutrients, sulfate, and most metals, including tungsten. Manganese concentrations are slightly elevated and increase with depth towards the sediment-water interface. Despite seasonally anoxic conditions in the deep water, dissolved Fe concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than Mn, suggesting that insufficient organic carbon is present in the sediment of this oligotrophic lake to drive bacterial Fe reduction. Based on stable isotope fingerprinting, diffuse seepage that enters a nearby headwater stream at the base of a large waste-rock pile can be directly linked to the partially evaporated pit lake. However, this seepage has neutral pH and low metal concentrations, and poses no threats to the environment. Stable isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are used to track the relative importance of photosynthesis and respiration with depth. In summer, a zone of high productivity exists near the base of the chemocline, releasing DO that is isotopically light. Respiration exceeds photosynthesis below the Secchi depth, which causes DO concentrations to approach zero towards the bottom of the lake. In winter, thick ice and snow cover prohibits photosynthesis. However, because of the low nutrient content, most of the volume of the lake remains oxic through the winter. Overall, the Calvert Lake is a good example of a pit lake formed from metal mining that has excellent water quality, which is a result of its favorable geology (paucity of sulfide minerals) and hydrology (flow-through lake with short residence time in a temperate climate).

J	Addis, CE; Bret-Harte, MS				Addis, Claire E.; Bret-Harte, Marion S.			The importance of secondary growth to plant responses to snow in the arctic	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												In arctic environments, drifting snow around large shrub patches during winter may enhance growth by insulating the soil and facilitating overwinter nutrient turnover, leading to increased summer plant growth and potentially widespread increases in shrub cover. To determine whether snow enhances growth of arctic plants, we examined the effect of 6 years of added snow on plant biomass allocation and growth of nine common vascular plant species collected in 2010 and 2011 on either side of snowfences established in 2005 across a gradient of shrub biomass and productivity near Toolik Lake, Alaska. The deciduous shrub Salix pulchra responded most positively to added snow showing an 88% increase in total ramet biomass, because increased secondary growth allowed plants to support more branches and leaves. Some graminoid species also showed growth increases, especially where they were more abundant and larger than nearby shrub species. Species sharing the same growth strategy (deciduous shrubs, evergreen shrubs and graminoids) responded differently to increased snow, with some showing increased growth, others showing decreased growth, and some showing no effects. We found that relative biomass per ramet in combination with growth strategy is a better predictor of species' growth responses to added snow than growth strategy alone. Our research shows that a primary mechanism for enhanced growth of shrubs in response to deeper snow is increased secondary growth. Improved growth may be an important way in which arctic plants spread, since they are often long-lived and clonal, and this may help explain the increase in shrub cover observed across northern latitudes.

Holocene environmental change in Kamchatka: A synopsis	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												We present a synthesis of the results of a multiproxy, multisite, palaeoecological study of Holocene environmental change in Kamchatka, Far East Russia, details of which are presented elsewhere in the volume. We summarise the results of the analyses of pollen, diatom, chironomid, and testate amoebae assemblages, together with stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon, and sediment characteristics from the sediments of five lakes and a peat succession on a latitudinal gradient of the Kamchatka Peninsula, to infer environmental change and establish the major climate forcers and climatic teleconnections. There are synchronous shifts in the assemblage composition of most of the biota and across most sites at 6.5-62 ka BP, 5.2 ka BP, 4.0 ka BP, and 3.5 ka BP, suggesting a response to strong regional climate forcing at these times. These dates correspond to the warmest part of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) (6.5-6.2 ka BP), the beginning of the Neoglacial cooling (5.2 ka BP), the coolest and wettest part of the Neoglacial (4.0 ka BP), and a switch to warmer and drier conditions at 3.5 ka BP. Our results provide evidence for the penetration and domination of different air masses at different periods during the Holocene. Cool and dry periods in winter (e.g., at 6.0 ka BP) were driven by a relatively weak pressure gradient between the Siberian High and the Aleutian Low, whereas cool, wet periods in winter (e.g., the Neoglacial and during the LIA) developed when these two systems increased in strength. Warm, dry, continental periods in summer (e.g., at 2.5 ka BP) were driven by a weakening of the Siberian High. We find that the timing of the HTM in Kamchatka is later than in the Eurasian arctic but similar to northern Europe and the sub-arctic part of eastern Siberia. This progressive onset of the HTM was due to the effects of postglacial ice-sheet decay that modulated the routes of westerly storm tracks in Eurasia. A major ecosystem driver was the Siberian dwarf pine Pinus pumila, which spread northward during the Holocene in response to increasing winter snow, and caused water chemistry changes on arrival in the catchments of our study lakes and a response in diatom and chironomid assemblages. We also detect shortterm responses, especially in diatom assemblages, to water chemistry changes following volcanic ash deposits. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Pope, KL; Willis, DW; Lucchesi, DO				Pope, KL; Willis, DW; Lucchesi, DO			Influence of temperature and precipitation on age-0 white bass abundance in two South Dakota natural lakes	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Age-0 white bass (Morone chrysops) were sampled during late summer-early fall from 1984 to 1993 in Enemy Swim and Pickerel lakes, South Dakota, with a bottom trawl. Age-0 white bass catch per unit effort (CPUE) among years was correlated (r = 0.69; (P) under bar = 0.027) between these two natural lakes, indicating that environmental factors were likely affecting white bass recruitment similarly in the two water bodies. Therefore, we assessed climatological variables to help explain variability in abundance of age-0 white bass among years. Age-0 white bass abundance was positively correlated with mean daily air temperature during June in both Enemy Swim (r = 0.63; (P) under bar = 0.051) and Pickerel (r = 0.62; (P) under bar = 0.056) lakes. In addition, multiple regression analysis indicated that precipitation and temperature jointly and positively influenced age-0 white bass abundance in both lakes. Although these are not necessarily cause-and-effect relations, they do provide insight into the importance of environmental conditions for successful recruitment of white bass in South Dakota natural lakes.

J	Arhonditsis, GB; Brett, MT				Arhonditsis, GB; Brett, MT			Eutrophication model for Lake Washington (USA) Part II - model calibration and system dynamics analysis	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We developed a complex eutrophication model to simulate the current chemical and biological properties of Lake Washington (USA). The model reproduces the key epilimnetic and hypolimnetic temporal patterns of the system and results in a good fit between simulated and observed monthly values. The relative error of model estimates was below 20% for most of the water quality parameters (phytoplankton, phosphate, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen). Discrepancies between simulated and observed ammonium levels were mainly due to the explicitly modeled egestion of excess nitrogen during zooplankton feeding. This indicates that the relation between secondary production and nutrient recycling has significant effects on the fractionation of the major elements (C, N and P) and regulates their distribution between the particulate/dissolved and inorganic/organic pools. The model was forced by 1962 nutrient loadings, when the lake received large quantities of treated wastewater treatment effluent, and accurately predicted the phytoplankton community responses (phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacteria dominance) and the nitrogen and phosphorus annual cycles for these conditions. We used Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce the meteorological forcing (air temperature, solar radiation, precipitation and subsequent river inflows) that in large part regulates phytoplankton interannual variability for the last 25 years in the lake. We found three seasonal components (modes of variability). The first component (January, May, November, December) is associated with the conditions that determine the abundance of the herbivorous cladocerans; the second component (June-September) coincides with the summer-stratified period, and the third component (February-April) is associated with the initiation and peak of the spring bloom. Finally, an illustrative application of two scenarios of nutrient loading increase at 25% of the 1962 levels indicated that both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria growth are likely to be stimulated. The three seasonal components still characterize phytoplankton dynamics, but changes in the relationships between summer phytoplankton/cyanobacteria biomass and total phosphorus/phosphate concentrations indicate the likelihood of structural shifts towards relaxation of the present phosphorus-limiting conditions and promotion of cyanobacteria dominance. Integration of the present eutrophication model with a hydrodynamic model with enhanced vertical resolution will allow more realistic predictions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This question requires a deep understanding of the long-term correlation between temperature and monsoon rainfall changes. We selected Yunlong Lake, a climate-sensitive subalpine lake located on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, to study this issue. We semi-quantitatively revealed warm-season temperature changes using the relative abundance of warm-preference planktic diatoms, namely Achnanthidium catenatum and Aulacoseira granulata var. angustissima, found in our diatom seasonal survey. Meanwhile, by examining the spatial pattern of surface diatom assemblages along the water depth gradient, two diatom-water depth transfer functions were constructed by using the modern analogue technique (MAT) and weighted average partial least squares regression (WAPLS) method, which were used to quantitatively reconstruct past lake water level changes. Comparison with independent modern monitoring records, the warm-water diatom indicators and the two diatom transfer functions suggest to be sensitive and reliable for reconstructing long-term temperature and rainfall changes in the Indian Monsoon domain. Based on this, and relying on the complete Holocene sedimentary records from the profundal zone of the lake, we reconstructed the warm-season temperature changes and lake water level fluctuations during the Holocene. Our reconstruction indicates that the temperature and rainfall in the Indian Monsoon domain exhibit a synchronous, 'three-stage' stepwise change over the multimillennial scale of the Holocene. These stages are roughly marked by the climate events of 8.2 ka and 4.2 ka, with the maximum warm-season temperature and lake water level occurring during the middle Holocene. We find that the maximum rainfall and heat during the middle Holocene in this region roughly coincide with the peak of warm-season (summer-autumn) insolation. This may be related to the significant thermal difference between land and ocean at that time, suggesting a synchronous change in rainfall and temperature in Indian Monsoon domain over long timescales.

J	OHLE, W				OHLE, W			NUTRIENT SUPPLY OF LAKE GREBINER SEE BY ATMOSPHERIC PRECIPITATION AND SURFACE RUN-OFF FROM THE WATERSHED AREA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Lake Grebiner See is one of the typical smaller Holstein water bodies situated in an intensively used agricultural district. It has a surface area of 26.89 ha and a mean depth of 9.54 m. The hypolimnion is free of dissolved O2 and contains H2S in summer time because the lake is overloaded by phosphate and other nutrients deriving by aquatic and eolic erosion from agricultural fields and meadows having been fertilized strongly. The areal loading of the lake reaches 1.69 g P/m2 per a and high amounts of N compounds, too. This indicates an overfertilization because only at a level of 0.30 g P/m2 per a an aerobic metabolism of the lake would be possible, i.e., there would be O2 left in the profundal contact water layer even in autumn. Four percent of the P supply of Lake Grebiner See was derived from atmospheric precipitation and only 0.1% came from the drainage water, but more than 95% came from run-off. This is the decisive factor of racing eutrophication produced by aquatic and wind erosion and not at all by sewage water which unfortunately cannot be avoided but can be diminished by distinct agricultural procedures.																			0003-9136						1982	95	OCT					331	363																WOS:A1982PV20900025

Field and laboratory studies demonstrated the existence of 2 critical stages in early life when smallmouth bass are particularly vulnerable to features characteristic of many natural water temperature regimes. The 1st stage extends from fertilization until the young leave the nest; high mortality results from exposure to extreme temperatures. The 2nd stage extends over the 1st winter, when the young subsist on accumulated energy reserves. Because the ratio of energy stored to basal metabolic rate increases with size, large fish can withstand winter starvation better than small fish. The results from these and other studies were incorporated into a deterministic model of the relations between temperature and 1st-yr survival of smallmouth bass. Analysis of water temperature time series data from many locations led to the development and parameterization of a stochastic model capable of simulating variations in water temperature characteristic of the littoral zones of typical North American lakes. The stochastic physical and deterministic biological models were used together to assess the effects on 1st-yr survival of changes in climate and of realistic changes in the magnitude and frequency of short-term temperature fluctuations. The model successfully predicted the observed northern limit of the species'' range. It also generated approximate environmental criteria for judging when year-to-year variation in survival, over one or both of the critical life history stages identified, is likely to reach a level sufficiently great to determine the pattern of year-to-year variation in recruitment to the adult stock. The combined model was also used to assess the effects of thermal loading from a nuclear power plant on a particular population.

The Baker River has the highest mean discharge of those draining both slopes of the Andes South of 20 degrees S and it is among the six rivers with the highest mean streamflow in the Pacific domain of South America (1100 m(3) s(-1) at its outlet). It drains an international basin of 29,000 km(2) shared by Chile and Argentina and has a high ecologic and economic value including conservation, tourism, recreational fishing, and projected hydropower. This study reconstructs the austral summer - early fall (January-April) streamflow for the Baker River from Nothofagus pumilio tree-rings for the period 1765-2004. Summer streamflow represents 45.2% of the annual discharge. The regression model for the period (19612004) explains 54% of the variance of the Baker River streamflow (R-adj(2) = 0.54). The most significant temporal pattern in the record is the sustained decline since the 1980s (tau = -0.633, p = 1.0144 * 10(-5) for the 1985-2004 period), which is unprecedented since 1765. The Correlation of the Baker streamflow with the November-April observed Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is significant (1961-2004, r=-0.55, p < 0.001). The Baker record is also correlated with the available SAM tree-ring reconstruction based on other species when both series are filtered with a 25-year spline and detrended (1765-2004, r = -0.41, p < 0.01), emphasizing SAM as the main climatic forcing of the Baker streamflow. Three of the five summers with the highest streamflow in the entire reconstructed record occurred after the 1950s (1977, 1958 and 1959). The causes of this high streamflow events are not yet clear and cannot be associated with the reported recent increase in the frequency of glacial-lake outburst floods (GLOFs). The decreasing trend in the observed and reconstructed streamflow of the Baker River documented here for the 1980-2004 period is consistent with precipitation decrease associated with the SAM. Conversely, other studies have reported an increase of summer streamflow for a portion of the Baker River for the 1994-2008 period, explained by ice melt associated with temperature increase and glacier retreat and thinning. Future research should consider the development of new tree-ring reconstructions to increase the geographic range and to cover the last 1000 or more years using long-lived species (e.g. Fitzroya cupressoides and Pilgerodendron uniferum). Expanding the network and quality of instrumental weather, streamflow and other monitoring stations as well as the study and modeling of the complex hydrological processes in the Baker basin are necessary. This should be the basis for planning, policy design and decision making regarding water resources in the Baker basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite the potential importance of these environments, systematic data on their location, morphology and water quality remain limited. In this study, we present an extensive assessment of the physical and optical properties in a large sample of PLs located in the Po River basin (Italy) from 1990 to 2021, utilizing a combined approach of remote sensing (Landsat constellation and Sentinel-2) and traditional limnological techniques. Specifically, we focused on the concentration of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and the dominant wavelength (lambda(dom), i.e., water colour). This study aims to contribute to the analysis of PLs at a basin scale as an opportunity for environmental rehabilitation and river floodplain management. ACOLITE v.2022, a neural network particularly suitable for the analysis of turbid waters and small inland water bodies, was used to atmospherically correct satellite images and to obtain SPM concentration maps and the lambda(dom). The results show a very strong correlation between SPM concentrations obtained in situ and those obtained from satellite images, both for data derived from Landsat (R-2 = 0.85) and Sentinel-2 images (R-2 = 0.82). A strong correlation also emerged from the comparison of spectral signatures obtained in situ via WISP-3 and those derived from ACOLITE, especially in the visible spectrum (443-705 nm, SA = 10.8 degrees). In general, it appeared that PLs with the highest mean SPM concentrations and the highest mean lambda(dom) are located along the main Po River, and more generally near rivers. The results also show that active PLs exhibit a poor water quality status, especially those of small sizes (<5 ha) and directly connected to a river. Seasonal comparison shows the same trend for both SPM concentration and lambda(dom): higher values in winter gradually decreasing until spring-summer, then increasing again. Finally, it emerged that the end of quarrying activity led to a reduction in SPM concentration from a minimum of 43% to a maximum of 72%. In this context, the combined use of Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery allowed for the evaluation of the temporal evolution of the physical and optical properties of the PLs in a vast area such as the Po River basin (74,000 km(2)). In particular, the Sentinel-2 images consistently proved to be a reliable resource for capturing episodic and recurring quarrying events and portraying the ever-changing dynamics of these ecosystems.					; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Viaroli, Pierluigi/M-3762-2014; nizzoli, daniele/AAM-3083-2021	Pinardi, Monica/0000-0001-5289-8842; Nizzoli, Daniele/0000-0003-4731-9804; Viaroli, Pierluigi/0000-0002-6396-2894; Ghirardi, Nicola/0000-0002-5006-9853; Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; 														2072-4292				DEC	2023	15	23							5564	10.3390/rs15235564	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15235564													WOS:001117614900001

Ice controls surface albedo, hydrological properties, gas exchange, and ecosystem services, but freezing processes differ between water bodies. We studied the influence of geomorphology and meteorology on winter ice of water bodies in the Lena Delta, Siberia. Electrical conductivity (EC) and stable water isotopes of ice cores from four winters and six water bodies were measured at unprecedented resolution down to 2-cm increments, revealing differences in freezing systems. Open-system freezing shows near-constant isotopic and EC gradients in ice, whereas closed-system freezing shows decreasing isotopic composition with depth. Lena River ice displays three zones of isotopic composition within the ice, reflecting open-system freezing that records changing water sources over the winter. The isotope composition of ice covers in landscape units of different ages also reflects the individual water reservoir settings (i.e., Pleistocene vs. Holocene ground ice thaw). Ice growth models indicate that snow properties are a dominant determinant of ice growth over winter. Our findings provide novel insights into the winter hydrochemistry of Arctic ice covers, including the influences of meteorology and water body geomorphology on freezing rates and processes.					; Boike, Julia/JZT-8129-2024; Juhls, Bennet/AAD-8848-2021; Overduin, Paul/B-3258-2017; Boike, Julia/R-4766-2016; Overduin, Pier/B-3258-2017; Morgenstern, Anne/N-3648-2015; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016	Juhls, Bennet/0000-0002-5844-6318; Boike, Julia/0000-0002-5875-2112; Overduin, Pier/0000-0001-9849-4712; Morgenstern, Anne/0000-0002-6466-7571; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706													1523-0430	1938-4246				DEC 31	2024	56	1							2350546	10.1080/15230430.2024.2350546	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2024.2350546													WOS:001239904700001

Reducing tree height by removing the upper 1-2 m of the tree canopy is likely to remove a substantial percentage of the current bearing surface. We hypothesized that summer pruning following height reduction would stimulate fruitwood production in the lower canopy and allow more rapid recovery of crop yield. The heights of pear trees in two orchards in Lake County, California, were reduced by 2-4 m in 1992 (Quercus Orchard) and 1993 (Thomas Orchard). Summer pruning was carried out in each orchard every June. Summer pruned trees produced 17.5% less crop than non-summer pruned trees in 1995 at Quercus Orchard. A qualitatively similar trend was observed in 1994 at Quercus Orchard and in 1995 at Thomas Orchard. In 1995, the locations and numbers of flowers and fruits in the canopy were determined. Most flowers and fruits were produced in the upper third of the canopy, which also produced the heaviest fruits. Spurs produced more flowers and heavier fruits than terminals. At harvest, no differences in fruit number due to summer pruning were detected at either orchard. Over a period of three years after height reduction, summer pruning caused small increases in flower formation in some canopy locations, but these changes did not result in increased fruit production. This lack of a positive response to summer pruning may have been due to the reduction in carbohydrate availability caused by summer pruning.																			0567-7572		90-6605-919-2				1997		451					543	549		10.17660/ActaHortic.1997.451.63	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.1997.451.63													WOS:000072197900063

The present study evaluates the snow cover in this basin associated with changes in air temperatures and precipitation during the period 1984 to 2019. It used the ERA5 high-resolution reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and 35 images from the Landsat satellite. The results showed a statistically significant positive trend in maximum air temperatures whose signal is in agreement with previous studies. Seasonal analysis of maximum temperatures showed positive trends in all seasons, indicating that the highest trends occur during winter and the lowest trends during the southern fall. In addition, there was a 26% decrease in snow cover in general in the basin, and it was evidenced that the greater decreases (53%, approximately) occurred in regions below the altitude of 5300 m. In fact, from this contribution of the study comes the need to carry out more research in this region, especially to support decisions covering agriculture, water resources management and biodiversity studies.

Evidence of Considerable Photoreactivity in an Extreme Environment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Water samples from shallow lakes located in Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, were taken in the austral summer season and characterized for chemical composition, optical features, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and photoactivity toward the generation of (OH)-O-center dot, O-1(2), and (CDOM)-C-3* (triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter). The optical properties suggested that CDOM would be largely of aquagenic origin and possibly characterized by limited photochemical processing before sampling. Moreover, the studied samples were highly photoactive and the quantum yields for the generation of (CDOM)-C-3* and partially of O-1(2) and (OH)-O-center dot were considerably higher compared to water samples from temperate environments. This finding suggests that water in the studied lakes would have considerable ability to photosensitize the degradation of dissolved compounds during the austral summer, possibly including organic pollutants, also considering that the irradiance conditions of the experiments were not far from those observed on the Antarctic coast during the austral summer.

Physicochemical characteristics of the thermal water samples showed pH from 6.3 to 8.3 with an average of 7.0, redox potential from +106 to +204 mV with an average of +172 mV, temperatures from 40 to 75 degrees C with an average of 56 degrees C and high electrical conductivity ranging from 1.8 to 75 mS/cm and averaged 13 mS/cm. Predominant major ions are Na+ and Cl- and the principal water types are 37.5% Na -Cl type and 37.5% Na-Cl-HCO3 type. Arsenic concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 65.3 mu g/L and arsenic speciation indicate the predominance of As(III) species. Sediments collected from the outlets of thermal waters show high iron content, and ferric oxides and hydroxides are assumed to be principal mineral phases for arsenic attenuation by adsorption/co-precipitation processes. Arsenic concentrations in cold water samples from shallow aquifers are higher than those in thermal springs (range < 5.6-233.2 mu g/L), it is likely that thermal water discharge is not the main source of high arsenic content in the shallow aquifer as they are very immature and may only have a small component corresponding to the deep geothermal reservoir. As people use both thermal waters and cold waters for consumption, there is a high risk for arsenic exposure in the area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jakubik, B				Jakubik, Beata			FOOD AND FEEDING OF VIVIPARUS VIVIPARUS (L.) (GASTROPODA) IN DAM RESERVOIR AND RIVER HABITATS	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Studies on feeding of V viviparus were carried out in the years 1995-2005 in dam reservoir (Zegrzynski Reservoir, Central Poland, 60 km long, mean depth ca 3.5 m, maximum depth at the dam up to 9 m, mean retention time from 1 to 15 days) and in the outlets of its tributaries (the Bug, Narew and Rzadza rivers), in the Narew River and - in the years 2003-2006 - also in oxbow lakes of the Bug River. Sex ratio and size structure of snails were estimated. Both the content of intestines (detritus, algae, inorganic matter) and the gut fulfilment were analysed. Performed multi-factor analysis showed the effect of habitat, season and snail size (estimated from shell height) on food mass in the gut. Snails from dam reservoir and outlet stretches of three rivers showed the largest food mass in the gut. Intestines of snails from rivers and oxbow lakes were less filled. The largest food volumes were found in spring and summer. Only in viviparids from oxbow lakes the largest food mass in the gut was noted in the autumn. Food mass in the gut was largest in snails of the I (<8 mm) and IV (20-35 mm) size class. Food mass was similar in females and males. Differences were, however, noted in the ingested food mass between fertile and infertile females which was smaller in the former. In all studied sites the snails fed mainly on detritus which constituted from 70 to 90% of food mass ingested of all individuals. Detritus abundance in studied habitats might result in using it by snails as obligatory though low-energetic food source. Detritus contributed more to the food of viviparids from Zegrzynski Reservoir and from oxbow lakes, slightly less - to the food of those from outlet stretches of rivers and from the Narew River. Algae contributed from 5% (Zegrzynski Reservoir) to 15% (the Narew River) to the food mass in snail guts. Apart from diatoms, green algae, dinoflagellates and chrysophytes, also cyanobacteria were found in snail food mass. Green algae (46% of all algae) and diatoms (37% of all algae) constituted the largest part of viviparids algal diet in the reservoir. The share of chrysophytes and dinoflagellates made about 10%. More diatoms (up to 48%) and less green algae (up to 25%) were found in snails from outlet stretches of rivers. Guts of snails from the Narew River contained mainly diatoms (over 50%) and green algae (30%). Gut content of snails from oxbow lakes was dominated by green algae (50% of all algae) and diatoms (35% of all algae). Inorganic matter in a form of mineral particles contributed least to the food of snails in the reservoir and in oxbow lakes (ca 5%) in comparison with snails from other sites. No food of animal origin was found. In general, it can be stated that the amount of food mass ingested and its composition differed rather slightly among studied habitats, seasons and individuals.																			1505-2249						2009	57	2					321	330																WOS:000267250200011

Fission-track maps of multiple bands of uniformly dull-luminescent fibrous calcite show that the concentration of U increases in the outward growth direction of the calcite of each individual band. Homogeneous dull luminescence in the fibrous calcite indicates no change in redox conditions of the fluid from which the calcite was precipitated. It is proposed that the cyclic pattern of increase in U concentration reflects a cyclical change in the U/Ca ratio in the fluid. Episodic mixing between Ca-rich spring water with a low U/Ca ratio and Ca-poor saline alkaline lake water with a high U/Ca ratio could produce the episodes of formation of fibrous calcite with increasing U concentrations. The spring water supplies the Ca for calcite precipitation, and the U concentrations increase with the decreasing fraction of spring water and increasing fraction of lake water. These cycles reflect a variable recharge of groundwater into the lake by springs. The large variation in U concentrations suggests mixing of 0% to 45% spring water with the lake, while the narrow range in delta O-18 of -6.37 parts per thousand to -6.87 parts per thousand limits the variation of the proportions of spring and lake water to 5%.

Mycological observations conducted in the spring and autumn seasons together with hydrochemical analysis in the 2010-2012 revealed the presence of 44 species (10 aquatic fungi and 34 straminipilous organisms). Among the taxa detected, there were some potential pathogens of economically valuable fish species and spawn, including Achlya americana, Ac. polyandra, Saprolegnia ferax and S. parasitica. Some of the species were crustacean pathogens, such as Lagenidium giganteum, Myzocytium microsporum and M. zoophthorum. There were also some common human pathogens Aspergillus niger and Candida tropicalis. Some species, such as Achlya klebsiana, Ac. prolifera, Nowakowskiella elegans, N. macrospora, Pythium debaryanum, Py. inflatum, Rhizophlyctis rosea and Saprolegnia litoralis were common phytosaprobionts. The largest number of species of fungi and straminipilous organisms was identified in Lake Sajenek (22), the fewest in Lake Biae (12). The quantitative composition and qualitative differentiation of mycobiota were influenced by the content of biogenic compounds and the amount of organic substance. The elevated levels of these parameters (Lake Sajenek) stimulated the growth of fungi and straminipilous organisms, whereas very low concentrations of biogenic compounds and a small amount of organic matter (Lake Biae) had an inhibitory effect. Statistical analysis of the results was conducted to determine the correlations between the number of fungal and straminipilous species and the hydrochemical parameters, i.e. water temperature, the level of nitrogen compounds (nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen), calcium carbohydrate, magnesium carbohydrate, water oxidizability and the content of dry residue, dissolved substances and suspension.

Energetic implications of floodplain wetland restoration strategies for waterfowl	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Modifications of the Illinois River and associated tributaries have resulted in altered hydrologic cycles and persistent river-floodplain connections during the growing season that frequently impede the establishment of hydrophytic vegetation and have reduced value for migratory waterfowl and other waterbirds. To help guide floodplain restoration, we compared energetic carrying capacity for waterfowl in two wetland complexes along the Illinois River under different management regimes during 2012-2015. The south pool of Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge (CNWR) was seasonally flooded due to a partial river connection and managed for moist-soil vegetation. Emiquon Preserve was hydrologically isolated from the Illinois River by a high-elevation levee and managed as a semipermanently flooded emergent marsh. Semipermanent emergent marsh management at Emiquon Preserve produced 5,495 energetic use-days (EUD)/ha for waterfowl and other waterbirds across wetland cover types and years, and seasonal moist-soil management at CNWR produced 6,199 EUD/ha in one of 4 years. At Emiquon Preserve, the aquatic bed cover type produced 9,660 EUD/ha, followed by 5,261 EUD/ha in moist-soil, 1,398 EUD/ha in persistent emergent, 1,185 EUD/ha in hemi-marsh, and 12 EUD/ha in open water cover types. At CNWR, the annual grass and sedge cover type produced 7,031 EUD/ha, followed by 5,618 EUD/ha in annual broadleaf and 1,305 EUD/ha in perennial grass cover types. Restoration of floodplain wetlands in isolation from frequent flood pulses during the growing season can produce hemi-marsh and aquatic bed vegetation communities that provide high-quality habitat for waterfowl and which have been mostly eliminated from large river systems in the Midwest, U.S.A.

The blooms were created during partial turnovers period, the lowest dammed water levels, the calm, sunny weather and water temperatures of 15 degreesC. Biomass of Woronichinia naegeliana showed a significant negative correlation with the dammed water levels and significant negative correlation with nitrate nitrogen. Nitrate nitrogen achieved the lowest values during the mass development of cyanoprokaryotes. We concluded that eucaryotic algae developed before NO3-N depletion. We also concluded that W. naegeliana replaced Microcystis aeruginosa, species that created blooms in the Dobczyce reservoir in the past years.

Changes in water quality and the phytoplankton community associated with tilapia cage farming in tropical lakes	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												We examine phytoplankton community structure and how it is influenced by commercial tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) cage farming in three tropical lakes in eastern Brazil. Sampling occurred during both the wet and dry seasons for two treatments - within tilapia cages and outside the cages in the lake. Total ammonia, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin and phytoplankton were measured in all water samples. In the phytoplankton community, we estimated species richness and total abundance. Thirty-three genera of algae distributed in 8 classes were identified. The most abundant classes were Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae (the latter of which was the most species-rich class). In Palmas Lake, chlorophyll a was constant over time (summer and winter) and location (within and outside cage farms), which may reflect the fact that fish farming is more recent in this lake. The richness and abundance of species were similar among the lakes, but Palminhas Lake tended to have more extreme values, apparently associated with the longer time fish have been farmed there. Fish farming clearly influences water quality as measured by algae species richness and abundance but is also moderated by the unique conditions in each lake and the amount of time over which the fish have been farmed. Understanding and preventing the impacts and detrimental consequences of tilapia cage farming on both the farming yield and the water quality in tropical lakes require continual monitoring.

Water-level regulation and coastal wetland vegetation in the upper St. Lawrence River: inferences from historical aerial imagery, seed banks, and Typha dynamics	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We evaluated habitat changes of tributary (drowned river mouth) wetlands in the upper St. Lawrence River with analysis of pre-and post-regulation water levels and historical vegetation reconstruction from aerial photographs. In addition, the germination response of transplanted wetland soil was compared to understand responses to moist versus saturated hydrology. Typha stem density was sampled in reference sites under the influence of water-level regulation by the International Joint Commission (IJC) and compared to treatment sites where installed control structures held levels (< 0.7 m) higher. Major hydrologic changes due to regulation included a reduction of inter-annual variability with a reduction in peak levels and periodic lows, leading to a dampening of 30-40 year water-level cycles. Wetland photo interpretation indicated that flooded and mixed habitat categories were apparent at all sites for pre-regulation in 1948, but post-regulation photos (1972 and 1994) showed encroachment of robust emergent (Typha angustifolia, T. latifolia, and T. x glauca) in these habitats. Vegetation surveys (7 years, 2001-2007) indicated that reference and treatment sites were dominated by Typha, but mean stem densities were not statistically different. Typha stem density, however, declined in response to decreased summer water level. Periodic summer low water levels coupled with higher winter levels (that promote muskrat activity) were hypothesized to have the greatest effect on reducing Typha density. Seed-bank analysis indicated that a greater diversity of plant species germinated in mesic (moist) conditions than in the saturated treatment (flooded), where Typha was the dominant seedling component. Altered hydrologic regimes and invasive Typha have had a substantial effect on habitat structure within coastal wetlands and inferences from local management of levels provide useful guidance for future system-wide regulation.

J	Giunchi, D; Baldaccini, NE				Giunchi, D; Baldaccini, NE			Orientation experiments with displaced juvenile barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) during autumn migratory season	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY												In a previous paper, we reported that juvenile barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) trapped during the autumn migratory season and tested in modified Emlen funnels under overcast conditions can use magnetic information for compass orientation, although they did not orient toward the expected migratory direction. To further investigate this behaviour, in the present paper, we report the results of two series of displacement experiments performed on juvenile barn swallows belonging to two different roost sites [Massaciuccoli Lake (ML) and Terzo Cavone (TC)] and tested using the same protocol as that previously adopted. On the whole, the outcome of the ML and TC experiments was quite different with respect to (a) the degree of bird activity within the funnel (substantially lower for TC) and (b) the effect of the experimental displacement on the directional preferences of the tested subjects (not detectable in TC, while evident in ML swallows). Taken together, these results suggest that migrating swallows could react differently to the experimental tests depending on the roost site where they were caught. Indeed, TC swallows, trapped in southern Italy, close to the seacoast, and characterized by fairly large amounts of fat stores, mainly broke off their migratory activity or reoriented their directional preferences toward inland sites, possibly in search of more profitable habitats. On the other hand, ML swallows, trapped about 660 km to the north and characterized by lower amounts of fat stores, apparently tried to compensate for the experimental displacement.					; Giunchi, Dimitri/B-9642-2008	Giunchi, Dimitri/0000-0003-2753-8997; 													0340-5443	1432-0762				MAR	2006	59	5					624	633		10.1007/s00265-005-0089-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-005-0089-5													WOS:000235219700005

We measured I-129/I and Cl-36/Cl ratios in nine warm springs (formation springs), six cold springs with elevated levels of Cl and I (mineral springs), and five springs of recent meteoric origin. Dating of the I in the formation waters indicated that sources of I in these waters are formations with minimum ages between 60 and 80 Ma. This age range is in good agreement with the ages of the Franciscan Complex and the Great Valley Sequence, the dominant formations in this area. Because the mineral waters are essentially formation waters diluted with meteoric water, I in these waters is of the same origin. Residence times of the waters were calculated based on the build-up of I-129 and Cl-36 as a consequence of the presence of U and Th in the crust. The residence time of the formation waters in the Great Valley Sequence, the location for most of these springs, was probably not longer than 84,000 yr. The concentrations found for Cl-36 and I-129 in the mineral waters indicate that these waters have residence times of similar magnitude in formations such as the Franciscan Complex or the Clear Lake Volcanics, which have slightly higher levels of U and Th than the Great Valley Sequence.																			0016-7037					MAY	1992	56	5					2069	2079		10.1016/0016-7037(92)90330-L	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(92)90330-L													WOS:A1992HU41300021
J	Jiang, GH; Guo, F; Wei, LQ; Li, WY				Jiang, Guanghui; Guo, Fang; Wei, Liqiong; Li, Wanyi			Characterizing the transitory groundwater-surface water interaction and its environmental consequence of a riverside karst pool	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Exchange between groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) is a common occurrence in karst water systems through sinking stream disappearance or groundwater emergence. However, the transitory GW-SW interaction caused by river backflowing into a spring is poorly observed and understood. In this study, we present an approach for characterizing the influence of GW-SW interaction in a karst spring by integrating high-resolution hydrology, carefully selected hydrochemistry monitoring and precise microbe measurements. The spring-fed pool water conditions can be distinguished as high, medium, and low-water level periods in a hydrological year. The high-water level accounts for <1 % in a year, while it is associated with the hydrological regimes of backflooding states. The inflow of river backflow was found to be 4.4 times that of the natural discharge of spring water during a rainfall event. The duration of river intrusion into the spring or karst conduit could be assessed by jointly interpreting hydrography and physicochemical signatures, while the lasting environmental consequences should be evaluated together with biotic factors such as Escherichia coli. The GW-SW interaction induced by river backflow has led to the retention of river water in a pool, spring, and karst conduit for 132, 94, and 56 h, respectively. Despite turbidity returning to normal levels after 56 h, E.coli continued to persist for an extended duration. Our study reveals that despite the transient nature of GW-SW induced by river backflow on the hydrograph, they present a lasting risk of contamination from heavy metals, organic matter, and microorganisms. This extended influence can persist within a karst aquifer lacking a hyporheic zone. This research contributes to the quantification of processes involved in transitory GW-SW interaction in a karst spring, and it highlights the underestimation of GW-SW interactions in karst water systems, which might negatively impact water resources management.

Increasing biomass of winter wheat using sorghum biochars	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Biochar is a black solid formed by pyrolysis of biomass such as crop residues. Biochar could be used for soil fertilization, carbon sequestration, and improvement of soil structure. Here, we tested the effect of sorghum biochars on winter wheat, with or without supplemental inorganic phosphorus, in a greenhouse. The application rate for sorghum residues and sorghum biochars based on a yield goal of 200 bushels ha(-1) was 13 Mg ha(-1). Inorganic phosphorus was added at the rate of 40 kg P ha(-1). Results show that addition of sorghum biochars increased the total biomass of winter wheat grown by about 31 % over the control plants.

Here, we analyzed a 10-year time series (sampled fortnightly) from a hypereutrophic turbid shallow lake located within the Pampa Region of South America, generating the first long-term record of freshwater Pcy from the Southern Hemisphere. We used a cytometric approach to study Pcy community, and focused on its relations with nutrient and light conditions (bottom-up) and potential grazers (top-down). A novel Pcy abundance seasonality with winter maximums was observed for years with relatively stable hydrological levels, related with decreased abundance of seasonal rotifers during colder seasons. Pcy showed lower abundance and higher cytometric alpha diversity during summer, probably due to a strong predation exerted by rotifers. In turn, a direct effect of the non-seasonal small cladocerans Bosmina spp. decreased Pcy abundance and induced a shift from single-cell Pcy into aggregated forms. This structuring effect of Bosmina spp. was further confirmed by Pcy cytometric (dis)similarity analyses from the time series and in situ experimental data. Remarkably, Pcy showed acclimatization to underwater light variations, resembling the relevance of light in this turbid system.					; Quiroga, Maria/JUV-5976-2023; Huber, Paula/AAA-7509-2021	Quiroga, Maria Victoria/0000-0002-6223-334X; Ospina-Serna, Juliana/0009-0005-4248-3340; Huber, Paula/0000-0002-5411-7736; Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960													0168-6496	1574-6941				MAY	2021	97	5							fiab055	10.1093/femsec/fiab055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiab055		APR 2021						33784379					WOS:000661470800011

How climate seasonalitymodifies drought duration and deficit	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Drought propagation through the terrestrial hydrological cycle is associated with a change in drought characteristics (duration and deficit), moving from precipitation via soil moisture to discharge. Here we investigate climate controls on drought propagation with a modeling experiment in 1271 virtual catchments that differ only in climate type. For these virtual catchments we studied the bivariate distribution of drought duration and standardized deficit for the variables precipitation, soil moisture, and discharge. We found that for meteorological drought (below-normal precipitation), the bivariate distributions of drought characteristics have a linear shape in all climates and are thus not affected by seasonality in climate. Despite the linear shape of meteorological drought, soil moisture drought (below-normal storage in the unsaturated zone) and hydrological drought (below-normal water availability in aquifers, lakes, and/or streams) show strongly nonlinear shapes in drought characteristics in climates with a pronounced seasonal cycle in precipitation and/or temperature. These seasonality effects on drought propagation are found in monsoonal, savannah, and Mediterranean climate zones. In these regions, both soil moisture and discharge show deviating shapes in drought characteristics. The effect of seasonality on drought propagation is even stronger in cold seasonal climates (i.e., at high latitudes and altitudes), where snow accumulation during winter prevents recovery from summer hydrological drought, and deficit increases strongly with duration. This has important implications for water resources management in seasonal climates, which cannot solely rely on meteorology-based indices as proxies for hydrological drought duration and deficit and need to include seasonal variation in both precipitation and temperature in hydrological drought forecasting.

Numerical abundance and biomass of larvae showed considerable spatial, seasonal and interannual variation (ANCOVAs, P<0.001). The maximum mean annual density was 7048 larvae m(-2), and corresponded to a biomass of 3.08 g dry weight (DW) m(-2). It was recorded at the site with the lowest rate of water renewal. Seasonal patterns were similar at all sites, with main annual peaks of abundance and biomass in autumn-early winter. Chironomid density was positively related to the biomass of benthic macroalgae (P<0.001). The population studied was multivoltine with a probable average of five generations per year, with overlapping cohorts and a predominance of third- and fourth-instar larvae. Estimates of annual production ranged between 72.2 g DW m(-2) yr(-1) at the site with the lowest rate of water renewal in 1991 and 0.1 g DW m(-2) yr(-1) at the site with the highest rate of water renewal in 1992. Mean annual production and the production/biomass ratio for the system was estimated to be 16.8 g DW m(-2) yr(-1) and 12.7, respectively. Possible factors leading to the observed density fluctuations are discussed, as well as possible sources of error in production estimates.

Both reservoirs were built to produce hydropower with wide water level regulation range (Lokka max. 5 m, Pomipahta max. 11 m). Flooded area consisted mainly of peatlands and forests. Water level is lowered during winter, when reservoirs are covered by ice and the energy need is greatest. Regulation was extensive during the first decade and water quality problems occurred. Wintertime oxygen concentration was very low and amount of phosphorus was high. This situation was caused by degradation of organic matter released from bottom. Organic matter was mainly released from peatlands pressured by penetrating ice and by breakdown of peat during the summer. Amount of total phosphorus is quite high compared to natural lakes. Main sources of loading during the first years of the reservoirs were at the littoral zone, where waves and currents caused erosion. The importance of the pelagic zone becomes more obvious as reservoirs age; bottom area is covered by thick layer of sediment consisting mainly of eroded peat. The bottom sediment forms a store of organic matter and phosphorus, which can be released during winter, when oxygen concentration is very low and also other transport mechanisms (convection, diffusion) exist. Nowadays, when the regulation amplitude is only 2-3 m/yr, water quality is more stable. In that situation the wind-caused resuspension of sediment can be quite important as a transport mechanism of organic matter and nutrients in shallow and open reservoirs.

The frequent migration and transformation of sediment nutrients result in different fractions. Studying the relationships between favorable nutrient fractions and the benthic environment is critical for understanding the contributions of C, N, and P and their geochemical cycles. In total, nine sediment cores were collected for the study of spatiotemporal distributions of C, N, and P in sediments of Moon Bay, Lake Taihu (China). Pearson correlation and principal component analysis were performed to analyze the influence of environmental parameters and seasons on the concentration of sediment nutrient fractions. Results showed that the algal Moon Bay was phosphorus dominated, given the light total phosphorus loading (401.86 mg/kg). The great concentration gradient from sediment to overlying water (493 times) favored the phosphorus release. Dissolved oxygen, organic loading, and sediment depth showed a close relationship with the mineralization process, which was directly controlled by the reduction-oxidation potential. As the temperature increased, the mineralization could be enhanced. The lower total organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio in summer (16.37) than winter (30.5) verified the strong decomposition and mineralization with the help of active microorganisms. This study provides a reference to understand the influence of physicochemical parameters and primary producers on the C, N, and P geochemical cycles in sediments.

The environmental extremes of the investigated site recorded were assessed in terms of their cultivable microbiological communities and relationships among plankton communities. The data show the absence of a cultivable archaeal community in the saline lake Letea. The bacterial communities are most probably represented by moderately halophilic or halotolerant strains. The extracellular enzymatic activities involved in the degradation of organic compounds revealed high aminopeptidase activity and occasionally showed beta-glucosidase in supernatant, which appears over the sapropelic mud from the same lake. The phytoplankton of Salt Lake Letea consists of four groups of taxa: Cyanobacteria (7 sp.), Bacillariophyceae (12 sp.) Chlorophyceae (6 sp.) and Pyrophyceae (1 sp.). The richness of the zooplankton species is highest in spring and decreases progressively to autumn. The relevance of our study of consists in the novelty of the research in the areas; no other records can be found in the literature.

Hydrophysical processes in Lake Baikal in its transition from subtropical to modern climates	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd Symposium on Species in Ancient Lakes	SEP 02-07, 2002	Quincy, WA					During the past 5 million years significant changes have taken place in the Lake Baikal ecosystem. The climate changed from subtropical, with average annual air temperatures (T-air) of 15-10 degrees C, to a moderate one with T-air of similar to 0 degrees C. The modern hydrophysical regime of the lake has been formed with increase in depth, and gradual cooling of the water body from deepwater temperatures (Taw) of 15-10 degrees C to below 4 degrees C. The processes of cooling of Lake Baikal water in its transition from subtropical climate with deep temperatures greater than those of maximal density (T-md) are similar to modern processes of deepwater cooling of the Mediterranean type of MEDOC convection. Such intensive mechanisms of vertical exchange (MVE) are similar to autumn homothermy in Lake Baikal. However, they are higher than T-md. Inverse thermal stratification began to occur in surface layers in cold periods of the year after the deep water had cooled to T-md. The character of water exchange also changed; instead of a monomictic lake with warm water from surface to bottom, the lake has become dimictic with lower water below 4 degrees C, i.e. vertical mixing now occurs not once but twice a year. Winter ice cover began about a million years ago.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 15	2006	568			1			253	257		10.1007/s10750-006-0306-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0306-x													WOS:000240688900037

These impacts are mostly associated with the attenuation of visible sunlight by stratospheric sulfate aerosols, which causes cooling and deceleration of the water cycle. Supereruptions have been assumed to cause so-called volcanic winters that act as primary evolutionary factors through ecosystem disruption and famine, however, winter conditions alone may not be sufficient to cause such disruption. Here we use Earth system model simulations to show that stratospheric sulfur emissions from the Toba supereruption 74,000 years ago caused severe stratospheric ozone loss through a radiation attenuation mechanism that only moderately depends on the emission magnitude. The Toba plume strongly inhibited oxygen photolysis, suppressing ozone formation in the tropics, where exceptionally depleted ozone conditions persisted for over a year. This effect, when combined with volcanic winter in the extra-tropics, can account for the impacts of supereruptions on ecosystems and humanity. Stratospheric sulfur emissions from the Toba supereruption about 74,000 years ago suppressed ozone formation which caused severe tropical ozone layer depletion and enhanced solar ultraviolet radiation stress, according to Earth system model simulations.

Islands in the ice stream: were spawning habitats for native salmonids in the Great Lakes created by paleo-ice streams?	FISH AND FISHERIES												Lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis and cisco Coregonus artedi are salmonid fishes native to the Laurentian Great Lakes that spawn on rocky substrates in the fall and early winter. After comparing the locations of spawning habitat for these species in the main basin of Lake Huron with surficial substrates and the hypothesized locations of fast-flowing Late Wisconsinan paleo-ice streams, we hypothesize that much of the spawning habitat for these species in Lake Huron is the result of deposition and erosion by paleo-ice streams. This hypothesis may represent a new framework for the identification and protection of spawning habitat for these native species, some of which are currently rare or extirpated in some of the Great Lakes. We further suggest that paleo-ice streams may have been responsible for the creation of native salmonid spawning habitat elsewhere in the Great Lakes and in other glaciated landscapes.

Trin. Ex Steud subsp. australis using random forest (RF) machine learning. RPAS imagery was collected in the spring and fall of 2019 using a fixed-wing RPAS equipped with a visible spectrum camera (eBee X, S.O.D.A. 3D; senseFly) in Long Point, Ontario, Canada. Imagery was used to produce separate early and late season classifications and a bi-temporal classification which used imagery from both dates. The overall accuracy achieved for each was 97%, 96%, and 91%, respectively. Digital surface models (DSMs) were the most important variable for identifying Phragmites in all classifications due to their greater height when compared to surrounding herbaceous vegetation. The bi-temporal classification, which utilized change in DSM value during the growing season, resulted in an estimated 47.8% new growth of Phragmites and appeared to capture sparse growth better than traditional classification differencing alone. This study highlights the promising use of high-resolution DSMs produced from RPAS imagery to classify invasive Phragmites and monitor within-year patch expansions.

J	CURTIS, GL				CURTIS, GL			RECOVERY OF AN OFFSHORE LAKE TROUT (SALVELINUS-NAMAYCUSH) POPULATION IN EASTERN LAKE-SUPERIOR	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) population at Stannard Rock, Michigan, an isolated offshore reef in eastern Lake Superior, was monitored each spring from 1959-79 using a permit assessment gill net fishery. This population, like nearly all of those in inshore waters, declined to low levels during the years of intense predation by the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in the late 1950s and early 1960s. After sea lamprey control began in 1961, the abundance of native lake trout at Stannard began to increase slowly in the 1960s and was limited to recruitment into the fishable stock of native fish that were juveniles during the years of high sea lamprey activity. By the early 1970s, lake trout abundance increased sharply and remained at a high level. This rapid recovery resulted from several strong year classes produced by the small spawning aggregations that reached maturity in the 1960s. Reproduction occurred in all years during and after the peak of sea lamprey activity in 1959. The strengths of year classes produced in 1963-1968 were related to the relative abundance of spawners the previous fall.																			0380-1330						1990	16	2					279	287		10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71421-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71421-9													WOS:A1990DL43700009

The objective of this study is to understand the hydrologic functions of unique land-cover types in this region (channel fens, flat bogs, and peat plateaus) using isotopic and chemical signatures of surface and subsurface water, as well as hydrometric measurements. The study was conducted in a 152-km(2) basin of Scotty Creek, located in the central part of the Mckenzie River basin in northern Canada. The headwater of Scotty Creek, Goose Lake had a strongly enriched isotopic composition due to evaporation. The stream water composition changed downstream, as the lateral drainage from the active layer of peat plateaus contributed isotopically light and chemically dilute water to channel fens that are part of the drainage network. flat bogs received drainage from peat plateau in addition to direct precipitation, and were internally drained or drained water to adjacent channel fens. Average evapotranspiration estimated from the chloride-balance method was 280-300 mm/yr, which was consistent with the hydrometric estimate (precipitation minus runoff) of 275 mm/yr indicating a potential applicability of this method to ungauged basins. Tracer-based hydrograph separation showed that the direct snowmelt contribution to spring runoff was less than half of total discharge, suggesting an importance of the water stored over winter in lakes and wetlands. The total amount of water stored over winter in the basin was estimated to be 140-240 mm, which was comparable to the average annual basin discharge (149 mm). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The Somali jet established in the 24th pentad and retreated in the 62nd pentad, and the eastern boundary position was maintained at 45-65 degrees E. The establishment time sequence was characterized by an earlier tendency, and the eastern boundary position sequence exhibited the strong interannual variability. The intensity, establishment time and eastern boundary position indices were verified to describe the characteristics of the Somali jet activity from different angle and flank. The connection between these three indices and the Asian monsoon index seemed to be quite different.

The eastern boundary position was negatively related to the first pattern of the summer rainfall in China.

In general, subadult individuals are identified with a tan, buffy or mottled chest, and adults are identified with a black chest. While studying Double-crested Cormorant population dynamics in Ontario, Canada, with known-age birds, it was noted that the plumage of many (> 75%) breeding adults changed from black to heavily mottled during the course of the breeding season. No pattern with age was observed; plumage changed in equal proportions for all ages from 2-year-olds to 7-year-olds. A similar but reverse pattern has been observed with Double-crested Cormorants roosting at sites in the southeastern USA during fall migration. Whereas the majority of the roost had juvenile/ subadult plumage in September, by mid-January the roost had shifted to 75% adult black plumage. The mechanism behind the plumage change is unknown, but extreme caution is advised when using plumage to age cormorants, especially during the winter months. By describing our observations with Doublecrested Cormorants, we hope to encourage future formal research on within-season plumage changes.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				SEP	2018	41	3					316	321		10.1675/063.041.0312	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.041.0312													WOS:000446234000011

Patterns in diurnal airspace use by migratory landbirds along an ecological barrier	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Migratory bird populations and survival are affected by conditions experienced during migration. While many studies and conservation and management efforts focus on terrestrial stoppage and staging areas, the aerial environment through which migrants move also is subjected to anthropogenic impacts with potential consequences to migratory movement and survival. During autumn migration, the northern coastline of Lake Superior acts as an ecological barrier for many landbirds migrating out of the boreal forests of North America. From 24 observation points, we assessed the diurnal movements of birds throughout autumn migration, 2008-2010, within a 210310 km coastal region along the northern coast of Lake Superior. Several raptor species showed patterns in airspace associated with topographic features such as proximity to the coastline and presence of ridgelines. Funneling movement, commonly used to describe the concentration of raptors along a migratory diversion line that either prevents or enhances migration progress, occurred only for Bald and Golden Eagles. This suggests a "leaky" migration funnel for most migratory raptors (e.g., migrating birds exiting the purported migration corridor). Passerines migrating during the late season showed more spatial and temporal structure in airspace distribution than raptors did, including funneling and an association with airspace near the coast. We conclude that (1) the diurnal use of airspace by many migratory landbirds is patterned in space and time, (2) autumn count sites situated along ecological barriers substantially underestimate the number of raptors due to "leakage" out of these concentration areas, and (3) the magnitude and structure of diurnal passerine movements in airspace have been overlooked. The heavy and structured use of airspace by migratory landbirds, especially the airspace associated with anthropogenic development (e.g., buildings, towers, turbines) necessitates a shift in focus to airspace management and conservation attention for these animals.

J	TREASURER, JW				TREASURER, JW			THE PREDATOR-PREY RELATIONSHIP OF PERCH, PERCA-FLUVIATILIS, LARVAE AND ZOOPLANKTON IN 2 SCOTTISH LOCHS	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Food consumption of perch larvae and the impact of this on zooplankton were examined in two adjacent shallow Scottish lochs. Maximum annual abundance of zooplankton occurred in mid-May at L. Kinord with minimum values in mid-June. Copepods were prominent in spring but were followed by a multi-species community of cladocerans and rotifers in summer. At L. Davan zooplankton biomass remained high through summer with cladocerans dominating and Daphnia longispina the most frequent species. Availability of food items was a principal factor governing feeding behaviour of larvae. Copepodite stages were initially the most common item in the diet in L. Kinord in 1976 and 1977 and rotifers the principal food in June 1977, reflecting the dominance of these items in the zooplankton. Cladocerans were dominant in the plankton community in L. Davan and constituted the greater part of food intake. Overlying this general pattern there was an increase in the size of food items taken by larvae with time and also a definite pattern of food selection for copepods, with initially selection for smaller copepodite stages and later for larger stages and adults. On most occasions larvae selected for Cyclops strenuus abyssorum and Polphemus pediculus and selected against Daphnia longispina. The reduction in the total zooplankton biomass attributed to perch larvae was minimal, with the exception of mid-June at L. Kinord in 1976. However, predation on particular species and copepodite stages was occasionally intense and may have impacted the zooplankton populations.

Trends in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in the Great Lakes atmosphere	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) concentrations were measured in both the vapor and particle phases at seven sites near the Great Lakes as a part of the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network. Lower molecular weight PAHs, including fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthrene, and pyrene, were dominant in the vapor phase, and higher molecular weight PAHs, including chrysene, benzo[a] pyrene, and coronene, were dominant in the particle phase. The highest PAH concentrations in both the vapor and particle phases were observed in Chicago followed by the semiurban site at Sturgeon Point, NY. The spatial difference of PAH concentrations can be explained by the local population density. Long-term decreasing trends of most PAH concentrations were observed in both the vapor and particle phases at Chicago, with half-lives ranging from 3-10 years in the vapor phase and 5-15 years in the particle phase. At Eagle Harbor, Sleeping Bear Dunes, and Sturgeon Point, total PAH concentrations in the vapor phase showed significant, but slow, long-term decreasing trends. At the Sturgeon Point site, which was impacted by a nearby city, particle-phase PAH concentrations also declined. However, most particle-phase PAH concentrations did not show significant long-term decreasing trends at the remote sites. Seasonal trends were also observed for particle-phase PAH concentrations, which were higher in the winter and lower in the summer.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 15	2006	40	20					6221	6227		10.1021/es0607279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0607279								17120545					WOS:000241192600011

Nutrients and phytoplankton dynamics in the fishing grounds off Tiruchendur coastal waters, Gulf of Mannar, India	SPRINGERPLUS												Nutrients and phytoplankton dynamics in the traditional fishing grounds off Tiruchendur coast, Gulf of Mannar, India revealed a clear seasonal trend influenced by prevailing monsoon system in east coast of India. A total of 73 species of phytoplankton were identified from the fishing grounds, revealed higher abundance in summer months compared to other seasons. Among the three stations, maximum phytoplankton abundance was recorded in station 2 followed by stations 1 and 3. The phytoplankton abundance ranged from 2.85 x 10(4) to 6.34 x 10(4) cells/l, with higher and lower value observed during summer and post monsoon season respectively. Chl-a showed similar seasonal trend with phytoplankton abundance and fluctuated from 0.4 to 6.8 mg/m(3) with high concentrates were recorded during summer. Primary productivity was ranged from 13.8 to 28.7 mg, C/m(2)/day with maximum and minimum during summer and monsoon respectively. It was understood from the study, ammonia could be acting as the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth, while the role of nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and silicate remained insignificant. At the time of diatom population proliferates there was a drop in the nutrient levels was observed during the study. The water current flowing from north to south during the northeast monsoon, nutrient rich fresh water discharged from Tamirabarani River influencing the nutrient dynamics in the fishing grounds that are ultimately increasing the nutrients concentration during northeast monsoon.																			2193-1801					AUG 24	2016	5								1405	10.1186/s40064-016-3058-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-3058-8								27610324					WOS:000391789700004

However, it remains ambiguous how its phytoplankton growth is limited by various nutrients in different seasons. A series of bottle-enrichment assays in Meiliang Bay was thus performed once a month from July, 2011 to June, 2012 in the present study. The initial chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton cell density ranged from 4.70 to 34.6 mu g/l and from 1.25 x 10(6) to 6.72 x 10(8) cells/l with three peaks in July, November, and March. Although Cyanophyta was dominant (30.9-99.2 percent) in most cases, other phyla like Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Gyptophyta could account for as much as 69.1 percent of total phytoplankton in cold seasons. The microcystin-LR content in the particulate phase followed a similar seasonal pattern as Cyanophyta. It further went up exponentially with the proportion of cyanobacteria in phytoplankton suggesting more toxigenic species and (or) upregulated microcystin synthesis when the contribution of Cyanophyta was enhanced. On the other hand, the dissolved concentrations of various nitrogen and phosphorus species reached their maxima in late spring and autumn, respectively. According to its growth response to nutrient addition, phytoplankton in Meiliang Bay was restricted by nitrogen in August, October, and November. No nutrient limitation occurred in July, September, and April, whereas phosphorus deficiency prevailed in the other months. Overall, nutrient limitation in Lake Taihu and possibly other aquatic ecosystems worldwide may be more dynamic than what we thought before, which should be considered to eliminate eutrophication.

J	Tietje, WD; Teer, JG				Tietje, WD; Teer, JG			Winter feeding ecology of northern shovelers on freshwater and saline wetlands in south Texas	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												During October-May 1982-84, we compared food availability, food use, and gut morphology of northern shovelers (Anas clypeata) on coastal estuarine wetlands in south Texas and on several freshwater lakes 18 km inland to evaluate the relative importance of estuarine versus freshwater habitats. Of 3 seasons and 3 times of day examined, shovelers spent more time feeding in saltwater than freshwater during early winter (P = 0.005) and afternoon (P = 0.005). Available biomass of plankton, nekton, and seeds was greater (P < 0.001) in freshwater than saltwater. Animal foods composed 80% of the saltwater compared to 50% of the freshwater diet. Although plankton composed similar (P = 0.56) proportions of the freshwater and saltwater diets, shovelers ingested more vegetation (P < 0.001) in freshwater and more nekton (P < 0.001) in saltwater. A preference assessment of 8 taxa of shoveler animal foods ranked plankton first and freshwater shrimp (Palaemonetes spp.) last in both habitats. Shoveler intestines were heavier in freshwater during 1982-83 (P < 0.001), but heavier in saltwater (P = 0.048) in 1983-84. During midwinter, shoveler intestines were longer (P = 0.0044) and gizzards were heavier (P < 0.001) in saltwater than freshwater. Overall, ceca mass (P < 0.001) and length (P < 0.001) were greater in freshwater. Food availability and gut morphology data suggest that freshwater wetlands were of higher quality than saltwater wetlands for wintering shovelers. Management of waterfowl habitats in the Texas Gulf Coastal Zone should emphasize protection of freshwater areas from saltwater intrusion and other development activities to maintain optimal wintering habitat for northern shovelers, and perhaps other waterfowl as well.																			0022-541X					OCT	1996	60	4					843	855		10.2307/3802385	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802385													WOS:A1996VV82100018

Contrasting fate of two large phytoplankton species in Lake Biwa	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We estimated the contributions of sedimentation and cell lysis to the loss of two large phytoplankton species (Fragilaria crotonensis and Staurastrum dorsidentiferum) in Lake Biwa. Major loss process differed between species, and large phytoplankton did not necessarily function as a nutrient sink. The spring bloom of F crotonensis was terminated by nutrient depletion and a subsequent increase in sedimentation rate. Although this species could be occasionally grazed by zooplankton, sedimentation eliminated nutrients from the surface. In contrast, the summer bloom of Staurastrum dorsidentiferum crashed mainly as a result of cell lysis caused by fungal infection within the surface mixing layer, which accounted for more than 75% of the mortality rate of this species. Cell lysis of S. dorsidentiferum may lead to nutrients within the surface mixing layer, supporting the production of bacteria and zooplankton. The different loss process of these two species implies that the function of phytoplankton in material flows cannot be assessed by cell size alone. Fungal parasitism can result in a different fate, which may play an important role in material cycling in lakes.

Using multidisciplinary methods (including sedimentological, hydrometric and hydrochemical, pollen, macrofossil, malacological, geochemical, radiocarbon dating, and stable oxygen and carbon isotope analyses) we have been able to (1) reconstruct the main phases of spring-fed fen development, and to (2) determine the cause of Neoholocene groundwater ascension responsible for the mire inception. These phases are characterized by cyclic organic (peat) and carbonate (tufa) sedimentation associated with the Holocene fluctuations in humidity and temperature. The beginning of the activation of hydrological systems (involving the flow of confined groundwater of the Cretaceous aquifer) at Wardzyn occurred in the Subboreal period of the Holocene, after a long episode of decreased humidity initiated ca. 4.2 ka cal BP.

These salt lakes are shallow and ephemeral, with inundation being more regular following winter rainfall, but summer inundation also occurred in 2001. Salinity was generally higher in playas (156-368 g l(-1)) than pans (30-284 g l(-1)), but salinity responded noticeably to heavy rainfall events, especially in pans. pH values in the playa lakes (6.68-7.82) were less variable than in the pans (6.81-8.08). The range of dissolved oxygen concentrations was greater in pans (3.7-14.4 mg l(-1)) than in playas (3.9-8.2 mg l(-1)). Cationic concentrations generally followed the pattern of sea water cation dominance. Benthic microbial communities comprised either cohesive to loosely mucilaginous mats, or thin films of diatoms.

Four main continental trona provinces are recognized at a global scale. They are located in Anatolia (Turkey), Wyoming (USA), Whuceng (China) and Botswana (Southern Africa). The origin of trona deposits is related to alkaline volcanism, thermal spring activity, closed basins and arid climate. Quaternary sodium carbonate minerals (trona minerals) are present in salars (Andes), playa lakes (Lake Van, Turkey and Botswana) and salt pans (USA and Tibet). Some conditions are essential for the formation of economically viable trona deposits: formation of shallow lake environments; source derived explosive andesitic to rhyolitic volcano-sedimentary sequences; concentration of sodium and bicarbonate in the lake, related to direct ash fall into the basin, or hydrothermal solutions along faults; thermal springs near areas of volcanic activity; arid to semi-arid climatic conditions; alkaline lake water. Many minerals contain Na carbonate, but the three that are most important from a worldwide commercial standpoint are trona, nahcolite, and pirssonite, which are produced in a limited number of countries, along with subordinate bradleyite, shortite and thenardite. Pirssonite occurs in organic-rich muds (oil shales). Trona and nahcolite are precipitated subaqueously (in lake waters) and as an interstitial phase in playa muds. Evaporite minerals are closely related to pyrite in oil shales and are also associated with diagenetic silicates (Mg-rich smectites, zeolites, K-feldspar, searlesite, and idiomorphic quartz) and dolomite formed by reaction of alkaline brines with pyroclastic deposits. Natural sodium carbonate minerals (soda minerals) are exploited commercially either from buried fossil trona deposits formed in Tertiary playa-lake sediments or by extraction from the brines of recent alkaline lakes and playas. Most of the world's commercial trona deposits are mined by underground and solution mining methods. Many modern industries use industrial trona minerals.																			1876-1682		978-3-030-02950-0; 978-3-030-02948-7				2019	16						599	633		10.1007/978-3-030-02950-0_12	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-02950-0_12	10.1007/978-3-030-02950-0												WOS:000626351700013

A review of water level fluctuations on aquatic biota with an emphasis on fishes in ice-covered lakes	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The effects of water level fluctuations on fish and other aquatic biota, with an emphasis on winter water withdrawal in northern regions is reviewed. Water demands for population growth and development are adding pressure on water reserves, particularly when coupled with changing climatic conditions. Water level fluctuations can have adverse effects on the environment, most notably to hydrologic and biotic processes ranging in magnitude from the micro-scale to landscape level. Water level management of lakes and reservoirs can affect all forms of aquatic biota. The severity of effect is dependant on the magnitude, duration and timing of the fluctuation, and the species exposed. In northwestern Canada and northern Alaska, water is withdrawn from water bodies to construct ice-roads and other winter based developments. Biota in small, isolated water bodies are particularly sensitive to reductions in winter water levels. Water withdrawals can reduce the oxygen available to overwintering fish, while reduced water levels can reduce habitat for fish and furbearers, and freeze littoral areas killing plants, invertebrates, and fish eggs. Regulatory winter water withdrawal thresholds have been developed in the Northwest Territories and Alaska and continue to be refined as new data becomes available. The use of thresholds can help minimize or avoid negative impacts to the environment, particularly fish, from winter water withdrawal activities. Many different factors may influence the effect that winter water withdrawal has on a water body, such as basin shape, substrate and location. More research is warranted to better understand the linkages between anthropogenic and natural water level fluctuations and their combined effect on aquatic ecosystems. A general decision support system is proposed for minimizing risk to aquatic life from winter water withdrawal activities.

The paper is focused on the introduction of an entirely new "small-scale geopark" establishment in the Vihorlat Mountains, immediately at the Ukrainian border, north-eastwards from the Zemplinska Sirava Dam, which is relatively abundantly visited in the summer season. The area of proposed geopark is lacking in job opportunities, and geotourism development could offer one of few possibilities to generate job opportunities especially for young people. On a relatively small area, the proposed territory offers variegated geological features including four first-order geological units of the Carpathians, five mineralogical localities, unique locality of an abandoned quarry in the Pieniny Klippen Belt, karst phenomena, volcanic structures of five stratovolcanoes, one greater and five small landslide closed lakes, and mineral springs. Beside geological attractions, the following historical monuments are also present in the area: two castle ruins and four wooden churches (one of them inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List). There are also botanical objects, such as natural forests and protected parks in the area, too. Last but not least, three wineries producing high quality red and white wine are situated in the proposed geopark area, which also offer wine tasting.

When acidic anions preferentially elute from melting snow, these low loads may nontheless be enough to acidify low ANC lakes. Two of the ten lakes included in the Sierra Episodes Study are discussed here: High Lake, the only lake in the study to become acidic during snowmelt; and Treasure Lake, typical of the remainder of the lakes. All lakes exhibited increases in NO3- concentrations during early snowmelt these were accompanied by increases in base cations, primarily Ca2+. In the first few days of snowmelt, NO3- concentrations at High Lake increased more rapidly than concentrations of base cations, resulting in ANC values below zero. Export of both NO3- and SO42- from the watersheds exceeded the inputs from the snowpack, suggesting that other sources (e.g., watershed minerals, stored inputs from the previous summer, transformations of other inputs) of these anions are important.					; Stoddard, John/H-5594-2013	Stoddard, John/0000-0002-2537-6130; 													0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					353	358		10.1007/BF00476854	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476854													WOS:A1995UB05300012

In 1975, mean values for 9 precipitation samplers at 1 site (Wraymires) ranged from pH 4.3-4.5; similar values were obtained in 1976. Samplers covered with fine-mesh plastic gauze caught substantially more Ca2+ and K+ than open samplers, but pH and SO42- + NO3- concentrations were similar in open and covered samplers. In precipitation, .apprx. 50% of H+ was balanced by NO3-and .apprx. 50% by SO42- was balanced by Ca2+ and Mg2+. Concentrations of major cations (H+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) and anions (Cl-, NO3-, SO42- and alkalinity [ALk.sbd.largely HCO3-]) in upland waterbodies were similar to those found in precipitation, but pH levels were generally higher and above 6.0 in some tarns. At lower altitudes, on base-rich rocks and soils, Ca2+ and Alk become dominant. Results of a survey of lakes and tarns in 1974-1978 are compared with a survey in 1953-56 and published data (chiefly for pH and Alk) for 1947-50, 1932 and 1928. Comparisons are also made with other measurements of Alk in 3 productive lakes (Blelham Tarn, Esthwaite Water and Windermere) for 1936-1939 and 1945-1980. Winter levels of NO3-N, PO4-P and Si are given for these lakes; although the 1st 2 have increased during the late 1960s and the 1970s there has been no significant change in the last. Considerable seasonal fluctuations in the concentrations of major ions, a characteristic feature of surface waters in the English Lake District, are illustrated and some implications for cation-anion balance briefly discussed. Mid-winter concentrations are usually high for Na+, K+, Cl- and NO3- and low for Ca2+, Mg2+, Alk and 2-. Alk, pH and conductivity of Lake District tarns and lakes show no signs of acidification from 1928-1980. Productive lakes have become more alkaline and some unproductive low-alkalinity (< 100 .mu.eq l-1) lakes also show signs of alkalinization, with increased mean concentrations of Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+, balanced by Alk, NO3- and probably some SO42-. In productive lakes a substantial (.apprx. 50%) rise in mean Alk occurred during the late 1960s and the 1970s, possibly related to increased winter levels of NO3-N and PO4-P derived from sewage and fertilizers. The maximum pH levels reached in summer were notably high, sometimes exceeding pH 10. The rise in Alk, conductivity and pH of surface waters is influenced by climatic factors (a decade of drier years), sewage input and biological productivity within the lakes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1982	12	5					451	506		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00640.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00640.x													WOS:A1982PH94700007
J	HART, RC				HART, RC			ZOOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE, COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS IN RELATION TO INORGANIC TURBIDITY, AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR A POTENTIAL FISHERY IN SUBTROPICAL LAKE LE-ROUX, SOUTH-AFRICA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The abundance and composition of entomostracan zooplankton were studied between 1977 and 1984 in relation to abiotic and biotic conditions in Lake le Roux (LLR), a large silt-laden reservoir on the Orange River formed in 1976. The community consisted of Metadiaptomus meridianus, Lovenula excellens (Calanoida), Daphnia gibba, D. barbata, D. longispina and Moina brachiata (Cladocera), and various Cyclopoida. 2. Zooplankton biomass varied seasonally from winter lows below 50 mg m-2 dry wt at temperatures of 9-10.degree. C to summer peaks generally above 1000 mg m-2 at 21-23.degree. C. It correlated strongly and positively with prevailing water temperature and transparency but only weakly with chlorophyll concentration. 3. Mean annual zooplankton biomass, which varied four-fold (97-408 mg m-2) in 7 years, increased with annual mean transparency (23-75 cm Secchi depth) and especially with summer heat content (33-320 degree-days above 20.degree. C) which was itself positively correlated with transparency. 4. Daphnid species showed most annual variation in abundance. Large forms (D. gibba and D. barbata) were scarce or absent in two years of very low transparency and low planktivore abundance. The smaller D. longispina developed once during clearer conditions when more fish were present. Copepod biomass also varied inversely with turbidity, but was not as severely reduced at high turbidities. 5. Smallmouth yellowfish (Barbus aeneus: Cyprinidae) is the principal planktivore and candidate fishery species in LLR. It feeds selectively on Lovenula and large daphnids. Catches and growth rates of yellowfish varied directly with the abundance of zooplankton, particularly large food forms, and with water transparency. High turbidity and associated food limitation seems to reduce standing stocks especially of the daphnid zooplankton more than the effects of fish predation. 6. Spawning of yellowfish depends upon the release of water from an upstream reservoir which concurrently reduces transparency and thus zooplankton availability in LLR. Transparency values above 30-35 cm SD appear necessary for the development of sufficient and suitable zooplankton to benefit the fishery.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	1986	16	3					351	+		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1986.tb00976.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1986.tb00976.x													WOS:A1986C915200005

We also developed empirical models between TD, TT, TS, and surface-water temperature (0-2 m) (T0-2 (m)), and transparency (Secchi disk depth, SDD). Additionally, we assessed the changes in TD, TT, and TS over the past 62 yr, based on our empirical models, air temperature data from 1951 to 2012, and SDD data from 1987 to 2012. Lake Qiandaohu is warm monomictic, with a long period of thermal stratification from April until January, and only a short period of mixing in the winter or spring (February or March). There were significant correlations between SDD and TD (positive), and between SDD and TT (negative). There was a significant negative correlation between T0-2 m and TD during the stratification weakness period (July-February), and a significant positive correlation between T0-2 m and TT for all data, including the stratification formation and weakness periods. Air temperature near the lake rose 1.2 degrees C between 1951 and 2012, corresponding to a 0.8 degrees C increase in T0-2 (m), and a 0.78 m decrease in SDD between 1987 and 2012. The increase in air temperature and the decrease in SDD caused a decrease in TD and an increase in TT, facilitating the thermal stratification and stability of the lake; therefore, climate warming has had a significant effect on the thermal regime of Lake Qiandaohu.

This study presented the monthly and spatial variations of atmospheric DF and their elemental components (Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr, Ti, V, Si, and Hg). Dust samples were collected from four urban and suburban sampling sites around Tabriz, Iran, by using the ASTM method D-1739 during April to September 2017. Moreover, the ICP-OES was used to determine metal components of the DF. The obtained results showed that the DF amount ranged between 1.8-27.6 (7.4 +/- 5.6) g/m(2).month. The elements of Fe (11863-13,906mg/Kg and 85%-89%), Al (858-1205mg/Kg and 4%-8%), and Si (274-386mg/Kg) were the dominant elemental concentrations of the DF. The average value of enrichment factor (EF) for Hg, Pb, Cu, Sr, Co, Ni, Mn, and V was greater than 10 in all the samples, showing that anthropogenic sources emit a considerable amount of elements in DF rather than the soil or Urmia lake bed. The result of correlations between the concentration of dust fall with humidity, temperature, wind speed, and precipitation showed that there was a direct relationship between the amount of dust fall and wind speed while humidity, precipitation, and temperature were inversely proportional to the amount of dust fall. This study revealed that earth crust and anthropogenic activities such as vehicle traffic, combustion of fossil fuel, and different industrial activities were the main sources of the DF in the studied areas.

The Influence of Dissolved Oxygen on Winter Habitat Selection by Largemouth Bass: An Integration of Field Biotelemetry Studies and Laboratory Experiments	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												In this study, field biotelemetry and laboratory physiology approaches were coupled to allow understanding of the behavioral and physiological responses of fish to winter hypoxia. The biotelemetry study compared dissolved oxygen levels measured throughout the winter period with continually tracked locations of nine adult largemouth bass obtained from a whole-lake submerged telemetry array. Fish habitat usage was compared with habitat availability to assess whether fish were selecting for specific dissolved oxygen concentrations. The laboratory study examined behavioral and physiological responses to progressive hypoxia in juvenile largemouth bass acclimated to winter temperatures. Results from the dissolved oxygen measurements made during the biotelemetry study showed high variance in under-ice dissolved oxygen levels. Avoidance of water with dissolved oxygen <2.0 mg/L by telemetered fish was demonstrated, but significant use of water with intermediate dissolved oxygen levels was also found. Results from the lab experiments showed marked changes in behavior (i.e., yawning and vertical movement) at <2.0 mg/L of dissolved oxygen but no change in tissue lactate, an indicator of anaerobic metabolism. Combined results of the biotelemetry and laboratory studies demonstrate that a dissolved oxygen content of 2.0 mg/L may be a critical threshold that induces behavioral responses by largemouth bass during the winter. In addition, the use by fish of areas with intermediate levels of dissolved oxygen suggests that there are multiple environmental factors influencing winter behavior.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Hasler, Caleb/H-6066-2019	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X; 													1522-2152	1537-5293				MAR-APR	2009	82	2					143	152		10.1086/591806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/591806								19199559					WOS:000263555700005
J	Padon, O; Ashkenazy, Y				Padon, Oded; Ashkenazy, Yosef			Non-hydrostatic effects in the Dead Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The Dead Sea is the saltiest and lowest terminal lake in the world. For at least three decades, the Dead Sea's water level has been dropping by more than 1 m per year, due to excessive use of the water that previously flowed into it. The Dead Sea constitutes a unique environment and is important from economic, environmental, and touristic points of view. The winter deep convection of the Dead Sea and its deep and narrow basin suggest that nonhydrostatic effects may significantly affect its circulation. Despite these factors, the expected non-hydrostatic effects on the circulation of the Dead Sea have not been investigated. Here we perform high resolution (100 m) ocean general circulation model (the MITgcm) simulations of the Dead Sea and show that the non-hydrostatic results are very different from the hydrostatic ones. Specifically, we show that the winter non-hydrostatic simulations resulted in a layer of dense water overlaying slightly lighter water during the several last hours of the night; this convection process involved plumes of heavier sinking water and the entrainment of the plumes. We also studied the effect of the wind stress's diurnal variability and found it to be important, especially during the summer when the wind's variability drastically increased the surface kinetic energy; however, it did not alter the depth density profile. The results presented here may be important for the Dead Sea's potash industry and for the planned Red Sea-Dead Sea canal that aims to stop and, possibly, to increase the level of the Dead Sea using the Red Sea's water.					; Ashkenazy, Yosef/AAV-3218-2020	Ashkenazy, Yosef/0000-0001-9405-068X; 													0924-7963	1879-1573				NOV	2018	187						36	51		10.1016/j.jmarsys.2018.06.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2018.06.007													WOS:000445313300004

A sediment trap study was conducted in the central basin of Lower Lough Erne, Northern Ireland. 2. The material caught was low in organic matter, ash weight was 77% of dry weight on average. 3. Mass deposition of material was shown to be correlated with lake water level. When lake water level fell or rose above the middle range, the amount of material caught by the trap increased markedly. The effect was exaggerated by an unusually dry summer in 1995 which caused abnormally low water levels in the lake. 4. Comparison of Erne data with Windermere shows similar deposition rate of many substances, but the deposition rate of iron is thirteen times higher in Erne than in Windermere, and iron made up 39% of the ash weight in the Erne trap data. 5. Only 17% of the silica removed from the water column during diatom growth was recovered in the trap over the same time period. 6.

In situ, transparent and dark flux chambers were used for direct measurements of benthic fluxes of dissolved oxygen, nutrients, silica and certain metals, taking into account primary production and mineral precipitation. The range of benthic flux observed for dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), ammonium, ortho-P, silica, calcium, and magnesium was -45.89 to 187.03, -99.32 to 50.96, -1.30 to 1.27, -0.51 to 0.39, -62.3 to 9.3, -33.82 to 16.83, and -23.93 to 7.52 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively (negative value indicating flux towards the lake bottom). Low benthic NH4+ and ortho-P fluxes were likely related to benthic algal production, and aerobic bottom water. Ortho-P fluxes could also be controlled by the dissolution/precipitation of ferrihydrite, calcite, and perhaps hydroxyapatite. The negative silica fluxes were caused by diatom frustule synthesis. Benthic calcium and magnesium fluxes could be related to algal production and dissolution/precipitation of calcium and/or Ca, Mg-carbonates. Fluxes of DO, DIC, pH and alkalinity were related to benthic biological processes. It is likely that some of the carbon precipitates as calcite at the high pH in the summer and dissolves at neutral pH in the winter. Mean of the ratio of gross benthic DIC consumption and gross benthic DO production was 0.94 +/- 0.18, consistent with algal production using NH4+ as N source. During the summer weeks the water column pH remains above 10. This high pH is caused by direct and indirect utilisation of CO2, HCO3-, CO3-2, H4SiO4degrees and H3SiO4 by primary producers. This study shows that in shallow lakes at high latitudes, where summer days are long and the primary production is mostly by diatoms, the pH is forced to very high values. The high pH could lead to a positive feedback for the Si flux, but negative feedback for the NH4+ flux.																			1386-2588	1573-5125					2004	38	2					191	207		10.1023/B:AECO.0000032066.65901.1f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:AECO.0000032066.65901.1f													WOS:000222064400008

Observations of supra-glacial lakes in west Greenland using winter wide swath Synthetic Aperture Radar	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Melt water gathered in supra-glacial lakes on the Greenland ice sheet contributes to reduced basal friction by the input of water from the surface to the bed during the melt season. Supra-glacial lakes change on both annual and inter-annual timescales. The high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can be used to capture annual changes on the highly transient/fast-draining lakes. However, MODIS imagery lacks the ability to penetrate clouds. Using ENVISAT Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) winter images, we show that SAR images can be used to identify seasonal/inter-annual changes in the lake area. Furthermore, winter SAR images identify lakes obscured to optical data by ice and snow cover. However, the SAR imagery systematically failed to discriminate narrow lakes and lakes in corrugated topography. Thus, SAR images can be used as a complement to existing visiblenear-infrared data but do not offer a viable replacement.

Claim of solar influence is on thin ice: are 11-year cycle solar minima associated with severe winters in Europe?	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												A recent paper in Geophysical Research Letters, 'Solar influence on winter severity in central Europe', by Sirocko et al (2012 Geophys. Res. Lett. 39 L16704) claims that 'weak solar activity is empirically related to extremely cold winter conditions in Europe' based on analyses of documentary evidence of freezing of the River Rhine in Germany and of the Reanalysis of the Twentieth Century (20C). However, our attempt to reproduce these findings failed. The documentary data appear to be selected subjectively and agree neither with instrumental observations nor with two other reconstructions based on documentary data. None of these datasets show significant connection between solar activity and winter severity in Europe beyond a common trend. The analysis of Sirocko et al of the 20C circulation and temperature is inconsistent with their time series analysis. A physically-motivated consistent methodology again fails to support the reported conclusions. We conclude that multiple lines of evidence contradict the findings of Sirocko et al.

Seasonal variability in glacial influence affects macroinvertebrate assemblages in North-Andean Patagonian glacier-fed streams	INLAND WATERS												Macroinvertebrate communities of glacial streams are affected by melting mountain glaciers, which in turn are influenced by landscape and local and global climate change. We analyzed macroinvertebrate communities in 2 North-Andean Patagonian glacier-fed streams. The significant difference in glacial influence between the 2 streams was due to differences in glacier flow velocity and to the presence of a proglacial lake in one of the streams. Our main aim was to analyze whether temporal variations in physical and chemical parameters of meltwater produced shifts in macroinvertebrate taxon richness and community composition. We applied the glaciality index (GI) to consider the combined effect of suspended solids, water temperature, conductivity, and streambed stability. On each stream we established one sampling station; we sampled during the melting season (spring-summer) of 3 consecutive years on 12 occasions. Macroinvertebrate taxon richness, diversity, and evenness increased as glacial influence decreased. Scrapers were the dominant functional feeding group in the stream with the lower glacial influence while detritivores-gathers dominated under high glacial influence. We further analyzed how temporal changes in the GI affected compositional differences among communities using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. Under a stable GI, communities showed no substantial compositional changes (low Bray-Curtis), whereas under change in glacial influence (Delta GI not equal 0) the communities decreased in similarity.					; Martyniuk, Nico/GXF-9085-2022; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; Martyniuk, Nicolas/0000-0002-2423-7040; 													2044-2041	2044-205X				OCT 2	2019	9	4					522	533		10.1080/20442041.2019.1624115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2019.1624115													WOS:000498061700010

Climate variability and glacial processes in eastern Iceland during the past 700 years based on varved lake sediments	BOREAS												Properties of varved sediments from Lake Logurinn in eastern Iceland and their link to climate and glacial processes of Eyjabakkajokull, an outlet glacier of the Vatnajokull icecap, were examined. A varve chronology, which covers the period AD 1262-2005, was constructed from visual observations, high-resolution images, X-ray density and geochemical properties determined from X-radiography and X-ray fluorescence scanning. Independent dating provided by 137Cs analysis and eight historical tephras verify the varve chronology. The thickness of dark-coloured seasonal laminae, formed mainly of coarser suspended matter from the non-glacial river Grimsa, is positively correlated (r=0.70) with winter precipitation, and our 743-year-long varve series indicates that precipitation was higher and more varied during the later part of the Little Ice Age. Light-coloured laminae thickness, controlled mainly by the amount of finer suspended matter from the glacial river Jokulsa i Fljotsdal, increased significantly during the AD 1972 surge of Eyjabakkajokull. As a consequence of the surge, the ice-dammed Lake Haoldulon formed and recurrently drained and delivered significant amounts of rock flour to Lake Logurinn. Based on these observations, and the recurring cyclic pattern of periods of thicker light-coloured laminae in the sediment record, we suggest that Eyjabakkajokull has surged repeatedly during the past 743 years, but with an increased frequency during the later part of the Little Ice Age.

Two parallel cores (ZGTC A-1 and ZGTC A-2) were collected from the lake at a water depth of 25 m during summer 2006. The chronology of core A-1 was reconstructed based on the Constant Initial Concentration (CIC) model of Pb-210 and three accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) ages from the chitin fragments. The hard water effect calibration of the sediment C-14 age showed that the reservoir effect ranged from 1655 yr at 1950 AD to 1540 yr at 1610 AD. The hydrological variation in Zige Tangco during the past 800 yr was reconstructed using multi-proxies, including organic and carbonate content, stable isotopes of fine-grained carbonate minerals (< 38.5 <mu>m) and grain-size distribution of the lake sediments. Our results show that there were strong fluctuations in the lake level between 1200 and 1820 AD, and at least three dry periods were recorded between 1235 and 1315 AD, 1410 and 1580 AD, and 1660 and 1720 AD characterized by high carbonate content, abrupt positive shifts of stable isotopes, and high sand content. The low-lake-level periods during the Little Ice Age (LIA) in Zige Tangco correspond to the lower delta O-18 values in the Guliya ice core and the lower precipitation reconstructed from tree rings in Delingha. This demonstrated that the summer monsoon on the central Tibetan Plateau weakened during the dry and cold periods, whereas the winter monsoon strengthened. Relatively wetter periods or higher lake levels in Zige Tangco occurred at 1580-1650 AD and 1820-1900 AD. Negative shifts in stable isotopes were related to increased lake levels between 1800 and 1820 AD. Our results also showed that the summer monsoon precipitation on the central Tibetan Plateau was mainly controlled by solar activity during the past 800 yr.					zhang, hongliang/AAC-6827-2021														2095-0195	2095-0209				DEC	2023	17	4					945	955		10.1007/s11707-023-1093-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-023-1093-7		JAN 2024											WOS:001142677800002

General linear regressions were used to analyze the relationship between changes in the abundances of three herbivorous geese (Eastern Tundra Bean Goose Anser fabalis serrirostris, Lesser White-fronted Geese Anser erythropus, and Greater White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons frontalis) and their wintering habitats in the East Dongting Lake during 2002/2003-2014/2015. The fluctuations in three herbivorous goose abundances exhibited negative correlations with changes in interval duration (i.e., days between complete sedge meadow exposure and goose arrival in the study areas), but positive correlations with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of sedge meadow in late wintering seasons. Comparing to Eastern Tundra Bean Goose, Lesser White-fronted Geese and Greater White-fronted Geese were more sensitive to habitat changes. No significant correlations were observed between goose abundances and both mean water levels and sedge meadow areas. Results indicate that the variations in herbivorous goose abundances may be caused by changes in the NDVI of sedge meadows and the interval durations between sedge meadow exposure and goose arrival. The earlier flood recession can accelerate the exposure, growth, and withering of sedge meadows (low NDVI in late January), thereby creating unsuitable feeding conditions for the geese in the wintering seasons. These findings are important as efforts are made to protect these valuable species from the effects of human intervention, and in particular, the Three Gorges Dam project.																			1436-3798	1436-378X				MAR	2017	17	3					879	888		10.1007/s10113-016-1087-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-016-1087-z													WOS:000394991000021

The present study deals with the phytoplankton dynamics, biomass and physicochemical features in freshwater reservoir, Tillari, western India. The reservoir experience seasonal stratification and mixing associated changes in the biogeochemical aspects especially the phytoplankton community and chlorophyll a (hereafter, Chl a). The influence of seasonality was lesser in the deeper water in the reservoir. Buildup in phytoplankton biomass (up to 6.6 mg m(-3)) was observed in the upper strata of the water column (epilimnion) during the monsoon period (June-July) and winter (December) as a result of nutrient enrichment from the hypolimnion. Among nutrients, nitrate was associated with buildup of Chl a in the epilimnion during summer (r(2 )= 0.7). A total of 91 phytoplankton species were identified with major contribution by charophytes and chlorophytes. The dominant phytoplankton species belonged to genera Staurastrum, Cosmarium, Aulacoseira, Nephrocytium and Shroederia. Charophytes made a remarkable presence during the whole study period in the well oxygenated epilimnion as well as in the hypolimnion with relatively low oxygen. Diatom, the major silica sinking group was relatively less abundant. Keeping the importance of the reservoir in view, the understanding of phytoplankton community from this poorly explored reservoir with respect to influencing factors is a very vital baseline information. Thus, to design and evaluate the management strategies for the reservoir, continuous monitoring and processes studies is warranted.

However, the data regarding to the environmental behavior, especially in atmospheric transfer and air-seawater exchange, are still sparse. In this study, seasonal marine boundary layer air and seawater samples were collected from Chinese Bohai sea and a fugacity model was built to evaluate the air-seawater diffusion and deposition flux of CPs. Generally, the total CP levels in atmosphere and seawater samples in summer were higher than those in spring, and CPs existed mostly in the gaseous phase in air and the dissolved phase in seawater. For SCCPs, C-10 and C-11 components were the most abundant homologue groups. For MCCPs, the C-14 homologue dominated in the particle phase of atmosphere and particulate phase of seawater. The logarithmic fugacity ratios (log f(a)/f(w)) of higher chlorinated congeners (Cl-8 to Cl-10: 0.71 to 1.32 in May and 1.38 to 2.29 in August) indicated that net deposition was the predominant process, whereas lower chlorinated congeners, especially Cl-5 homologue groups in August, showed a trend of net volitization (log f(a)/f(w) < -0.5). The results of diffusion and dry deposition fluxes indicated that air-seawater gas exchange of CPs was significantly higher than dry deposition in the sampling areas.					; Gao, Wei/HLH-2787-2023; Wang, Yawei/C-5628-2015	Ma, Xindong/0000-0001-8949-9327; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 17	2018	52	14					7729	7735		10.1021/acs.est.8b01803	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b01803								29939722					WOS:000439397800017

Processes controlling the flow of water into rivers in the headwater systems in Tien Shan (Kyrgyzstan) and Pamir (Tajikistan) are therefore most relevant. Lake water mineralization is strongly dependent on river discharge and has been inferred from spectrometrically determined gypsum and other salt contents. Comparison of high-resolution mineralization data with tree ring data, other proxies for tracing temperature and snow cover in NW China, and accumulation rates in the Guliya Ice Core indicate that mineralization over the past similar to 2000 yrs in the Aral Sea reflects snow cover variability and glacier extent in Tien Shan and Pamir (at the NW and W edges of the Tibetan Plateau). Snow cover in W Central Asia is preferentially a winter expression controlled by temperature patterns that impact the moisture-loading capacity over N Europe and NW Asia (Clark et al., 1999). We observed that the runoff, resulting from warmer winter temperatures in W Central Asia and resulting in a reduction of snow cover, decreased between AD 100-300, AD 1150-1250, AD 1380-1450, AD 1580-1680 and during several low frequency events after AD 1800. Furthermore, we observed a negative relationship between the amount of mineralization in the Aral Sea and SW summer monsoon intensity starting with the Little Ice Age. Based on these observations, we conclude that the lake level changes during the past similar to 2000 yrs were mostly climatically controlled. Around AD 200, AD 1400 and during the late 20th century AD, human activities (namely irrigation) may also have synergistically influenced discharge dynamics in the lower river courses.

J	Prasad, AA; Nishant, N; Kay, M				Prasad, Abhnil Amtesh; Nishant, Nidhi; Kay, Merlinde			Dust cycle and soiling issues affecting solar energy reductions in Australia using multiple datasets	APPLIED ENERGY												Dust plays a vital role in the Earth's climate system and can also modulate solar energy yield from photovoltaics due to soiling and it also impacts concentrated solar power outputs by up to 30%. Research examining decreased energy production on solar panels due to dust accumulation is limited. This is particularly important for dry arid regions of Australia, which are prone to dust storms. Thus, this paper examines the dust characteristics over Australia by comparing two reanalysis products, the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) with the satellite data (Himawari-8) to ascertain the capabilities of the reanalysis products in capturing dust cycles over Australia. The results are then used to explore the seasonal variability and trends in the radiative impacts, emissions, and depositions of dust. The energy reductions from seasonal averaged dust accumulations without natural removal or cleaning and later the impact of soiling with removal from precipitation bursts on selected operational solar farms are presented. Results show that MERRA-2 outperforms CAMS in capturing Dust Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) near the Lake Eyre Basin in all seasons, consistent with satellite observations. The radiative trends showed contrasting differences during the Spring and Summer, whereas seasonal dust emissions and depositions peaked at 1.4 gm(-2). Similarly, seasonal dust accumulations without natural removal on panels showed significant reductions in the energy of up to 3% around the Lake Eyre Basin, but most operational solar farms in Australia depicted energy reductions of 8-9% due to accumulated dust of up to 2.5-3 gm(-2), which was naturally removed from regular seasonal rainfall bursts.

The quantification and, more importantly, the speciation of chemical substances that indicate the presence of anthropogenic contamination in water resources are of great importance. This paper presents the results of analysis for the determination of organic, inorganic and total phosphorus, pseudo-sulfur, and iron and manganese, in five fractions, in water sediments collected from the Capivara Hydroelectric Power Plant, Brazil. A study on the seasonal variation of these parameters was conducted, with data having been collected in the winter and in the summer, at two sites along the dam, 5 km apart, close to the city of Primeiro de Maio. Phosphorous was found in sediments and adjacent soil in the organic form (OP), and was used as an indicator of anthropogenic influence on the reservoir banks. Speciation of potentially toxic Mn showed that it is present in the exchangeable fraction of the 0-5 cm depth layer (sediment/water interface), making its transfer to the water column possible. Results from this study showed that domestic and industrial effluent treatment measures are needed for the preservation of the quality of aquatic environments.

Sakari; Plikk, Anna; Helmens, Karin			Seasonal variability in temperature trends and atmospheric circulation systems during the Eemian (Last Interglacial) based on n-alkanes hydrogen isotopes from Northern Finland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Last Interglacial warm period, the Eemian (ca. 130-116 thousand years ago), serves as a reference for projected future climate in a warmer world. However, there is a limited understanding of the seasonal characteristics of interglacial climate dynamics, especially in high latitude regions. In this study, we aim to provide new insights into seasonal trends in temperature and moisture source location, linked to shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns, for northern Fennoscandia during the Eemian. Our study is based on the distribution and stable hydrogen isotope composition (delta D) of n-alkanes in a lake sediment sequence from the Sokli paleolake in NE Finland, placed in a multi-proxy framework. The delta D values of predominantly macrophyte-derived mid-chain n-alkanes are interpreted to reflect lake water delta D variability influenced by winter precipitation delta D (delta Dprec), ice cover duration and deuterium (D)-depleted meltwater. The delta D values of terrestrial plant-derived long-chain n-alkanes primarily reflect soil water delta D variability modulated by summer delta Dprec and by the evaporative enrichment of soil and leaf water. The delta Dprec variability in our study area is mostly attributed to the temperature effect and the moisture source location linked to the relative dominance between D-depleted continental and polar air masses and D-enriched North Atlantic air masses. The biomarker signal further corroborates earlier diatom-based studies and pollen-inferred January and July temperature reconstructions from the same sediment sequence. Three phases of climatic changes can be identified that generally follow the secular variations in seasonal insolation: (i) an early warming trend succeeded by a period of strong seasonality (ii) a mid-optimum phase with gradually decreased seasonality and cooler summers, and (iii) a late climatic instability with a cooling trend. Superimposed on this trend, two abrupt cooling events occur in the early and late Eemian. The Sokli delta D variability is generally in good agreement with other North Atlantic and Siberian records, reflecting major changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns during the Eemian as a response to orbital and oceanic forcings.

Surface, subsurface and depth samples of snow and firns were collected from the Agassiz Ice Cap, Ellesmere Island, Canada using clean room practices. Results for Tl (directly determined by LEAFS) and Cd (determined by GFAAS) are reported. To our knowledge, the thallium depth profile presented here is the first one so far reported for both polar systems, Greenland or other places. Tl concentrations peak in the winter-spring periods, when the Arctic atmosphere is loaded with foreign pollutants and suspended particulates which sometime severely reduce the visibility, creating a phenomenon commonly known as the Arctic haze. These results are in general accordance with the historical Arctic air pollution and acidity/conductivity data on ice cores. Surface concentrations of Tl range from 0.3 to 0.9 pg/g, which is a few times higher than those found in Antarctica. Cadmium shows seasonal characteristics similar to Tl although there is not a definite correlation between the two. However, there could be two predominant origins of metals which were deposited in the snow: Eurasian origin in January-April corresponding to high level metals (main deposition), and a less definite origin in May-December corresponding to low level metals.																			0937-0633					JUN	1996	355	3-4					332	335											15045403					WOS:A1996UT01900040

Declines in ice cover are accompanied by light limitation responses and community change in freshwater diatoms	ISME JOURNAL												The rediscovery of diatom blooms embedded within and beneath the Lake Erie ice cover (2007-2012) ignited interest in psychrophilic adaptations and winter limnology. Subsequent studies determined the vital role ice plays in winter diatom ecophysiology as diatoms partition to the underside of ice, thereby fixing their location within the photic zone. Yet, climate change has led to widespread ice decline across the Great Lakes, with Lake Erie presenting a nearly "ice-free" state in several recent winters. It has been hypothesized that the resultant turbid, isothermal water column induces light limitation amongst winter diatoms and thus serves as a competitive disadvantage. To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted a physiochemical and metatranscriptomic survey that spanned spatial, temporal, and climatic gradients of the winter Lake Erie water column (2019-2020). Our results suggest that ice-free conditions decreased planktonic diatom bloom magnitude and altered diatom community composition. Diatoms increased their expression of various photosynthetic genes and iron transporters, which suggests that the diatoms are attempting to increase their quantity of photosystems and light-harvesting components (a well-defined indicator of light limitation). We identified two gene families which serve to increase diatom fitness in the turbid ice-free water column: proton-pumping rhodopsins (a potential second means of light-driven energy acquisition) and fasciclins (a means to "raft" together to increase buoyancy and co-locate to the surface to optimize light acquisition). With large-scale climatic changes already underway, our observations provide insight into how diatoms respond to the dynamic ice conditions of today and shed light on how they will fare in a climatically altered tomorrow.

Characterization of anadromous Arctic char winter habitat and egg incubation areas in collaboration with Inuit fishers	ARCTIC SCIENCE												In Nunavik, anadromous Arctic char spend more than 6 months under ice-covered habitats, mainly in lakes. Their winter habitats in this region have been scarcely studied due to the challenging logistics in the Arctic. In this study, we worked with Inuit fishers to characterize the winter habitat and incubation areas used by Arctic chars in five overwintering lakes and one lentic river reach. The collaborating fishers determined char occupancy of certain areas related to fishing sites (presence, absence, and spawning) and conducted measurements to characterize the sites while performing their fishing activities. The data showed that incubation areas were associated with significantly shallower depths and warmer (albeit not statistically significant) lake bottom temperatures than sites where no spawning occurs, which is beneficial for egg maturation. The productivity of these areas is also beneficial for fry that hatch during winter. Adult and post-smolt habitats tended to be associated with cold littoral zone, but their habitat did not show any other distinct characteristics. This exploratory study adds insights into the cryptic characteristics of the Arctic char winter habitat use, thanks to the Inuit fishers' knowledge of fish habitats and movements, and the experience and expertise they have acquired working in the local environment.

Growth, longevity, and climate-growth relationships of Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) in Hongze Lake, China	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Corbicula fluminea is invasive in other parts of the world, but in China, it is native and supports important commercial fisheries. Surprisingly little is known about the ecology of native C. fluminea populations in China, including how life-history parameters, such as growth, may respond to widely variable environmental conditions, especially water-level management. A native C. fluminea population that supports a local commercial fishery in Hongze Lake (the 4th-largest freshwater lake in China and the largest impounded lake on the East Route of the South to North Water Transfer Project [ESNT]) was studied. Age, growth, and climate-growth relationships were estimated based on thin-sectioned shells. Sclerochronological techniques were used to detrend individual growth measurement series and to investigate climate factors that influenced growth over time. Six age-classes of C. fluminea were identified. Lee's phenomenon (i.e., underestimated sizes at earlier age classes in survivors) was evident. A von Bertalanffy growth function was fitted to estimate shell height (SH)-at-age (SH infinity = 45.2 mm, k = 0.13 and t(o)= -1.11). Growth rates of individuals were extremely synchronous over time (2007-2011) (interseries r = 0.81), suggesting common growth drivers among individuals. Growth was positively correlated with food availability (chlorophyll a), annual runoff, regional annual total precipitation, and lake water level, and negatively correlated with extreme temperatures and annual temperature variance. The results suggest current water-level management practices that lower water level during summer may be limiting somatic growth and production of C. fluminea. Operation of the ESNT may have been working to benefit C. fluminea growth by increasing water availability from winter through early summer, a hypothesis that should be further investigated.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2017	36	3					595	608		10.1086/693463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/693463													WOS:000407373600012

The picoplankton community was dominated by single phycoerythrin-containing (PE) Synechococcus (59%) with lesser amounts of chlorophyll fluorescing cells (21%), PE colonial Synechococcus-like cells (11%), other PE colonial Chroococcales (6%), and other cells (3%). Single PE Synechococcus was abundant throughout the year whereas chlorophyll-fluorescing and colonial cyanobacteria were more abundant during the periods of spring isothermal mixing and summer stratification, respectively. Picoplankton accounted for an average of 10% (range 0.5-50%) of phototrophic biomass. Phototrophic organisms that passed 1-, 3-, and 10-mu-m screens were responsible for an average of 17% (range 6-43%), 40% (21-65%), and 70% (52-90%) of primary production. Maximum contributions of < 1, < 3, and < 10-mu-m size fractions occurred during the period of thermal stratification. Primary production by phototrophic picoplankton was found to equal production in the < 1-mu-m size fraction.

Several thousand geese visit South Korea every winter, but currently it is unclear which habitats are preferred by the geese. Understanding patterns of habitat usage is important for establishing conservation strategies, as some habitats may be disappearing more rapidly than others making it critical to know whether or not a disappearing habitat is crucial to certain birds. In this study, we investigated the habitat use of the wintering populations of Bean Goose Anser fabalis and Greater White-fronted Goose A. albifrons. We found that the wintering populations of these two geese species in South Korea have stabilized after sudden increases during the mid and late 2000s. Both species formed larger wintering populations at coastal lakes, on reclaimed lands, and at estuaries than on freshwater habitats, which may be related to the availability and/or diversity of food items. Considering that environmental changes resulting from development and climate change are reducing the inshore areas and estuaries, the role of artificial wetlands, such as reclaimed areas that are used as rice fields, is important for conservation of geese that overwinter in Korea.																			1347-0558					JUL	2016	15	2					141	149																WOS:000380826600006
J	Furgal, JA; Taylor, WD; Smith, REH				Furgal, JA; Taylor, WD; Smith, REH			Environmental control of photosynthate allocation in the phytoplankton of Georgian Bay (Lake Huron)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Allocation of photosynthate by phytoplankton in Georgian Bay was measured from spring through fall of 1993 to test previous models for environmental control of allocation and to assess for the first time the effects on allocation of solar ultraviolet radiation. Ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-320 nm) at near-surface levels significantly inhibited photosynthesis (by up to 82%) under both natural and artificial light. UV-B effects on allocation to protein, polysaccharide, low molecular weight materials, and total lipids were rarely significant, but the sensitivity of photosynthesis to UV-B increased directly with allocation to protein. UV-B exposure had more influence on allocation among lipid classes, but the effects were still statistically marginal. Allocation to protein and glycolipids varied directly with silicon availability, while allocation to total lipids and glycolipids varied inversely with phosphorus availability. Previously published models for predicting protein, polysaccharide, and total lipid allocation from temperature and daylength were unsuccessful. Lipid classes showed distinctive seasonal patterns and environmental correlates, consistent with differing functional roles and (or) taxonomic associations among the major lipid classes. The allocation of photosynthate, and thus the food quality and nutrient stoichiometry of the primary producers, appeared to be under complex control that could not be precisely predicted from any simple combination of environmental variables.

The spatial distribution of phytoplankton pigments in the surface sediments of the Kongsfjorden and Krossfjorden ecosystem of Svalbard, Arctic	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Kongsfjorden-Krossfjorden twin fjord ecosystem in Svalbard (Arctic), is facing enhanced warm Atlantic water intrusion from ocean as well as intensified melting from glaciers. It is an interesting ecosystem to study phytoplankton productivity under the two opposing processes. For phytoplankton productivity, pigments are used as potential photosynthetic biomass indicators and taxonomic biomarkers. However, due to labile nature of pigments, degradation - preservation distribution must be investigated to form essential framework for biomarker studies. With this motivation, we have undertaken the present work to study the spatial distribution of surface sedimentary pigments in the twin-fjord ecosystem. The pigments were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector. A total of fifteen pigments were identified, which belonged to different classes - chlorophylls, pheopigments and carotenoids. Chlorophyll-a and pheophorbide-a were major pigments with concentration up to 700-800 ng g(-1) dry weight of sediment. Among carotenoids, fucoxanthin, diatoxanthin and prasinoxanthin were abundant with maximum concentration recorded up to 400-600 ng g(-1) dry weight. The distribution of the pigments varied significantly between the two fjords as well as in different regions of the fjord. Most of the pigments were significantly high in their concentration at Krossfjorden stations. Within Kongsfjorden, outer region showed higher concentration of pigments than inner. However, preservation was lesser for the outer fjord pigments than inner as confirmed by various pigment indices. Further, the overall distribution of phytoplankton communities derived from taxonomic biomarker pigments in Kongsfjorden-Krossfjorden sediments, was coherent with that of water during spring and summer. The distribution was dominated by diatoms, dinoflagellates, prasinophytes and prymnesiophytes. The surface sedimentary pigments were found capable of providing information about phytoplankton biomass and composition under environmental conditions existing in the region. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aims of present research were to evaluate the tendency in reference evapotranspiration (ET0) by the Mann-Kendall test, the Spearman's Rho test and the linear regression analysis at the 5% significant level using meteorological data of 16 synoptic stations at Southern Iran during period 1980-2010. Results revealed that 1, 3, 6, and 12 monthly ET0 in most regions of study area showed increasing trends. Only, Shiraz station exhibited the significant decreasing trend in all time scales based on statistical methods. The values of the significant raising tendencies in annual ET0 varied among -0.501 at Shiraz and +3.194 mm/year at Bam. Based on seasonal time scale, also Bam station showed the maximum significant increasing tendency (in summer and spring) based on Mann-Kendall and Spearman's Rho techniques. The monthly analysis of trend in ET0 series indicated that the highest amounts of stations with significant increase tendency discovered in May. In general, this study result indicates a serious warning about warming and climate change of southern Iran. This subject can cause different effects including increment of water consumption in agricultural sector, increase of water rain waste, enhancement of water waste in dams, reservoirs, lakes, etc., decrease of surface water quality, and food crisis.

Here we present diffusive and ebullition fluxes collected over several years from 30 ponds and 4 lakes formed on an organic-rich polygonal tundra landscape. Water body morphology strongly affects the mixing regime-and thus the seasonal patterns in gas emissions-with ice-out and autumnal turnover periods identified as hot moments in most cases. The studied thermokarst lake maintained relatively high ebullition rates of millennia-old CH4 (up to 3405 C-14 YBP). Larger and deeper kettle lakes maintained low fluxes of both gases (century to millennium-old), slowly turning into a CO2 sink over the summer. During winter, lakes accumulated CO2, which was emitted during the ice-out period. Coalescent polygonal ponds, influenced by photosynthesizing benthic mats, were continuous CO2 sinks, yet important CH4 emitters (modern carbon). The highest fluxes were recorded from ice-wedge trough ponds (up to 96 mmol CO2 equivalent m(-2) d(-1)). However, despite clear signs of permafrost carbon inputs via active shore erosion, these sheltered ponds emitted modern to century-old greenhouse gases. As the ice-free period lengthens, scenarios of warmer and wetter conditions could favor both the production of CO2 and CH4 from thawing permafrost carbon, and CH4 production from recently fixed carbon through an atmospheric CO2-to-CH4 shunt at sites in which primary production is stimulated. This must be carefully considered at the landscape scale, recognizing that older carbon stocks can be mineralized efficiently in specific locations, such as in thermokarst lakes.

Monitoring of Water-Level Fluctuation of Lake Nasser Using Altimetry Satellite Data	EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Apart from the Renaissance Dam and other constructed dams on the River Nile tributaries, Egypt is classified globally as a state of scarce water. Egypt's water resources are very limited and do not contribute a significant amount to its water share except the River Nile (55.5 billion m(3)/year). While the number of population increases every year, putting more stress on these limited resources. This study aims to use remote-sensing data to assess the change in surface area and water-level variation in Lake Nasser using remote-sensing data from Landsat-8 and altimetry data. In addition, it investigates the use of thermal data from Landsat-8 to calculate water loss based on evaporation from Lake Nasser. The eight Landsat-8 satellite images were used to study the change in surface area of Lake Nasser representing winter (January) and summer (June/July) seasons in two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). Time series analyses for 10-day temporal resolution water-level data from Jason-2/OSTM and Jason-3 altimetry was carried out to investigate water-level trends over the long term (1993 and 2016) and short term (2015-2016) in correspondence with the change of the surface area. Results indicated a shrink in the lake surface area in 2016 of approximately 14% compared to the 2015 area. In addition, the evaporation rate in the lake is very high causing a loss of approximately 20% of the total water share from the river Nile.

Compared to a considerable number of studies on oligotrophic lakes and oceanic waters, little evidence for the importance of N deposition has been generated for eutrophic lakes, even though emphasis has been placed on reducing external N inputs to control eutrophication in these lakes. Our high-resolution observations of atmospheric depositions and riverine inputs of biologically reactive N species into eutrophic Lake Dianchi (the sixth largest freshwater lake in China) shed new light onto the contribution of N deposition to total N loads. Annual N deposition accounted for 15.7% to 16.6% of total N loads under variable precipitation conditions, 2-fold higher than previous estimates (7.6%) for the Lake Dianchi. The proportion of N deposition to total N loads further increased to 27-48% in May and June when toxic blooms of the ubiquitous non-N-2 fixing cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. are initiated and proliferate. Our observations reveal that reduced N (59%) contributes a greater amount than oxidized N to total N deposition, reaching 56-83% from late spring to summer. Progress toward mitigating eutrophication in Lake Dianchi and other bloom-impacted eutrophic lakes will be difficult without reductions in ammonia emissions and subsequent N deposition.					; Shen, Jianlin/G-1820-2014; Zhou, Feng/C-9377-2011; Paerl, Hans/ACA-9911-2022; Liu, Xuejun/AAA-7412-2022; farong, li/GZK-5313-2022	Li, FARONG/0000-0002-2386-9134; Shen, Jianlin/0000-0002-5853-094X; Zhou, Feng/0000-0001-6122-0611; BO, YAN/0000-0002-0041-4196; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 20	2017	51	12					6699	6708		10.1021/acs.est.6b06135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.6b06135								28570060					WOS:000404087400009

Haw. is restricted to south-facing rock outcrops on the shores of certain rivers and lakes in the boreal forest of southeastern Manitoba. Limitations in propagule dispersal, establishment, and maintenance were studied at Bird River (50.degree.25''N, 95.degree.41''W) between October 1979 and October 1982. Propagules studied were stem units (pads) because this cactus propagates enitrely by vegetative means in this region. Mature terminal pads broke off most easily in the late spring while turgid and rolled downhill (geochory), thus establishing new plants locally. Some pads fell into the river and could float long distances (hydrochory) before being washed ashore. Perhaps less frequently, pads were dispersed over long distances on animals (epizoochory). Marked pads placed in potential habitats showed significantly greater establishment (.alpha. = 0.05) on south-facing outcrops than on north-facing or forest sites. Censuses (1979-1982) of an established colony indicated that pad number was increasing by 51% per year. Approximately 6% of the pads were dispersed from the outcrop. The present distribution of O. fragilis appears to be both habitat and dispersal limited.																			0008-4026					DEC	1985	63	12					2377	2382		10.1139/b85-340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b85-340													WOS:A1985A088400048

Iseo, I)	WATER												In Lake Iseo (Lombardia, Italy), the predominant species in the cyanobacterial taxa was Planktothrix rubescens. However, since 2014, the presence of an allochthonous Cyanobacteria, Tychonema bourrellyi, able to produce consistent biomasses and harmful toxins, was detected. The causes of this expansion are poorly understood. Many studies have linked the development of allochthonous Cyanobacteria populations with climate change. This study shows the spatio-temporal dynamics, the ecological requirements, and the interspecific relationship of P. rubescens and T. bourrellyi. Samples were collected monthly in 2016 at six different depths in the water column; 20 chemico-physical characteristics were measured; and Cyanobacteria density, morphology, and biovolume were evaluated. The results allowed a comparison of the spatial pattern of the two species, which showed a greater distribution at a depth of 10-20 m, and their seasonal dynamics. Both Cyanobacteria were present throughout the year, with the greatest abundance during the period from March to May. A temporal shift was observed in their development, linked to different capacities for overcoming winter and mixing periods. Principal Component Analysis, performed on 20 observations (4 months <mml:semantics> x </mml:semantics> 5 depths), highlighted the important role of the stability of the water column in determining T. bourrellyi settlement in Lake Iseo and the role of solar radiation in spring population development.

Structural and trophic characteristics of protozoan plankton in a subarctic Lake (Northern Karelia)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The seasonal dynamics of ciliate abundance has been studied in Lake Krivoye (the White Sea coast). A high species diversity of ciliates and their maximal biomass in the plankton are observed in the early spring in spite of low water temperatures (5-7 degrees C). In spring, infusoria comprise 90% of the zooplankton biomass; i.e., infusoria as primary consumers are the main consumers of algal and microzooplankton production and the major carriers of energy to the next trophic level. During this period, a significant portion of planktonic infusoria biomass is constituted by the species containing zoochlorella. The high biomass of symbiotic algae (25% of the total biomass of planktonic algae) in a spring cilioplankton testifies to the important role that algosymbionts play in the primary production in some parts of the year.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				JUL	2010	3	3					260	265		10.1134/S1995082910030090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082910030090													WOS:000282219400009

In this study, we surveyed the monthly variations of phytoplankton density in 3 large deep reservoirs and 7 small shallow reservoirs and analyzed the effect of large precipitation events on phytoplankton. During heavy rains, stream phosphorus concentrations increased sharply, and phosphorus loadings into reservoirs were not continuous but episodic shock loadings. In deep stratified reservoirs, however, the concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyll a were much lower than expected from the high total phosphorus levels in the storm runoff. Inflowing storm waters laden with phosphorus flowed into metalimnetic layers because deep reservoirs had strong thermal stratification and the storm water was cooler than the epilimnion. The result was the formation of an ecosystem resilient to phosphorus shock loadings during monsoon. Nutrients in the metalimnion seemed to be dispersed gradually toward the epilimnion, and phytoplankton reached maximum densities, called "monsoon blooms," after the monsoon. By contrast, shallow reservoirs with short hydraulic residence times had lower chlorophyll a concentrations during the monsoon season because the high flushing rate was the major limiting factor of phytoplankton growth. In conclusion, summer monsoon is the major determinant of phytoplankton density in reservoirs of the East Asian region, but their responses can vary widely depending on hydrologic characteristics.

Therefore, accurate estimations of glacier mass balances with high spatial (large region) and temporal (annual, seasonal) resolutions are very important. However, the estimation of glacial mass balances in mountainous regions is usually hampered by remoteness and the lack of high-precision topographic data for most mountain ranges. This study presents a novel method for estimating mass changes in mountain glaciers using InSAR data. We utilised observations of glacier surface deformation to derive changes in thickness, and then calculated the mass change. This method can accurately estimate short-term mass changes. We apply this method to the Koxkar glacier in the Tien Shan Mountain Range in China and successfully estimate the seasonal mass change. Using theoretical error and statistical error analysis, we determined that the accuracy of this method is much better than other geodetic methods. We analyse the spatial characteristics of the mass changes in the ablation zone for the first time. The results show considerable spatial and seasonal variability, which were mainly from ablation in the summer, with the greatest amount of glacial ablation reaching up to -3872mm water equivalent (w.e.), and from accumulation in the winter.					; fu, xiyou/GXH-0360-2022; Zhou, jinamin/HPH-4897-2023; huang, lei/GQP-8739-2022	Fu, Xiyou/0000-0003-2936-2681; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2019	78	3							77	10.1007/s12665-019-8075-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8075-9													WOS:000457144900001

Consequences of winter air exposure on walleye (Sander vitreus)l physiology and impairment following a simulated ice-angling event	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Length-based harvest restriction is common in fisheries management and can result in a substantial number of fish being released after capture. Science on live release confirms that the practice allows individuals to return to the population and reproduce; however, little is known about how handling practices influence mortality or the sub-lethal physiological alterations in fish that are released during the winter. In this study, walleye (Sander vitreus; Mitchill 1818) were angled through the ice in Lake Nipissing, Ontario to evaluate the contribution of air exposure to the reflex impairment, post-release mortality, and the stress response of fish in the winter. Following 24 h holding, fish were exposed to a simulated angling event and exposed to air or snow across a range of exposure durations. Fish were non-lethally blood sampled and were assessed for reflex impairment and mortality 24 h after capture. No mortalities were recorded during the study and reflex impairment was not linked to exposure type or duration. Blood [lactate] at 1 h post-capture was comparable across treatment groups but was significantly higher than respective baselines. Plasma [cortisol], blood [glucose], and aspartate aminotransferase activities were comparable to baseline levels. Walleye appeared to be resilient to catch-and-release angling in the winter given that no mortalities occurred and fish suffered minimal reflex impairment and physiological disturbance following capture. Findings from this study suggest that mandatory catch-and-release regulations for sub-adult walleye are a useful tool for the management of winter walleye ice fisheries.					; Lawrence, Michael/AAC-9979-2019; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Twardek, William/0000-0002-8286-021X; Lennox, Robert/0000-0003-1010-0577; Lawrence, Michael/0000-0002-4801-1580; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659													0165-7836	1872-6763				JUL	2019	215						106	113		10.1016/j.fishres.2019.03.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.03.014													WOS:000466824300013

Overall, the model can reasonably reproduce the daily variations of lake surface temperature and the spatial patterns of 2 m air temperature (T-2m) and precipitation over TP during summer. Sensitivity results show that the effects of TP lakes on the over-lake T-2m and precipitation exhibit distinctive seasonal and diurnal features and strong space dependence. Generally, the TP lakes tend to cool the local T-2m and enhance the precipitation over the lake and surrounding areas. With the summer advances, the cooling effect of TP lakes weakens while the lake-induced enhancement of precipitation becomes more evident. During daytime, the TP lakes decrease the T-2m and suppress the short-duration (<= 6 h) rainfall in afternoon. However, the TP lakes increase the T-2m and strengthen the convective rainfall over the lake and surrounding areas by simultaneously enhancing both short and long-duration (>6 h) precipitation during nighttime. The lakes over the southeastern central TP (CTP) lead to slight warming and pronounced precipitation increases, while the other lakes in CTP mainly cause significant cooling and suppressed precipitation. Such opposite effects are mainly because the lakes over the western and northeastern CTP hardly produce nighttime warming and the associated circulation changes favorable for the convective precipitation as found over the southeastern CTP, suggesting that the climate effects of TP lakes may be modulated by the lake intrinsic features, local terrain distributions, and background atmospheric circulations.					黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019; Fu, Zhipeng/JPL-5535-2023; Yang, Ben/O-8548-2015; Wu, Yang/HNI-3599-2023; Huang, Anning/K-7473-2019	Wu, Yang/0000-0002-3477-7171; Huang, Anning/0000-0001-9872-440X													0930-7575	1432-0894				NOV	2019	53	9-10					5215	5236		10.1007/s00382-019-04856-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04856-4													WOS:000493469900005

Five species of fish representing a range of trophic levels and the lake's principal game fishes were studied. Hg generally increased with trophic level and fish size. Median Hg concentrations (ng/g wet mass) were 277 in striped bass, 168 in channel catfish, 160 in largemouth bass, 75 in bluegill, and 8 in blue tilapia. Overall, fish from Las Vegas Bay and Boulder Basin had the lowest Hg concentrations, possibly a result of biodilution in this biologically productive area. In general, fish-mercury, about consuming fillet advisories might include a warning from emaciated fish, based on the finding that Hg concentrations in 59 striped bass (captured during a scarce-food season) correlated inversely (r = -0.89, p < 0.001) with a fish nutritional-status factor. This is consistent with starvation-concentration, whereby Hg in fish muscle is lost at a slower rate than the muscle mass. The median concentration found for 139 striped bass corresponds to a recommended risk-based consumption limit of three 8-oz. (227-g) meals per month for a 70-kg adult. Finally, this paper serves as a useful archive for future research and long-term studies of Hg in Lake Mead fish.

Evidence for phase-locked changes in climate between Scotland and Greenland during GS-1 (Younger Dryas) using micromorphology of glaciolacustrine varves from Glen Roy	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												There is a current need to develop annual/decadal chronologies from periods of rapid climate change in order to understand the rate and timing of climate events and identify how other proxies either lead or lag this climate forcing. Annually-laminated or varved sediments are key proxies for understanding environmental change at such a scale. This paper presents the results of microscale analysis of glaciolacustrine varve sediments from Scotland and develops a new index called varve group, which ranks the number of pulses of sediment observed in the summer component of the varve. The varve group index is compared with data from the Greenland ice-core record and correspondence can be observed between the oxygen isotope records from Greenland during the latter part of GS-1 and the 515-year Lochaber varve group index. The processes that control the number of sediment pulses into the lake basin are discussed and we examine how these factors might control both the isotopic composition of the ice cores and varve group formation. It is proposed that the position of the sea ice in the North Atlantic may provide such a mechanism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Long-term trends in burbot abundance in Oneida Lake, New York: Life at the southern edge of the range in an era of climate change	BURBOT: ECOLOGY, MANAGEMENT AND CULTURE	American Fisheries Society Symposium				2nd International Burbo Symposium	SEP 13, 2005	Anchorage, AK					The burbot Lota Iota is a cold-stenothermal species with a circumpolar distribution that rarely extends below latitude 40 degrees N. Oneida Lake, New York, is a large (20,670 ha), shallow (mean depth 6.8 in) lake and its position at latitude 43 degrees N places it near the southern border of the burbot's range. Although abundant enough to be considered detrimental to more desirable species during the early 1900s, previous research indicated that burbot abundance was limited by sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus predation and marginal thermal conditions during the summer in Oneida Lake. However, a lamprey control program initiated in 1985 did not result in significant increases in burbot catches. Oneida Lake's morphology results in homothermal conditions throughout much of the summer, reducing the availability of coldwater refuges. High occurrence of empty stomachs and reduction in energy density of livers during the summer months suggest that high summer water temperatures may limit burbot in Oneida Lake. Long-term trends in catches of burbot in bottom trawls, gill nets, and trap nets since the 1960s have exhibited significant declines. During the same period, summer water temperatures have increased significantly. Bioenergetics models suggest that water temperatures greater than 2 PC will result in weight loss in burbot, and the average duration of this period of high summer stress has increased to almost 2 months in recent years. Declines in burbot catches were significantly correlated with increases in summer temperatures and the number of days when weight loss was predicted by energetics models. Continued warming of Oneida Lake may result in extirpation of this burbot population.																			0892-2284		978-1-888569-98-8				2008	59						131	+																WOS:000253841600008
J	Fan, SM; Yang, XS				Fan, Songmiao; Yang, Xiaosong			Arctic and East Asia Winter Climate Variations Associated with the Eastern Atlantic Pattern	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The wintertime Arctic temperature (T; surface-400 hPa) decreased from 1979 to 1997 and increased rapidly from 1998 to 2012, in contrast to the global mean surface air temperature. Here aspects of circulation variability that are associated with these temperature changes are examined using the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis and ERA-Interim products. It is found that the Nordic-Siberia seesaw of meridional winds near 70 degrees N is associated with two-thirds of the variance of the Arctic winter mean T, possibly contributing to the cooling and warming trends. It is suggested here that the seesaw accounts for much of the difference in Arctic amplification between observations and climate models. Growth of sea ice in winter is hindered by southerly winds over the Nordic region (0 degrees-60 degrees E). Through modulation of the wind seesaw, the eastern Atlantic (EA) pattern is found to be significantly associated with Arctic and East Asia winter climate variations. In one phase of the EA pattern, a midlatitude North Atlantic ridge anomaly is associated with a poleward shift of the mean storm track, a weakened eddy-driven jet over Eurasia, and above-normal sea level pressure (SLP) over Siberia, most significantly in the region to the northwest of Lake Baikal. The EA pattern is associated with two-thirds of the variance of winter-average SLP over Siberia.

Large, monsoonally driven discharges in late summer flush the impoundment repeatedly leaving, after 2 months, a longitudinally uniform, well-mixed water column, rich in dissolved nutrients and with high turbidity). For the rest of the year flows are negligible. Paradoxically, two sites with initially identical nutrient and stratification characteristics, and located only 30 km apart, develop quite different Patterns of cyanobacterial succession. The upstream site is initially dominated by Anabaena circinalis which appears in early spring and collapses within the month. A mixed population of Anabaenopsis elenkinii and Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi then develops at both sites. This is followed by a mixture of small cyanobacteria (consisting of Cylindrospermopsis, Planktoyngbya and Limnothrix) which develops mainly at the downstream site and persists for 3 months until flushed away by flood flows. We report on data covering an 8 month period of investigation of the stratification, light climate, temperature and nutrient dynamics at these two sites. We show that large-scale climatic conditions and the local weather pattern set the physical and chemical conditions which determine the cyanobacterial response.

The concentrations of the two VFAs detected, formic and acetic acid, were low (< 10 mu M) in the oxic upper waters of the lake, but increased dramatically (up to 250 mu M) beneath the oxycline. The distribution of DFAAs was similar, with a total concentration of 280 mu M in the anoxic water early in the study. The amino acids occurring at the highest concentrations were alanine, glutamic acid, leucine and valine. Total VFA concentrations in the anoxic zone increased during the study period, but the total amino acid concentration dropped significantly to 64 mu M by the end of the study. The high concentrations beneath the oxycline were probably the result of bacterial utilisation of these substrates that was slow due to the high salinity and low temperature of the lake water.

The results showed that dust emission rates increased from the middle to the lower reaches of the river by a factor of up to 10(3). There two strongest areas of dust emission are the dried-up Gaxun Lake with a dust emission rate of 1.6 t ha(-1) year(-1), and the desertified grassland areas around the abandoned Heicheng City, with a dust emission rate of 0.6-0.7 t ha(-1) year(-1). The total annual dust emissions with their particle diameters less than 50, 30, and 10 mu m were 1.71 x 10(6), 1.11 x 10(6), and 0.555 x 10(6) t, respectively. Dust emission rates showed striking seasonal variations, with the maximum value (45%) occurring in spring and the minimum value (13.5%) in summer. The mineral aerosol-size distributions were also measured and the results showed that the size distributions for dust and non-dust events were both trimodal, in contrast with the widely accepted view that primary particles such as aeolian dust are coarse, whereas particles less than 1 mu m in diameter are mainly secondary particulate substances such as ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, and organic matter.					wang, tao/AGJ-1581-2022; tao, wang/LQK-4781-2024	wang, tao/0000-0002-2892-1050; 													0943-0105					FEB	2007	51	8					1341	1347		10.1007/s00254-006-0432-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-006-0432-9													WOS:000244186500006

It involves the collection of three samples, corresponding with spring, early- and late-summer phytoplankton production, in every fifth or sixth year, phytoplankton is enumerated and categorised according to size, being < 65 mum or > 65 mum in unit (cell or colony) dimension and with an additional category for (larger) 'cyanophytes'. Biomass scores averaged over the year prove to be very conservative in the lakes of the English Lake District, unless they have undergone significant eutrophication though (mainly) receiving sewage effluent (i.e. mineralised but not nutrient stripped). The method is shown to be sensitive to broad differences in trophic status but insufficiently so to more subtle changes over a five-year period, unless these are either anticipated or confirmed by more intensive study. For background monitoring of a previously well-studied lake or lake series, the present method should prove adequate.																			0003-9136					DEC	1993	129	2					157	178		10.1127/archiv-hydrobiol/129/1993/157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/archiv-hydrobiol/129/1993/157													WOS:A1993MQ28200002

R-selected species dominated throughout the duration of flooding and a clear succession of communities, with three distinct phases, was found in most turloughs: prevalence of Chlamydomonas, cryptophytes, pennate diatoms and Tribonema in the first few months of flooding followed by dominance in winter by cryptophytes, pennate diatoms and centric diatoms. A final stage in late spring was characterized by filamentous greens and chrysophytes. Algal communities in turloughs resemble those of ponds, lakes or even slow-flowing rivers, depending on the time of the year. Multivariate analysis showed that the variables significantly affecting phytoplankton composition in turloughs were total phosphorus (TP), season and mean depth/colour. Turloughs with higher TP tended to have a higher prevalence of green algae, particularly filamentous forms. Tychoplanktonic algae were also important in turloughs (up to 82% of total biovolume), probably owing to their shallow nature and to the presence of terrestrial vegetation on the bottom of the basins. The results are discussed in relation to Reynolds functional groups and other studies and, in general, it is shown that there is good accordance between the algae found in turloughs and what is presently known of their ecologies.

J	Stefan, HG; Fang, X				Stefan, HG; Fang, X			Simulated climate change effects on ice and snow covers on lakes in a temperate region	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A simulation model for ice and snow covers is applied to dimictic and polymictic lakes of the temperature zone to project the effects of possible climate warming on ice and snow covers. The winter cover model is associated with a deterministic, one-dimensional water temperature model. The lake parameters required as model input are surface area (A(S)), maximum depth (H-max), summer and Secchi depth as a measure of radiation attenuation and trophic state. The model is driven by daily weather data. The model has been validated with extensive data. Standard errors between simulated and measured values are 0.12 m for ice thicknesses, 0.07 m for snow covers and less than 6 days for ice formation dates. The model is applied to simulate effects of projected climate change on winter ice and snow covers on different types of lakes in Minnesota. Lake depth and latitude are shown to have the strongest influence on freeze-over dates. Lake morphometry causes variations of up to 6 days in the mean value of ice-in dates. The trophic state and shape of a lake have little effect on ice-out date, but latitude is important. The projected climate change due to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (2 X CO2) is obtained from the output of the Canadian Climate Center Global circulation Model (CCC GCM) and the Goddard Institute of Space Studies at Columbia University (GISS GCM). The 2 X CO2 climate delays the ice formation by as much as 20 days, reduces maximum ice and snow thicknesses by 50%, and shortens the ice cover period by up to 60 days. These changes would eliminate fish winterkill in most shallow lakes, but would endanger snowmobiles and ice fishermen. To illustrate the effect of projected climate change on winter ice/snow cover characteristics, separate graphs are presented for values simulated with inputs of past climate conditions (1961-79) and with a projected 2 X CO2 climate scenario. Independent variables used on these plots are a lake geometry ratio A(S)(0.25)/H-max and Secchi depth. The lake geometry radio measures the susceptibility of a lake to stratification.																			0165-232X					MAR	1997	25	2					137	152		10.1016/S0165-232X(96)00023-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0165-232X(96)00023-7													WOS:A1997WN56600006

It is a source of good quality fish and wildlife. The phytoplankton was evaluated seasonally (summer 2013 to spring 2014), at 12 stations. A total of 186 taxa from 95 genera and seven classes, namely, Bacillariophyceae, Dinophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cyanobacteria, Euglenophyceae, Rhodophyceae and Chrysophyceae were recorded. The phytoplankton community was dominated by Bacillariophyceae followed by Dinophyceae. The Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (1.75-3.30) classified Bardawil Lagoon as being a not stressed environment. Differences in the phytoplankton community structure and abundance between previous results and the present study showed significant changes with the change in salinity. Seasonal differences in the quantitative and qualitative composition of the phytoplankton communities in the different sites were marked. The phytoplankton annual succession was characterized. No sign of eutrophication was observed, and most of the dinoflagellate species detected have been described as harmful or able to occur at high biomass. The study showed that Bardawil water is still oligotrophic, free of contaminants, so we suggest the need to add fertilizers to accelerate the production of natural food organisms to increase fish and crustacean production. Before the addition of any fertilizer, it must dig two or three canals to facilitate exchange of water between the Mediterranean Sea and the lagoon to prevent undesirable harmful algae bloom.						gharib, samiha/0000-0001-9822-9337													2037-4631	1720-0776				SEP	2016	27	3					483	493		10.1007/s12210-016-0506-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12210-016-0506-x													WOS:000381601300008

In the past 10 years, green tides dominated by Chaetomorpha spp. have broken out frequently in the phosphate-deficient Swan Lagoon, China. Here, we evaluated the changes in P concentration and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) in water and sedi-ments during the growth of C. linum in the laboratory experiment. The objective of this study was to clarify the phosphorus (P) sources supporting the C. linum blooms throughout the year in this phosphate-deficient lagoon. Our results show that C. linum is able to store a large amount of P when phosphate is abundant in the water, and the P in algal tissue can be utilized for algal growth at a short time. This species can also produce alkaline phosphatase (APase) and facilitate the release of mobile P (BD-P and NaOH-P) from sediments when phosphate is deficient in order to sustain growth. The field investigation shows the seasonal differences in the P sources supporting C. linum blooms in Swan Lagoon. In addition to sediment released P, the tissue P in living algae and the dissolved organic P in water are the main utilized P sources in spring and winter, respectively. This possibly explains why C. linum can persist and proliferate in such a lagoon system throughout the year.

Development of a carcass analog for nutrient restoration in streams	FISHERIES												Resource managers are becoming more interested in restoring nutrients to food-limited salmonid bearing streams, but all of the current approaches have some shortcomings. The objective of our work was to develop a nutrient restoration product that reduced these shortcomings. The product we developed, a carcass analog, was made from fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from Spring Creek Hatchery, Underwood, Washington. These fish were pasteurized during the process that dried the ground salmon carcasses into a fishmeal. No known fish pathogens were detected in the pasteurized product. The analogs were easy to transport and distribute throughout the stream channel, generally sank to the bottom, and were retained within the channel. Approximately half of the analog had dissolved or been eaten after being in streams two weeks, and the analog was almost gone after four weeks. We discuss other studies that have demonstrated that carcass analogs reproduce the main food pathways historically provided by salmon carcasses and contributed to productivity of resident and anadromous salmonids. Our evaluation indicates that the carcass analog is a viable candidate for stream nutrient restoration in food-limited streams.

DISTRIBUTION OF TOXIC CYANOBACTERIA AND CYANOTOXINS IN TURKISH WATERBODIES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												The increase of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in aquatic ecosystems posing threat to human health has caused countries to establish monitoring strategies and set limit values in their regulations. The frequency of toxic cyanobacterial blooms increase in Turkey as a result of deterioration of water resources. In order to investigate the problems arising from cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins, the 'SIYANOTOKS' Project was carried out by the Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs, General Directorate of Water Management in cooperation with Istanbul University Faculty of Fisheries. Within this scope, the Project has been carried out to monitor cyanobacteria and their toxins in 18 selected waterbodies: 7 natural lakes, 8 reservoirs, 1 lagoon and 2 coastal and transitional waters in Turkey. Samples were collected between May to October 2015 in monthly intervals and two samples were taken in winter 2015 and Spring 2016. Potentially toxic cyanobacteria species were detected in 14 waterbodies and blooms were observed in 57% of them. A highest concentration of Microcystin-LR eq. was 29.7 mu g/l and cylindrospermopsin was 9 mu g/l.

Winter survival of Northern Pintails in the Middle Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												In response to continued low population numbers of Northern Pintail (Anas acuta) in North America and to increase knowledge of the geographic variation in pintail survival rates, we estimated 126-day (27 October-2 March) survival for male and female pintails wintering in the Middle Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico, during 2001-2002 (SY1) and 2002-2003 (SY2). Sixty-nine adult male and female pintails were marked with radio-transmitters and tracked throughout the study period. Weekly relocation data in relation to study year, sex, time (week), body condition at capture, and hunting seasons were modeled using the known-fate procedure in Program MARK. Year, sex, time, and body condition covariates did not improve model performance in estimating survival, so we used the most parsimonious model to produce an overall winter survival estimate of 0.597 +/- 0.077 (95% C.I. = 0.442-0.735). Weekly survival estimates did not differ between hunting and nonhunting seasons. Male and female point estimates did not differ (chi(2)(1) = 0.209, P = 0.65). Our adult female survival estimate of 0.639 +/- 0.117 (95% C.I. = 0.396-0.827) was 5.5%-28.6% lower than published estimates for adult female pintails in 5 other geographic regions. No winter survival estimates for males in other geographic regions were available for direct comparison with our study. Although relatively small sample sizes may have contributed to the lack of statistical differences in weekly survival between years, sexes, and hunting seasons, as well as to the lack of influence of body condition, relatively abundant water and food resources and absence of hunting in a refuge setting contributed to consistent survival probabilities. Because our low survival estimates, relative to other geographic regions, cannot he attributed to hunting, we postulate that natural causes of mortality play a larger role in pintail survival in our study region than in other wintering regions.																			1527-0904					JAN	2007	67	1					79	85		10.3398/1527-0904(2007)67[79:WSONPI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3398/1527-0904(2007)67[79:WSONPI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000245786700011

Seasonal Variations in Soil and Bacteriological Properties as Affected by Phytogenic Mounds (Nebkhas) of Halocnemum strobilaceum in Lake Manzala, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												PHYTOGENIC mounds (nebkhas) formed by halophytes are widely distributed in coastal and desert environments. Such nebkhas provide loci for geochemical and biological activities that influence ecosystem processes and function. Seasonal variation in soil and bacterial properties were investigated within the nebkhas under the canopy of Halocnemum strobilaceum and in the surrounding unvegetated sites at salt marshes of Lake Manzala. The parameters measured include soil moisture, organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorus, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and bacterial community and enzyme characteristics. Enrichment ratios for soil salinity and nutrients were evaluated to indicate the salinity and fertility islands within nebkhas. Soil moisture content showed significant differences between the different seasons with the highest value in winter (16.55%) at unvegetated control site. Soil electrical conductivity, total nitrogen and phosphorus had their significantly higher values in nebkhas during autumn. The enrichment values for the measured soil parameters ranged from 0.31 to 4.09 in the four seasons which indicates a clear accumulation effect for soil nutrients and salts within the nebkhas under the canopy of H. strobilaceum. Bacterial abundance was consistently higher in nebkhas through all seasons. Eleven genera of bacteria belong to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and proteobacteria phyla were recorded in nebkha and unvegetated sites. These genera varied in their occurrence between the two locations and the four seasons. It can be concluded that the formation of nebkhas by halophytic vegetation have noticeable effects on accumulation of soil salinity and fertility during different seasons that affect bacterial abundance and activity in coastal environment.

J	BONDRUPNIELSEN, S				BONDRUPNIELSEN, S			DEMOGRAPHY OF CLETHRIONOMYS GAPPERI IN DIFFERENT HABITATS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Theoretical considerations indicate that habitat heterogeneity may affect vole population density dynamics. The greater the degree of habitat heterogeneity, the greater the likelihood that a vole population will show stable rather than cyclic density dynamics. A livetrapping study of Clethrionomys gapperi was conducted near Lesser Slave Lake, Alberta, Canada, to examine the effect of habitat on demography and behaviour on this species. Voles in different habitat types differed in spring and late summer density, persistence, ratio of immature to total recruits, transiency, and home range size. There was no difference in litter size of voles among habitat types. Clethrionomys gapperi is not a cyclic species and sexually mature females are territorial. In this study demography of vole populations differed greatly among habitat type and only on one grid in 1 year did the density of sexually mature females reach saturation. Therefore, in each year there was always room for territorial establishment of females born in that year. This is unlike the situation for cyclic populations of Clethrionomys spp. in which there is no room for territorial establishment of such females during the peak population phase.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				FEB	1987	65	2					277	283		10.1139/z87-043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z87-043													WOS:A1987G472400009

Linking movements of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) in a small hydroelectric reservoir to abiotic variables	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					7th International Symposium on Sturgeons - Sturgeons, Science and Society at the Cross-Roads - Meeting the Challenges of the 21st Century	JUL 21-25, 2013	Nanaimo, CANADA	Vancouver Isl Univ, WSCS				Quantifying the extent to which abiotic factors influence lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) movement and utilization of areas where they are susceptible to entrainment may be useful for management of hydroelectric operations. Over two open-water seasons, acoustic telemetry was used to monitor tagged adults (n=25) and subadults (n=24) throughout a 9.8km long run-of-the-river reservoir located on the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, Canada. Movement and utilization patterns were examined for correlation with abiotic variables. Despite considerable individuality, the adult sample population increasingly utilized the lower sections of the reservoir when air and water temperatures were high, daylight hours were long, river flow was increasing, and flows were high. However, our hypothesis of a pronounced concentration of Lake Sturgeon occurring immediately upstream of the generating station when high flows coincided with the summer/fall period was not supported. This may be attributed to the presence of a shallow river narrows located 2.1km upstream of the station, which appeared to restrict the extent of seasonal/flow influenced downstream movement by adults. Movements of individual subadults were also correlated to seasonal and flow variables, but directionality was not consistent and population level trends in utilization did not appear to be correlated to abiotic variables. Results suggest that in small reservoirs, adult utilization of the areas immediately upstream of hydroelectric facilities may be influenced more by seasonality than by flow conditions.

J	Snucins, E; Gunn, J				Snucins, E; Gunn, J			Interannual variation in the thermal structure of clear and colored lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We used end-of-summer temperature profiles to examine the thermal structure of 86 small (<500 ha) lakes in Killarney Park, Ontario, Canada, during one cool (1997) and two extremely warm years (1998 and 1999). The main effect of the warm years, which had unusually high air temperatures during the spring, relative to the cool year was to create warmer surface waters, shallower mixing depths, and stronger metalimnetic thermal gradients in nearly all lakes. Changes in deep water temperatures differed between clear (DOC < 2 mg L-1) and colored (DOC > 4 mg L-1) lakes. During warm years, the volume of cold water (<10<degrees>C) was reduced in clear lakes. In colored lakes, deep water temperatures were more stable, and cold water volume actually increased during one warm year. We suggest that clear lakes will be more sensitive than colored lakes to the warming effects of climate change. Because cigar lakes exhibit large thermal changes in response to small differences in DOC, they will also be more sensitive to changes in DOC levels associated with altered hydrological inputs, climate change, or acidification.

The studies revealed the seasonal and interannual dynamics in the distribution of PAHs in aerosols from urban (source) and rural (receptor) areas. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of weather conditions such as wind direction, relative humidity, air temperature, and atmospheric pressure. The analysis determined high correlations between air temperature, atmospheric pressure, temperature inversions, and PAHs at the monitoring stations. The average annual concentrations of PAHs in the abnormally warm 2020 were three times lower than the average values obtained in the cold 2016. The toxic equivalent concentrations (BaPeq) increased from summer to winter with an increase in the contribution from benzo(a)pyrene, one of the most toxic and hazardous compounds of this class of organic substances. Four-, five- and six-ring PAHs mainly predominated in aerosol; the proportion of two- and three-ring PAHs increased from the warm season to the cold season. Diagnostic ratios of PAHs identified the main sources of air pollution by this class of compounds: combustion of coal, liquid fuel and firewood, vehicle emissions, and wildfires. The percentage of the transport of anthropogenic aerosol containing PAHs from industrial sources of the Southern Baikal region towards Lake Baikal was 65 to 71%.

We collected whole year diatom assemblages from 2002 to 2014 with a sequential sediment trap from a varved boreal lake (Nylandssjon, Sweden) together with environmental and limnological parameters, and compared them with the corresponding diatom record of the annual laminated sediment. Our data set indicates a large year-to-year variability of diatom succession and abundance patterns, which is well reflected in the varved sediments. Specifically, Cyclotella glomerata dominated the annual sediment trap record (as well as in the corresponding sediment varves) in years with warmer air temperatures in March/April, and Asterionella formosa dominated the annual sediment assemblages as a consequence of years characterized by higher runoff before lake over-turn. Years succeeding forest clearance in the lake catchment showed marked increase in diatom and sediment flux. The DCA scores of the yearly diatom trap assemblages clearly resemble the lake's thermal structure, which indicates that the relative abundance of major taxa seems primarily controlled by the timing of seasonal environmental events, such as above-average winter air temperature and/or autumn runoff and the current thermal structure of the lake. The high seasonal variability between environmental drivers in combination with the physical limnology leaves us with several possible scenarios leading to either an A. formosa versus C. glomerata dominated annual diatom sediment signal. With this study we highlight that short-term environmental events and seasonal limnological conditions are of major importance for interpreting annual sediment signals.

J	BLOESCH, J; UEHLINGER, U				BLOESCH, J; UEHLINGER, U			HORIZONTAL SEDIMENTATION DIFFERENCES IN A EUTROPHIC SWISS LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Settling fluxes measured by means of sediment traps were 887 g dry wt m-2 yr-1, 113 g POC m-2 yr-1, and 2.6 g PP m-2 yr-1 in 1982-1983 at a central station in eutrophic Lake Hallwil, Switzerland. Nearshore settling rates were higher by a factor of 1.4-3.4. Since particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate phosphorus (PP), and biomass concentration in the lake water showed vertical rather than horizontal differences, this result was attributed to permanent bottom sediment resuspension and redeposition in the littoral zone. Horizontal sediment transport (sediment focusing) and sediment resuspension in the profundal zone in winter, when wind and turbulence are increased, accounted for only about 20% of the sedimentation rates. Because 70-80% of the total sedimentation for the year occurred during summer, such processes are of minor importance in Lake Hallwil, although a "nepheloid" layer with increased POC and PP concentrations 5-8 m above the bottom was present. It is stressed that the mechanisms of sediment transport must be known to permit interpretation of trap results and to understand lake metabolism.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	1986	31	5					1094	1109		10.4319/lo.1986.31.5.1094	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.5.1094													WOS:A1986E892400016

Exploring the Generality of Recruitment Hypotheses for Largemouth Bass along a Latitudinal Gradient of Florida Lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Latitudinal influences on growing season length and winter severity cause variation in prerecruitment life history across species distributions. We evaluated two recruitment hypotheses for a broadly distributed species, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, at the southern extent of their natural range. We tested (1) whether early hatching provided a growth and survival advantage relative to later hatching through their first summer and (2) whether overwinter size-selective mortality Strongly influenced recruitment to age I across Florida's latitudinal gradient. We sampled the 2003 and 2004 year-classes at six Florida lakes thin spanned latitudes front 27 degrees 0'N to 30 degrees 5'N. Our results did not Fully conform to our hypotheses or the results frequently reported from more northerly latitudes because largemouth bass that hatched early did not exhibit a growth and survival advantage at all lakes and we did not detect strong size-selective overwinter mortality. Early hatching at South Florida lakes resulted in slow growth for three Of four lake and year combinations and early-hatched fish never exhibited a Survival advantage relative 10 later-hatched fish, which was probably due to cool water temperatures soon after hatching. Environmental variability influenced the interactions between hatching period. growth, and survival for Florida's largemouth bass populations, which has implications for understanding fish recruitment across broad spatial scales.																			0002-8487					JAN	2009	138	1					23	37		10.1577/T07-178.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-178.1													WOS:000268500900003

Quantifying microplastic residence times in lakes using mesocosm experiments and transport modelling	WATER RESEARCH												The microplastic residence time in lakes is a key factor controlling its uptake by lake organisms. In this work we have, for the first time, conducted a series of microplastic addition experiments in a 12 x 3 m lake mesocosm and traced its transport through the lake water column. This was combined with a 1D physically based random walk model of microplastic transport. Four experiments were conducted using three microplastic size ranges (1-5, 28-48, and 53-63 mu m) over one year during thermal stratification and lake turnover. The results showed that the residence time in the water column largely depended on particle size and lake hydrodynamics, although the smallest particles were poorly represented by the model. Residence times in the mesocosm ranged between similar to 1 day for the largest particles to 24 days for the small particles during summer. The modeled residence time were similar to the measured values of the 28-48 mu m and 53-63 mu m particles, but for the smallest particles residence times were calculated to be >200 d. The discrepancy is likely due to aggregation between the small microplastic particles and natural lake particles, which increases the microplastic settling velocity. Aggregation is favored for the small particles due their large surface area to volume ratio. In contrast, density instabilities in the water column during autumn likely led to turbulent convective mixing and rapid microplastic transport within the water column. This work shows that microplastic transport within lakes is complex and not fully understood, especially for the smallest sizes, and involves interactions between physical, physicochemical and biological processes.					; Gilfedder, Benjamin/G-5462-2018; Frei, Sven/E-2825-2010	Frei, Sven/0000-0002-1818-8246; Elagami, Hassan/0000-0002-2919-5230; Boos, Jan-Pascal/0000-0003-1748-3646; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				FEB 1	2023	229								119463	10.1016/j.watres.2022.119463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.119463		DEC 2022						36543087					WOS:000904450400008

BOREAS												Twelve new samples of loessic silts from widely spaced locations on the karst uplands of northwest England have yielded Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dates that fall within or overlap with (within uncertainties) the early to mid-Holocene period (11.7-6.0 ka), and support three already-published Holocene ages from similar sediment from this region. Nine of the 15 dates are coincident with the hypothesized climatic deterioration at 8.5-8.0 ka in the North Atlantic region and eight are coincident with the 8.2 ka event. These dates demonstrate that the silts are not primary air-fall loesses of deglacial/Lateglacial age (c. 18.0-11.7 ka) but have been reworked and now consist of loess-derived colluvial deposits; we consider the ages to be reliable as there is no compelling evidence to indicate that the samples are partially bleached. There is no substantive archaeological or palynological evidence for Late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers having had a major impact on the landscape, and it is considered highly unlikely that these people triggered colluviation. We estimate that during the 8.2 ka event there was a reduction in mean annual air temperature at these upland locations of similar to 2.6-4.6 degrees C, and proxy evidence from other sites indicates a shift to wetter conditions. It is inferred that there was greater snow accumulation in winter, that the snowpack survived for longer periods, and that there was an increase in the magnitude and frequency of frost-related processes and meltwater flooding. Together, these changes in climate and their associated (sub)surface processes were responsible for the reworking of the loess. The OSL dates indicate climatically induced landscape dynamism in Great Britain during the latter half of the ninth millennium.

Results showed that samples collected during the summer season (SM) were high contaminated by heavy metals than that of the winter season (WN). Furthermore, the WN samples have relatively low phytotoxicity on A. sativa seed germination and T. alexandrinum root elongation (no EC50 was determined). Genotoxicity of the SM samples is evident in A. sativa by a significant depression of mitotic activity, induction of several chromosomal aberrations and occurrence of micronuclei in T. alexandrinum.

J	Hudson, JJ; Taylor, WD				Hudson, JJ; Taylor, WD			Phosphorus sedimentation during stratification in two small lakes	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Sedimentation of phosphorus was measured with sediment traps during spring through fall at 3 depths in 2 small lakes that had initially different fish and zooplankton communities, but were subject to a manipulation of their fish communities. P sedimentation (P area(-1) time(-1)) increased with depth in both lakes and all years, and more than accounted for the decline in total P through the stratified season. Sedimentation measured at the base of the epilimnion was sufficient to remove the epilimnetic total P only every 36 days on average, and sedimentation velocities were very low, about 10 to 15 cm d(-1). P sedimentation did not vary significantly between lakes and among years, although it did demonstrate temporal variability. Sedimentation velocity also varied among depths, and was greater in the epilimnion than in the metalimnion. Sedimentation rates were not related to particulate phosphorus concentrations, or to particular size fractions, while sedimentation velocities were only weakly correlated to particle-size distribution. Mass balance calculations suggest that there was substantial input of P to the epilimnion of these small lakes during stratification. This and the resuspension and mineralization of P from the shallow sediments may account for the differences between these results with those for larger lakes and for limnocorrals, respectively.					; hudson, jeff/G-6171-2012	Taylor, William/0000-0001-8555-945X; Hudson, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0256-3240													0003-9136					MAR	2005	162	3					309	325		10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0162-0309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0162-0309													WOS:000228391300002
J	Michalec, B				Michalec, Boguslaw			SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN NICKEL CONTAMINATION OF WATER AND SEDIMENTS OF SMALL DAM RESERVOIRS IN SOUTHERN POLAND	CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The paper presents the results of analyses of nickel content in bottom sediments of four small dam reservoirs, as well as nickel content in water of tributaries to these reservoirs. The analyzed reservoirs, with capacities ranging from 34 to 3860 thousand m(3), are located in southern Poland. Based on the results of analyses conducted over five years, i.e. in the periods 2005-2007 and 2012-2013, an attempt was made to determine the seasonal variation in the concentration of nickel in sediments along with the seasonal variation of nickel concentration in water flowing into these reservoirs. Additionally, an attempt was made to correlate the nickel concentration in water flowing into the reservoirs with nickel concentration of sediments. Also, nickel content in water and sediments was evaluated according to different criteria and standards. It was concluded that the concentration of nickel in sediments significantly exceeds the limits set for this element by the EQS. Significantly lower concentrations of nickel in water indicated that there is no risk of environmental contamination. The highest mean concentration of nickel in sediments was noted in samples collected in spring. On the other hand, the lowest mean Ni concentrations were observed in winter.																			1842-4090	1844-489X				AUG	2021	16	2					349	360		10.26471/cjees/2021/016/180	http://dx.doi.org/10.26471/cjees/2021/016/180													WOS:000706855400004

While European cold periods in the 17th and 18th century have been assessed in detail, earlier cold periods received much less attention due to sparse information available. New evidence from proxy archives, historical documentary sources and climate model simulations permit us to provide an interdisciplinary, systematic assessment of an exceptionally cold period in the 15th century. Our assessment includes the role of internal, unforced climate variability and external forcing in shaping extreme climatic conditions and the impacts on and responses of the medieval society in north-western and central Europe. Climate reconstructions from a multitude of natural and anthropogenic archives indicate that the 1430s were the coldest decade in north-western and central Europe in the 15th century. This decade is characterised by cold winters and average to warm summers resulting in a strong seasonal cycle in temperature. Results from comprehensive climate models indicate consistently that these conditions occurred by chance due to the partly chaotic internal variability within the climate system. External forcing like volcanic eruptions tends to reduce simulated temperature seasonality and cannot explain the reconstructions. The strong seasonal cycle in temperature reduced food production and led to increasing food prices, a subsistence crisis and a famine in parts of Europe. Societies were not prepared to cope with failing markets and interrupted trade routes. In response to the crisis, authorities implemented numerous measures of supply policy and adaptation such as the installation of grain storage capacities to be prepared for future food production shortfalls.

J	Shuman, B; Plank, C				Shuman, Bryan; Plank, Colin			Orbital, ice sheet, and possible solar controls on Holocene moisture trends in the North Atlantic drainage basin	GEOLOGY												Holocene patterns of hydroclimatic change in the North Atlantic region are poorly understood despite the importance to climate of the region's freshwater flux to the ocean. Here we reconstruct the history of moisture balance in the North Atlantic drainage by compiling lake-level records from 95 lakes in Europe and North America. We show that recent millennia were significantly wetter than much of the Holocene in both regions. Only 15% of lakes studied in the North Atlantic basin were low in the past millennium. In contrast, 50% of lakes were low at 10 cal kyr B. P. Low moisture levels in the early Holocene likely resulted from high summer and fall insolation and the influence of the continental ice sheets; water levels rose in many areas as these influences diminished. A principal components analysis of the lake-level data, however, also indicates that Holocene atmospheric circulation changes, possibly driven by solar activity, generated additional moisture variation, including low water levels at 5-2 cal kyr B. P. in eastern North America and Scandinavia.

J	Deocampo, DM				Deocampo, DM			Hydrogeochemistry in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, and implications for land use in a World Heritage Site	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The chemistry of surface and ground waters in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, home to thousands of large mammals and a World Heritage Site, is controlled by the volcanic host rock lithology, evaporative concentration, mineral precipitation and redissoluton, and biological factors. Three groups of waters are informally differentiated based on their ranges of concentration: (1) dilute inflow (meteoric runoff and springs from short flowpaths: pH < 8, Cl- < 10 mg/l); (2) concentrated inflow (concentrated runoff and springs from long flowpaths: pH = 8-9, Cl- = 10- 100 mg/l); and (3) brackish waters (pools and Lake Makat: pH > 9, Cl- > 100 mg/l). Evaporative concentration and biological activity in swamps commonly produce strong geochemical gradients between dilute sources and peripheral concentrated ephemeral wetlands. Dilute inflow is found in the Lerai, Munge, and Oljoro Nyuki streams, and several large springs near the Crater wall such as Ngoitokitok and Seneto. Concentrated inflow is found in downstream reaches of the Munge stream, discharging from springs away from the Crater wall such as Engitati and Mti Moja, and in dry-season pools. Brackish waters are found discharging from springs on the southern margin of Lake Makat, in mudflats surrounding marshes, in ephemeral pools, and in the lake itself. Although few hydrologic data are available, the persistence of relatively fresh water in vegetated wetlands is consistent with lower sedge-dominated wetland evapo-transpiration rates compared with open water. This suggests that wetlands may play an important role in ensuring fresh water availability in the basin, and it demonstrates the need for future hydrologic study. Most of the Ngorongoro waters originate as rainfall outside the Crater, and travel into the basin as surface or ground water flow, emphasizing the need for a watershed-scale approach to land management.

J	Kerimoglu, O; Rinke, K				Kerimoglu, Onur; Rinke, Karsten			Stratification dynamics in a shallow reservoir under different hydro-meteorological scenarios and operational strategies	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Vertical mixing plays a major role in functioning of seasonally stratified aquatic systems. In this study, we employ a 1-D stratification model and a 9 year forcing data set to simulate the thermal dynamics in a large, but shallow reservoir that regularly displays a polymictic character with complete mixing events during summer. Such mixing dynamics is typical for many water bodies in the temperate zone having an intermediate depth. In many cases summer-mixing events were documented to induce severe water quality deteriorations (e.g., cyanobacterial blooms). We examined and quantified the response of summer-mixing behavior to combinations of hydrological regimes, i.e., water level fluctuations and withdrawal depth, and changes in meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature and wind speed. According to our findings: (i) increasing summer air temperatures considerably increase the resistance of the water column against mixing; (ii) while the combination of maintenance of a high and constant water depth and implementation of epilimnetic discharge results in almost complete resistance to mixing, their individual effects are also substantial, being roughly comparable to the effects of 4-6 K increase in air temperatures; (iii) wind is a critical variable, 30% increase of which can compensate up to 5.5 K increase in air temperatures; and (iv) effects of changes in air temperature, wind speed, and water depth are inter-dependent, as indicated by enhanced importance of wind and temperature in response to decreasing water depth, as well as reduced importance of depth in response to decreasing wind speed and increasing temperature.

Evaluating Hydrologic Response in Tile-Drained Landscapes: Implications for Phosphorus Transport	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Phosphorus (P) loss in agricultural discharge has typically been associated with surface runoff; however, tile drains have been identified as a key P pathway due to preferential transport. Identifying when and where these pathways are active may establish high-risk periods and regions that are vulnerable for P loss. A synthesis of high-frequency, runoff data from eight cropped fields across the Great Lakes region of North America over a 3-yr period showed that both surface and tile flow occurred year-round, although tile flow occurred more frequently. The relative timing of surface and tile flow activation was classified into four response types to infer runoff-generation processes. Response types were found to vary with season and soil texture. In most events across all sites, tile responses preceded surface flow, whereas the occurrence of surface flow prior to tile flow was uncommon. The simultaneous activation of pathways, indicating rapid connectivity through the vadose zone, was seldom observed at the loam sites but occurred at clay sites during spring and summer. Surface flow at the loam sites was often generated as saturation-excess, a phenomenon rarely observed on the clay sites. Contrary to expectations, significant differences in P loads in tiles were not apparent under the different response types. This may be due to the frequency of the water quality sampling or may indicate that factors other than surface-tile hydrologic connectivity drive tile P concentrations. This work provides new insight into spatial and temporal differences in runoff mechanisms in tile-drained landscapes.

Recently, flood events have impacted the Northeastern U.S. more frequently than in past decades, resulting in increased turbidity and other impacts in northern temperate lakes. This study represents an unprecedented analysis of the impacts of major spring and summer flooding in 2011 on Lake Champlain zooplankton communities. Few studies exist on flood impacts on lake systems, especially in natural un-impounded lakes. Our results illustrate the impacts of large-scale flooding on planktonic communities in deep stratified temperate lakes and the differential responses among species based on autecological traits. Community responses include flood-adapted increase during the flood event (Ceriodaphnia reticulata and Eubosmina coregoni), a flood-intolerant decline (Asplanchna spp. and Keratella cochlearis) or a delayed flood intolerance (Daphnia retrocurva, Mesocyclops edax, and Polyarthra spp.). Our results suggest that large, temperate lakes such as Lake Champlain will experience community shifts in zooplankton composition during future extreme flood events associated with climate change-related weather patterns in the Northeastern U.S.																				1424-2818				AUG	2024	16	8							451	10.3390/d16080451	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d16080451													WOS:001305022200001

The predominant phytoplankton species that appeared during the spring bloom belonged to 28 genera. A few species among them increased at any time to form a phytoplankton pulse, but the few species of phytoplankters that comprised a phytoplankton pulse did not completely exclude other phytoplankters. During the spring bloom, one pulse was replaced by another pulse composed of a new grouping of different species. Throughout these replacements by natural selection in the bloom were numerous other species by phytoplankters at levels of abundance somewhat less than those which formed phytoplankton pulse.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1983	17	4					447	451		10.1016/0043-1354(83)90143-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(83)90143-4													WOS:A1983QH14200014
J	Chanudet, V; Filella, V				Chanudet, Vincent; Filella, Vlontserrat			Size and composition of inorganic colloids in a peri-alpine, glacial flour-rich lake	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												From June 2004 to October 2005, particle size distributions (PSD) and the mineralogy of inorganic colloids in Lake Brienz, a glacial flour-rich Swiss lake, and in its tributaries (the Aare and Lutschine rivers), were quantified by single particle counting based on light scattering (0.1-2 mu m) combined with transmission electronic microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy and selected area electron diffraction. The two lake tributaries differ in terms of the geology of their catchment area and in their hydrology: the River Latschine's glacial regime is unperturbed, while the River Aare has been significantly modified by hydroelectric installations. The dependence of the colloid concentration numbers on colloid diameters can be described by a power-law distribution in all cases. The power-law slopes in the River Aare were consistently smaller, and the total colloid number concentrations consistently higher, (mean values: -3.89 and 6.2 x 10(8) mL(-1), respectively) than in the River Lutschine (-3.61 and 1.7 x 10(8) mL(-1)). The measured PSD in the lake were dependent on season and depth: homogenous in the whole epilimnion in winter and modified by river intrusions in summer. In this season, the presence of a river turbid plume above the thermocline is a significant source of colloids in the epilimnion, where their concentration was high (mean value: 5.1 x 10(7) mL(-1)). The same main mineral types were found in the different systems: 2:1 minerals, feldspars, chlorite and quartz; with a few particles of oxides. Differences in their relative concentrations in the rivers, essentially reflecting the geological differences of the respective catchment areas, made it possible to trace the origin of the mineral colloids present in lake surface waters throughout the year. The relationship between colloid size and mineralogy was assessed, showing that different minerals have distinct size distributions. In the rivers, where almost no aggregates were observed, PSD would essentially be the result of the nature (particle formation and mineralogy) of the colloids, whereas in the lake, aggregation and sedimentation processes would also play a role, particularly in summer.

J	Böhme, M				Boehme, Madelaine			Ectothermic vertebrates, climate and environment of the West Runton Freshwater Bed (early Middle Pleistocene, Cromerian)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The ectothermic vertebrate fauna from the early Middle Pleistocene West Runton Freshwater Bed (WRFB; England, Norfolk) comprises 21 species (10 fishes, 8 amphibians and 3 reptiles). All recorded species are referred to recent forms, except a large newt (Triturus sp. nov.) probably belonging to the Triturus cristatus group, and an indeterminate colubroid snake showing viperid affinities. This indicates that the Cromerian herpetofauna of the British Isles is more diverse than previously thought and contains extinct species. Two fish species are new for the WRFB: the white bream (Abramis bjoerkna), and the ide (Leuciscus cf. idus). Based on the faunal composition the aquatic ecosystem can be reconstructed as a densely vegetated, large eutrophic freshwater body, representing a slow-flowing river or oxbow lake. The terrestrial ecosystem in the surrounding area represents moist woodland habitats. There are no indications of open landscapes in the immediate vicinity. The estimated palaeoclimatological parameters indicate similar summer temperatures to today (16-17 degrees C), probably cooler winters (-6 to 1.4 degrees C) and mean annual temperatures (6-8 degrees C), and significantly higher mean annual precipitation compared to present-day conditions.

Autonomous Year-Round Sampling and Sensing to Explore the Physical and Biological Habitability of Permanently Ice-Covered Antarctic Lakes	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												The lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, are some of the only systems on our planet that are perennially ice-covered and support year-round metabolism. As such, these ecosystems can provide important information on conditions and life in polar regions on Earth and on other icy worlds in our solar system. Working in these extreme environments of the Dry Valleys poses many challenges, particularly with respect to data collection during dark winter months when logistical constraints make fieldwork difficult. In this paper, we describe the motivation, design, and challenges for this recently deployed instrumentation in Lake Bonney, a lake that has been the subject of summer research efforts for more than 40 years. The instrumentation deployed includes autonomous water, phytoplankton, and sediment samplers as well as cable-mounted profiling platforms with dissolved gas and fluorometry sensors. Data obtained from these instruments will allow us, for the first time, to define the habitability of this environment during the polar night. We include lessons learned during deployment and recommendations for effective instrument operation in these extreme conditions.					; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	Buelow, Heather/0000-0003-3535-4151; 													0025-3324	1948-1209				SEP-OCT	2014	48	5					8	17		10.4031/MTSJ.48.5.6	http://dx.doi.org/10.4031/MTSJ.48.5.6													WOS:000345057300002
J	Timoney, KP				Timoney, Kevin P.			Has river regulation damaged the Peace-Athabasca Delta?	ECOSCIENCE												The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) is a complex, dynamic, and misunderstood ecosystem. This study uses landscape, ecological, climatic, hydrologic, historical, stratigraphic, and wildlife data that document how and why the PAD has changed and varied from similar to 1900 to 2023. The ecological, climatic, and hydrologic components of the ecosystem vary in concert. Flood-drawdown cycles influenced by physical and biological factors have driven a host of landscape changes over the past 120 years. Prior to regulation, net drying of the PAD took place over the period similar to 1900 to the mid-1940s. Since mid-20th century, there has been no multidecadal drying trend but rather decadal-scale wet and dry episodes. Levels of the confluent Lakes Athabasca, Claire, and Mamawi, and their adjacent restricted basins, are strongly correlated with the combined flows of the Peace, Athabasca, Fond du Lac, and Birch Rivers. River regulation has changed the seasonal distribution of flows and suppressed summer flows. There is, however, no evidence that 'dramatic landscape change is underway, devastating local fauna' or that river regulation has caused delta desiccation, declines in spring flooding, declines in lake levels, or declines in wildlife, waterfowl, or their habitat. The great areal extent of the PAD watershed imparts hydrologic and ecological resilience.																			1195-6860	2376-7626				JUL 2	2024	31	3					118	148	2404796	10.1080/11956860.2024.2404796	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2024.2404796		OCT 2024											WOS:001336622200001

The first three intervals of weak summer EAM indicated by low TOC, C/N ratio and water content within the Holocene optimum (similar to 8.6-4.5 ka BP) correlate with solar activity, revealing that the centennial-scale summer monsoon variations in a warm climate were related to weak solar irradiance. The desiccation of the lake (4.5-similar to 2.1 ka BP), followed by a weak monsoon event at similar to 2.0-1.6 ka BP, may coincide with decreased sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific. High water content and low dry bulk density in core Rd at similar to 7.6, 7.46, 6.8-6.54, 6.1, 5.8, 5.6, and 5.0 ka BP imply a significant increase of summer EAM during these periods, and thus suggest an unstable optimum climate in Taiwan. A possible linkage of weak summer EAM with the tropical Pacific and North Atlantic cooling during these intervals may be driven by coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions, especially reduced heat and moisture transport and enhanced El Nino-Southern Oscillation in the tropical Pacific, as well as solar activity. The centennial-scale reorganizations in the tropical Pacific climate dynamics may have played an important role in the summer EAM instability, particularly during the late Holocene.

J	ENGEL, S				ENGEL, S			ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF HARVESTING MACROPHYTES IN HALVERSON LAKE, WISCONSIN	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Mechanical harvesting removed 50 to 70% of submersed macrophyte standing crop in June and July 1980 and 1981 from Halverson Lake, a 4.2-ha impoundment in southwestern Wiconsin. Coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum L.) and Berchtold''s, curly-leaf, and sago pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.) together comprised about 75% of total standing crop and covered 40 to 70% of the lake bed for three summers before harvesting. Macrophytes quickly regrew after the June 1980 harvest, reaching preharvest biomass within a few weeks and even becoming denser. However, they took until spring to recover from both July harvests. Species composition shifted a year later to dominance by water stargrass (Heteranthera dubia [Jacq.] MacM.). Rare before harvesting, it spread into three-fourths of all sampling plots and comprised 70% of total standing crop by August 1982. It continued to dominate until 1988 when the pondweeds took over. Bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus Raf.), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides [Lacepede]), and macroinvertebrates (mostly snails and chironomid larvae) were also removed during harvesting. But harvesting had little effect on phytoplankton, though blooms of blue-green algae (chiefly Anabaena and Microcystis) were least dense when water stargrass remained dominant.																			0146-6623					JAN	1990	28						41	45																WOS:A1990CQ52800011

The centric diatom Puncticulata balatonis (Pantocsek) Wojtal et Budzynska, comb. nov., in the plankton of eutrophic-hypertrophic Rusalka Lake (Western Poland)	NOVA HEDWIGIA												Cyclotella balatonis Pantocsek is probably a common and widely distributed component of the phytoplankton in mesotrophic to eutrophic European lakes and rivers. However, the distribution and ecology of the species are still unclear, since the species remained hidden in the broad C. radiosa (Grunow) Lemmermann - concept throughout most of the 20(th) century. Cyclotella balatonis was found to form quite a large population in the plankton of a small and shallow, urban, eutrophic to hypereutrophic lake (Rusalka Lake, Western Poland). The species occurred in the lake throughout the study period, from February till December 2007, with its highest number in the winter - spring period. The morphology and fine valve structure of the species are described in the paper, documented with light microscope (LM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs, and discussed along with the species ecology. Additionally, Cyclotella balatonis is formally transferred into the genus Puncticulata [P. balatonis (Pant.) Wojtal et Budzynska, comb nov.], and compared with the morphologically similar taxa - P. radiosa (Lemmermann) Hakansson, P. conga (Ehrenberg) Hakansson and P. praetermissa (Lund) Hakansson.

A most suitable empirical model validated by the field data between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradlometer (MODIS) reflectance and Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) selected as the indicator of water turbidity is used to map the spatio-temporal dynamics. High water transparency values are observed during the summer season, while the most turbid situations always occur in winter. In different years, the trend is similar while the occurrence of detailed peaks is a little different in the same lake. Comparing the situation in different seasons, the most turbid places show in different directions. Different lakes have their specific situations. The turbidity difference in the low-water season is less than the varying in the other seasons. Statistical methods were used to quantify the influence of factors such as water level, wind speed, temperature and rainfall. Further statistic analysis is used to judge the accuracy of the model. Some ancillary environmental factors which can also play a role such as fishing, dredging, vegetation and bird's influence are analyzed by theoretical deduction, supported by field investigations and historical data.					wu, guofeng/MGV-3932-2025; Mannaerts, Chris/A-6167-2011														0277-786X		978-0-8194-6914-4				2007	6754		1-2						67541H	10.1117/12.764879	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.764879													WOS:000251055600052

The co-occurrence of sulfur (S) and As increases the complexity of As migration and transformation in hot springs. Microorganisms play important roles in As-S transformation processes. In the present study, two Tibetan alkaline hot springs (designated Gulu [GL] and Daba [DB]) with different total As concentrations (0.88 mg/L and 12.42 mg/L, respectively) and different sulfide/As ratios (3.97 and 0.008, respectively) were selected for investigating interactions between As-S geochemistry and microbial communities along the outflow channels. The results showed that As-S transformation processes were similar, although concentrations and percentages of As and S species differed between the two hot springs. Thioarsenates were detected at the vents of the hot springs (18% and 0.32%, respectively), and were desulfurized to arsenite along the drainage channel. Arsenite was finally oxidized to arsenate (532 mu g/L and 12,700 mu g/L, respectively). Monothioarsenate, total As, and sulfate were the key factors shaping the changes in microbial communities with geochemical gradients. The relative abundances of sulfur reduction genes (dsrAB) and arsenate reduction genes (arsC) were higher in upstream portions of GL explaining high thiolation. Arsenite oxidation genes (aoxAB) were relatively abundant in downstream parts of GL and at the vent of DB explaining low thiolation. Sulfur oxidation genes (soxABXYZ) were abundant in GL and DB. Putative sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), such as Desulfuromusa and Clostridium, might be involved in forming thioarsenates by producing reduced S for chemical reactions with arsenite. Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), such as Elioraea, Pseudoxanthomonas and Pseudomonas, and arsenite-oxidizing bacteria (AsOB) such as Thermus, Sulfurihydrogenibium and Hydrogenophaga, may be responsible for the oxidation of As-bound S, thereby desulfurizing thioarsenates, forming arsenite and, by further abiotic or microbial oxidation, arsenate. This study improves our understanding of As and S biogeochemistry in hot springs.

The microbial diversity in these hot springs has been explored only by culture-dependent surveys. In this study, we performed metagenomic Illumina MiSeq, and 16S and 18S rRNA pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial life are residing in the microbial mats of the springs called Tina-Bonita. Our results show the presence of 186 operational taxonomic units, 99.7% of which belong to bacteria, 0.27% to eukaryotes, and 0.03% to archaea. The most abundant bacterial divisions are the Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Cyanobacteria, which include 105 genera. The ecological indexes indicate that the microbial mats have moderate microbial diversity. An abundant group of genes that participate in photosynthesis, including photosynthetic electron transport, as well as photosystems I and II, were detected. Another cluster of genes was found that participates in sulfur, nitrogen, and methane metabolism. Finally, this phylogenetic and metagenomic analysis revealed an unexpected taxonomic and genetic diversity, expanding our knowledge of microbial life under specific extreme conditions.

These sediments have been dated to the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene by the C-14 method. A number of lakes have formed and then disappeared several rimes in the last 20,000 years, while others survived until historical times. The number of lakes decreased in periods characterized by a negative hydrologic balance and increased when the balance was positive. The variations in the number of temporary lakes are mostly due to climatic causes and can be correlated with the oscillations of Lake Fucino level. Only in the last 4000 years divergent trends occurred. The cause of this could be the uman impact on the mountain environment. Of the twenty-four non-perennial lakes studied, currently only three reappear in spring and disappear with the onset of summer.																					0-7923-6918-1				2001	9						445	458																WOS:000169572400041

Phytoplankton and zooplankton have been shown to be ecological indicators of the water quality status in estuary ecosystems. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects that multiple pressures have on the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in estuarine ecosystems is essential. In this study, water samples from 29 stations were collected from the Liaohe Estuary over three different seasons, and biotic factors (i.e., phytoplankton and zooplankton) were obtained and compared. The results showed that there were significant temporal and spatial variations in the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities from the Liaohe Estuary. The correlation analyses showed that water temperature was the most important factor regulating the variation in phytoplankton communities, whereas the main driving force for the zooplankton was nutrient concentrations. Large amounts of nutrients entered the estuary in spring and summer due to intensive human activities in the Liaohe River basin. The inflows by the Liaohe River introduced some phytoplankton and zooplankton into the estuary, such as Coscinodicus asteromphalus, Chaetoceros decipiens, and Schmacheria poplesia. The impacts of Liaohe inflows on the estuary region gradually decreased as the distance from the inlet increased and this change was mediated by marine diffusion. The results from this study will improve knowledge about planktonic communities in estuarine ecosystems and provide a theoretical foundation for estuary environmental management.

Two lakes in Washington, Corral Lake (northern watermilfoil) and Sawyer Lake (Eurasian watermilfoil), were surveyed throughout the summer in 1998. In addition, we surveyed 17 lakes once during the summer of 1999 to determine instantaneous densities of the weevil. Summer densities (all life stages) in Corral Lake ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 weevils/stem in 1998, with the greatest numbers of weevils observed the end of June and mid August. In Lake Sawyer, summer densities ranged from 0.0 to 0.8 weevils/stem in 1998; density was highest in June and declined during the summer. The weevil appears to have at least two generations during the summer on Eurasian and northern watermilfoil. The instantaneous density of weevils (all life stages) ranged from 0.0 to 0.6 weevils/stems in 1999. Densities were greater on northern than on Eurasian watermilfoil, but these differences were not statistically significant. Weevil density, however, was positively correlated with the percentage of stems with larval damage, but negatively correlated with the length (parallel to shore) of the watermilfoil bed. No significant relationships were found between weevil density and water quality or watermilfoil frequency of occurrence. Results indicate that neither density nor the number of summer generations differ significantly between the weevil's native and exotic host.

In contrast to the traditional particle-size-based methods, an approach relying on time and depth variation of sediment concentration was employed to estimate the mean value of fall velocity at any depth and time. Particles at greater depths, particularly for the samples with a higher rate of sediment concentration, accelerated faster and remained at higher velocities for a longer duration owing to a higher rate of flocculation. As a particular property of cohesive sediments, particles for all concentrated samples and in all depths reached their maximum fall velocity at around the same time-15 min after the start of the tests. The low concentration samples reached higher maximum velocities because of the lower rates of hindering, but for a much lower duration in comparison to the higher concentrated samples. An empirical equation is developed to estimate the maximum fall velocity of particles for cohesive sediments where the ratio of flocculation to hindering is highest.

J	Gooseff, MN; McKnight, DM; Runke, RL; Vaughn, BH				Gooseff, MN; McKnight, DM; Runke, RL; Vaughn, BH			Determining long time-scale hyporheic zone flow paths in Antarctic streams	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, glaciers are the source of meltwater during the austral summer, and the streams and adjacent hyporheic zones constitute the entire physical watershed; there are no hillslope processes in these systems. Hyporheic zones can extend several metres from each side of the stream, and are up to 70 cm deep, corresponding to a lateral cross-section as large as 12 m(2), and water resides in the subsurface year around. In this study, we differentiate between the near-stream hyporheic zone, which can be characterized with stream tracer experiments, and the extended hyporheic zone, which has a longer time-scale of exchange. We sampled stream water from Green Creek and from the adjacent saturated alluvium for stable isotopes of D and O-18 to assess the significance and extent of stream-water exchange between the streams and extended hyporheic zones over long time-scales (days to weeks). Our results show that water residing in the extended hyporheic zone is much more isotopically enriched (up to 11parts per thousand D and 2-2parts per thousand O-18) than stream water. This result suggests a long residence time within the extended hyporheic zone, during which fractionation has occurred owing to summer evaporation and winter sublimation of hyporheic water. We found less enriched water in the extended hyporheic zone later in the flow season, suggesting that stream water may be exchanged into and out of this zone, on the time-scale of weeks to months. The transient storage model OTIS was used to characterize the exchange of stream water with the extended hyporheic zone. Model results yield exchange rates (a) generally an order magnitude lower (10(-5) s(-1)) than those determined using stream-tracer techniques on the same stream. In light of previous studies in these streams, these results suggest that the hyporheic zones in Antarctic streams have near-stream zones of rapid stream-water exchange, where 'fast' biogeochemical reactions may influence water chemistry, and extended hyporheic zones, in which slower biogeochemical reaction rates may affect stream-water chemistry at longer time-scales.

Calibration and Application of Branched GDGTs to Tibetan Lake Sediments: The Influence of Temperature on the Fall of the Guge Kingdom in Western Tibet, China	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from lacustrine sediments have been widely used to reconstruct mean annual air temperature (MAAT). Although many proxy calibrations relating brGDGT characteristics have been put forth, these calibrations may produce warm biases when applied to lakes in cold regions. We present an expanded Chinese lake surface sediment brGDGT-MAAT calibration with 29 new surface samples from cold regions along with 39 previously published from Chinese lakes. We deployed sediment traps in a meromictic lake, Dagze Co, and compared results with previously published data from a dimictic lake, Lake 578 in Greenland, to determine potential seasonal and depth-dependence of brGDGTs. In the meromictic lake, brGDGTs are primarily produced in the lake bottom water, whereas in the dimictic lake, the brGDGTs are produced throughout the water column and mainly reflect the annual bottom water temperature or mixing season water column temperature. We applied our refined calibration to a sediment core from Western Tibet to examine how fluctuations in temperature influenced the Guge Kingdom over the last 2,000 years. Our record reveals relatively warm temperatures during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, cooling of 2 degrees C to -2 degrees C during the Little Ice Age, warming into the eighteenth century, and stabilization after 1800 CE. The temperature variations coincided with a transition of dynasties in Western Tibet. Temperature sensitivity tests on barley distribution, the principal cultivated cereal in Tibet, suggest that a decline in temperature led to a decreased crop yield that may have factored into the disappearance of the Guge Kingdom.					梁, 洁/GRY-6915-2022; Hou, Juzhi/W-5655-2018; Guo, YanLong/KGL-6413-2024; Guo, Yanlong/KGL-6413-2024; Lupien, Rachel/HJI-2324-2023; Liu, jianbao/X-3646-2019; Wang, Mingda/C-7736-2011; Zhao, Boyang/JOZ-5006-2023	liang, Jie/0000-0003-2726-923X; Hou, Juzhi/0000-0002-8512-5739; Vachula, Richard/0000-0001-5559-6540; Guo, Yanlong/0000-0002-0886-6621; Xie, Haichao/0000-0002-3035-4526; Wang, Mingda/0000-0002-8081-755X; Lupien, Rachel/0000-0002-5618-8829; Yao, Yuan/0000-0002-9833-5639; Zhao, Boyang/0000-0002-4325-775X; Richter, Nora/0000-0002-4613-005X													2572-4517	2572-4525				MAY	2022	37	5							e2021PA004393	10.1029/2021PA004393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021PA004393													WOS:000789931000001

However, fewer studies have focused on the influence these controls in a holistic manner. We relate the water chemistry of a country-wide Irish river survey to atmospheric input, underlying geology, and the influence of bogs. Climatic conditions were defined by an atypically wet winter and an unusually dry summer, providing the opportunity to investigate river chemistry variation across hydrologic conditions. Sampling included 21 of Ireland's 22 largest rivers ranked by discharge, first-order and second-order streams draining bog lands, a second-order stream draining a limestone catchment, and downstream transects along the River Shannon. All samples were analyzed for major elements, selected trace elements, and nutrients, and a subset was analyzed for delta S-34(SO4). New hydrological insights: Most catchments were dominated by carbonate weathering with little contribution from the weathering of aluminosilicates. River water composition also varied geographically along the prevailing wind direction due to inputs from marine aerosols, with additional weathering components important in some systems. Seasonal influences could be seen in the chemistry of the headwaters of the River Shannon, while the lower reaches of the river exhibited less variable behavior throughout seasonal changes, likely due to the influence of lakes in the River Shannon system.

To optimize the management of cyanobacteria blooms there is the need to better comprehend the combination of factors influencing the diversity and dominance of cyanobacteria and their impact on the lake's ecology. The goal of this study was to characterize the diversity and seasonal dynamics of cyanobacteria communities found in a water column of Lake Geneva, as well as the associated changes on bacterioplankton abundance and composition.Methods: We used 16S rRNA amplicon high throughput sequencing on more than 200 water samples collected from surface to 100 meters deep monthly over 18 months. Bacterioplankton abundance was determined by quantitative PCR and PICRUSt predictions were used to explore the functional pathways present in the community and to calculate functional diversity indices.Results: The obtained results confirmed that the most dominant cyanobacteria in Lake Geneva during autumn and winter was Planktothrix (corresponding to P. rubescens). Our data also showed an unexpectedly high relative abundance of picocyanobacterial genus Cyanobium, particularly during summertime. Multidimensional scaling of Bray Curtis dissimilarity revealed that the dominance of P. rubescens was coincident with a shift in the bacterioplankton community composition and a significant decline in bacterioplankton abundance, as well as a temporary reduction in the taxonomic and PICRUSt2 predicted functional diversity.Conclusion: Overall, this study expands our fundamental understanding of the seasonal dynamics of cyanobacteria communities along a vertical column in Lake Geneva and the ecology of P. rubescens, ultimately contributing to improve our preparedness against the potential occurrence of toxic blooms in the largest lake of western Europe.					; Guillaume, Annie/V-6328-2019; Kohn, Tamar/H-1430-2011	Guillaume, Annie/0000-0002-2188-2861; Tofield Pasche, Natacha/0000-0002-9578-9301; Selmoni, Oliver/0000-0003-0904-5486; 														1664-302X				DEC 15	2023	14								1295193	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1295193	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1295193								38169808					WOS:001133618000001

For this purpose, the concentrations of ions associated with diagnosing and managing this problem were evaluated from several measurements performed over one year along a road. This analysis demonstrated a higher concentration of soluble Na+ in the soil 3 m from a road in the northernmost part of the study area in February, which made the soil saline-sodic. Data from the rest of the study period (during the spring and summer) demonstrated that the de-icing salt moved to areas farther south by runoff water, which caused environmental impacts by modifying soil characteristics. These results suggest that leaching of Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations occurred faster in the studied systems in sodic soils. Leaching of these cations may affect plant yield, and results in environmental impacts within 3-30 m from the road. Awareness of this impact will be useful for developing future strategies for evaluating and reporting these complex relationships within Spain's transport system and environment.

Linking Host Prokaryotic Physiology to Viral Lifestyle Dynamics in a Temperate Freshwater Lake (Lake Pavin, France)	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												In aquatic ecosystems, fluctuations in environmental conditions and prokaryotic host physiological states can strongly affect the dynamics of viral life strategies. The influence of prokaryote physiology and environmental factors on viral replication cycles (lytic and lysogeny) was investigated from April to September 2011 at three different strata (epi, meta, and hypolimnion) in the mixolimnion of deep volcanic temperate freshwater Lake Pavin (France). Overall, the euphotic region (epi and metalimnion) was more dynamic and showed significant variation in microbial standing stocks, prokaryotic physiological state, and viral life strategies compared to the aphotic hypolimnion which was stable within sampled months. The prokaryotic host physiology as inferred from the nucleic acid content of prokaryotic cells (high or low nucleic acid) was strongly regulated by the chlorophyll concentration. The predominance of the high nucleic acid (HNA) prokaryotes (cells) over low nucleic acid (LNA) prokaryotes (cells) in the spring (HNA/LNA = 1.2) and vice versa in the summer period (HNA/LNA = 0.4) suggest that the natural prokaryotic communities underwent major shifts in their physiological states during investigated time period. The increase in the percentage of inducible lysogenic prokaryotes in the summer period was associated with the switch in the dominance of LNA over HNA cells, which coincided with the periods of strong resource (nutrient) limitation. This supports the idea that lysogeny represents a maintenance strategy for viruses in unproductive or harsh nutrient/host conditions. A negative correlation of percentage of lysogenic prokaryotes with HNA cell abundance and chlorophyll suggest that lysogenic cycle is closely related to prokaryotic cells which are stressed or starved due to unavailability of resources for its growth and activity. Our results provide support to previous findings that changes in prokaryote physiology are critical for the promotion and establishment of lysogeny in aquatic ecosystems, which are prone to constant environmental fluctuations.

J	Madan, NJ; Marshall, WA; Laybourn-Parry, J				Madan, NJ; Marshall, WA; Laybourn-Parry, J			Virus and microbial loop dynamics over an annual cycle in three contrasting Antarctic lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Viral and microbial loop dynamics were investigated over an annual cycle in three contrasting saline Antarctic lakes - Highway Lake (salinity 4 parts per thousand), Pendant Lake (salinity 19 parts per thousand) and Ace Lake, a meromictic system (with a mixolimnion salinity of 18 parts per thousand) in order to assess the importance of viruses in extreme, microbially dominated systems. 2. Virus like particles (VLP) showed no clear seasonal pattern, with high concentrations occurring in both winter and summer (range 0.89 x 10(7) +/- 0.038 to 12.017 x 10(7) +/- 1.28 mL(-1)). VLP abundances reflected lake productivity based on chlorophyll a concentrations. Bacterial abundances and biomass did not correlate with VLP numbers except in Pendant Lake, the most productive of the three lakes studied. 3. Pendant Lake supported the highest bacterial biomass (range Highway: 18.44 +/- 1.35 to 59.43 +/- 2.80 ng C mL(-1); Ace: 14.42 +/- 2.69 to 68.39 +/- 2.95 ng C mL(-1); Pendant: 31.36 +/- 3.94 to 115.95 +/- 4.49 ng C mL(-1)) so that virus to bacteria ratios (VBR) (range 30.48 +/- 7.96 to 96.67 +/- 8.21) were higher in Ace Lake (range 30.58 +/- 3.98 to 80.037 +/- 1.60) and Highway Lake (range 18.63 +/- 3.12 to 126.74 +/- 6.50). 4. Negative correlations occurred between VLP and cryptophytes (dominant phototrophic nanoflagellates), suggesting that they were not hosts to lytic viruses. Among the other protists only the heterotrophic nanoflagellates of Highway Lake (dominated by the marine choanoflagellate Diaphanoeca grandis) showed a positive correlation with VLP. 5. The VLP was negatively correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and temperature, both of which increased with ice thinning and breakout, increasing viral decay. In winter VLP probably persisted in cold, dark water. 6. High VLP concentrations and high VBR (values at the upper end of those reported for marine and lacustrine systems) indicated that viruses, most of which were probably bacteriophage, are a major element within the microbial communities in extreme, saline lakes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2005	50	8					1291	1300		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01399.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01399.x													WOS:000230576500001

SCHRANK IN LAKES OF DIFFERENT TROPHY	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Changes in the density of C. hirundinella were determined in 6 subarctic Canadian lakes from May 1978-May 1979. The lakes differed widely in trophic conditions, size and depth. Low summer temperatures reduced the length of the growing season (June-Oct.) but did not influence the timing of peak abundance (usually Aug.-Sept.). The thermal optimum of C. hirundinella ranged from 4-18.degree. C. Late summer blooms were probably controlled by decreasing daylength after the summer solstice and were independent of temperature. Nutrient availability controlled the intensity but not the timing of maxima. The occurrence of large numbers of C. hirundinella at depths of 60-70 m was partly related to high light penetration and O2 levels.																			0003-9136						1981	92	4					535	548																WOS:A1981MR18500006

Extremes of summer climate trigger thousands of thermokarst landslides in a High Arctic environment	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) - landslides caused by the melt of ground ice in permafrost - have become more common in the Arctic, but the timing of this recent increase and its links to climate have not been fully established. Here we annually resolve RTS formation and longevity for Banks Island, Canada (70,000 km(2)) using the Google Earth Engine Timelapse dataset. We describe a 60-fold increase in numbers between 1984 and 2015 as more than 4000 RTS were initiated, primarily following four particularly warm summers. Colour change due to increased turbidity occurred in 288 lakes affected by RTS outflows and sediment accumulated in many valley floors. Modelled RTS initiation rates increased by an order of magnitude between 1906-1985 and 2006-2015, and are projected under RCP4.5 to rise to >10,000 decade(-1) after 2075. These results provide additional evidence that ice-rich continuous permafrost terrain can be highly vulnerable to changing summer climate.					; Way, Robert/B-1417-2013	Lewkowicz, Antoni/0000-0002-9307-2147; 													2041-1723					APR 2	2019	10								1329	10.1038/s41467-019-09314-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09314-7								30940802					WOS:000462984700001

Despite extensive research in warm temperate and tropical rice-growing regions, bird communities in snow-rich agricultural wetland landscapes remain poorly studied. Here we present a dataset describing bird assemblages in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape surrounding Lake Kahokugata, located in a snow-rich region on the Sea of Japan side of central Japan. The area represents a land reclamation zone shaped by decades of wetland conversion. We conducted point-count surveys across 43 plots in winter and summer (2021 and 2023), yielding 129 replicated observations. The plots encompassed diverse cropland types, including rice paddies, lotus root fields, vegetable fields, pastures, and abandoned lands, representing a mosaic of wet and dry farmland. The dataset includes abundance records of 41 bird species, along with land-use attributes within a 75 m radius and landscape data on open waterbodies within a 500 m radius. Our data is useful in providing insights into how landscape heterogeneity, cropland composition, and seasonal dynamics influence bird diversity in snowy agricultural wetlands.

Icings as sentinels and modifiers of water flow through winter landscapes: An exploration of physico-chemical processes on the lake-dominated, discontinuous permafrost Taiga Shield	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The winter hydrological period is in transition across the Canadian subarctic, as climate warming is shifting precipitation regimes, thawing permafrost, and altering active layer dynamics, and thus increasing the overall amount, and variability, of winter streamflow. Effects of these changes are poorly understood on the Taiga Shield, which comprises similar to 20% of North America's permafrost-covered area, and is characterized by a unique 'fill-and-spill' hydrology whereby runoff generation requires the exceedance of lake basin storage thresholds. Here, we assessed lake hydrostatic levels and used trail camera images of icings, which are sheet-like masses of layered ice that are common manifestations of wintertime flow on the Taiga Shield, to understand landscape controls on winter water movement in this region. We further used paired geochemical measurements to explore how source water characteristics affect icing chemistry, and the degree to which icings may modify the chemical composition of active winter flow. We undertake this work over 2 years, and across watersheds of different sizes and lake basin characteristics. We show that icing growth is driven by hydroclimatic controls that include fill-and-spill hydrologic constraints and winter air temperatures, and that pre-freshet pulses of water flow are common within this landscape. Across winters with variable antecedent precipitation levels, a larger catchment was able to support icing growth via continued runoff generation, while small catchments were not. Icings were often chemically dilute compared with source waters, indicating that solute exclusion may actively enrich geochemical concentrations in flowing water. Across icings, chemical variation appeared related to source water type (groundwater versus lake; lake size) and apparent redox conditions. These results highlight that streamwater hydrology and biogeochemistry can be dynamic during the understudied winter period, and illustrate that icings may alter the composition of wintertime flow as it moves through fluvial networks.

At site 4 sulfate reduction followed a seasonal pattern with summer maxima and winter minima, suggesting temperature dependence, but in contrast at site 1 there was no distinct seasonal cycle. Use of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to investigate the active sulfate reducing bacterial (SRB) populations suggested that populations of SRB remained relatively constant at site 4 throughout the year. However, at site 1 distinct peaks in signal from a Desulfovibrio spp.-targeted probe were measured which corresponded with peaks in sulfate reduction activity. In addition, sedimentary profiles suggested that both sulfate reduction activity and active SRB populations peaked at 0-5 cm into the sediment at site 1 but deeper into the sediment at 9-10 cm at site 4. The results indicate that SRB population dynamics are more complex than process measurements would suggest.

Active layer hydrology in an arctic tundra ecosystem: quantifying water sources and cycling using water stable isotopes	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Climate change and thawing permafrost in the Arctic will significantly alter landscape hydro-geomorphology and the distribution of soil moisture, which will have cascading effects on climate feedbacks (CO2 and CH4) and plant and microbial communities. Fundamental processes critical to predicting active layer hydrology are not well understood. This study applied water stable isotope techniques (H-2 and O-18) to infer sources and mixing of active layer waters in a polygonal tundra landscape in Barrow, Alaska (USA), in August and September of 2012. Results suggested that winter precipitation did not contribute substantially to surface waters or subsurface active layer pore waters measured in August and September. Summer rain was the main source of water to the active layer, with seasonal ice melt contributing to deeper pore waters later in the season. Surface water evaporation was evident in August from a characteristic isotopic fractionation slope (H-2 vs O-18). Freeze-out isotopic fractionation effects in frozen active layer samples and textural permafrost were indistinguishable from evaporation fractionation, emphasizing the importance of considering the most likely processes in water isotope studies, in systems where both evaporation and freeze-out occur in close proximity. The fractionation observed in frozen active layer ice was not observed in liquid active layer pore waters. Such a discrepancy between frozen and liquid active layer samples suggests mixing of meltwater, likely due to slow melting of seasonal ice. This research provides insight into fundamental processes relating to sources and mixing of active layer waters, which should be considered in process-based fine-scale and intermediate-scale hydrologic models.

Persistent unstable atmospheric boundary layer enhances sensible and latent heat loss in a tropical great lake: Lake Tanganyika	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Energy fluxes across the surface of lakes regulate heat storage and affect the water balance. Sensible and latent heat fluxes are affected by atmospheric stability, especially for large lakes. We examined the effect of atmospheric stability on the heat fluxes on seasonal time scales at Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, by estimating hourly sensible and latent heat fluxes and net radiation using thermistor chains and meteorological stations. The atmosphere was almost always unstable, in contrast to the atmosphere above North American Great Lakes which is unstable in winter and stable in summer. Persistent atmospheric instability resulted in a 13% and 18% increase in the annual mean heat loss by latent and sensible heat fluxes, respectively, relative to conditions of neutral stability. The persistent unstable atmosphere is caused by a higher water surface temperature compared with air temperature, which we argue is the case in general in (sub) tropical lakes. Low humidity further enhanced the frequency of unstable conditions and enhanced the exchange of heat and vapor from the lake to the atmosphere. The estimated heat fluxes were sensitive to the temporal scale of data inputs and to the local values of parameters such as air density. To our knowledge this is the first paper that demonstrates and quantifies the effect of atmospheric stability on latent and sensible heat fluxes from a lake on an annual basis, using data collected from the lake surface.						verburg, piet/0000-0001-7574-9161													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 8	2010	115								D11109	10.1029/2009JD012839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JD012839													WOS:000278732700001

These small quarry lakes (1-50 ha) are usually hydrologically isolated, often deep (6-40 m) and stratify during summer and in cold winters. Due to their small size, these deep man-made lakes are usually not included in the regular monitoring campaigns, e.g. as required for the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Therefore, not much is known about the ecological functioning of these novel ecosystems. During two summers, we determined the macrophyte diversity and measured a range of physico-chemical and biological parameters in 51 quarry lakes in the catchment area of the rivers Meuse and Rhine. We compared the results of this campaign to the chemical and macrophyte sampling as performed for the WFD in the immediate surrounding shallow standing waters. Alpha (local) and beta diversity (regional), and local contribution to beta diversity were calculated for the whole region of which beta diversity was further partitioned into a true species replacement and richness difference component. Quarry lakes contain higher water quality reflected by lower nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentration compared with shallow water bodies. Additionally, quarry lakes contribute significantly to the regional macrophyte diversity pool by harboring distinctly different macrophyte communities (beta diversity - replacement). Specifically quarry lakes with a total phosphorus concentration in the water column below 35 mu g P/l contribute most to beta diversity among quarry lakes. Novel ecosystems such as deep quarry lakes are often perceived as less valuable ecosystems, with strong implications regarding their management. Our results show that quarry lakes are in general of better chemical and biological quality compared with shallow standing waters. We therefore call for a more integrated assessment of the quality of quarry lakes and corresponding management strategy of these waters by water managers. (C) 2021 The Authors.

J	Hilt, S				Hilt, Sabine			Recovery of Potamogeton pectinatus L. stands in a shallow eutrophic lake under extreme grazing pressure	HYDROBIOLOGIA					11th International Symposium on Aquatic Weeds	SEP 02-06, 2002	Moliets et Maa, FRANCE	European Weed Res Soc				In shallow lakes, submerged macrophytes contribute to the stabilization of the clear water state. If lost, a number of mechanisms prevent re-colonization. Lake Muggelsee (730 ha) lost its submerged vegetation due to increasing eutrophication and switched to phytoplankton dominance in 1970. After the reduction of nutrient loading in 1990, Potamogeton pectinatus L. started re-colonizing the lake. During the following years, it spread at a mean rate of 2.5 ha per year to all available areas < 80 cm depth. Between 1993 and 1999, decreasing maximum biomass indicated hampered growth. Exclosure experiments revealed that herbivory reduced the aboveground biomass by more than 90%. Both waterfowl and fish were found to contribute to the grazing pressure despite a low abundance of the known herbivorous fish species and waterfowl in spring and summer. Protection of stands against grazing resulted in higher biomass of shoots, whereas shoot and tuber density did not change. Both shading by phytoplankton and periphyton, as well as grazing pressure, prevented the submerged vegetation of Lake Muggelsee from developing back to a dense zone that contributed to the reduction of turbidity.

J	Landis, MS; Vette, AF; Keeler, GJ				Landis, MS; Vette, AF; Keeler, GJ			Atmospheric mercury in the Lake Michigan basin: Influence of the Chicago/Gary urban area	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The relative importance of the Chicago/Gay urban area was investigated to determine its impact on atmospheric mercury (Hg) concentrations and wet deposition in the Lake Michigan basin. Event wet-only precipitation, total particulate, and vapor phase samples were collected for Hg, and trace element determinations from five sites around Lake Michigan from July 1994 through October 1995 as part of the Lake Michigan Mass Balance Study (LMMBS). In addition, intensive over-water measurements were conducted aboard the EPA research vessel Lake Guardian during the summer of 1994 and the winter of 1995 as part of the Atmospheric Exchange Over Lakes and Oceans Study. Atmospheric Hg concentrations were found to be significantly higher in the Chicago/Gary urban area than surrounding sites: Hg in precipitation was a factor of 2 and particulate Hg was a factor of 6 times higher. Over-water measurements found elevated Hg concentrations 19 km off shore of Chicago/Gary suggesting an enhanced near field atmospheric deposition to Lake Michigan. Meteorological transport analyses also determined that local sources in the Chicago/Gary urban area significantly impacted all of the LMMBS sites indicating a broad impact to the entire Lake Michigan basin.

J	MORIN, A				MORIN, A			INTENSITY AND IMPORTANCE OF ABIOTIC CONTROL AND INFERRED COMPETITION ON BIOMASS DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF SIMULIIDAE AND HYDROPSYCHIDAE IN SOUTHERN QUEBEC STREAMS	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Biomass of Simuliidae larvae was measured on individual rocks in four surveys of southern Quebec streams to quantify the intensity and importance of relationships between biomass of black flies and microhabitat features (depth, current velocity, rock size), site properties (distance from the lake, seston quality), and biomass of Hydropsychidae. Microhabitat features and site properties accounted for 14-47% of the variability in biomass of hydropsychids and simuliids on individual rocks, and between 30 and 67% of variability in mean biomass across sites. Addition of biomass of potential competitors did not significantly improve the proportion of variability accounted for by the multiple regression models. Within most sampling sites, biomasses of simuliids and of hydropsychids were positively correlated. However, analysis of microdistribution patterns across sites suggests a small but significant negative partial correlation between hydropsychids and simuliids in summer and a positive partial correlation in winter. Analysis of covariance revealed strong site effects that could not be explained by microhabitat features or biomass of potential competitors. These results suggest that hydropsychids have a negative effect on biomass of simuliids in summer, but that biomass of simuliids in different sites is more influenced by microhabitat features and site properties than by the biomass of hydropsychids. Reanalysis of published work on interactions between simuliids and caddisflies suggests that intensity of competition is relatively constant, but that its importance is overestimated by controlled experiments. Quantitative models describing the distribution of filter feeders across sites should include better correlates of site suitability rather than considering abundance of competing groups.					; Morin, Antoine/J-9583-2013	Morin, Antoine/0000-0003-0043-2391; 													0887-3593					DEC	1991	10	4					388	403		10.2307/1467665	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467665													WOS:A1991GV33700004
J	Zhang, XS; Xu, XY; Su, L; Shen, ZW				Zhang, Xiaosen; Xu, Xinyu; Su, Ling; Shen, Zhongwei			Ecological responses of the diatom species Asterionella formosa to climate change and resource availability in a shallow eutrophic lake of Chinese Loess Plateau	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Diatoms have long been recognized as strong ecological indicators for climate and environmental changes. Asterionella formosa Hassall is a cosmopolitan diatom species around the world, but its ecological preferences are still unclear and its palaeolimnological interpretations are strongly disputed. This species is often considered to be driven by nutrient enrichment, whereas it was recently proposed that the increasing abundance of this species is linked to warming-induced lake thermal stratification. To improve its ecological interpretation, we examine the possible driving factors of this species through diatom seasonal monitoring in an alpine, shallow and eutrophic lake (Lake Mayinghai) on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Our data show that the compositional dominance of A. formosa in the late-autumn and winter months indicates that this species can tolerate both mixing and ice-covered stable water conditions and further suggests that it has a preference to low light availability. The dominance of this species is not associated with an increase in nutrients, and does not support that this species can be used as an indicator of nutrient enrichment. However, given low diatom production in the cold season, increased lake thermal stability in the growing season induced by warming is a more probable explanation, and it is likely that a eutrophic, turbid condition or an oligotrophic, other algae-dominant low-light condition may be a requisite for its interpretation as a signal of warming.

A multi-isotope (δ13C, δ15N, δ34S, δ2H) approach to establishing migratory connectivity in lesser snow geese: Tracking an overabundant species	PLOS ONE												Expanding populations of North American midcontinent lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) have potential to alter ecosystems throughout the Arctic and subarctic where they breed. Efforts to understand origins of harvested lesser snow geese to better inform management decisions have traditionally required mark-recapture approaches, while aerial photographic surveys have typically been used to identify breeding distributions. As a potential alternative, isotopic patterns that are metabolically fixed within newly grown flight feathers following summer molting could provide inferences regarding geographic breeding origin of individuals, without the need for prior capture. Our objective was to assess potential to use four stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta S-34, delta H-2) from feather material to determine breeding origins. We obtained newly grown flight feathers from individuals during summer banding at three Arctic and two subarctic breeding colonies in 2014 (n = 56) and 2016 (n = 45). We used linear discriminant analyses to predict breeding origins from models using combinations of stable isotopes as predictors and evaluated model accuracy when predicting colony, subregion, or subpopulation levels. We found a strong inverse relationship between delta H-2 values and increasing latitude (R-2 = 0.83), resulting in differences (F-4,F- 51 = 90.41, P < 0.0001) among sampled colonies. No differences in delta C-13 or delta N-15 were detected among colonies, although delta S-34 in Akimiski Island, Baffin Island, and Karrak Lake were more enriched (F4, 51 = 11.25, P < 0.0001). Using delta H-2 values as a predictor, discriminant analyses improved accuracy in classification level as precision decreased [model accuracy = 67% (colony), 88% (subregion), 94% (subpopulation)]. Application of the isotopic methods we describe could be used to provide an alternative monitoring method of population metrics, such as overall breeding population distribution, region-specific productivity and migratory connectivity that are informative to management decision makers and provide insight into cross-seasonal effects that may influence migratory behavior.

J	Hu, B; Wang, YS; Liu, G				Hu, Bo; Wang, Yuesi; Liu, Guangren			Spatiotemporal characteristics of photosynthetically active radiation in China	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) plays an important part in climate change and ecological processes. Few PAR measurements are usually available, especially in China. Thus it is important and significant to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of PAR in China for radiation budget and ecosystem studies. In order to study the spatiotemporal characteristics of PAR, photosynthetic photon flux density (Q(p)) and broadband solar radiation (R-s) measurement data were analyzed for the period of January 2005 to June 2006. Q(p) increases gradually from spring and reaches its maximum and minimum in summer and winter, respectively. The highest value of annual mean daily Q(p) (40.9 +/- 4.1 mol m(-2) d(-1)) appears in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, along with higher atmospheric transmission; and the lowest value (17.4 +/- 9.03 mol m(-2) d(-1)) is found in the northern subtropics, along with the largest aerosol optical depth (AOD) and a lower water vapor content. PAR fraction shows a similar seasonal trend as that of Q(p) at all sites except for some near to lakes and sea. The annual mean daily value of PAR fraction varies from 1.75 +/- 0.12 to 2.3 +/- 0.15 mol MJ(-1) over China. The largest value appears in tropical regions because of higher relative humidity (RH). The lowest value is observed at the Luancheng site, which features low humidity and an abundance of fine aerosols, instead of sites in China's driest northern desert region. The variability of PAR fraction is mainly controlled by the selective scattering of aerosol particles and absorption of water vapor. Two different diurnal trends of PAR fraction are observed in China. In most sites, PAR fraction tends to peak during sunrise or sunset and reaches its lowest value around noon. However, it exhibits an opposite trend in the northern desert area because of the distinctive diurnal variation of water vapor in this region. Further analysis of annual mean hourly PAR fraction shows that the national average is 1.82 +/- 0.11 and 2.00 +/- 0.08 mu mol J(-1) for clear and cloudy days, respectively. The cloudy day's ratio is therefore 10% higher than that for clear days. The altitude dependency of PAR fraction is very weak below 1500 m because of uneven distributions of water vapor, clouds, and aerosols. Above 1500 m, PAR fraction increases gradually with altitude on both cloudy and clear days, attributed to the weaker extinction of Q(p) at higher-altitude sites. The distribution pattern of annual mean daily PAR fraction is similar to that of the hourly value. Its magnitude is medial to the hourly values on cloudy and clear days. These results are helpful for understanding the climatic, agricultural, and ecological processes over China and useful for primary productivity estimation and ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange study in China.					; hu, bo/C-5747-2014; Wang, Yuesi/AAF-3186-2019	hu, bo/0000-0003-4808-9115; hu, bo/0000-0001-6164-9784; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 31	2007	112	D14							D14106	10.1029/2006JD007965	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JD007965													WOS:000248599400006

The difference in heat island intensity was investigated under the four microenvironments, of: shed, no shed, beneath trees, and above vegetation. The graph of daily intensity changes plots as a hump-shaped curve, and the intensity at night shows as significantly higher than during daytime. The urban heat island intensity of the two vegetated microenvironments was lower by 0.27 degrees C compared with the site with no day shed. The urban heat island intensity in winter was approximately 2.5 degrees C and higher by 0.6 degrees C in summer. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the urban heat island intensity was closely related to surrounding industrial heat sources. The human comfort index -in Renmin Park registered as the highest, because of its tree canopy. The ability to improve the microclimate is limited in Xiliu Lake Park, where the greening type is mainly lawn. However, the railway station square had a 16% frequency for a high human comfort index, perhaps owing to open space and good air flow.																			2151-7614		978-1-4244-4713-8				2010																								WOS:000397260200067
J	Nettleton, S				Nettleton, Sarah			Cementing Relations within a Sporting Field: Fell Running in the English Lake District and the Acquisition of Existential Capital	CULTURAL SOCIOLOGY												This article presents findings from an ethnography of fell running in the English Lake District. A provocative concept - existential capital - is proposed to underscore the profits acquired from fell running as an embodied technique, and as a means of defining the shared passions within the field. These gains are acquired through corporeal techniques that require sustained physical effort, embodied vigilance, and knowledge of an environment that is topographically challenging and aesthetically arresting. The visceral pleasures intrinsic to existential capital are appreciated by those within the field and this, in turn, means that this solitary sport gives rise to an intense sociality that 'only a runner can understand'. Field analysis conventionally focuses on struggles; it is suggested here that a focus on what is shared allows us to understand how a field gains an identity. Thus the notion of existential capital highlights the field as passionately defined in ways that challenge the instrumentalism inherent to conventional modes of field analysis.																			1749-9755	1749-9763				JUN	2013	7	2			SI		196	210		10.1177/1749975512473749	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1749975512473749													WOS:000330312600006

However, little is known about the relative contribution of different forestry practices. We address this question using a paired-catchment study that distinguishes the effects of site preparation from the antecedent logging. Runoff water from three catchments, two harvested and one untreated control, was sampled biweekly during one year prior to logging, two years after logging, and three years after site preparation. The logging alone did not significantly increase the concentrations of either total or methyl-mercury in runoff, but export increased by 50-70% in one of the harvested catchments as a consequence of increased runoff volume. The combined effects of logging and site preparation increased total and methyl-mercury concentrations by 30-50% relative to preharvest conditions in both treated catchments. The more pronounced concentration effect after site preparation compared to logging could be related to site preparation being conducted during summer. This caused more soil disturbance than logging, which was done during winter with snow covering the ground. The results suggest that the cumulative impact of forest harvest on catchment mercury outputs depends on when and how forestry operations are implemented.

Hydrological evolution and chemical structure of a hyper-acidic spring-lake system on Whakaari/White Island, NZ	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					Fall Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union (AGU)	DEC 14-18, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Amer Geophys Union				White Island has a long and varied history of acid spring discharge and shallow ephemeral lake formation on its main crater floor. In the 12 months prior to the onset of the 1976-2000 eruptive episode, mass discharge from the spring system increased ca. 10-fold, pointing to a strong coupling of the hydrothermal environment to the evolving magmatic system. Between 1976 and 1978, the formation of numerous eruption vents to 200 m depth in the Westem Sub-crater abruptly changed the hydraulic gradients in the volcano, resulting in the reversal of groundwater flow in the massif towards the newly-formed crater(s). This affected not only the style of volcanic activity (leading to phreatic-phreatomagmatic-magmatic eruption cycles), but also led to the demise of the spring system, with discharge from the main crater declining by a factor > 100 by 1979. Eruptive activity ended shortly after a moderate Strombolian eruption in mid-2000, after which ephemeral lakes started to form in the eruption crater complex Between 2003 and 2015 there were three complete lake filling and evaporative cycles, reflecting varying heat flow through the conduit system beneath the lake. Over these cycles, lake water concentrations of Cl and SO4 varied between ca. 35-150 and 5-45 g/L respectively, with pH values temporally ranging from +1.5 to -1. Springs appeared on the Main Crater floor in 2004, and their discharges varied with lake level, pointing to the lake level being a primary control over the piezometric surface in the crater area. Springs closest to the crater complex show direct evidence of crater lake water infiltration into the crater floor aquifer, whereas distal spring discharges show compositional variations reflecting vertical displacement of the interface between shallow, dilute condensate and underlying acidic brine fluids. Source components for the spring fluids include magmatic vapour, dissolved andesitic host rocks, seawater and meteoric water. Lake waters, on the other hand, consist predominantly of magmatic vapour, meteoric water and solutes derived from host andesites and their altered derivatives. delta H-2 and delta O-18 signatures of the enclosing acid brine fluids, indicate they are predominantly seawater which have been affected by both vapour loss, but also mixing with arc-type vapour. An interesting finding of this study is that crater floor deformation correlates directly to both lake level and volatile emissions, in an apparent poroelastic response to the establishment of a hydrostatic water column in the eruption crater complex, and a net decrease in permeability owing to hydrothermal mineralization in the conduit (predominantly elemental sulfur and sulfate minerals). The hydrostatic pressurization of the vent environment also leads to increased gas pressures and flows through fumarolic channels, and consequent expansion of fitmarolic areas on the main crater floor. A period of unrest, which commenced in August 2012 and lasted until October 2013, included the extrusion of a small dome into the eruption crater complex. This activity, and related high heat flow, led once again to evaporation of the lake, and ongoing phreatic eruption activity which has provided interesting insights into the role which elemental sulfur, associated hydrothermal alteration minerals and of course water play in regulating pressures in the magmatic-hydrothermal environment.

However, several conflicting interpretations are evident within these studies and a comprehensive review of the topic is needed to reconcile them, and thus to provide an improved understanding of the history and forcing mechanisms of Holocene environmental changes within the region. Here we review the evidence for changes in climate (temperature, precipitation/moisture), vegetation and landscape attributes (glacier and eolian activity) on the TP during the Holocene. Our main conclusions are as follows. 1) The patterns of Holocene mean annual temperature change on the TP remain controversial; however, an early to middle Holocene summer temperature maximum is evident, which coincided with high summer insolation and a strengthening of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). This suggests that the summer land-sea thermal gradient, impacted by the temperature of the TP, may be an important factor driving orbital-scale ISM changes. 2) Lake-level records indicate an optimum in moisture conditions on the southwestern (SW) TP in the early Holocene, while on the northeastern (NE) TP the optimum occurred in the middle to late Holocene. This out-of-phase or anti-phased relationship may be linked to the role of the ISM in dominating precipitation on the SW TP, while the westerlies and East Asian summer monsoon dominated the precipitation on the NE TP. 3) Most of the lake-sediment-based stable isotope records (delta O-18 and leaf wax delta D) exhibit a pattern similar to that of stalagmite delta O-18 records from monsoonal Asia, reflecting the dominance of large-scale patterns of atmospheric circulation, rather than localized moisture changes reflected by lake level records. 4) A synthesis of pollen records reveals that the extent of forest was maximal in the mid-Holocene, while from the early Holocene onwards alpine steppe shrunk and alpine meadow and desert gradually expanded. 5) Evidence of glacier advance increased slightly during the early Holocene, decreased during the mid-Holocene, and then increased substantially after 3 Ica BP. 6) The integrated ages of eolian sand and loess from the NE TP reveal that eolian activity intensified during the early and late Holocene. Site inter-comparisons reveal that regional climate change played a major role in modulating changes in vegetation and other landscape attributes. Overall, producing Holocene climate reconstructions for the entire TP remains a major challenge even though much progress has been made. Further improvements in terms of the spatial coverage of high-resolution paleoclimatic records with robust chronological control, and a deeper understanding of the specific climatic significance of several climatic proxies, will facilitate an improved understanding of how the monsoon and the west-erlies interacted and their impacts on vegetation and landscape changes on the TP.

The Delft3D model examines four critical factors affecting water quality: flow velocity, stratification intensity, pollutant retention, and hypoxia occurrence. Seasonal simulations reveal significant stratification and hypoxia during the summer, caused by vertical density differences and the counterflow between surface and bottom layers. In contrast, winter conditions exhibit stronger circulation and reduced stratification. A vulnerability index is introduced to identify critical zones requiring targeted management. Key findings indicate that Zones M1 (northern Mankyeong section) and D1 (Dongjin section) are highly vulnerable due to stagnant hydrodynamics, prolonged residence times, and frequent hypoxia events exacerbated by salinity stratification. This study emphasizes the importance of optimizing sluice gate operations, particularly increasing seawater inflow frequency during periods of intensified stratification and adopting zone-targeted management interventions to mitigate hypoxia and improve water quality. These findings will provide valuable insights into reducing stratification and hypoxia periods in brackish waters like Saemangeum Lake and will raise awareness of the importance of hydraulic flow and aquatic environment management.

The lake is an important reference site and has been the subject of extensive ecosystem studies since the 1950s. Emphasis has been given to measuring long-term trends in the activity content of radioactive cesium in the brown trout (Salmo trutta) population. After ice-break in June 1986, the average total cesium activity content rose to 7000 Bq/kg wet weight. The activity content fell during 1987 and at ice-break in 1988 was 4000 Bq/kg. However, there was no further reduction during the summers of 1988 and 1989, possibly due to increased inputs from the catchment. There is considerable variation in the radiocesium activity content measured in individual fish. On the basis of the changes in cesium activity content in trout since 1986, an observed half-life for Cs-137 and Cs-134 in trout of 3.0 and 1.3 years, respectively, has been estimated.																			0265-931X						1991	14	3					181	191		10.1016/0265-931X(91)90027-D	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0265-931X(91)90027-D													WOS:A1991GE05800001

J	Frolova, LL; Sverdrup, AE				Frolova, Ludmila L.; Sverdrup, Anthony E.			The Monitoring of Nizhniy Kaban Lake by Rbcl Gene of Fresh Water Ater Organisms Using Next-Generation Sequencing.	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												The ecological state of the environment, including water bodies, is evaluated by different methods, one of which is bioindication. The method of bioindication is based on the study of the state of biota in natural conditions, the monitoring of the composition and the number of indicator species inhabiting the medium under study, the identification of which has been carried out by researchers visually, using microscopy methods. As an alternative, the paper considers a method for identifying hydrobionts in a water sample using the rbcL marker gene of freshwater organisms on the basis of modern sequencing methods. The results of the analysis are presented and the water quality of Nizhniy Kaban lake (Kazan, Russia) is estimated on the basis of DNA-barcoding by a next-generation sequencing method. The sequenced sequences of the fragment of the rbcL hydrobiont gene of fresh-water Lake Nizhniy Kaban in the autumn (2016) and summer (2017) sampling periods in the fastq format are included in the international database on the NCBI's website with unique numbers SRR7470969, SRR7459788 and SRR7463326. A comparative analysis of metagenomic data shows that the majority of the organisms of Lower Kaban Lake are grouped by the rbcL gene near the b-a mesosaprobic zone. Lower Kaban lake can be characterized as contaminated, transitional from b-mesosaprobic to a-mesosaprobic by water quality.

In order to gain deeper understanding of biological processes in Israel's freshwater ecosystems and to develop a bioindication system, species have to be known and characterised at all life stages. Here, we applied an integrative morphological and genetic approach to characterise caddisflies of the genus Hydropsyche Pictet, 1834 from the Lake Kinneret catchment. Seventeen sites in the Lake Kinneret catchment were sampled in spring/summer 2015 and 2016. For 77 hydropsychid larvae and two adult specimens of H. yahfufah Malicky, 2001, we analysed a 658bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene and compared the results of different genetic species delimitation methods to observed morphological variation. Our results suggest the presence of at least five species. This study is an important first step towards assessing stream biodiversity of a yet largely understudied region and highlights advantages of integrative taxonomic approaches.

Various image processing techniques were used to map surface features directly or indirectly related to former lake levels and groundwater tables for inferring conditions of the past climate. Special attention has been paid to the distribution of open water body, playa salt crust, waterlogged and salinized soils, and desert vegetation. With improved spatial resolution and more spectral bands, data acquired by ASTER sensor were explored to get additional information for discriminating these surface features. The compiled data indicate that Aiding Lake was a seasonal lake as early as in 1961. For the last 40 years, Aiding Lake has existed as a lake with open water only during the spring and early summer months. The size of the lake water body and timing and duration of the lake phase have varied year to year, suggesting that Aiding Lake is highly sensitive to climatic fluctuations and it is an ideal location for detecting possible impacts of global climatic changes.																			0277-786X		0-8194-4276-3				2001	4548						129	134		10.1117/12.441400	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.441400													WOS:000176403100025

In this study, we report a high-resolution dataset of daily monitored water levels from 1974 to 2010 in the YYL, which was used to elucidate annual and seasonal variations of the lake water level. These data are coupled to the stable isotope signals in the lake water and to a water balance model to provide an overall picture of factors and processes affecting the lake. The data revealed an annual average rate of 0.12 m per year lowering of the lake water level, but there was a relative increase in the summer and autumn seasons. It was found that a large amount of precipitation and low evaporation were primary reasons for increasing periods of the lake water level. The extensive glacier melting process driven by a sharp rise in temperature is another key factor for the increasing period between 1997 and 2004. The annual general water level decline before 1996 is attributed to the slow glacier melting rate and reduced precipitation, while a drastic decline of the water level after 2005 could be related to water leakage at the lake bottom, enhanced by a thawing of the permafrost. This process is driven by increasing soil temperatures and human activity. Finding out the causes of the YYL shrinkage trend provides vital implications for the management of water resources in the Tibetan plateau cold regions.

J	Madsen, TV; Olesen, B; Bagger, J				Madsen, TV; Olesen, B; Bagger, J			Carbon acquisition and carbon dynamics by aquatic isoetids	AQUATIC BOTANY												Isoetids are small, submerged vascular plants that often dominate the vegetation of soft-water lakes. The isoetids have short stiff leaves and large roots that might make up more than 50% of plant biomass. Leaves and roots have a system of internal gas spaces that allow efficient intra-plant gas transport and are the morphological basis for the remarkable use of sediment CO(2) in photosynthesis by isoetids. This ability allows the plants to exploit the rich CO(2) pool in the sediment of soft-water lakes and thereby partly ameliorate the low CO(2) availability in the bulk water. The transport Of CO(2) from roots to leaves is by diffusion in the lacunae. Diffusion is relatively slow over longer distances and appears to set an upper limit to the leaf-length of isoetids. Quantitatively, the use of sediment CO(2) accounts for most of the inorganic carbon assimilated by isoetids and only at very high CO(2) concentrations in the bulk water significant amounts are taken up through the leaf surface. Physiologically some of the isoetids are unique among submerged macrophytes by featuring the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM).,CAM in isoetids is considered a carbon conserving mechanism and is an ecological advantage in typical isoetid habitats. CAM allows the plants to take up CO(2) from the water at night when competition from other plants is eliminated and, since daytime CO(2) uptake is unaffected by CAM, the time-slot during which CAM-isoetids can assimilate inorganic carbon is expanded compared to non-CAM species. The unique morphological and physiological traits and adaptations of isoetids allow them to prosper under the conditions prevailing in soft-water lakes. Still, growth is restrained by low resource availability and by an inherent low capacity for growth. Isoetids grow throughout the year with higher rates in summer and lower in winter. Annual leaf turnover rates are low and correspond to a leaf lifetime as long as 700 days in some species. A close relationship between production and mortality of leaves results in a relatively constant biomass over the year with only slightly higher values in summer than winter. However, the small stature and low weight of isoetid plants only allow moderate standing biomass per ground area despite high plant densities and accordingly the low leaf turnover rates result in low annual primary production in isoetid populations.

Bernhart			Bioturbation in matgrounds at Lake Bogoria in the Kenya Rift Valley: implications for interpreting the heterogeneous early Cambrian seafloor	LETHAIA												Modern burrowing organisms feed on microbial organic matter in matgrounds near hot springs on the margins of Lake Bogoria, a saline alkaline lake in the Kenya Rift Valley. The burrowers produce a low-diversity trace assemblage similar to those produced by undermat miners during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. Despite obvious differences in body plans and phylogenetic affinities, these modern animals feed on microbes in similar ways to those inferred for primitive bilaterians. With increasing distance from hot-spring vents, outflow channels and adjacent matgrounds, the diversity and depth of the traces increase and mixgrounds become dominant. This modern extreme environment gives clues for interpreting the heterogeneous early Cambrian seafloor, with: (1) the restriction of 'pre-agronomic revolution' matground substrates; and (2) expansion of adjacent 'post-agronomic revolution' mixground areas.

The intertidal venting consists of a cluster of hot springs that occur a few meters offshore, with vent temperatures up to 62degreesC and a pH of 6.68. Two irregularly shaped patches of silica-carbonate hot spring deposits occur around the main intertidal vent areas. In addition, a fossil bed of silica-carbonate hot spring deposits of about 75 in long crops out along a cliff next to the active vent area. Both fossil and modem silica-carbonate deposits are finely laminated, and form columnar, bulbous and smooth undulating microstromatolites up to 10 cm thick. Noncrystalline opal-A is the only silica phase present in the modem and fossil hot spring deposits and occurs as microspheres up to 300 nm in diameter forming porous aggregates and irregular clusters, chains and spongy filament networks. The silica supersaturation state of the thermal fluid necessary for opal precipitation is achieved by cooling when it reaches the surface. The presence of preserved microbial remains (diatoms and possibly filamentous microbes) in both modem and fossil deposits reflects the biological activity around the hot springs. The biological activity constrains the fabrics and the textures of the deposit, and could mediate silica deposition. Calcite is the most abundant crystalline phase in the hot spring deposits and forms discontinuous horizons of subhedral bladed crystals within the silica aggregates. Calcite crystals are unusually enriched in C-13, With delta(13)C(V-PDB) values between +3.0parts per thousand and +9.3parts per thousand. The large C-13 enrichment is attributable to a geothermal CO2 degassing process, which yields calcite supersaturation. The delta(18)O(V-PDB) values in calcite, between -10.0parts per thousand and -6.6parts per thousand, indicate precipitation from a hot spring fluid that is a mixture of seawater and meteorically derived water. With the methods applied in this study, no indication of biogenic influence on calcite precipitation has been found. Minor amounts of barite occur in the fossil and modem hot spring deposits and precipitates when Ba2+-rich thermal water mixes with seawater. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Generally speaking, both the consumed water and the consumption structure reflect the quality and quantity of water resources and, implicitly, the economic potential of the region at issue. As for Braila Plain, here there is a paradox to be considered : even if the region is bordered by highly significant rivers (The Danube and Siret) with huge flows - not to mention here the salty water lakes or underground streams with a more or less drinking water - the need of drinking water becomes obvious mostly in summer and autumn. The climate, morphometric and lythological conditions confer certain peculiarities upon the waters resources of the northern-eastern Romanian Plain. One can say about the Braila Plain hydrographic network that it is poor and this is due to the discharge, situated under the value of 11/sqkm, but also to the very low relief energy. The allochthone rivers : the Danube, Siret, Buzau and Calmatui are affected by the refief climate conditions and also by the size and the geographic position of the hydrographic basins.					; Turtureanu, Anca/AAD-4718-2021	TURTUREANU, Anca - Gabriela/0000-0002-7370-5250; 															978-954-91818-1-4				2008							67	74																WOS:000275797200009
J	Bradbury, JP				Bradbury, JP			A diatom record of climate and hydrology for the past 200 ka from Owens Lake, California with comparison to other great basin records	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Diatoms from lake sediments beneath Owens Lake playa, Inyo County, California, document a nearly continuous paleolimnological record of climate and hydrologic change since the penultimate glacial-interglacial cycle based on a chronology established by radiocarbon, tephrochronology, and paleomagnetic control. Freshwater planktic diatoms (especially species of Stephanodiscus), plagioclase feldspar-rich sediments with high magnetic susceptibility, and Juniperus-type pollen characterized the penultimate glaciation at Owens Lake. Saline diatoms dominated in the following interglacial period, and there are several episodes during which freshwater planktic diatoms became abundant between 100 and 50 ka that may represent interstadial climatic conditions. Saline diatoms fell to low values after 50 ka, but warm-season Aulacoseira species indicate episodes of significant summer precipitation in the hydrologic balance of Owens Lake prior to the last glacial maximum. By 25 ka, glacial environments were again characterized by abundant Juniperus, plagioclase feldspar, and Stephanodiscus species. Generally arid Holocene climates were recorded in Owens Lake by short-term fluctuations of saline and freshwater diatoms, desiccation, and oolitic sediments barren of diatoms. Comparison to paleoclimate records both noah and south of Owens Lake suggest a southerly displacement of storm tracks originating from the Aleutian Low during glacial episodes.

Distributions of Cisco (Coregonus artedi) in the upper Great Lakes in the mid-twentieth century, when populations were in decline	PLOS ONE												The restoration of the once abundant Cisco (Coregonus artedi) is a management interest across the Laurentian Great Lakes. To inform the restoration, we (1) described historical distributions of Cisco and (2) explored whether non-indigenous Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax) and Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) played a role in the decline of Cisco populations across the upper Great Lakes (i.e., Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron). Our source data were collected from fishery-independent surveys conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's research vessel R/V Cisco in 1952-1962. By analyzing data collected by gill-net surveys, we confirmed the importance of embayment and shallow-water habitats to Cisco. We found that Cisco was abundant in Whitefish Bay and Keweenaw Bay, Lake Superior, and in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, but we also found a sign of Cisco extirpation in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Our results also showed that Ciscoes generally stayed in waters <80 m in bottom depth throughout the year. However, a substantial number of Ciscoes stayed in very deep waters (>150 m in bottom depth) in summer and fall in Lake Michigan, although we cannot exclude the possibility that these Ciscoes had hybridized with the other Coregonus species. By comparing complementary data collected from bottom-trawl surveys, we concluded that the spatiotemporal overlap between Rainbow Smelt and Cisco likely occurred across the upper Great Lakes throughout 1952-1962. These data were consistent with the hypothesis that Rainbow Smelt played a role in the decline of Cisco populations across the upper Great Lakes in the period. We also found that the spatiotemporal overlap between Alewife and Cisco likely occurred only in Saginaw Bay in fall 1956 and in Lake Michigan after 1960. Thus, any potential recovery of Cisco after the 1950s could have been inhibited by Alewife in Lakes Michigan and Huron.

In this study, nutrient transport under static conditions was simulated by using two ice thickness models in combination with an indoor freezing experiment under different segregation coefficient conditions for nutrients. A real-time prediction model for nutrient and pollutant concentrations in ice-covered lakes was established to explore the impact of the ice-on period in eutrophic shallow lakes. The results demonstrated that the empirical degree-day model and the high-resolution thermodynamic snow and sea-ice model (HIGHTSI) could both be used to simulate lake ice thickness. The empirical degree-day model performed better at predicting the maximum ice thickness (measured thickness 0.22-0.55 m; simulated thickness 0.48 m), whereas the HIGHTSI model was more accurate when estimating the mean thickness (5-6% error). When simulating ice growth, the HIGHTSI model considered more meteorological factors impacting ice cover ablation; hence, it performed better during the ablation stage relative to the empirical degree-day model. Two non-dynamic nutrient transport models were developed by combining the segregation coefficient model and the ice thickness prediction model. The HIGHTSI nutrient transport model can be used to predict real-time changes in nutrient concentrations under ice cover, and the degree-day model can be used to predict changes in the lake water ecosystem.

Assessing Angler Effort, Catch, and Harvest on a Spatially Complex, Multi-Lake Fishery in Middle Georgia	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Creel surveys are valuable tools in recreational fisheries management. However, multiple-impoundment fisheries of complex spatial structure can complicate survey designs and pose logistical challenges for management agencies. The Marben Public Fishing Area (PFA) in Mansfield, Georgia, is a multi-impoundment fishery with many access points, and these features prevent or complicate use of traditional on-site contact methods, such as standard roving or access-point designs, because many anglers may be missed during the survey process. Therefore, adaptation of a traditional survey method is often required for sampling this special case of multi-lake fisheries to develop an accurate fishery profile. Accordingly, a modified nonuniform probability roving creel survey was conducted at the Marben PFA during 2013 to estimate fishery characteristics relating to fishing effort, catch, and fish harvest. Monthly fishing effort averaged 7,523 angler-hours (SD=5,956) and ranged from 1,301 angler-hours (SD=562) in December to 21,856 angler-hours (SD=5,909) in May. A generalized linear mixed model was used to determine that angler catch and harvest rates were significantly higher in the spring and summer than in the other seasons but did not vary by fishing location. Our results demonstrate the utility of modifying existing creel methodology for monitoring small, spatially complex, intensely managed impoundments that support quality recreational fisheries; these results also provide a template for the assessment and management of similar regional fisheries.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2018	38	4					833	841		10.1002/nafm.10179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10179													WOS:000441706600006
J	Smith, KL; Jones, ML				Smith, KL; Jones, ML			Watershed-level sampling effort requirements for determining riverine fish species composition	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Accurate assessments of watershed-level species composition are necessary for comparative ecological studies, ecosystem health assessments, monitoring, and aquatic conservation prioritization. Several studies have addressed sampling effort requirements for characterizing fish species composition at a section of stream, but none have examined watershed-level requirements. In the spring and summer of 2002, we extensively sampled nine Great Lakes watersheds to assess sampling-effort requirements. Sampling requirements increased with the targeted percentage of estimated species richness. Sampling 15-119 randomly selected reaches of stream, stratified by stream order, was on average sufficient to detect 80%-100% of estimated species richness. Watershed size (km(2)) and estimated species richness each showed a weak, negative correlation with sampling-effort requirements in our study streams, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of -5.06 and -0.590, respectively. Because of among-watershed variability in sampling effort requirements, field crews should plot species accumulation curves onsite to determine adequate inventory completion. Based on the difficulty of detecting the last 10% of species, random sampling should be conducted in conjunction with targeted sampling of rare species.																			0706-652X					JUL	2005	62	7					1580	1588		10.1139/F05-098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F05-098													WOS:000231599300009
J	Decrouy, L; Vennemann, TW; Ariztegui, D				Decrouy, Laurent; Vennemann, Torsten Walter; Ariztegui, Daniel			Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca of ostracod valves from living species of Lake Geneva	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of living ostracods belonging to 15 different species and sampled monthly over a one year-cycle at five sites (2, 5, 13, 33, and 70 m water depths) in western Lake Geneva (Switzerland) are compared to the oxygen and carbon isotope compositions measured on the same samples as well as to the temperature and chemical composition of the water (delta O-18(H2O), delta C-13(DIC), Mg/Ca-H2O, and Sr/Ca-H2O) at the time of ostracod calcification. The results indicate that trace element incorporation varied at the species level, mainly because of the ecological and biological differences between the different species (life-cycle, (micro-)habitat preference, biomineralisation processes) and the control thereof on trace element incorporation of the ostracods. In littoral zones, the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca of ostracod valves increase as temperature and Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca of water increase during spring and summer, hence reflecting mainly seasonal variations. However, given that for Lake Geneva the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca of water also vary with temperature, it is not possible to distinguish the effects of temperature from those of changes in chemical composition of water on the trace element content in ostracod valves. Results support that both water temperature and water Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios control the final trace element content of Cyprididae valves. In contrast, the trace element content of species living in deeper zones of the basin is influenced by variations in the chemical composition of the pore water for the infaunal species. Trace element content measured for these specimens cannot, therefore, be used to reconstruct the compositions of the water lake bottom. In addition, incorporation of Mg and Sr into the shell differs from one family, sub-family, or even species to the other. This suggests that the distinctive Mg and Sr partition coefficients for the analysed taxa result from different valve calcification strategies that may be phylogenetic. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Heo, WM; Kim, B				Heo, WM; Kim, B			The effect of artificial destratification on phytoplankton in a reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The effects of artificial destratification on limnological conditions and on phytoplankton were surveyed for 6 years (1995-2000) in Lake Dalbang (South Korea), a water supply reservoir receiving nutrients from agricultural non-point sources. In order to reduce odor problems caused by cyanobacterial blooms, six aerators were installed in 1996 and operated regularly during the warm season. Aeration destratified the water column of the reservoir and produced homogeneous physical and chemical parameters. The maximum surface temperature in summer decreased from 28.9 degreesC before aeration to 20.0-26.4 degreesC after aeration, whereas the maximum hypolimnetic temperature increased from 8.0 to 17.0-23.7 degreesC. Despite these changes, surface water concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (CHLA) and their seasonal patterns did not change with destratification. Phosphorus loading was concentrated in heavy rain events during the summer monsoon, and TP and CHLA reached maximal concentrations in late summer after the monsoon. Because the hypolimnion was never anoxic prior to aeration, internal loading did not seem to be substantial. Cyanobacteria were the dominant phytoplankton in summer before aeration, but diatoms replaced them after operation of the aerator. Cyanobacteria blooms were eliminated. In contrast, total algal biomass in the water column (as CHLA integrated over depth) increased from 190 mg m(-2) in 1995 to 1150, 300, 170, and 355 mg m(-2) in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. The increased ratio of mixing depth to euphotic depth to 2.5 may have resulted in a net reduction in the amount of underwater irradiance experienced by phytoplankton cells, and this may have favored the switch to diatom dominance. Furthermore, the mixing may have allowed diatoms to flourish in summer by lowering their settling loss that would be critical in stratified water columns. In conclusion, the destratification in this reservoir was effective in preventing cyanobacteria blooms, but not in reducing the total algal standing crop.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2004	524	1					229	239		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000036142.74589.a4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000036142.74589.a4													WOS:000222941600016
J	JOHNSTON, CG; KIPPHUT, GW				JOHNSTON, CG; KIPPHUT, GW			MICROBIALLY MEDIATED MN(II) OXIDATION IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC ARCTIC LAKE	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Rates of oxidation of Mn(II) were measured by an in situ incubation technique in the water column of Toolik Lake, Alaska. Measurement rates were lower than those observed in other aquatic systems but were sufficient to oxidize all Mn(II) in the lake within a 3-month period. Measured rates compared favorably with rates estimated from a previous study of the geochemical cycling of Mn in Toolik Lake. The Mn(II) oxidation was largely microbially mediated, as indicated by inhibition of oxidation rates by sodium azide. Azide had been previously demonstrated to be a suitable microbial poison for studying Mn(II) oxidation in seawater. This study demonstrates that azide is also a suitable poison for freshwaters and that it inhibits microbial but not abiotic oxidation of Mn(II). Manganese(II) oxidation rates were similar during cold, under-ice conditions in early spring and during warmer summer conditions. This observation suggests that Mn(II) concentration, rather than temperature or oxygen concentration, is the most important factor regulating Mn(II) oxidation rates in Toolik Lake.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				JUN	1988	54	6					1440	1445		10.1128/AEM.54.6.1440-1445.1988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.54.6.1440-1445.1988								16347655					WOS:A1988N682800022
J	PETERS, EK				PETERS, EK			D-O-18 ENRICHED WATERS OF THE COAST RANGE MOUNTAINS, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - CONNATE AND ORE-FORMING FLUIDS	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												D and O-18 enriched waters of several weight percent salinity issue from hot and cold springs in Franciscan Complex and Great Valley Sequence rocks in the northern Coast Range Mountains of California. Although these waters have been described separately in the past and called ''metamorphic,'' ''connate,'' and ''serpentinizing fluids,'' this study shows that the hot and cold springs are all fed by one source of water-trapped Cretaceous seawater modified by a variety of reactions. The district is an example of the complexities of subsurface waters and their importance for our understanding of metamorphic fluid sources, oil-field waters, and ore transport problems. The subsurface waters have a range of deltaS-34 values, including some near marine sulfate values (+20 parts per thousand), and deltaC-13 near marine calcite values (0 parts per thousand). Strontium isotopic signatures in the spring waters are derived from the Great Valley Sequence (Sr-87/Sr-86 values near 0.705). The most saline spring pool is lined with serpentine phases found together as a fine white precipitate and has a pH of 11. One portion of the subsurface water is heated and reduced; it transports Au, Ag, Sb, As, and Hg to the surface (gold grades of the hot spring precipitates range from less than 1 ppm to over 10 ppm). These heated waters are chemically and isotopically similar to the fluids which formed Au mineralization at the nearby McLaughlin gold mine. The hot springs precipitate pyrite and native sulfur and are supersaturated with respect to calcite. Other springs are less saline and are oxidized, cooler, and diluted versions of the hot spring fluid. They do not carry ore metals but they are supersaturated with respect to silica and calcite. He-3/He-4 ratios of the springs gases are all above atmospheric values and indicate a possible magmatic component, consistent with the presence of Quaternary Clear Lake Volcanics. I-129 data yield a minimum age of 60-80 Ma for the source of the iodide in the waters, consistent with the connate nature of the source fluid (FEHN et al., 1992).																			0016-7037					MAR	1993	57	5					1093	1104		10.1016/0016-7037(93)90043-V	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(93)90043-V													WOS:A1993KR47300012
J	ARTS, MT; EVANS, MS				ARTS, MT; EVANS, MS			OPTICAL-DIGITAL MEASUREMENTS OF ENERGY RESERVES IN CALANOID COPEPODS - INTERSEGMENTAL DISTRIBUTION AND SEASONAL PATTERNS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We present a simple optical-digital method to measure visible energy reserves in calanoid copepods. Seasonal patterns (spring-fall) of triacylglycerol energy reserves in Diaptomus sicilis were determined in a hypereutrophic and in a saline prairie lake. In addition to optical measurement of energy reserves, two well-established chemical techniques (microgravimetric and Iatroscan TLC-FID analyses) were used over the same period. Seasonal patterns of visible energy reserves measured by the optical method were positively correlated with both the Iatroscan measurements of triacylglycerol (Pearson's r was between 0.72 and 0.87, P < 0.005) and the microgravimetric measurements of total lipid (r was between 0.73 and 0.88, P < 0.005). Thus, the optical method can be used to investigate seasonal changes in energy reserves in calanoid copepods but at a substantially lower cost (equipment, handling time) than chemical-based methods. Moreover, the optical method offers increased resolution because energy reserves can be measured for each animal so that individual feeding success can be assessed, provides data on the partitioning of lipids in various body regions, and is nondestructive because anesthetized animals can be measured and returned to culture. Patterns of storage lipid reabsorption within discrete body regions may predict starvation risk in culture and in natural populations of copepods.					; Arts, Michael/H-4973-2012; Evans, Marlene/NQC-4422-2025	Evans, Marlene/0000-0002-8869-1162; Arts, Michael/0000-0002-2335-4317; 													0024-3590					MAR	1991	36	2					289	298		10.4319/lo.1991.36.2.0289	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1991.36.2.0289													WOS:A1991FQ78700006

Such nonlinear behaviors constitute a major source of climate "surprises" with important socioeconomic and ecological implications. Paleorecords are key for elucidating patterns and mechanisms of nonlinear responses to radiative forcing, but their utility has been greatly limited by the paucity of quantitative temperature reconstructions. Here we present Holocene July temperature reconstructions on the basis of midge analysis of sediment cores from three Alaskan lakes. Results show that summer temperatures during 10,0005,500 calibrated years (cal) B.P. were generally lower than modern and that peak summer temperatures around 5,000 were followed by a decreasing trend toward the present. These patterns stand in stark contrast with the trend of precessional insolation, which decreased by similar to 10% from 10,000 y ago to the present. Cool summers before 5,500 cal B.P. coincided with extensive summer ice cover in the western Arctic Ocean, persistence of a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly La Nina-like conditions, and variation in the position of the Alaskan treeline. These results illustrate nonlinear responses of summer temperatures to Holocene insolation radiative forcing in the Alaskan sub-Arctic, possibly because of state changes in the Arctic Oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation and associated land-atmosphere-ocean feedbacks.																			0027-8424					NOV 29	2011	108	48					19299	19304		10.1073/pnas.1110913108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1110913108								22084085					WOS:000297463100044
J	Holen, DA				Holen, DA			The relative abundance of mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates in an oligotrophic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Between July and December 1998, mixotrophic ciliates ranged in concentration from 751 to 33,600 cells/L in a small oligotrophic lake in northeast PA. Mixotrophic ciliates, primarily oligotrichs, comprised on average 58 % of the total ciliate fauna and 88 % of the total ciliate biovolume during summer and fall. Stombidium viride appeared to be the dominant mixotroph. Average ciliate abundance did not change substantially during this time period. However in December, after lake turnover, only 5 % of all ciliates were mixotrophic, contributing 58 % of the total ciliate biovolume. The cell density of mixotrophic ciliates was not significantly correlated with Chl-a concentration. Grazing experiments conducted in August and October, using fluorescently labeled beads (0.5 mum diameter) indicated that mixotrophic ciliates removed 30.6 and 17.4 bacteria ciliate(-1) h(-1) and heterotrophic ciliates removed bacteria at a rate of 18.2 and 3.0 bacteria ciliate(-1)h(-1). Overall, the ciliates removed less than 1% of the bacterial standing stock per hour.

Quantifying groundwater dependence of a sub-polar lake cluster in Finland using an isotope mass balance approach	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												A stable isotope study of 67 kettle lakes and ponds situated on an esker aquifer (90 km(2)) in northern Finland was carried out to determine the role and extent of groundwater inflow in groundwater-dependent lakes. Distinct seasonal fluctuations in the delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of lakes are the result of seasonal ice cover prohibiting evaporation during the winter. An iterative isotope mass balance approach was used to calculate the inflow-to-evaporation ratios (I-TOT/E) of all 67 lakes during the summer of 2013 when the isotopic compositions of the lakes were approaching a steady-state. The balance calculations were carried out independently for H-2 and O-18 data. Since evaporation rates were derived independently of any mass balance considerations, it was possible to determine the total inflow (I-TOT) and mean turnover time (MTT) of the lakes. Furthermore, the groundwater seepage rates to all studied lakes were calculated. A quantitative measure was introduced for the dependence of a lake on groundwater (G index) that is defined as the percentage contribution of groundwater inflow to the total inflow of water to the given lake. The G index values of the lakes studied ranged from ca. 39 to 98%, revealing generally large groundwater dependency among the studied lakes. This study shows the effectiveness of applying an isotope mass balance approach to quantify the groundwater reliance of lakes situated in a relatively small area with similar climatic conditions.

However, differences in the reconstructed climatic history from various studies in this region still exist, probably due to influence of climatic proxies from multiple factors and the chronological uncertainties in lacustrine sediments. Here we present records of terrestrial plant delta C-13, soil color and total organic carbon content over the past 8400 years from a well-dated meadow section on the northeastern TP. The terrestrial plant delta C-13 value serves as a good summer precipitation/moisture indicator in the studied region. Soil color property and TOC content are also able to disentangle the moisture evolution history. All the data show much wet climates at 8400-7400 cal yr BP, dry climates at 7400-6000 cal yr BP and then wet conditions with fluctuation at 6000-3200 cal yr BP. Late Holocene moisture appears to be comparable with moist conditions from 6000 to 3200 cal yr BP. By further comparing the climatic variations in the Lake Qinghai area with records of the reconstructed summer temperature and the Asian Monsoon precipitation, we believe that the pattern of moisture/precipitation evolution in the Lake Qinghai area was not completely consistent with regions around Lake Qinghai, probably due to complicated interaction between the East Asian Summer Monsoon and the Indian Summer Monsoon.					; Wang, Zheng/I-8936-2014; Zhou, Xin/AIE-7442-2022; Li, Xiangzhong/I-8714-2014	Liu, Xiang-Jun/0000-0002-8413-2451; Zhou, Xin/0000-0003-2640-6431; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				FEB	2018	161						1	9		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2017.11.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2017.11.016													WOS:000424854000001

Interannual Variability of Cyanobacterial Blooms in Lake Erie	PLOS ONE												After a 20-year absence, severe cyanobacterial blooms have returned to Lake Erie in the last decade, in spite of negligible change in the annual load of total phosphorus (TP). Medium-spectral Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) imagery was used to quantify intensity of the cyanobacterial bloom for each year from 2002 to 2011. The blooms peaked in August or later, yet correlate to discharge (Q) and TP loads only for March through June. The influence of the spring TP load appears to have started in the late 1990 s, after Dreissenid mussels colonized the lake, as hindcasts prior to 1998 are inconsistent with the observed blooms. The total spring Q or TP load appears sufficient to predict bloom magnitude, permitting a seasonal forecast prior to the start of the bloom.

The dominant species were dinoflagellates, mainly Woloszynskia ordinata and Peridinium aciculiferum, during the entire spring of 1979. The long period of ice-cover (21 weeks) favoured the motile species, which were able to utilize the available light immediately below the ice. A considerable vertical migration was noticed in March 1979. These large and slow-growing algae were able to store luxury phoshorus, and surplus phosphorus concentrations up to 12 .mu.g P/l were measured, which corresponded to an algal content of 10 .mu.g P/mg C. These values were more than twice as high as those recorded earlier in Lake Erken. Although a spring outburst of diatoms did not occur in 1979 and 1980, the algae were phosphorus-limited in May, as indicated by high alkaline phosphatase activity, low algal surplus phosphorus content and high inorganic N:P ratios.																			0020-9309						1985	70	4					527	546		10.1002/iroh.19850700407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19850700407													WOS:A1985ATC2500006

Cold climatic conditions and growing ice-sheets during the last glaciation radically reduced forest extent in Europe to a restricted number of so-called "refugia", mostly located in the southern part of the continent. On the basis of paleobotanical analyses the Euganian Hills (Colli Euganei) in northeastern Italy have previously been proposed as one of the northernmost refugia of temperate trees (e.g. deciduous Quercus, Tilia, Ulmus, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer, Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Carpinus and Castanea) in Europe. In this study we provide the first quantitative, vegetation independent summer air temperature reconstruction for Northern Italy spanning the time similar to 31,000-17,000 cal yr BP, which covers the coldest periods of the last glacial, including the LGM and Heinrich stadials 1 to 3. Chironomids preserved in a lake sediment core from Lago della Costa (7m a.s.l.), a small lake at the south-eastern edge of the Euganean Hills, allowed quantitative reconstruction of Full and Late Glacial summer air temperatures using a combined Swiss Norwegian temperature inference model based on chironomid assemblages from 274 lakes. Chironomid and pollen evidence from Lago della Costa derives from finely stratified autochthonous organic gyttja sediments, which excludes major sediment mixing or reworking. After reconstructing paleotemperatures, we address the question whether climate conditions were warm enough to permit the local survival of temperate tree species during the LGM and whether local expansions and pollen inferred contractions of temperate tree taxa coincided with chironomid-inferred climatic changes. Our results suggest that chironomids at Lago della Costa have responded to major climatic fluctuations such as temperature decreases during the LGM and Heinrich stadials. The vegetation of the Euganean Hills shows responses to these climatic oscillations although the effects of temperature changes were probably also strongly influenced by changes in humidity. Reconstructed July air temperatures at Lago della Costa never fell below 10-13 degrees C (error range of reconstruction similar to +/- 1.5-1.6 degrees C), which is considerably above the limit considered necessary for forest growth (8-10 degrees C). Instead rather mild climatic conditions prevailed similar to 31,000-17,000 cal yr BP with average summer temperatures between similar to 12 and 16 degrees C, which most likely allowed survival of temperate tree taxa in the warmest (and moistest) microhabitats of the Euganean Hills during the LGM. Only assuming local survival is it possible to explain the repeated expansions and collapses of temperate trees at Lago della Costa which faithfully accompanied the climatic oscillations.

In the present study the littoral macrobenthic invertebrate communities of two alpine lakes placed in the same geograph-ical context (Upper and Lower Balma Lakes, Cottian Alps, Italy) were seasonally charac-terized, and the observed diversity was investigated in relation to site-specific abiotic fea-tures. During the ice-free period, two seasonal sampling campaigns (summer and autumn) were carried out at each lake along the littoral zones: macrobenthic invertebrate were col-lected and abiotic features (main physicochemical water parameters and main substrates) were monitored. PERMANOVA test disclosed significant differences in the invertebrate as-semblages between the lakes, and SIMPER test highlighted that the observed dissimilarity was mainly related to Oligochaeta and Chironomidae taxa. The application of the RDA and VPA showed that differences were mainly due to littoral substrate composition and nutri-ent concentrations (i.e., phosphorus and nitrates) which could heavily affect both the struc-tures and densities of the macrobenthic invertebrate communities in these environments. Findings from this study improve the knowledge about the macrobenthic invertebrate as-semblages in the western area of the European Alps, highlighting the role of site-specific factors in small scales studies, and the importance of detailed knowledge of their local variability. The better understanding of the variation patterns in regional/ subregional bio-diversity and their drivers are of pivotal importance and have implications in the decision of conservation policies.

J	Johnson, JH; Douglass, KA				Johnson, J. H.; Douglass, K. A.			Diurnal stream habitat use of juvenile Atlantic salmon, brown trout and rainbow trout in winter	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												P>The diurnal winter habitat of three species of juvenile salmonids was examined in a tributary of Skaneateles Lake, NY to compare habitat differences among species and to determine if species/age classes were selecting specific habitats. A total of 792 observations were made on the depth, velocity, substrate and cover (amount and type) used by sympatric subyearling Atlantic salmon, subyearling brown trout and subyearling and yearling rainbow trout. Subyearling Atlantic salmon occurred in shallower areas with faster velocities and less cover than the other salmonid groups. Subyearling salmon was also the only group associated with substrate of a size larger than the average size substrate in the study reach during both winters. Subyearling brown trout exhibited a preference for vegetative cover. Compared with available habitat, yearling rainbow trout were the most selective in their habitat use. All salmonid groups were associated with more substrate cover in 2002 under high flow conditions. Differences in the winter habitat use of these salmonid groups have important management implications in terms of both habitat protection and habitat enhancement.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				OCT	2009	16	5					352	359		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00680.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00680.x													WOS:000269730100002

Metal (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) concentrations were measured twice at 22 sites in Lakes St. Pierre and St. Louis, both in oxic sediments and in amphipods. Concentrations of free-metal ions at the sediment-water interface were estimated from lake water pH and sediment/water sorption equilibria. Multiple linear regression models forecasting trace metal (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) levels in amphipods were developed, using abiotic variables (sediment-bound metals, sediment organic carbon, free-metal ions, hydrogen ions, dissolved calcium; and dissolved organic carbon) and biotic (size class) variables. These models explained 73-81% of the observed variation, except in the case of Zn (68%) and Cu (61%), indicating that G. fasciatus is a promising biomonitor for Cd, Ni, and Pb in littoral environments. Seasonal patterns of amphipod contamination were identified for Fe, Ni, and Pb, summer concentrations being higher than those measured during the fall. Size-dependent variation in amphipod metal levels was found, smaller organisms being more contaminated than larger ones.

The alleged species status of these endemics has been re-assessed by means of an integrative approach combining molecular genetic taxonomy techniques with the traditional methods based on shell and soft body morphology. Phylogenetic reconstructions were made using both mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (ITS2) DNA markers. We used topotypic samples of both species and specimens sampled from other sites around Lake Baikal. The results demonstrate that the two endemic species are only synonyms of a widespread Holarctic species, Radix auricularia (Linnaeus, 1758), and represent its intraspecific morph (ecotype) adapted to living in thermal springs.

Based on a phenology transformation model, all of these spring phenological records were converted into the first blooming date of Amygdalus davidiana for A.D. 1741-1832. Then, a springtime temperature anomaly series for A.D. 1741-1832 was reconstructed based on modern (1951-1980) correlation between the first blooming date of A. davidiana and the mean springtime (March-May) temperature. The main results are as follows. (1) The spring phenological and temperature series for Beijing were successfully dated back to A.D. 1741. (2) A.D. 1790 was the turning point of the spring phenology change between 1741 and 1832; specifically, the average first blooming date of A. davidiana had advanced by 4.84 days compared to the present (A.D. 1951-1980), during 1741 to 1789, and was delayed by 0.14 days during 1790 to 1832. (3) The mean springtime temperature in A.D. 1741-1789 was about 0.48 degrees C warmer than the present (A.D. 1951-1980) in Beijing. (4) The annual-scale variation of the phenological series during A.D. 1790-1832 was greater than that in A.D. 1741-1789.					; Liu, Yang/HJZ-3633-2023	Liu, Yang/0000-0002-9647-6913; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				DEC	2017	37	15					5080	5088		10.1002/joc.5145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5145													WOS:000416905900008

The size distribution of the 1985 cohort was surveyed with bottom trawling before and after the winter commercial gillnet fishery, from 1985 till 1990. Ageing and reconstruction of individual growth was done, using opercular banes from fish collected during the surveys and scales sampled from the commercial gillnet catch. The reconstructed potential average size of the 1985 cohort showed that the size reached after five summers could have been 26.9 cm, whereas average length observed in the population was 25.3 cm. Correlations between population size and back-calculated size were highest for back-calculations for the previous year. When earlier back calculations were considered, the correlations became poor or even insignificant. These findings stress the large individual differences in growth history within a cohort and show that the size selective mortality of perch can only be proven over relatively short growth trajectories of less than one year.

However, global estimates of lake CH4 fluxes over the last 20 years exhibit widely different results ranging from 6 to 185 Tg CH4 yr(-1), which is to a large extent driven by differences in lake areas and thaw season lengths used. This has generated uncertainty regarding both lake fluxes and the global CH4 budget. This study constrains global lake water CH4 emissions by using new information on lake area and distribution and CH4 fluxes distinguished by major emission pathways; ecoclimatic lake type; satellite-derived ice-free emission period length; and diel- and temperature-related seasonal flux corrections. We produced gridded data sets at 0.25 degrees latitude x 0.25 degrees longitude spatial resolution, representing daily emission estimates over a full annual climatological cycle, appropriate for use in global CH4 budget estimates, climate and Earth System Models, bottom-up biogeochemical models, and top-down inverse model simulations. Global lake CH4 fluxes are 41.6 +/- 18.3 Tg CH4 yr(-1) with approximately 50% of the flux contributed by tropical/subtropical lakes. Strong temperature-dependent flux seasonality and satellite-derived freeze/thaw dynamics limit emissions at high latitudes. The primary emission pathway for global annual lake fluxes is ebullition (23.4 Tg) followed by diffusion (14.1 Tg), ice-out and spring water-column turnover (3.1 Tg), and fall water-column turnover (1.0 Tg). These results represent a major contribution to reconciling differences between bottom-up and top-town estimates of inland aquatic system emissions in the global CH4 budget.					du, jinyang/LZE-5392-2025	Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2022	127	7							e2022JG006793	10.1029/2022JG006793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JG006793								36250198					WOS:000834831800001

During the summer growing season, mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the ILWAS watersheds ranged from 21-32 mg C 1-1 in O/A horizon leachates, from 5-7 mg C 1-1 in B horizon leachates, from 2-4 mg C 1-1 in groundwater solutions, from 6-8 mg C 1-1 in first order streams, from 3-8 mg C 1-1 in lake inlets, and from 2-7 mg C 1-1 in lake outlets. During the winter, mean DOC concentrations dropped significantly in the upper soil profile. Soil solutions from mixed and coniferous stands contained as much as twice the DOC concentration of lysimeter samples from hardwood stands. Results of DOC fractionation analysis showed that hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids dominate the organic solute composition of natural waters in these watersheds. Charge balance and titration results indicated that the general acid-base characteristics of the dissolved humic mixture in these natural waters can be accounted for by a model organic acid having an average pKa of 3.85, an average charge density of 4-5 .mu.eg mg-1 C at ambient pH, and a total of 6-7 meq COOH per gram carbon.																			0016-7037	1872-9533					1985	49	8					1697	1705		10.1016/0016-7037(85)90140-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(85)90140-1													WOS:A1985APP1700002

Stands at Lake Duparquet (Quebec, Canada) were characterized as being deciduous, mixed-deciduous, mixed-coniferous, or coniferous, according to their conifer basal area percentage. Sampled fuel loads (litter, duff, woody debris, herbs, and shrubs) and local weather conditions (three different fire-risk classes) were used as inputs in the simulation. The predicted fire behavior variables were rate of spread (ROS), head fire intensity (HFI), and area burned. Results from ANOVA testing showed that both weather and vegetation are not always significant, and the two prediction systems qualitatively attribute the explained variance to these factors differently. The FBP System selects the weather factor as the most important factor for all fire behavior variables, whereas BEHAVE selects the vegetation factor. However, three research burns located in Ontario revealed that BEHAVE was not well adapted to the mixedwood boreal region, whereas FBP predictions were quantitatively close to observed prescribed values. Extreme fire weather is confirmed as producing large and intense fires, but differences in fire behavior among stand types exist across the full range of fire weather. Implications of climate change, vegetation, and seasonal effects on fire behavior and the forest mosaic are discussed.

J	Suriano, ZJ; Leathers, DJ				Suriano, Zachary J.; Leathers, Daniel J.			Spatio-temporal variability of Great Lakes basin snow cover ablation events	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												In the Great Lakes basin of North America, annual run-off is dominated by snowmelt. This snowmelt-induced run-off plays an important role within the hydrologic cycle of the basin, influencing soil moisture availability and driving the seasonal cycle of spring and summer lake levels. Despite this, relatively little is understood about the patterns and trends of snow ablation event frequency and magnitude within the Great Lakes basin. This study uses a gridded dataset of Canadian and United States surface snow depth observations to develop a regional climatology of snow ablation events from 1960 to 2009. An ablation event is defined as an interdiurnal snow depth decrease within an individual grid cell. A clear seasonal cycle in ablation event frequency exists within the basin and peak ablation event probability is latitudinally dependent. Most of the basin experiences peak ablation frequency in March, while the northern and southern regions of the basin experience respective peaks in April and February. An investigation into the interannual frequency of ablation events reveals ablation events significantly decrease within the northeastern and northwestern Lake Superior drainage basins and significantly increase within the eastern Lake Huron and Georgian Bay drainage basins. In the eastern Lake Huron and Georgian Bay drainage basins, larger ablation events are occurring more frequently, and a larger impact to the hydrology can be expected. Trends in ablation events are attributed primarily to changes in snowfall and snow depth across the region.					; Leathers, Daniel/A-3665-2010	Suriano, Zachary/0000-0001-7574-0191; Leathers, Daniel/0000-0001-9002-9031; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				NOV 15	2017	31	23					4229	4237		10.1002/hyp.11364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11364													WOS:000414389600014

Light penetration, the angular distribution of irradiance, and the spectral quality of underwater irradiance were quantified by measurements with a Secchi disk, quantum sensors, and a spectroradiometer. A partitioning of light absorbing and light scattering components is presented. Light attenuation was much higher in the bay than in the lake because of the elevated levels of light absorption and scattering that prevailed in the bay, associated with the higher concentrations of phytoplankton, gelbstoff, and perhaps tripton. The enrichment with these materials also caused disparate spectral attenuation characteristics between the bay and the lake that were manifested as strong differences in appearance. Calcium carbonate particles were an important component of light scattering in both systems in the early part of the study. This material had a particularly striking effect on the angular distribution of irradiance in the lake.																			0380-1330						1991	17	1					109	119		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71346-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71346-4													WOS:A1991FJ25400011

Between 7 February and 6 March 2012, the central ice region (22.6 km(2)) above the largest lake dropped by similar to 37 m followed by a further drop of 12 m in the following 29 days. This implies a subglacial water outflow, or jokulhlaup, of at least 1 km(3) at rates of hundreds of cubic meters per second. A comparable outflow occurred again between 23 July and 15 September 2019, with smaller outflows in the fall of 2014 and 2016. In contrast, a second smaller subglacial lake at a higher elevation had two subglacial outbursts of similar to 0.3 km(3) in 2012 and 2019 but the lake filling was gradual and not strongly seasonal or episodic. Water remained in both lakes after the outflows but this may not be the case for the third smallest and lowest subglacial lake. While there appears to be some hydrological link between the three lakes, the flux of water moving under the ice in this area appears to be larger than would be expected from local summer melt. However, the source of the excess water remains uncertain.					; Will, Kochtitzky/AAW-8532-2021	Copland, Luke/0000-0001-5374-2145; Dow, Christine/0000-0003-1346-2258; Gray, Laurence/0009-0009-9559-2697; Kochtitzky, William/0000-0001-9487-1509													0022-1430	1727-5652				APR 16	2024	70									10.1017/jog.2024.32	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2024.32		APR 2024											WOS:001216904300001

E.; Coppola, Giancarlo; Boxrucker, Jeff			Reservoir Fish Habitats: A Perspective on Coping with Climate Change	REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE & AQUACULTURE												Climate change is the defining environmental problem for our generation. The effects of climate change are increasingly evident and are anticipated to profoundly affect our ability to conserve fish habitats and fish assemblages. Reservoirs are important structures for coping with projected shifts in water supply, but they also provide refuge for riverine fishes and retain distinct fish assemblages that support diverse fisheries. The effects of climate change on reservoirs are unique among aquatic systems because reservoirs have distinctive habitat characteristics due to their terrestrial origin and strong linkage to catchments. This article reviews (1) the projected effects of rising temperature and shifting precipitation on reservoir fish habitats, and (2) adaptation strategies to cope with the anticipated effects. Climate warming impacts to reservoirs may include higher water temperatures and shifts in hydrology that can result in reduced water levels in summer and fall, altered water residence cycles, disconnection from upstream riverine habitats and backwaters, increased stratification, eutrophication, anoxia, and a general shift in biotic assemblages including plants, invertebrates, and fishes. What is needed to adapt to these changes is a perspective that focuses on maintaining ecosystem functionality rather than on retaining a certain species composition. To that end, various strategies organized into planning, monitoring, and managing compartments are identified.

However, generally, groundwater or surface water is assessed separately, and the differences among different water bodies are neglected. This study assessed the water quality and its influencing factors of different water bodies in the Daihai Lake Basin (a closed inland lake basin in a semi-arid region) by analysing the hydrochemical data of groundwater, and spring, river, and lake waters in the dry and wet seasons. The dominant hydrochemical type of groundwater (81.48%), spring water (80%), and river water (83.33%) was HCO3-Ca center dot Mg, while that of lake water was Cl-Na (100%). Groundwater, spring water, and river water were suitable for drinking and agricultural irrigation; however, the groundwater quality was worse in the wet season than in the dry season. Na+ and Cl- majorly affected the lake water quality. The mean NO3- concentration in groundwater was 28.39 mg/L, and its non-carcinogenic hazard quotient indicated that high risk areas were mainly distributed in Tiancheng and northern Maihutu. The hydrochemical compositions of groundwater, spring water, and river water were mainly influenced by rock (silicate and carbonate) weathering and cation exchange, and agricultural activities were the main sources of groundwater NO3-. Moreover, the lake hydrochemical composition was mainly affected by evaporation and halite dissolution. Thus, groundwater NO3- pollution and lake water salinisation should be prioritised. These findings provide a more thorough understanding of water quality and its influencing factors in the closed inland lake basin in the semi-arid region, and can be used to develop the protection of ecosystems and water resources management strategies in the Daihai Lake Basin.

Freshwater pulmonate (Radix swinhoei) is widespread and abundant in many eutrophic water bodies in Asia. Despite its key roles in eutrophic lake systems, the information on life history and population ecology of R. swinhoei is lacking, especially in ultra-eutrophic freshwater plateau lakes. Here, we conducted a 1-year survey of R. swinhoei with monthly collections to measure the life history traits (life span and growth), annual secondary production, and population size structure of R. swinhoei in nearshore regions with a high seasonally variation of nutrients in Lake Dianchi, a typic hypereutrophic plateau lake in Southwest China. Our results showed that R. swinhoei had the highest biomass in autumn and had the lowest in winter. Its maximum potential life span was 2.5 years, with three recruitment periods (November, March, and July) within a year. Its annual secondary production and P/B ratio were 137.19 g WW/m(2) and 16.05, respectively. Redundancy analysis showed that eutrophication-related environmental factors had weak correlations with population size structure of R. swinhoei. Our results suggested that R. swinhoei is a typical r-strategist with high secondary production and thrive in eutrophic environment. Our study can help better understand the mechanisms for widespread species to survive eutrophication and could also be relevant for biodiversity conservation and management of eutrophic ecosystems.					; yang, Jiali/AAH-3959-2020	Song, Zhuoyan/0000-0002-6056-8568; 													2045-7758					DEC	2022	12	12							e9631	10.1002/ece3.9631	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9631								36532136					WOS:000898339800001

Identification of watershed characteristics that mediate the effect of atmospheric nitrogen deposition can help evaluate the sensitivity of lakes to chronic and episodic nitrogen addition. Twenty four lakes in the southwestern portion of the Adirondack Park, New York, U.S.A., were classified into three N classes by cluster analysis of lakewater NO3-N concentration [N] during the summers of 1994-1996. The lake-N classes were best characterized as having (1) low [N] throughout the summer, (2) high [N] in early- but low [N] in late-summer, and (3) high [N] throughout the summer. The three lake-N classes were reconstructed perfectly by canonical discriminant analysis based mainly on lake average depth (AD), and lakewater concentrations of chlorophyll a [Chla] and SO4-S [S] in mid-summer. Increases in AD and [S], but decrease in [Chla] corresponded with a transition from low- to high-N classes.

J	KNAPTON, RW; PAULS, K				KNAPTON, RW; PAULS, K			FALL FOOD-HABITS OF AMERICAN WIGEON AT LONG POINT, LAKE ERIE, ONTARIO	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We studied food habits of an abundant migrant, the American wigeon (Anas americana), staging during the 1991 fall migration at Long Point, a World Biosphere Reserve and a Ramsar site on the north shore of Lake Erie. Food samples from 149 wigeons were analyzed; stems and leaves of aquatic plants (predominantly submerged macrophytes) comprised over 92% aggregate dry mass of the diet, seeds made up 7.8%, and animal matter 0.6%. A diverse array of plant species was identified; however, results indicate that wigeons were showing selectivity in plant species consumed. Stems and leaves of muskgrass (Chara spp.), elodea (Elodea canadensis) and bushy pondweeds (Najas flexilus and N. guadalupensis) (aggregate percent dry mass 37%, 22%, and 18% for proventriculi, and 15%, 12%, and 38% for gizzards, respectively) comprised the bulk of the diet, although neither bushy pondweed nor elodea wholly dominated submerged macrophyte communities. Several submerged macrophytes, such as coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum) and pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.) which are common and widespread at Long Point and reported frequently as important in the diet of American wigeons elsewhere, were not found at all or only in trace amounts. Some sex, age, and seasonal differences in diet were detected, Chara spp. and tubers were eaten more frequently by adults than by immatures, Elodea canadensis was eaten in late fall by females but not by males, immatures ate Myriophyllum spicatum seeds more frequently than did adults, and Najas spp. was consumed more in late fall than in early fall.																			0380-1330						1994	20	1					271	276		10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71146-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71146-1													WOS:A1994NL34800021

Studies have shown that inland lakes are mostly supersaturated in CO2, 2 , making them significant sources to the atmosphere. However, estimating CO2 2 fluxes from inland lakes is still challenging due to large variations in surface water CO2 2 partial pressure (pCO2). p CO 2 ). Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is widely found in aquatic ecosystems, especially in shallow lakes. However, their role in lake- wide carbonate chemistry has not been thoroughly investigated. Accurately measuring air-water CO2 2 exchange and understanding the environmental factors that control these fluxes in vegetated ecosystems are essential for reducing uncertainties in global CO2 2 emission estimates. In this study, high-resolution (3-h interval) field measurements were made along the nearshore of eastern Lake Taihu during the SAV growing seasons to examine their effects on surface water p CO 2 and air-water exchange. Our results showed evident daily variations in water chemistry and air-water fluxes. Daytime air-water CO2 2 exchange switched from sinks in summer to sources in autumn. The vegetation sites were observed to be strong CO2 2 sources consistently at night. The density of aquatic vegetation was found to be positively correlated with the daily range of p CO 2 , highlighting their role in regulating surface water carbonate chemistry. Negative correlations were found between water depth and surface p CO 2 . These results highlight the importance of aquatic vegetation and daily variations in reducing uncertainties in carbon budgets of shallow aquatic systems.

Temporally-displaced Mississippi River spring flood pulse shows muted aquatic ecosystem response in estuarine waters: A climate change warning for coastal foodwebs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Mississippi River water levels typically rise in the early spring after snow melt in the extensive watershed. However, in 2016, warm air temperatures coupled with high precipitation led to a historically early river flood pulse, resulting in the opening of a flood release valve (Bonnet Carre Spillway) in early January to protect the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. The goal of this research was to determine the ecosystem response of this wintertime nutrient flood pulse on the receiving estuarine system and compare it to historical opening responses, which are generally several months later. Nutrients, TSS, and Chl a were measured along a 30 km transect in the Lake Pontchartrain estuary, before, during, and after the river di-version event. In the past, NOx concentrations were quickly reduced to below detection in the estuary in <4 weeks post -event accompanied by a moderate phytoplankton bloom. However, due to seasonal limitations (cold water temperatures and light limitation) during the 2016 event, NOx remained elevated for >2 months post-closure and Chl a values were low, indicating limited assimilation of nutrients into phytoplankton biomass. Consequently, much of the bioavailable nitrogen was denitrified by sediments and dispersed to the coastal ocean over time, limiting the transfer of nutrients into the food web by means of a spring phytoplankton bloom. An increasing warming trend in temperate and polar river watersheds is leading to earlier spring flood pulses, altering the timing of coastal nutrient transport, decoupled from conditions supporting primary production, which could significantly affect coastal food webs.					; Sapkota, Yadav/AAQ-6253-2020; White, John/A-7940-2008; White, John R./A-7940-2008	Sapkota, Yadav/0000-0003-2222-3435; White, John R./0000-0002-9967-013X													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 20	2023	874								162623	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162623		MAR 2023						36871708					WOS:000955003400001

Winter's paintings existed at the intersection of competing colonial discourses. Like many "Indian painters" of his time, Winter believed he was capturing the final images of a vanishing race. At the same time, Winter's work runs counters to the imagery of "nakedness" and "savagery" that characterize many Anglo-American paintings of Native Americans during this period. By holding these visual sources in "productive tension" (Stahl 2001:15-16) with documentary and archaeological sources, the role dress played in the construction of identity by members of Great Lakes fur trade society during the 19th century can be unraveled.

Monthly samples of Cuban bulrush were harvested from five plots from May 2019 to April 2021. During each sampling event, water pH, water temperature, air temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were recorded. Average peak total biomass was 309.0 g DW m(- 2), 290.0 g DW m(- 2), and 129.3 g DW m(- 2) in 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively and usually occurred in late fall or early winter months (November to January). Biomass allocation was greatest for submersed tissues and least for inflorescences. Total, emergent, and sub-mersed biomass had weak negative correlations with water temperature and PAR. Peak total starch content occurred from August to December and was measured at 3.7% DW, 3.2% DW, and 1.3% DW for 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. Overall, starch was not disproportionately stored in any one tissue, < 1.5% DW for all plant tissues. Since peak biomass occurred during the coldest months of the study, it suggests the capability of this species to expand northward. Future work should include wider spatial or geographic variation in sampling strategy and incorporate growing degree days (GDD) analysis to enhance the understanding of the relationships between life stages and environmental factors.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				MAY	2023	186								103627	10.1016/j.aquabot.2023.103627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2023.103627		JAN 2023											WOS:000924789600001

Seasonality of rainfall in the Lake Victoria Basin is controlled by the large-scale circulation	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Despite relatively constant surface temperatures, seasonally-varying rainfall in the Lake Victoria Basin is approximately bimodal with maxima during the equinoctial seasons. Rainfall amounts are lower during boreal winter, and boreal summer is dry. Explanations of this seasonality involving movement of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) are incorrect since the ITCZ, characterized by low-level meridional moisture convergence, is not identifiable over the Lake Victoria Basin. The ERA5 reanalysis is evaluated and used to understand the seasonality of Lake Victoria Basin precipitation, including the influence of land/lake mesoscale circulations and local topography. A consideration of diurnal time scales is included since averaging over the region's pronounced diurnal cycles obscures physical processes. The unique features of the Lake Victoria Basin precipitation and the large-scale connections that determine its seasonality are evaluated. Seasonal variations in the continental-scale geopotential height field and the seasonal formation and breakdown of the Somali jet provide a large-scale framework for understanding the region's seasonality. Interactions with mesoscale hydrodynamics associated with lake/land circulations and orographic flow superimpose to provide a more complete understanding.

Previous studies in the Qaidam Basin have advanced our knowledge of the paleoclimate over glacial to interglacial cycles. However, our understanding of the paleoclimatic sensitivity of the Qaidam Basin to the relative strength of these two climatic driving forces remains limited due to the lack of regional paleoclimatic reconstructions. The Qaidam Basin is proposed as a regional and global eolian dust source during the glacial periods, during which a cold, dry climate is associated with the equatorward shift of the jet stream. On the contrary, paleoshoreline records suggest that a highstand lake stage prevailed in late Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) and lasted until 15 ka. To address this conundrum, we have applied an integrated approach to reconstructing the regional paleoclimatic history by combining compound-specific isotope analysis, lake temperature reconstruction, and numerical modeling. Our results show varying paleoclimate associated with the dynamic climate boundary since 45 ka: (1) a wet climate during late MIS 3, when the Asian summer monsoons are strengthened under high summer insolation and penetrate further into Central Asia; (2) a general cold, dry but wetter than at present climate in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), when the Asian summer monsoons retreat and the Westerlies become dominant; and (3) three short periods of extreme aridity corresponding to the Younger Dryas and Heinrich 2 and 4 events, when the normal moisture transport via the Westerlies and Asian summer monsoons is interrupted. The numerical modeling supports an increase in the effective precipitation during the LGM due to reduced evaporation under low summer insolation. These results suggest that the Westerlies and Asian summer monsoons alternately controlled the climate in the Qaidam Basin in response to precessional forcing during the late Pleistocene.

J	Mayer, M; Natusch, D; Frank, S				Mayer, Martin; Natusch, Daniel; Frank, Shane			Water body type and group size affect the flight initiation distance of European waterbirds	PLOS ONE												Human encroachment on nature grows constantly, increasing human-wildlife interactions. Flight initiation distance (FID, the distance at which animals flee from an approaching threat) is often used to measure antipredator behaviour and establish buffer zones to reduce human impact on wildlife. In this study, we approached 10 waterbird species on larger lakes and narrower rivers using a motorboat. We investigated whether water body type, season (winter/spring), approach starting distance, species body mass, and group size influenced bird FID. Average bird FID was 145 +/- 92 m and differed between species. In general, FID of all species was larger on lakes than rivers and increased with increasing group size and approach starting distance. When analysed separately for the two most common species, common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), FID increased with increasing starting distance on rivers, but not lakes, likely because birds on lakes have enough time to evaluate the approaching object and take flight at great distance. Additionally, birds might perform different activities on lakes versus rivers, leading to varying energetic trade-offs between the two habitat types, which may affect the decision when to take flight. Finally, mallards aggregated in larger groups on lakes, which affected FID, likely due to enhanced visibility (i.e., earlier detection of the approaching boat) and detection probability (via increased group size) on lakes. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for habitat characteristics, such as water body type, when studying waterbird FID, because they can affect the visibility of stimuli, group size and potentially animal behaviour, factors which should be taken into account when planning buffer zones for waterbirds in conservation areas.

The objectives of this investigation were to describe winter surface circulation in the bay and document ice distribution patterns for predicting where additional ice might be transported if it forms. Landsat MSS bands 5 and 7 and RBV imagery with 70% cloud cover or less, taken between Nov. 1 and April 30 each year from 1972-1980, were analyzed. Surface circulation patterns inferred from suspended sediment patterns and ice distribution and movement were observed and mapped from the Landsat imagery. The generalized circulation patterns indicate that any additional ice formed due to future increased winter discharge from Bradley River would be likely to accumulate along Homer Spit and to be blown into the outer bay by the dominant northerly winter winds.																			0034-4257	1879-0704					1982	12	5					421	435		10.1016/0034-4257(82)90017-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(82)90017-7													WOS:A1982PN85100007

The nexus approach was institutionalized in two projects using the location specific case study of Beppu, Japan where a set of interconnected issues in using geothermal hot spring resources have emerged due to the promotion of geothermal energy development under low-carbon policies at global and national levels. The interlinkages among geothermal hot spring resources, including heat, steam, nutrients, and drainage between land and coastal systems were analyzed to improve decision- and policy-making. This study discusses (1) how different discipline-oriented methods and data are integrated, (2) how much of the targeted water-energy-food nexus systems are understood using the nexus approach, and (3) how far does the nexus approach influence changes in the policy agenda and human behavior regarding sustainable geothermal hot spring resources use. The nexus approach facilitated the sequential integration of individual methods and data to better explain the causal linkages focusing on water-energy-food resources in the human-nature systems in Beppu. The proposed policy recommendations are based on the local government initiative for continuing to conduct citizen participatory surveys on geothermal hot spring resources. Transferring the developed methodology will help to effectively develop geothermal hot spring resources and compliment the current national renewable energy and natural resource policies and management.

Effectiveness of Submerged Vanes for Stabilizing Streamside Bluffs	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING												The effectiveness of submerged vanes for stabilizing streamside bluffs varied over a 10-year monitoring period in a tributary to Lake Superior, United States. Submerged vanes are a river training device used to divert river flows away from eroding banks along meander bends and ultimately hold constant or reverse the direction of lateral migration. At the study site, the relatively steep slope, large substrate size, and flashy flow regime pushed the upper end of the design limitations of submerged vanes. Changes in channel location and morphology due to the vanes were monitored using repeat channel cross-section surveys along a 110-m reach. The vanes experienced 15 floods over the monitoring period. The two most damaging floods happened in the summer and fall of 2005 with annual exceedance probabilities of 7% and 6% respectively. A new data analysis method for rivers, using centroids of cross sections, was useful to track channel migration rapidly and objectively and, along with calculations of changes in bankfull channel size, provide metrics to describe channel change.

Genetic analysis and uncertain taxonomic status of threatened Foskett Spring speckled dace	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Foskett Spring is a small isolated desert spring in the Warner Basin of Oregon containing an undescribed subspecies of speckled dace protected under the US Endangered Species Act. Uncertainty regarding the taxonomic status of Foskett dace has raised questions about their evolutionary relationship to other more abundant populations in the Warner Basin. To address these questions, we sequenced 1,982 base pairs (bp) of the ND2 and cyt-b genes of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) for 85 fish from Foskett Spring, the surrounding Warner Basin, and the adjacent Goose Lake Basin. We observed 58 unique mtDNA haplotypes defined by 96 bp substitutions in both genes. MtDNA sequences were highly divergent and reciprocally monophyletic between dace from the Warner and Goose Lake Basins, with sequence divergences (5 and 3% at ND2 and cyt-b, respectively) in the range usually observed between fish species. In contrast, mean sequence divergence between Foskett dace and other Warner Basin populations was less than 1%, with no evidence of reciprocal monophyly among mtDNA lineages. These results indicate that Foskett dace and other populations in the Warner Basin are approximately equally diverged from one another evolutionarily, suggesting similar times of divergence since the late Pleistocene. We believe further studies are needed to determine if rapid evolution of novel traits have occurred in dace inhabiting the unique ecological setting of Foskett Spring during the past 10,000 years.																			1566-0621	1572-9737				JUN	2010	11	4					1299	1315		10.1007/s10592-009-9959-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-009-9959-0													WOS:000278899500006

Appearance of 0+ salmon and trout in summer seine net catches indicated early downstream movement of fry from inlet streams to lake inshore areas which also provided nursery habitat for older age classes. Total trap records of salmon and sea trout smelts migrating from Burrishoole catchment since 1970 were used to provide one of the first published estimates of smelt production from a lacustrine catchment in temperate Europe. Trout and salmon smelt output from Burrishoole was shown to have declined by about 50% since records began. Current levels of production are estimated at about 4 sea trout smolts ha(-1) (0.4 kg ha(-1)) and about 13 salmon smelts ha(-1) (0.3 kg ha(-1)).

J	Jacquet, S				Jacquet, Stephan			Are warm temperatures the key factor to prevent winter swarms of Hemimysis anomala in peri-alpine lakes?	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												The invasive bloody red mysid, Hemimysis anomala, has recently colonised peri-alpine lakes in Western Europe. During the last decade, scuba divers have regularly reported observations of substantial winter swarms of this animal in Lakes Bourget (France) and Geneva (Switzerland-France). During the last four years, we have regularly dived and observed such phenomena in a variety of habitats, revealing thousands to millions of individuals during the period between December and March, with maximal densities occurring in the water column and small open wrecks in January or February. Surprisingly, however, no swarm was observed during the winters of 2022-2023. This led to the hypothesis that temperature could be the main direct or indirect factor responsible for this lower abundance, resulting in the absence of significant gatherings. Some possible explanations are discussed.																			1961-9502					MAY 29	2023		424							14	10.1051/kmae/2023008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2023008													WOS:000996803600001

The bimodal seasonal plankton distribution, typical at Chicago, still occurs. There has been a shift in seasonal periodicity with spring peaks occurring in March from 1957-1976 instead of May-June as previously reported for 1937-1956. An optimum temperature of 10.degree. C for the plankton community was observed between 1936-1956, but for the last 20 yr an optimum temperature range from 0-4.degree. C was observed. This change in optimum temperature of the plankton community is related to a change in the abundance of the genera Asterionella, Fragilaria, Stephanodiscus and Tabellaria. Asterionella and Fragilaria were the dominant spring plankton with maximum standing crops observed around 10.degree. C prior to 1956. Stephanodiscus first increased significantly in 1957 and was the dominant spring plankter through 1976. More recently (1972-1976) blue-green algae have increased in numbers. Differences in apparent temperature optima reported are real and are caused by the emergence of cold water species of Stephanodiscus as the dominant spring plankter from 1957-1976.																									1979	36	10					1169	1173		10.1139/f79-168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f79-168													WOS:A1979HQ54700001

Lake Jinghu was sampled for zooplankton and water chemistry at 3 or 4-day intervals over a year, and samples of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus were obtained at 8-day intervals and clonally cultured in the laboratory. We found that B. calyciflorus occurred in winter and spring, and was a species complex composed of cryptic species BcI and BcII based on mtDNACOI sequence divergence and the GMYC model analyses. Both cryptic species cohabited in Lake Jinghu when they were present. The densities of BcI and BcII were not correlated, indicating that there might be no strong competition between them. Based on principal component analysis (PCA) and generalized linear models (GLM), only BcII density was impacted by chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration (of the lake water filtered through a 25 mm net) alone with a time lag, and the interaction of temperature and Chl a concentration without a time lag. Our results suggest that a distinct response to Chl a reduces the intensity of competition between cryptic B. calyciflorus species and promotes their coexistence in Lake Jinghu over time.

The total carbon content of the Takashima-oki core is an indirect proxy for the East Asian summer monsoon, because the total carbon content reflects primary productivity within the lake, which is controlled by precipitation in the catchment area. Using these data, we clarify temporal variations in the East Asian summer monsoon prior to MIS 5, which were previously unresolved. The observed variations show a -1,500-year cycle that is also recorded by paleoclimate indices in the North Atlantic region. We propose that the East Asian summer monsoon underwent abrupt millennium-scale changes during interglacial stages such as MIS 5 and 7.																			0943-0105					AUG	2007	52	8					1607	1616		10.1007/s00254-006-0606-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-006-0606-5													WOS:000248135700016

The ducks fed overwhelmingly on the dominant bivalve found in each of the two lagoons, the mussel Musculista senhousia in L. Nakaumi and the clam Corbicula japonica in L. Shinji. In general, however, the ducks probably preferred the mussels to the clams because of: (i) their high (2.9 times) calorific content for their weight; (ii) their high digestibility; (iii) their greater accessibility; and (iv) their shorter handling time. An average tufted duck (850 g) was estimated to require 1.3 kg of mussels or 3.8 kg of clams to meet their daily energy requirements. As a result, the two wintering populations were estimated to consume 4970 t mussels and 4770 t clams during a single wintering season, amounting to some 20% of the standing clam crop. Throughout the winter the average gizzard weight (37 g), and gizzard-body mass ratio (4.2%) of the Lake Nakaumi population were half those of the Lake Shinji population (73 g, 8.1%, respectively), despite their significantly similar nutritive body condition (% body lipid > 12%). The need to maintain a specialized gizzard mass in order to be able to cope with the different prey species results in little opportunity for 'sampling' movements of birds between lakes/prey types and as a result two subpopulations of ducks are indicated to be segregated.

J	Renaut, RW; Jones, B; Tiercelin, JJ				Renaut, RW; Jones, B; Tiercelin, JJ			Rapid in situ silicification of microbes at Loburu hot springs, Lake Bogoria, Kenya Rift Valley	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Microbial mats, located along the margins of hot-spring pools and outflow channels at Lake Bogoria, Kenya, are commonly silicified forming friable laminated crusts. Columnar microstromatolites composed of silica and calcite are also forming at several springs in sites of oscillating water level or spray. Silicification of the microbes involves impregnation of organic tissue by very fine amorphous silica particles and encrustation by small (< 2 mu m) silica spheroids. Rapid silicification of the microbes, which may begin while some are still alive, can preserve sheaths and in some examples, the filaments, capsules and cells. Although this provides evidence of their general morphology, the biological features that are required for taxonomic identifications are commonly poorly preserved. The silica precipitation results mainly from evaporative concentration and rapid cooling of spring waters that have been drawn upward through the mats and microstromatolites by capillary processes. Almost all the silica at the Loburu springs nucleates on microbial substrates. This affinity of silica for functional groups on microbial surfaces contributes to the rapid silicification of the microbes and their preservation in modern and ancient cherts.

Differentiation between two types of acid events is made related to origin; one is caused by heavy rains and the other associated with snowmelt during winter and spring. Acid events are due to incomplete mixing between lake and inflow water. Both mixing forces like wind and density differences are important factors regulating the actual stratification. As observed in the lakes studied, stratification therefore occurs during periods of ice-cover when wind-induced mixing is impeded and generally results in an acidic surface water of varying depth. However, in this study we also described the stratification of acidic inflow water at the sediment-water interface. This type of inlayering is presumably less frequent as a complex set of conditions must be satisfied for its occurrence. Our study shows that acid events may cause temporal and spatial water chemistry changes even in lakes and streams with relatively high pH and buffer capacity. Thus, early biotic damages can be expected in neutral and limed (soft water) lakes.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	1987	32	3-4					341	362																WOS:A1987G359600007

The annual input of S roughly balances the output, the average S flux being about 1.6 g S .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1. The average dry deposition was estimated to be about 0.4 g S .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1. For good agreement between calculated and observed S concentrations, it was necessary to introduce a reduction (or adsorption) process for SO42- in deeper soil layers during summer and fall. During dry periods, SO42- is produced by oxidation in the upper soil layer. The SO42- concentrations in streamwater during snowmelt are remarkably constant. According to model results this could be explained by the existence of a reservoir of easily soluble S in the soil considerably larger than the annual S flux. The basic structure of the models applied to the Ontario stream and to 2 streams in Norway was the same. It seems likely, therefore, that the model may, with moderate modifications, be applicable to many catchments.

J	ELLISEVANS, JC				ELLISEVANS, JC			METHANE IN MARITIME ANTARCTIC FRESH-WATER LAKES	POLAR BIOLOGY												Methane occurred in all freshwater lakes, irrespective of trophic status, sampled during this preliminary investigation at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands. Antarctica. Methane accumulated in the water column of these lakes during the winter period when ice cover prevented wind-induced mixing. Maritime Antarctic lakes are usually subject to wind-induced complete mixing during the summer open-water period but 2 major exceptions were found. Methanogenesis occurred in littoral and profundal regions of oligotrophic Sombre Lake. The presence of a substantial algal mat stabilized the Eh status of underlying sediments at the littoral site. Methane production was confined to the sediments in both littoral and profundal sediments during the study period (Dec.-March) but in winter probably migrated to the sediment surface at the profundal site. All Signy Island lakes sampled were sulfate-poor and addition of sulfate markedly inhibited methanogenesis. Radio-isotope studies indicated that the H2/CO2 pathway was probably the predominant route for methanogenesis in these sediments through the acetate pathway appeared equally important at the sediment surface. In the absence of sulfate, sulfate reducers probably acted as net hydrogen donors to the methanogens. The process rate was permanently limited by the consistent low temperature (annual range 1.degree.-3.degree. C). Rates increased with increasing temperature over the range 4.degree.-32.degree. C, but no evidence was found to suggest cold sensitivity or psychrophily. The optimum temperature for methanogenesis was > 30.degree. C, temperatures never experienced at Signy Island. Rates of methanogenesis during the study period (Dec.-Mar.) ranged from 0.29-0.45 mg of C m-2 and on an annual basis methanogenesis was calculated equivalent to 13% of the organic C deposition rate.																			0722-4060	1432-2056					1984	3	2					63	71		10.1007/BF00258149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00258149													WOS:A1984SY17000001

It transports moisture and heat from the ocean to mid- and low-latitude regions, which influence their climate and ecology. Under the influence of the Asian summer monsoon, temperature and precipitation in East Asia vary synchronously on the seasonal scale; however, this relationship was decoupled on the decadal scale over the past century, and on millennial or even longer time scales. In the context of the "Holocene temperature conundrum" and seasonal temperature reconstructions, the relationship between temperature and precipitation variations in the ISM region during the Holocene has been found to be increasingly complex. This study focuses on Yangying Co on Haizi Mountain, on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. We obtained a high-quality, 475-cm-long, continuous sediment core (Yangying Co 2022B) from the lake center, which was dated using analyses of Cs-137, Pb-210, and AMS C-14. After evaluating the carbon reservoir effect, a reliable chronology was established for this core since 15 ka (1 ka = 1000 years). Sedimentological proxies (grain size) and geochemical proxies (XRF elements, TOC, TN, organic matter content) were used to reconstruct the history of glacier activity during the last deglaciation, and temperature and precipitation changes during the Holocene. The changes in TOC, TN, organic matter content, and Br (reflecting biomass variations) reveal a gradual increase in biomass in the Yangying Co region during the early Holocene, which reached a maximum during the middle Holocene and then decreased. The biomass is primarily controlled by summer temperature changes, and our Holocene summer temperature record shows a warming-thermal maximum-cooling temporal pattern. The gradual decrease in PC1 of scanning XRF data and in mean grain size during the Holocene indicate a weakening of the ISM. Influenced by cloud cover, dust flux, volcanic activity, and snow/ice albedo, the precipitation and summer temperature in the ISM region of the Tibetan Plateau were decoupled during the early Holocene (11.6-6 cal kyr BP). However, after similar to 6 cal kyr BP, both precipitation and summer temperature decreased, possibly influenced by the decreasing Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of current and future regional and global climate changes.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				JUL 1	2025	669								112937	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112937		APR 2025											WOS:001471183300001
J	Phillips, G; Willby, N; Moss, B				Phillips, Geoff; Willby, Nigel; Moss, Brian			Submerged macrophyte decline in shallow lakes: What have we learnt in the last forty years?	AQUATIC BOTANY												Over the last 40 years there has been substantial evidence that high biomasses of submerged aquatic plants and phytoplankton rarely occur together in shallow lakes, but it is clear that when present, plants have a competitive advantage over algae. Aquatic plants provide habitat structure, which influences the fish community such that zooplankton and other macroinvertebrates maintain a top-down control on algal growth, and this control is largely independent of the nutrient supply to the lake. Nonetheless it is clear that many, but not all, lakes lose their vegetation as nutrient loading increases. However, in eutrophic lakes, the subsequent dominance by phytoplankton is more likely to be a result of the loss of vegetation rather than the cause. At higher nutrient levels, grazing or mechanical damage can reduce plant cover allowing rapid development of algae. Changes to fish community structure or the influence of toxic chemicals can reduce invertebrate algal grazers, overcoming the positive feedback loops that stabilise the plant dominance. The longer-term stability of macrophyte dominance is also reduced if there are few surviving plant species. Such loss of species richness is associated with increased nitrogen loading. Submerged plants also depend on a spring clear-water phase to become established, and local weather conditions during winter and spring may determine the relative success of phytoplankton and plant growth, leading to a progressively longer period of algal dominance and fewer surviving plant species. The loss of submerged vegetation from lakes, although often perceived as a rapid change, is more likely to be the final conclusion of a process in which the competitive advantage of a diverse plant community is eroded by many pressures that are collectively interpreted as eutrophication. In attempts to manage our environment we hope to find simple, closed stable systems that will respond to measures designed to meet our perceptions of improved ecological quality. What we increasingly find are more complex open systems, which do not necessarily respond as expected. We look for simple and widely applicable explanations where none are likely to exist.

J	Gabrey, SW				Gabrey, SW			Migration and dispersal in Great Lakes Ring-billed and Herring Gulls	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Band-recovery data for Ring-billed (Larus delawarensis) and Herring (L. argentatus) Gulls were analyzed to determine the origins of gulls breeding within the Great Lakes region, the extent of lake and colony fidelity, and the winter and breeding season distributions of gulls of various age classes. Most Great Lakes Ring-billed Gulls wintered along the Gulf Coast, especially in Florida. Most Herring Gulls wintered along Lakes Erie, Ontario, and Michigan, although first-winter birds were more widely distributed and were recovered at greater distances than older birds. Movement into or out of the Great Lakes region by gulls of breeding age was minimal. However, movement among colonies and lakes was much more extensive; lakes and colonies do not define distinct populations. Gulls banded as chicks tended to return as adults to the lake, but not necessarily to the colony, where they where banded. Gulls banded as breeding adults were more likely to return in subsequent breeding seasons to the colony at which they had been banded than were chicks recovered as breeding adults. Gulls are probably not as colony-tenacious as previously believed, and natal dispersal plays a significant role in establishing or maintaining colonies. Management plans for Great Lakes Ring-billed and Herring Gull colonies should consider the effects of inter-lake and inter-colony dispersal.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				SPR	1996	67	2					327	339																WOS:A1996UK57000014

Thus, controlling the growth of cyanobacteria at the benthic stage to inhibit their recruitment is vital to control or delay the formation of summer blooms. In this study, overwintering benthic cyanobacteria were exposed to ascending hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations (0, 1, 5, and 20 mg/L) in a simulated overwintering environment. Photosynthetic pigments, physiochemical features, and antioxidant responses were evaluated to determine the inhibitory effects of H2O2 on the growth of benthic cyanobacteria and to identify the potential mechanisms thereof. These H2O2-treated cyanobacteria were then collected through filtration and transferred to an optimum environment to evaluate their recovery capacity. The results showed that chlorophyll a and phycocyanin contents, photosynthetic yield, and esterase activity decreased significantly in H2O2 treated groups compared to the control. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in benthic cyanobacteria were inhibited after 72 h exposure to H2O2, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were stimulated at the same time. These results indicate that H2O2 can inhibit the growth of benthic cyanobacteria, and H2O2-induced oxidative damage might be one of the mechanisms involved. The recovery experiment showed that the impairment of benthic cyanobacteria was temporary at a low dose of 1 mg/L H2O2, but permanent damage was induced when H2O2 concentrations were increased to 5 and 20 mg/L. Overall, our results highlight that H2O2 is a potential cyanobacteria inhibitor and can be used to decreasing the biomass of overwintering cyanobacteria, and could further control the intensity of cyanobacteria during the growth seasons.

Microbial life under ice: Metagenome diversity and in situ activity of Verrucomicrobia in seasonally ice-covered Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Northern lakes are ice-covered for a large part of the year, yet our understanding of microbial diversity and activity during winter lags behind that of the ice-free period. In this study, we investigated under-ice diversity and metabolism of Verrucomicrobia in seasonally ice-covered lakes in temperate and boreal regions of Quebec, Canada using 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Verrucomicrobia, particularly the V1, V3 and V4 subdivisions, were abundant during ice-covered periods. A diversity of Verrucomicrobia genomes were reconstructed from Quebec lake metagenomes. Several genomes were associated with the ice-covered period and were represented in winter metatranscriptomes, supporting the notion that Verrucomicrobia are metabolically active under ice. Verrucomicrobia transcriptome analysis revealed a range of metabolisms potentially occurring under ice, including carbohydrate degradation, glycolate utilization, scavenging of chlorophyll degradation products, and urea use. Genes for aerobic sulfur and hydrogen oxidation were expressed, suggesting chemolithotrophy may be an adaptation to conditions where labile carbon may be limited. The expression of genes for flagella biosynthesis and chemotaxis was detected, suggesting Verrucomicrobia may be actively sensing and responding to winter nutrient pulses, such as phytoplankton blooms. These results increase our understanding on the diversity and metabolic processes occurring under ice in northern lakes ecosystems.(C) 2018 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd					Huot, Yannick/B-4497-2008; Tran, Patricia/AAH-3679-2019; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020	Huot, Yannick/0000-0003-1793-761X; Tran, Patricia/0000-0003-3948-3938; Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Walsh, David/0000-0002-9951-5447													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUL	2018	20	7					2568	2584		10.1111/1462-2920.14283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.14283								29921005					WOS:000443114300020

We analyze outputs of the 48-member ensemble regional climate simulations in the historical and future climates. In the historical climate simulations, each ensemble member has a 61-year simulation from September 1950 to August 2011. For the future climate simulations, we also conduct 61-year simulations assuming the climate at the end of the twenty-first century (2080-2099) when the global mean surface air temperature is about 4 A degrees C warmer than the pre-industrial climate (1861-1880) as projected under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. Our simulations show that the heavy snowfall occurring at a frequency of every 10 years is enhanced in the inland areas of the central part of the Japanese archipelago (central Japan) where the total winter snowfall amount decreases significantly. Heavy snowfall is also intensified in the northern part of the Asian continent where the surface air temperature is much colder than over central Japan. A composite analysis of heavy snowfall events in central Japan indicates that such events occur when the Japan Sea polar air mass convergence zone (JPCZ) appears during the East Asian winter monsoon season. In the future climate projections, the JPCZ is intensified since the warm ocean supplies more moisture due to warming. An upward wind anomaly is also found over the windward side of mountains where the upward flow is prevalent climatologically. The intensification of both the JPCZ and the upward wind over the mountain ranges result in the enhancement of heavy snowfall in inland areas where the surface air temperature is still below 0 A degrees C.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				NOV	2016	139	2					265	278		10.1007/s10584-016-1781-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-016-1781-3													WOS:000387581400010
J	Hu, P; Feng, GL; Dogar, MM; Cheng, JB; Gong, ZQ				Hu, Po; Feng, Guolin; Dogar, Muhammad Mubashar; Cheng, Jianbo; Gong, Zhiqiang			Joint Effect of East Asia-Pacific and Eurasian Teleconnections on the Summer Precipitation in North Asia	JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH												The East Asia-Pacific (EAP) and Eurasian (EU) teleconnections are independent of each other on the seasonal timescale (with a correlation coefficient of only 0.03). But they may occur concurrently with consistent or opposite phases. This paper investigates their synergistic effect on the summer precipitation in North Asia. Based on the signs/phases of EAP and EU indices, the EAP and EU teleconnection anomalies occur in four cases: (I) positive EAP + positive EU, (II) negative EAP + negative EU, (III) positive EAP + negative EU, and (IV) negative EAP + positive EU. Further analyses show that these four configurations of EAP and EU anomalies are coherently related to different atmospheric circulations over the midlatitude Eurasian continent, leading to different summer precipitation modes in North Asia. Category I (II) corresponds to a zonal tripole structure of the geopotential height at 500 hPa over eastern Europe and the Sea of Japan, leading to less (more) than normal precipitation in eastern Europe, Japan, and the surrounding areas, and more (less) precipitation from central China to Lake Baikal and eastern Russia. Category III (IV) corresponds to a meridional dipole structure of the geopotential height at 500 hPa over North Asia, leading to more (less) precipitation in the northern North Asia and less (more) precipitation in most of the southern North Asia. Independent analysis reveals that the EAP teleconnection itself is positively correlated with the precipitation in the region between the eastern part of Lake Baikal and Okhotsk Sea, and negatively correlated with the precipitation in the region between Northeast China and Japan. Coincidently, the EU pattern and precipitation have negative correlations in Ural Mountain and Okhotsk Sea areas and positive correlations in the Lake Baikal area. The respective relations of EAP and EU with the summer precipitation in North Asia suggest that the EAP northern lobe overlapped with the EU central and eastern lobes could extend the geopotential anomalies over Lake Baikal to Russian Far East, creating an EAP-EU synergistic effect on the summer precipitation in North Asia.

J	Yang, YF; Gao, W; Zhang, Y				Yang, Yufeng; Gao, Wei; Zhang, Yuan			Retrieval of Dissolved Organic Carbon Storage in Plateau Lakes Based on Remote Sensing and Analysis of Driving Factors: A Case Study of Lake Dianchi	REMOTE SENSING												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an essential form of carbon in lakes and has significant impact on thermal structure and carbon source-supporting food webs. Current remote sensing studies on DOC mainly focus on the retrieval of surface concentration of lakes, with limited understanding of three-dimensional carbon storage. This study proposes a novel vertical retrieval methodology for plateau lakes by integrating remote sensing and vertical profile analysis. Specifically, a Gaussian function-based vertical fitting model was developed to characterize DOC concentration distribution along water columns, where parameters (mu and sigma) were calibrated against surface DOC concentrations retrieved from MODIS reflectance. A result-oriented storage algorithm was established by linking surface DOC concentration to DOC storage through linear relationships (R-2 > 0.9), with slope and intercept functions optimized as depth-dependent equations. The mixed-layer depth (2 m) was determined through error minimization analysis of 16 vertical profiles. Applied to the eutrophic Lake Dianchi, results show significant vertical DOC variations (CV up to 101.4%) but consistent distribution patterns across profiles. Spatially, higher DOC storage occurred in central regions (80-120 g.m(-2)) with seasonal peaks in summer and autumn. Interannual analysis reveals wind speed and forest coverage as dominant drivers, while monthly variations correlate strongly with water temperature. This methodology advances real-time monitoring of carbon storage in deep plateau lakes, providing critical insights into lacustrine carbon cycling.																				2072-4292				MAY 21	2025	17	10							1791	10.3390/rs17101791	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17101791													WOS:001496577900001

Geochemistry of thermal springs at Baransky volcano, Southern Kuriles (Russia)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Four types of springs occur on the southwestern slope of Baransky volcano: solfataras, blue lakes, thermal springs and mud boilers. Different matter sources, feeding these springs, divide them into three genetic groups: hydrothermal fluid, volcanic gas and mature waters. This paper presents new data on geochemistry, hydrochemistry and ecological consequences of Baransky volcano activity including its influence on the environment. Based on tectonics and hydrogeological conditions of drainage at the volcano, we pointed out main parameters that could be influenced by the activation of seismogenesis. A new approach to calculate the influence of volcanic waters on surrounding rivers was used. Calculated values of hydrothermal weathering of rocks show the possibility of industrial usage of acid creek water as a deposit of some strategic metals. Rare earth elements study gives an understanding of the processes occurring inside the volcanic structure and opens new horizons for predicting future seismic activity.

C	Bell, T; Briggs, R; Bachmayer, R; Li, S			IEEE	Bell, Trevor; Briggs, Robert; Bachmayer, Ralf; Li, Shuo			Augmenting Inuit knowledge for safe sea-ice travel - the SmartICE information system	2014 OCEANS - ST. JOHN'S	OCEANS-IEEE				Oceans Conference	SEP 14-19, 2014	St Johns, CANADA					Sea ice is a critical component of the Arctic coastal environment. For northern communities, it is a central part of culture, community, and livelihood. Recent changes in Arctic climate have led to greater unpredictability in sea ice conditions, making travel and hunting more hazardous, particularly during the dynamic freeze-up and break-up periods. If the recent trend of warmer Arctic winters is an indication of future climatic conditions, sea ice will become increasingly more dangerous for travel, especially for inexperienced travellers, and traditional knowledge of safe routes based on past climatic conditions will become less reliable. For northern resource industries (e.g., mining) and maritime shipping, the presence of sea ice represents added operational risk, particularly where shipping routes overlap with community on-ice travel routes, making route planning in these coastal areas less predictable and increasing the potential for delay and additional costs. Furthermore, northern resource extractive industries are expected to grow significantly in the future, leading to increased year-round shipping and greater potential for conflicting sea-ice use. The key to decreasing conflicts and ensuring safe and efficient winter travel for both local communities and industry is the timely availability of information describing sea ice conditions, at the relevant spatial scales, presented in a format that is appropriate for each user group. SmartICE represents a community-government-university-industry collaboration that integrates adapted technology, remote sensing, and Inuit Knowledge to promote safe travel for all stakeholders in northern coastal environments. The main elements of the SmartICE information system are: (i) A network of automated in situ sensors that measure sea-ice thickness and other characteristics; (ii) Repeat satellite imagery from which sea-ice surface conditions (e.g., concentration, roughness, water content) are mapped following user-defined classification systems; and (iii) Information technology that integrates the in situ and remotely sensed sea-ice data to generate raw and processed digital products that match the needs of user groups, from ice navigation managers to Inuit ice experts to recreational ice users. While community participation in SmartICE is key to addressing local needs and conditions, the program is intended to augment and integrate Inuit sea-ice knowledge, not replace it. Development and validation of the SmartICE technology and information system involve a multi-stage approach with simultaneous development of the ice monitoring technology and the Inuit-based ice type classification and remote sensing. The Nunatsiavut Government is a principal partner in SmartICE and our first phase of community sea-ice workshops, sea-ice classification and field truthing, sensor deployment and system validation is taking place in the Nunatsiavut communities of Nain and Rigolet. Nain is located to the north of Vale NL's Voisey's Bay mine site where winter ore shipping cuts a regular track through the coastal sea ice. Rigolet and a third study community, North West River, are located at the mouth and head of Lake Melville, respectively, an 150-km-long estuary that drains major rivers, including the Churchill River, to the Labrador Sea. Lake Melville sea ice is regularly used for subsistence harvesting and travel during winter and spring months. During the 2013/14 sea-ice season, workshops with sea-ice specialists were held in Nain and North West River. Sea-ice types deemed locally important for making decisions about on-ice travel were identified. Categories common to both communities included: rough ice (either due to ice or hard pack snow), smooth ice (again, due to a surface of ice or snow), open water, and water on-ice. Pack ice and the shear zone with landfast ice were only identified in Nain. The Canadian Ice Service (CIS) and C-CORE (through Polarview) provided high-resolution imagery for sea-ice classification. In addition, CIS have given full access to coarse resolution operational images. The sea-ice specialists in Nain and North West River have collected on-ice observations concurrent with image acquisition. Development of the sea-ice classification process is ongoing. SmartICE is developing two in situ sea-ice monitoring device types. Type 1, based on thermistor technology, will be deployed in the ocean prior to freeze-up and left in place until after break-up. Device prototypes were environmentally tested during the 2013-14 sea-ice season. Non-destructive ultrasonic sensor technologies are currently being explored for Type 2 devices, which will be deployed onto the ice surface.

Protozoan (ciliates and dinoflagellates) abundance (4 to 15 cells .cntdot. mL-1) and biomass (13-140 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1, wet wt.) were comparable between lakes and similar to those reported from other oligotrophic environments. On average, ciliates comprised the majority of protozoan abundance (80%) and biomass (73%). The mean size (ESD) of these communities was small (20.6 .mu.m) due to the numerical dominance of small choreotrichs, oligotrichs, and species of Gymnodinium. Total biomass in both lakes peaked during late June-July and again during the October-November period. These seasonal changes in biomass were accompanied by species replacements: tintinnids, strobilids, oligotrichs, and Gymnodinium species were abundant in the spring isothermal period, shifting to oligotrich dominance during summer stratification (May-July); a more diverse assemblage followed during late stratification (October-November) in which haptorids, prorodontids, and Peridinium species became more important. Deep and surface communities were comparable in terms of abundance and biomass, although deep community biomass decreased as stratification intensified. Because the biomass of ciliates alone represents approximately 30% of crustacean zooplankton biomass, protozoa may be more important grazers than once thought.

Studies of trends in the minimum 30-day winter runoff of rivers flowing out of the lake. Sevan acquired great practical importance and significant interest from the point of view of calculating the ecological flow, due to the increased use of water resources for various types of economic activities, in particular, in connection with the development of the economy, hydropower, irrigation, population growth and improving living standards. Calculations of the minimum runoff are especially relevant in relation to solving the problems of water supply to settlements, industrial and agricultural enterprises, as well as assessment of irrigation norms of agricultural plots. The aim of the work. Analysis and assessment of trends in the minimum 30-day winter runoff of rivers flowing out of the lake Sevan. Methods. The following methods were used in the work: mathematical-statistical, correlation, cartographic, extrapolation, interpolation, spatial analysis, analogy. Results. During the research, the characteristics of the winter minimum 30-day water consumption for the entire observation period were calculated for hydrological posts on the rivers of the lake Sevan basin, which have a number of observations for 40 years more. Supply curves are constructed, the values of the winter minimum 30-day runoff are estimated, with security of 90, 95 and 99.5% for 12 sites. The values of the flow rates, its coefficients of variation (Cv) and asymmetry (Cs) are determined. The analysis of temporal distribution of the studied hydrological characteristics was carried out, the coefficients of the linear trend of the minimum 30-day winter runoff were determined. Close correlations have been obtained between the values of the average monthly minimum water consumption and the minimum 30-day winter water consumption. These dependencies can be used to predict the minimum 30-day winter water consumption of the rivers of the territory under consideration. It is established that for the rivers of the lake Sevan basin is characterized by synchronicity of fluctuations in annual and winter runoff. It was revealed that most of the rivers flowinto the lake Sevan (by more than 58% of posts), there is an increase in the amount of winter runoff, i.e. a positive trend in its change. Based on the results obtained, a distribution map of the linear trend coefficients of the minimum 30-day winter runoff in /sec / 10 years with an observation period from december to march was constructed.					; Varduhi, Margaryan/AAT-7859-2020; Reshetchenko, Svitlana/JSL-6490-2023	Margaryan, Varduhi/0000-0003-3498-0564; Resetcenko, Svitlana/0000-0003-0744-4272; 													2410-7360	2411-3913					2024		60					231	239		10.26565/2410-7360-2024-60-16	http://dx.doi.org/10.26565/2410-7360-2024-60-16													WOS:001314197100016

SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Dust plays an important role in climate changes as it can alter atmospheric circulation, and global biogeochemical and hydrologic cycling. Many studies have investigated the relationship between dust and temperature in an attempt to predict whether global warming in coming decades to centuries can result in a less or more dusty future. However, dust and temperature changes have rarely been simultaneously reconstructed in the same record. Here we present a 1600-yr-long quantitative record of temperature and dust activity inferred simultaneously from varved Kusai Lake sediments in the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, NW China. At decadal time scale, our temperature reconstructions are generally in agreement with tree-ring records from Karakorum of Pakistan, and temperature reconstructions of China and North Hemisphere based on compilations of proxy records. A less or more dusty future depends on temperature variations in the Northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, i. e. weak and strong dust activities at centennial time scales are well correlated with low and high June-July-August temperature (average JJA temperature), respectively. This correlation means that stronger summer and winter monsoon should occur at the same times in the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.					; Chen, Huei-Fen/IYS-6261-2023; YU, ZHITONG/NVL-8771-2025	Dong, Hailiang/0000-0002-7468-1350; Chen, Huei-Fen/0000-0003-0188-9342													2045-2322					OCT 20	2014	4								6672	10.1038/srep06672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep06672								25335792					WOS:000343589900004

On 3-4 July 2001 we estimated a density of 466.03 ind./m(2) in the water column of lake "Breiter Luzin", but in April of 2002 population density was only 5.26 ind./m(2). In October 2004 the observed densities increased with depth, starting at the lower sublittoral down to the upper profundal on about 1000 ind./m(2). Downward from 22 m, densities fluctuated around this value up to 30 in depth. During daytime, mysids were never observed above 9 m. Below this limit all suitable parts of both lakes were occupied. We found no evidence for a preference of different sediment types as mud or sand. During daytime mysids showed a strong affinity for the lake bottom, and adults tend to live in deeper areas than juveniles. At night this distribution seems to be inverted. In July 2001 the proportion of adults (especially females) was highest in the metalimnion and the upper hypolimnion, whereas the proportion of juveniles increased with depth.																			0011-216X	1568-5403				JUN	2005	78		6				685	699		10.1163/156854005774353467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854005774353467													WOS:000232485500005

Weather and Air Quality Drive the Winter Use of Utah's Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons	SUSTAINABILITY												Winter outdoor recreation opportunities in Utah are directly impacted by the effects of climate change and deteriorating air quality. We examine the influences of daily weather conditions and air quality on winter use of two prominent Utah canyons located just outside Salt Lake City-Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons. Daily weather data were collected both within the canyons and in Salt Lake City; daily air quality data were collected for just Salt Lake City. We hypothesized that desirable weather within the canyons (i.e., cooler temperatures, more snowfall, and deeper snow depths) serves as a pull factor, positively influencing the volume of traffic. We also hypothesized that poor air quality within the city acts as a push factor on individuals' travel behavior, this too would positively influence the volume of traffic up the canyons. We used a panel time-series regression model to determine the influence of both these push and pull factors on use of the canyons during the winter months. Our results revealed that, as expected, cooler temperatures and greater amounts of snow in the canyons, as well as poorer air quality in the city, have a positive and significant influence on winter canyon use. These findings suggest that warmer winter temperatures, as well as deteriorating air quality in the city, may have substantial impacts on Utah's outdoor recreation economy.

In April 1990 a site was established in Lake Michigan to continuously monitor the offshore thermal structure and vertical velocity profile. The site is located near the center of the lake's southern basin in 160 m of water. Temperature is measured at 16 depths (winter) to 28 depths (summer), and the horizontal velocity components are measured at 5 levels which allows us to characterize the offshore environment with high temporal resolution. The goals of this effort are to provide basic physical measurements to better describe the flow of energy through the lake ecosystem and to provide a basis against which future change can be better gauged.																			0165-0009					OCT	1993	25	2					119	125		10.1007/BF01661201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01661201													WOS:A1993MK68300003

In all three lakes, three to four fold diel variations in concentrations and assimilation rates were measured. These fluctuations appeared to be independent of phytoplankton and bacteria production. Pools of DFAA varied from 380 nM (Lake Mosso) to 2430 nM (Lake Orn), with serine, glycine, alanine and ornithine as dominant free amino acids. When similar water samples were incubated in a natural light-dark cycle or in total darkness, different pools of DFAA were measured in light and dark. Decomposition of organic matter or zooplankton activity (rather than e.g. phytoplankton exudates) appear to be responsible for the concentration changes. Observed discrepancies between simultaneous concentration changes and assimilation rates are duscussed in relation to the applied tracer procedure and the concentration measurements. Assimilation of DFAA sustained from 6% to 25% of the bacterial carbon requirement, corresponding to 2-12% of the phytoplankton production in the lakes.

J	Diggins, TP				Diggins, TP			A seasonal comparison of suspended sediment filtration by quagga (Dreissena bugensis) and zebra (D. polymorpha) mussels	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Field evidence suggests a shift in the dreissenid population from zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) to quagga (D. bugensis) mussels is occurring within the lower Great Lakes. This laboratory study directly compared per-mussel and per-dry-weight filtration rates (volume per time) of both species, gauged by the clearance of resuspended natural sediments (1 to 12 mg/L) from gently mixed, I-L static vessels. Mussels of 15- and 20-mm lengths were collected together from the Lake Ontario drainage basin at Oak Orchard Creek, Medina, NY, and maintained and tested in ambient Niagara River water. A 2 x 4 factorial design was employed, with species and season as independent factors. Season significantly influenced filtration rate of both size classes, and winter rates were about half those measured during the rest of the year. Species significantly influenced filtration of 20-mm mussels. Quagga mussels of this size filtered up to 37% faster than zebra mussels (data for spring: 309 vs. 226 mL/h/mussel, n = 18 and 20 individuals, respectively). Species was not a significant factor alone for 15-mm mussels, but a species x season interaction was significant. The zebra mussels employed here had 16 to 22% more ash-free dry weight (AFDW) than the quagga mussels, accentuating filtration differences when expressed per-mg-AFDW.																			0380-1330						2001	27	4					457	466		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70660-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70660-0													WOS:000173010400006
J	Camuera, J; Alonso-Zarza, AM; Rodriguez-Berriguete, A; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, A				Camuera, Jon; Alonso-Zarza, Ana M.; Rodriguez-Berriguete, Alvaro; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Alejandro			Origin and palaeo-environmental significance of the Berrazales carbonate spring deposit, North of Gran Canaria Island, Spain	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Berrazales carbonate spring deposit is a small outcrop constituted mainly by cascade-like geometries. Four main facies have been identified:fibrous dense macro crystalline formed by rapid degassing under high-flow conditions; framestones of coated plant moulds formed in moderate energy flow favoured by the presence of biogenic support; micrite/microsparite are primary precipitates in which crystalline aggregates nucleated on organic filaments and/or EPS; banded micrite-coarse crystalline were the result of alternating physically, chemically and biologically induced precipitation in areas of varying flow-velocities. Most facies underwent different degrees of micritization processes. Micrite is distributed as thin lines penetrating the crystals, as irregular patches or as micrite layers. In the first case organic filaments penetrate crystals, suggesting that micritization is mainly biogenically driven. In the latter cases micritization is caused mostly by partial dissolution. Microbe participation in micrite formation increased micrite MgCO3 content in comparison with coarse crystalline facies. Isotopic analyses show positive delta C-13 values (+2.63 and +4.29% VPDB) and negative delta O-18 (-5.65 and -4.48 parts per thousand VPDB) values. Positive delta C-13 values clearly indicate "deep-sourced" fluids. The Berrazales spring deposit studied here very probably is a small part of a larger carbonate building that was largely eroded by fluvial incision. Calculations of spring water temperature give a range from 20 degrees C to 35 degrees C, characteristic of a cold to warm spring favouring precipitation of calcite and important biogenic activity (framestones). Although the study deposit has textural characteristics of tufas, proving that the CO2 sourced from deep fluids, it should be considered as thermogene travertine, being one more example of the difficulty of using those terms for ancient sedimentary deposits. Carbonate spring deposits, very rare in the Canary Islands, are good archives of recent volcanic activity, fluvial processes and vegetation regimes prevailing in the islands in recent times.

A 40-Year Annual Record of Sedimentary DNA From a Boreal Lake (Nylandssjon, Sweden)	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												To assess the sensitivity of lakes to anthropogenically-driven environmental changes (e.g., nutrient supply, climate change), it is necessary to first isolate the effects of between-year variability in weather conditions. This variability can strongly impact a lake's biological community especially in boreal and arctic areas where snow phenology play an important role in controlling the input of terrestrial matter to the lake. Identifying the importance of this inherent variability is difficult without time series that span at least several decades. Here, we applied a molecular approach (metabarcoding on eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes and qPCR on cyanobacterial 16S rRNA genes) to sedimentary DNA (sed-DNA) to unravel the annual variability of microbial community in 40 years' sediment record from the boreal lake Nylandssjon which preserve annually-laminated sediments. Our comparison between seasonal meteorological data, sediment inorganic geochemistry (X-ray fluorescence analyses) and organic biomarkers (pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses), demonstrated that inter-annual variability strongly influence the sediment composition in Nylandssjon. Spring temperature, snow and ice phenology (e.g., the percentage of snow loss in spring, the timing of lake ice-off) were identified as important drivers for the inputs of terrestrial material to the lake, and were therefore also important for shaping the aquatic biological community. Main changes were detected in the late-80s/mid-90s and mid-2000s associated with increases in algal productivity, in total richness of the protistan community and in relative abundances of Chlorophyta, Dinophyceae as well as Cyanobacteria abundance. These changes could be linked to a decline in terrestrial inputs to the lake during the snow melt and run-off period, which in turn was driven by warmer winter temperatures. Even if our data shows that meteorological factors do affect the sediment composition and microbial communities, they only explain part of the variability. This is most likely a consequence of the high inter-annual variability in abiotic and biotic parameters highlighting the difficulty to draw firm conclusions concerning drivers of biological changes at an annual or sub-annual resolution even with the 40-year varved sediment record from Nylandssjon. Hence, it is necessary to have an even longer time perspective in order to reveal the full implications of climate change.					; Capo, Eric/H-8362-2018; Bigler, Christian/C-4002-2008; Domaizon, Isabelle/A-2517-2011; Tolu, Julie/GLR-9987-2022	Capo, Eric/0000-0001-9143-7061; Tolu, Julie/0000-0001-5249-9497; 													2296-701X					JUL 10	2019	7								245	10.3389/fevo.2019.00245	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00245													WOS:000474916200001

Major coherent hydroclimatic variations in NW China were identified based on the first 2 leading singular value decomposition modes. The modes include the 'southern Xinjiang' pattern, the 'coherent NW-SE' pattern with positive or negative loadings over both the northwestern and southeastern parts and the 'NW-SE dipole' pattern, with inverse correlation patterns between them. The southerly winds near the western boundary of NW China and Lake Balkhash during the early stage of the Indian summer monsoon influence the hydroclimate variability in western NW China (Xinjiang area). The East Asian summer monsoon variability is related to the hydroclimate of eastern NW China, which is modulated by the El Nino Southern Oscillation, geopotential heights in northeastern Asia and over the Philippine Sea, as well as the western Subtropical Pacific High. The strength of the geopotential height in northeastern Asia may be related to the 'coherent NW-SE' pattern, while the inverse relationships between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Indian summer monsoon and westerlies may account for the 'NW-SE dipole'.					li, yingjun/HJB-0161-2022; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Li, Jinbao/D-3561-2011	Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; 													0936-577X	1616-1572					2011	49	1					17	27		10.3354/cr01019	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr01019													WOS:000295339000002

Influence of eastern Pacific and central Pacific El Nino events on winter climate extremes over the eastern and central United States	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Different influences of the eastern-Pacific (EP) El Nino and central-Pacific (CP) El Nino on nine winter extreme indices over the eastern and central United States are examined through composite analysis of high-resolution daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation for the period 1950-2010. During EP El Nino winters, there are usually more warm days and warm nights, fewer frost days, cold days, and cold nights over the eastern and central United States than in winters with a CP El Nino, especially for the Ohio Valley, around the Great Lakes, and southern New England. For precipitation extremes, compared with CP El Nino, EP El Nino usually brings more extreme precipitation amounts, more days with large precipitation amounts, larger amounts of maximum consecutive 5-day total precipitation, and a shorter duration of consecutive dry days around the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. The 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies show that wave train patterns differ when the maximum tropical sea surface heating locations are displaced. The corresponding wind field and moisture convergence anomalies are examined to analyse the mechanisms that drive the anomaly fields associated with the two types of El Nino events.

Atmospheric circulation is reflected in precipitation isotope gradients over the conterminous United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The stable isotopic (delta O-18 and delta H-2) composition of meteoric precipitation integrates information on the history of water fluxes to, from, and between air masses as they traverse the continents. The development of new methods relating isotopic data to water cycle processes will increase our ability to understand this system and its response to natural and anthropogenic forcing. Here we present an analysis of 2 years (1992-1993) of precipitation isotope data from 73 sites across the conterminous United States. We focus on patterns in the spatial precipitation isotope gradients (rate and direction of isotopic change in space), a metric which we suggest reflects two factors: (1) variation in the balance of rainout and land-surface recycling for air masses moving across the continent and (2) the spatial juxtaposition of air masses carrying moisture of differing origin and rainout history (e. g., Pacific versus Gulf of Mexico moisture). We demonstrate that the position of zones of particularly high precipitation isotope slopes correspond to the time-averaged position of air mass boundaries and to regions where prevailing moisture transport trajectories interact with orographic barriers. Differences in the location of high-slope zones between winter and summer seasons and between the same seasons in 1992 and 1993 can be related to differences in circulation and weather patterns. These results suggest new opportunities for the interpretation of precipitation, vapor, and paleoclimate water isotope data in the context of regional climate dynamics through spatial analysis.

September sea ice concentrations in the Arctic Ocean since 1991 correlate well (r = +0.69, p < 0.001) to this lake regime shift. To understand how and to what extent sea ice affects lakes, we conducted model experiments to simulate winters with years of high (1991/92) and low (2007/08) sea ice extent for which we also had field measurements and satellite imagery characterizing lake ice conditions. A lake ice growth model forced with Weather Research and Forecasting model output produced a 7% decrease in lake ice growth when 2007/08 sea ice was imposed on 1991/92 climatology and a 9% increase in lake ice growth for the opposing experiment. Here, we clearly link early winter 'ocean-effect' snowfall and warming to reduced lake ice growth. Future reductions in sea ice extent will alter hydrological, biogeochemical, and habitat functioning of Arctic lakes and cause sub-lake permafrost thaw.					alexeev, vladimir/B-2234-2010	Cai, Lei/0000-0002-9794-407X; Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; alexeev, vladimir/0000-0003-3519-2797													1748-9326					JUL	2016	11	7							074022	10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/074022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/074022													WOS:000380817000022
J	Lenters, JD				Lenters, JD			Long-term trends in the seasonal cycle of Great Lakes water levels	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Numerous long-term trends in the rate-of-change in monthly mean Great Lakes water levels are identified for the period 1860 to 1998. Statistically significant trends are found for 2, 4, 5, and 7 months of the year for Lakes Superior, Michigan-Huron, Erie, and Ontario, respectively. Many of the trends translate into large changes in net water flux (600 to 1,700 m(3)/s). In each case, significant positive trends are roughly offset by negative trends during other times of the year. Together with similar trends in monthly lake level anomalies (deviations from the annual mean), these trends indicate important changes in the seasonal cycle of Great Lakes water levels. Specifically, Lakes Erie and Ontario are rising and falling (on an annual basis) roughly one month earlier than they did 139 years ago. Maximum lake levels for Lake Superior are also slightly earlier in the year, and the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of Lake Ontario is found to increase by 23% over the 139-year period. Some of the changes are consistent with the predicted impacts of global warming on spring snowmelt and runoff in the Great Lakes region. Other potential contributors to the observed trends include seasonal changes in precipitation and human induced effects such as lake regulation and changes in land use.

In experiment 1, P (100 .mu.g/l) was added alone and in combination with nitrate N (700 .mu.g/l). Other treatments included nitrate N added alone and a control treatment which enclosed lake water with no further treatment added. In experiment 2, 3 levels of P (50, 100 and 150 .mu.g/l) were added to replicate P bags, along with a control treatment. Uncorrected chlorophyll-a-concentrations were significantly greater in the P treatments in both experiments than concentrations in the lake (sampled at surface and 1 m depths), control, and N treatments. The P plus N treatment in experiment 1 did not produce any greater algal than the P treatment. The P treatments in both experiments became almost unispecific in dominance by Chlorella sp. The dominant phytoplankton present in the lake during during these experiments were Chlorella sp., Botryococcus braunii and Peridinium inconspicuum.																			0003-9136						1982	94	4					393	424																WOS:A1982PW30400001
J	Yang, K; Zhang, Y; Luo, Y; Shang, CX				Yang, Kun; Zhang, Yan; Luo, Yi; Shang, Chunxue			Precipitation events impact on urban lake surface water temperature under the perspective of macroscopic scale	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is an important factor affecting a lake's ecological environment. In recent decades, LSWT worldwide has shown an increasing trend in the context of global climate change. This rising trend has been more evident in urban lakes. With the rapid development of urbanization, urban lakes are affected not only by climate warming but also by human activities. Among these factors, due to the increase in impervious surface coverage (ISC), the impact of thermal runoff pollution caused by precipitation events on urban lakes cannot be ignored. Therefore, this study used the Dianchi Lake watershed as a study area, and the surface water temperature of Dianchi Lake, the precipitation data, and the land use data were collected and analyzed. Based on these data, the influence of precipitation events on the surface water temperature of Dianchi Lake was analyzed. The research results show that under the background of different ISC levels and different growth rates of impervious surface area (ISA), precipitation events have different effects on the LSWT. When ISC is low and the growth rate of ISA is slow, the annual precipitation is negatively correlated with the annual average surface water temperature of Dianchi Lake (r = - 0.183). When ISC is high and the growth rate of ISA is fast, the annual precipitation is positively correlated with the average annual surface water temperature of Dianchi Lake (r = 0.65). With the increase in ISC, the correlation between seasonal precipitation and the average surface water temperature in Dianchi Lake changed from negative to positive in spring and autumn. Under the action of impervious surfaces, precipitation events have a warming effect on the surface water temperature of the lake, and this effect will be intensified with the increase in ISC.

Out of the Ashes: Ecological Resilience to Extreme Wildfire, Prescribed Burns, and Indigenous Burning in Ecosystems	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Until Euro-American colonization, Indigenous people used fire to modify eco-cultural systems, developing robust Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). Since 1980, wildfire activity has increased due to fire suppression and climate change. In 2017, in Waterton Lakes National Park, AB, the Kenow wildfire burned 19,303 ha, exhibiting extreme fire behavior. It affected forests and the Eskerine Complex, a native-grass prairie treated with prescribed burns since 2006 to reduce aspen (Populus tremuloides) encroachment linked to fire suppression and bison (Bison bison bison) extirpation. One year post-fire, the Kenow wildfire caused vigorous aspen sprouting, altered stand structure to an early-seral state and changed dominant land cover from grass to mineral soil. It did not change aspen-cover extent or cause non-native grass eruption, but it reduced native-grass diversity and produced more pronounced shifts in ecosystem structure and biodiversity than the prescribed burn. The 2017 Kenow wildfire and prescribed burns differed in phenological timing, scale, and severity. Prescribed burns occurred in late spring, with little fuel available, while the Kenow wildfire occurred in late summer, with abundant fuel-amplifying the difference in severity. As in other climate-limited fire regimes, prescribed burns treatments did not mitigate the severity of the Kenow wildfire. To more effectively reduce the extent of aspen cover, future prescribed burns in this system could be applied in the late season. Incorporating TEK in adaptive co-management can help create ecosystems more resilient to fire and pervasive stressors such as invasive plants, provided one contextualizes current conditions and how they differ from historical conditions.

High nutrient loads to streams and lakes are known to adversely affect water quality and may potentially cause algae blooms. Therefore, in-field as well as edge-of-field mitigation measures that can assist in reducing the loss of nutrients are needed. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and possibility of using controlled drainage during the drainage season to reduce nutrient losses while growing a winter crop in a temperate climate. The 3-yr-long (2012-2015) study was conducted on four experimental field plots on loamy soil. The impacts of controlled drainage on groundwater levels, drain flow, and water quality at regulation levels of 50 and 70 cm above the conventional drain pipe level were determined by using a before-after control-impact study design. A regulation level of 70 cm was required to significantly elevate groundwater levels and reduce the drain outflow and N and P loss, which decreased by 37 to 54%, 38 to 51%, and 43 to 46%, respectively, relative to conventional drainage levels. Denitrification in the root zone, as measured with stable isotopes, was not markedly enhanced at the plots with controlled drainage, except on a few occasions. Resetting the groundwater level to conventional levels in early spring only had a marginal influence on water and nutrient losses. Thus, potential water quality tradeoffs (e.g., increased N loss to groundwater) need to be more thoroughly investigated before implementing controlled drainage as a mitigation measure in Denmark.					kronvang, brian/I-7715-2013	kronvang, brian/0000-0003-1165-1354; Borgesen, Christen Duus/0000-0001-8362-6460; Vodder Carstensen, Mette/0000-0003-4882-9945													0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2019	48	3					677	685		10.2134/jeq2018.11.0393	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2018.11.0393								31180423					WOS:000466856300016

HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Synchronous patterns of variation in NO(3) concentration, observed in upland lakes and streams across gradients of climate, altitude, land use and nitrogen deposition over the last decade, show a strong negative correlation with winter values for the North Atlantic Oscillation Index and mean winter temperature. Variations in a longer term stream NO(3) record validate this relationship, and although mechanisms are yet unclear, may be linked to the length of time the soil profile remains frozen during the winter.

The modeled annual surplus for each drainage basin is compared to gauged annual discharge obtained from the United States Geological Survey. This provides an estimate of the differential success of the model over watersheds of various sizes, and also suggests appropriate adjustment factors to be used in future water balance analyses of similar basins in humid subtropical climate regions. Results show that annual surplus values agree well with the USGS values, after an annual adjustment of about 140 mm (11 to 28 percent of the basin surplus) is subtracted from the annual modeled totals to compensate for overestimation by the model. However, inter-annual variability is high in the annual cycles. Winter and spring discharges can also be modeled successfully.

A total of 117 bacterial and 66 archaeal 16S rRNA gene clones were obtained from the Wuli cold springs. The bacterial clones could be classified into Proteobacteria, Acid-obacteria, Deinococci, Sphingobacteria, Flavobacteria, Nitrospirae, Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and unclassified-bacteria; and the archaeal clones could be classified into Crenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. Among the major groups, Proteobacteria and Crenarchaeota were dominant in the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, respectively. The clone sequences obtained in Wuli cold springs were closely related to those from cold habitats, such as snow/ice/soils on high mountains or at high latitude. Especially, the microbial community composition of Wuli Area was more similar to that in Tibetan glaciers than cold environments of other locations. The data presented in this study have implications for a better understanding of microbial diversity in cold springs on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

The 2nd of these generations appeared during the hottest months of the year, late Jan. and Feb. This generation sequence was confirmed in a completely different environment, a permanent pond in a climatically different area, the coastal peneplain of north-eastern Zululand though the density of the 2nd generation here was much reduced. The species is moreover absent from certain types of shallow permanent waterbody(pans) on this plain. In these habitats the thermal regime rose above those in other types during spring and early summer, the maturation period of the 1st generation. A negative partial-correlation, significant at a 1% level, was found between decreasing fecundity of the 1st generation and increasing periods of above-optimal temperatures (> 27.degree. C) during its maturation period. This temperature effect accounts for the species'' absence from pans in the area, and the critical duration of these above-optimal temperatures appears to lie between mean weekly levels of 120-179 deg.h. [degree hours] > 27.degree. C. The discontinuous distribution of B. pfeifferi in the Lake Sibaya area of the Zululand coastal plain corresponds to an ecological succession among waterbodies associated with the lake''s fluctuating water level. The separation of sheltered bays from the lake was followed by further lowering of their levels and a spread of emergent vegetation. This is believed to have contributed to an increasingly high thermal regime, especially during spring when temperatures rise rapidly. The pans from which B. pfeifferi is absent constitute the present end point of this succession.																			0020-7519	1879-0135					1977	7	5					335	345		10.1016/0020-7519(77)90057-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0020-7519(77)90057-1								924719					WOS:A1977DY37800001
J	CONLEY, DJ; JOHNSTONE, RW				CONLEY, DJ; JOHNSTONE, RW			BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF N, P AND SI IN BALTIC SEA SEDIMENTS - RESPONSE TO A SIMULATED DEPOSITION OF A SPRING DIATOM BLOOM	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Experimental studies of intact cores from the Baltic Sea were conducted to determine the response of sediment nutrient recycling processes to varied inputs of organic matter. A 2 mo enrichment experiment was carried out in the laboratory on sediment cores held at 4 degrees C using a flow-through system where overlying waters were continuously replaced at a rate of 1 d(-1). The experiments were designed to simulate the deposition of organic matter that occurs during a typical spring diatom bloom (Ix) and under enriched conditions with eutrophication at approximately 3 times (3x) a normal spring bloom utilizing added organic matter from a natural phytoplankton assemblage collected in a eutrophic coastal fjord during the spring diatom bloom. Low and constant sediment-water fluxes were observed throughout the duration of the experiment in control cores with no added organic matter. In all cases an immediate response was noted when a single pulsed addition of algal material was added to the sediment surface. Sediment-water fluxes of ammonium (NH4+), and dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) increased significantly (ANOVA, p < 0.01). For nitrite + nitrate (NO2- + NO3-) and dissolved silicate (DSi) sediment-water fluxes, differences were initially observed; however, only the NO2- + NO3- fluxes were significantly different over time (ANOVA, p < 0.01). Fluxes of NO2- + NO3- were into the sediment for 3 to 10 d after addition of organic material, followed by small fluxes out of the sediment. The addition of algal material proportionate to a normal spring bloom (Ix) had only a minor effect on porewater nutrient concentrations, whereas the 3x treatment substantially modified both the short- and long-term response of sediments. A greater proportion of anaerobic decomposition products, e.g. NH4- and DIP, were observed with an expansion of more reducing conditions resulting from the addition of organic matter. The percentage of Si remineralized decreased as the flux of material to the sediment increased. Deposition rates similar to a typical spring bloom did not have long-term effects on the nutrient recycling processes; however, increases in the present level of deposition (as simulated in this study), which are forecasted with further eutrophication in the Baltic Sea, may have a significant impact on nutrient biogeochemical cycles.

A Three-Pass Electrofishing Removal Strategy Is Not Effective for Eradication of Prussian Carp in a North American Stream Network	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Prussian Carp Carassius gibelio, also referred to as Gibel Carp, is a destructive aquatic invasive species, recently found in Alberta, Canada. Three-pass electrofishing is a potential approach to control some aquatic invasive fish species in stream habitats. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine the efficacy of this strategy to control Prussian Carp in connected streams and 2) assess whether population size or the distance to the introduction site would influence removal success. We sampled sites by using electrofishing in tributaries of the Red Deer River in both the summer and fall and detected Prussian Carp at all sites before removal, with >90% probability of detection of this species within the first 120 m of electroshocking efforts. Overall, we were not successful at removing Prussian Carp from the sample sites, and we found that abundances of Prussian Carp were significantly higher postremoval. Removal success related significantly to distance to the introduction site, suggesting that removal may be useful in targeted situations close to the edge of the invasion front.

J	Bleiker, W; Schanz, F				Bleiker, W; Schanz, F			Light climate as the key factor controlling the spring dynamics of phytoplankton in Lake Zurich	AQUATIC SCIENCES												During the spring seasons of 1983, 1986 and 1987 the development of phytoplankton in Lake Zurich was investigated (from February to May) using samples taken at short term intervals. The aim was to describe the effects of the short term dynamics of environmental factors on the algal growth. The results could then be used to discuss the existing theories to assess the start of phytoplankton growth pulses in spring. Only 7 to 10 days without wind driven vertical mixing were required in spring to start the first growth pulse, despite of a still very unstable water column (sometimes inverse thermal stratification). Mainly flagellates and Stephanodiscus hantzschii increased their biomass and achieved net growth rates of 0.1 and up to 0.65 d(-1) respectively During such a phase the mixing depth was always smaller than the euphotic depth. Later on, at the start of the spring bloom (= last growth pulse in spring before the clear water stage), the intensity of vertical mixing as well as the mixing depth were markedly reduced due to an increase in heat input and low wind. Then flagellates dominated (contribution up to 75.5 % of the areal biomass reaching 60 g fresh weight m(-2)) and the growth rate rose to a maximum of 0.65 d(-1). Standard models of critical depth considers that there is only a biomass increase if the mixing depth is smaller than the depth of a water layer positive balanced between production and respiration. This model for determining the beginning of a phytoplankton growth pulse in spring takes no account of the favorable light conditions for phytoplankton cells at calm and sunny days in February and March. The newly developed threshold value model takes these situations into account: It assumes that the phytoplankton biomass increases when the calculated effective light climate is equal or greater than a previously fixed threshold. The calculations are based on the mean light intensity within the mixed layer at windy days or within the euphotic depth (z(eu)) at calm days. In Lake Zurich a minimum of 0.2 10(6) J m(-2) d(-1) (= 0.9 mol quanta m(-2) d(-1)) has to be reached or surpassed in at least 3 days before an exponential increase of algal biomass can occur. The value does not depend on short term fluctuations in neither radiation nor mixing depth. It seems that this value is rather low comparing with those of investigations in other water bodies (up to 0.8 10(6) J m(-2) d(-1)) but high related to values from algal cultures (0.02 10(6) J m(-2) d(-1)). As the weather can only be forecasted a few days ahead with any certainty the period for a more or less accurate prediction of an algal bloom is restricted to about 1 to 5 days.																			1015-1621						1997	59	2					135	157		10.1007/s000270050081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000270050081													WOS:A1997XG45900003
J	Shiller, AM				Shiller, AM			Dissolved trace elements in the Mississippi river: Seasonal, interannual, and decadal variability	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												A monthly trace element sampling of the lower Mississippi River, utilizing ultra-clean methods, was conducted from October 1991 to December 1993. Dissolved concentrations were determined for Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, V, Mo, U, Cu, Ni, Cd, Rb, and Ba. The results show significant seasonal dissolved concentration changes for a number of elements. Specifically, dissolved Mn and Fe are found to increase rapidly in the fall and then decrease in the spring. Zn and Pb follow a similar seasonal trend, though with lower percentage concentration changes. V, Mo, and U follow an opposite seasonal trend to Mn and Fe. The data do not allow a complete determination of the causes of this variability. However, changes in the adsorption process do not appear to play an important role. Hydrologic factors are also of minimal importance for most elements, with the probable exception of Ba and U. I suggest here that redox processes, occurring both in-stream and in source regions, play an important role in determining seasonal variations in dissolved trace elements. No evidence was found of significant dissolved trace element concentration changes over the past decade and interannual variability in mean concentrations was generally small. The time series also encompassed a period of extreme flooding in the U.S. Midwest. However, the flooding did not significantly influence dissolved trace element concentrations in the lower Mississippi River. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We aimed to investigate the effect of season, depth and regional environmental factors on the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in a plain river network area from Taihu Basin. The millions of Illumina reads (16S rRNA gene amplicons) at the surface 25 cm inside samples of the study area were examined using a technically consistent approach. Results from the diversity index, relative abundance, principal component analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA) and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis indicated that the diversity of the bacterial community in summer was generally higher than in other seasons. Proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum in the sediment samples in different seasons (43.15-57.41%) and different layers (39.66-77.97%); the autumn sediments were enriched with Firmicutes (5.67%) and Chloroflexi (12.5%); in all four seasons the sediments were enriched with Betaproteobacteria (14.98-23.45%), Gammaproteobacteria (11.98-14.36%) and Deltaproteobacteria (8.68-14.45%). In the bottom sediments (10-25 cm), Chloroflexi were abundant (average value 10.42%), while Bacteroidetes was the dominant phylum in the surface sediments; redundancy analysis found that total phosphorus (TP) (p = 0.036) was the main environmental factor influencing the sediment bacterial community in different layers. This study provides a reference for further understanding the effects of seasonal changes on sediment microorganisms in lake wetlands.

The hepatotoxins microcystin-LR, -RR, -LF and -YR, and the neurotoxin anatoxin-a were present. The mats were dominated by Phormidium terebriformis, Oscillatoria willei, Spirulina subsalsa and Synechococcus bigranulatus. The concentration of microcystins in mat samples, ranged from 221 to 845 mug microcystin-LR equivalents g(-1) DW of mat. Anatoxin-a concentrations ranged from 10 to 18 mug g(-1) DW of mat. A contribution of the cyanobacterial toxins from the hot spring mats to the mass mortalities of Lesser Flamingos is suggested by: (a), the presence of hot spring cyanobacterial cells and cell fragments, and high concentrations of the cyanobacterial hepato- and neurotoxins in flamingo stomach contents and faecal pellets; (b), observations of neurological signs of bird poisoning at the lake. Cyanobacterial toxins in stomach contents, intestine and fecal pellets were 0.196 mug g(-1) fresh weight (FW) for the microcystins and 4.34 mug g(-1) FW for anatoxin-a. Intoxication with cyanobacterial toxins could occur by uptake of detached cyanobacterial cells from the mats, as the flamingos need to drink fresh or brackish water, and to wash their feathers daily, which they do in the vicinity of the hot springs, where salinity is lower than in the main body of water of the lake.

J	Amirowicz, A; Gwiazda, R				Amirowicz, Antoni; Gwiazda, Robert			How equally sized piscivorous birds and fish sharing common food resources may reduce possible feeding interactions between them?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The diets of sympatric predators may overlap, especially when their body sizes are similar and foraging area is relatively small. It may be also supposed that some differences in their foraging strategies may counteract competitive interactions among them, and therefore be of advantage to these species. To reveal such phenomena the composition of food of cormorant and adult pikeperch was studied in the Dobczyce Reservoir (S Poland) from June to November 2002. The main prey species were the same and the range of prey size was similar for both piscivores. Despite these similarities, the potential for dietary overlap was strongly reduced due to two differences in their foraging patterns: (1) different preferred prey species (cormorants foraged mainly roach, whereas pikeperch selected juvenile percids); (2) different size of simultaneously selected prey (in summer, cormorants selected larger prey, while in autumn larger prey was selected by pikeperch). These differences may be explained by some general features of birds and fishes, which determine the costs to the individual of capturing prey. The observed selection of different prey species and sizes may be also important for the co-occurrence of other piscivorous birds and fishes sharing common food resources.

One area susceptible to potentially catastrophic landslides is located at Lushan in central Taiwan, which is famous for its hot springs and tourism. The northern slope above the hot spring district slips gradually and frequently due to heavy rainfall. For safety reasons, the slip-affected area has been under constant borehole monitoring by government agencies, and a controversial public debate has arisen over permanent evacuation of the hot spring district. In this study, we attempt to simulate possible scenarios of catastrophic slope failure using slip geometries derived from the monitoring data, and assess potential landslide impact areas by a discrete element method using the PFC3D code. In the worst case scenario, the Lushan hot spring district is predicted to be destroyed by debris in 20 s. Besides, the planned regional emergency refuge is rapidly jeopardized by flooding resulted from landslide-dammed lakes. This study addresses catastrophic slope failure under heavy rainfall conditions given a range of friction coefficients and varied continuity of the failure surfaces. It is noted that the PFC3D code has limitations in modeling all complex mechanisms of landslide, particularly in modeling loss of material shear strength due to increases in pore pressure. Nevertheless, the numerical simulation results by the 3D discrete element method provide scenario-based runout paths, particle velocities and landslide-affected areas, which are useful information for decision support and future landslide hazard assessment.

J	Reiser, MK; Scheiber, T; Fügenschuh, B; Burger, U				Reiser, Martin K.; Scheiber, Thomas; Fuegenschuh, Bernhard; Burger, Ulrich			HYDROLOGICAL CHARACTERISATION OF LAKE OBERNBERG, BRENNER PASS AREA, TYROL	AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Since the construction of a railway tunnel in the 1990s (Tunnel of Val di Fleres-Pflersch, Italy) the visible high water level fluctuations of the Lake Obernberg and specially its low stands were connected to recorded high water inflows in the tunnel and therefore to the impact which the tunnel has on the hydrological system. Due to a missing hydrological monitoring before, during and after construction of the tunnel an impact assessment on the lake is not straight forward. The aim of this study is to quantify present lake level fluctuations, to compare the shape and the extension of the lake in the past and present and to show with a conceptual hydrogeological model the reasons for the high water level fluctuations. Therefore historical documents, photos and pictures were collected and local people interviewed. With these results the behaviour of the water level and the morphology of the lake in the past are worked out and compared to recent data. The hydrogeological conceptual model is based on the results of a hydrological monitoring carried out on springs and surface waters and on the results of a detailed geological and geomorphologic mapping. The Lake Obernberg is located next to the Portjoch fault, which separates carbonates of the "Brennermesozoikum" to the west from Palaeozoic metasediments of the Steinach nappe (mainly quartz phyllites) to the east. The lake is embedded in coarse grained Quaternary rockfall deposits and covers an area of approximately 0.08 km(2). Annual water level fluctuations of up to 10 m were measured. The lake is divided by a morphological ridge which is covered from lake water during water level highstands. Between midsummer and autumn, when temperatures reach their maximum and precipitation is low, the water level drops and the ridge separates the lake into two discrete lakes. Surface runoff discharging into the lake were observed only during periods of water level highstands which are caused by large precipitation events and/or massive meltwater input. Normally the lake is draining to a large spring, located approximately 250 m downvalley of the northern lake border. Only during water level highstands an overflow of the natural dam can be observed. The hydrogeological conceptual model shows that the water level represents the groundwater table of the coarse-grained soft rock aquifer. The aquifer is recharged uphill of the lake by infiltrating rivers and laterally by a carbonatic aquifer of the Tribulaun area, west of the Portjoch fault. The historical documentation shows that water level fluctuations and water level lowstands of present magnitude also occurred before the tunnel construction. A visible impact (m-scale) on the water level due to water inflows in the tunnel can therefore be excluded.

J	Cousins, M; Stacey, MT; Drake, JL				Cousins, Mary; Stacey, Mark T.; Drake, Jeana L.			Effects of seasonal stratification on turbulent mixing in a hypereutrophic coastal lagoon	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal variations in vertical turbulent mixing rates, density structure, inorganic nutrient concentrations, and phytoplankton biomass were investigated in a shallow, tidally choked coastal lagoon. The project site, Rodeo Lagoon, is located in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, California, and has experienced intense blooms of the cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena and Microcystis aeruginosa in recent years. Monthly measurements collected along a transect of the lagoon from March 2006 to April 2008 show it is strongly stratified by brackish water in winter, when freshwater inputs from the watershed and saltwater inputs from storm surge are both at their highest. The squared buoyancy frequency exceeds 0.5 s(-2) under these conditions. In summer, weaker diurnal temperature stratification is the result of strong light absorption characteristics in this hypereutrophic lagoon. Wind is the dominant driver of turbulent mixing. Although water depths of less than 2.5 m lead to the expectation of rapid vertical mixing, limited fetch and strong density gradients reduce the coupling of wind stress and bottom stress. The vertical turbulent diffusivity is reduced by as much as three orders of magnitude across the pycnocline, and the water column in and below the pycnocline shows active turbulence only intermittently. The annual cycle of salt-based stratification and accompanying reduction in turbulent exchange of nutrients between the sediments and overlying water column inhibit the flushing of nutrients out of the lagoon and contribute to excessive phytoplankton biomass.																			0024-3590					JAN	2010	55	1					172	186		10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0172	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0172													WOS:000272759900008

The conditions in such areas are favorable for separation of bays and straits from the sea. As a result of the glacial isostatic adjustment of the area the fiards would be transformed into coastal lakes. To discover the regularities of evolution of such water bodies, we studied topography, sea and lake sediments, hydrology and diatom associations of meromictic Lake Kislo-Sladkoe at the Karelian Coast of the Kandalaksha Bay, the White Sea, Russia (66 degrees 32 & PRIME;54 & DPRIME;N, 33 degrees 08 & PRIME;05 & DPRIME;E). Detailed geomorphological, geodetic, bathymetric, and aerial imagery field works have been completed on the coastal area. We built a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the coast and seabed. Radioisotope dating (210Pb,14C), grain size distribution, loss on ignition, Corg/Norg ratio and diatom analysis have been completed for the entire 1.5-m sequence of the Lake's sediments. Currently, the Lake Kislo-Sladkoe communicates with the sea through a rising sill. We have established that the water body is meromictic due to its upper water layer being of variable salinity, middle layer comprising of aerated salty water, and the near-bottom water layer being anaerobic. However, several-year-long periods of water stratification alternate there with occasional late-autumn or early -winter flushes. The water body evolution falls into four stages: (1) a strait with an active hydrodynamic envi-ronment (prior to 1500-1560s), (2) a strait with a variable hydrodynamic environment (1500-1560s to 1850-1890s), (3) a semi-isolated lagoon with a quiet hydrodynamic environment (1850-1890s to early 1950s), and (4) a meromictic lake at an early stage of separation from the sea (early 1950s to present). We show how coastal processes on fiard coasts change the mode and duration of isolation of coastal water bodies from the sea. Based on the assessment of the rate of the post-glacial rebound and hydrological conditions of the coastal area we propose an approach to estimating the duration of transitional phase between a marine bay or strait and freshwater lake, including its meromictic stage. We predict that the meromictic stage of the lake will be completed no earlier than c. 100-200 years after the sill rises above the tidal zone.					; Shilova, Olga/L-9170-2015; Shilova, Olga/AAM-6447-2021; Losyuk, Galina/ABB-5620-2020; Vakhrameeva, Elena/ABB-5631-2020; FROLOVA, NATALIA/NMK-6379-2025; Grigoriev, Vasily/C-3040-2015; Krasnova, Elena/AAJ-9714-2020; Repkina, Tatiana/L-9353-2015; Lugovoy, Nikolay/L-9419-2015; Entin, Andrey/V-3775-2017	Repkina, Tatiana/0000-0003-4345-8807; Shilova, Olga/0000-0002-2383-2438; Kublitskiy, Yuriy/0000-0001-7955-8944; Lugovoy, Nikolay/0000-0001-8021-0953; Vahrameeva, Elena Anatol'evna/0000-0001-5129-2419; Entin, Andrey/0000-0002-0350-5587; Losuk, Galina/0000-0001-6636-2344													1040-6182	1873-4553				JAN 20	2023	644						96	119		10.1016/j.quaint.2022.05.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2022.05.015		JAN 2023											WOS:001012169400001

Aluminium, silicon and transition metal dynamics in a non-polluted lake:: aquatic concentrations and phytoplankton uptake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study was carried out to monitor and relate seasonal Al, Si and transition metal (Mn, Fe, Ni and Cu) concentrations in lake water and phytoplankton within an unpolluted lake. Lake water concentrations of Al and Mn showed seasonal (high winter-low summer) variation. The clear annual correlation pattern had significant links among transition metals, but not Si-Al. Within phytoplankton biomass, separate analyses of acid (soluble) and carbonate (insoluble) constituents showed that most elements (Si, Ni, Cu and Fe) occurred in bound form, but insoluble Al and Mn concentrations were < 50% total. Diatom abundance was characterised by high Si and low Al biomass concentration, with substantial amounts of Si also occurring during phases of blue-green dominance. The elemental correlation pattern of phytoplankton acid digests (soluble material) was different from carbonate digests, which had significant correlations among the three transition metals (Mn, Ni, and Cu)-but no relationships involving Si, Al and Fe. Data show that phytoplankton biomass accumulates high levels of Al, Si and transition metals, irrespective of taxonomic composition. The different correlation patterns seen for aquatic, soluble biomass and insoluble biomass elemental concentrations indicate that external availability, soluble uptake and insoluble deposition are distinct aspects of the pelagic ecosystem.																			0018-8158					JUL	2008	607						131	142		10.1007/s10750-008-9382-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9382-4													WOS:000256080700013
J	Mikucki, JA; Priscu, JC				Mikucki, Jill A.; Priscu, John C.			Bacterial diversity associated with blood falls, a subglacial outflow from the Taylor Glacier, Antarctica	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Blood Falls is the surface manifestation of brine released from below the Taylor Glacier, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Geochemical analyses of Blood Falls show that this brine is of a marine origin. The discovery that 74% of clones and isolates from Blood Falls share high 16S rRNA gene sequence homology with phylotypes from marine systems supports this contention. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone library was dominated by a phylotype that had 99% sequence identity with Thiomicrospira arctica (46% of the library), a psychrophilic marine autotrophic sulfur oxidizer. The remainder of the library contained phylotypes related to the classes Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria and the division Bacteroidetes and included clones whose closest cultured relatives metabolize iron and sulfur compounds. These findings are consistent with the high iron and sulfate concentrations detected in Blood Falls, which are likely due to the interactions of the subglacial brine with the underlying iron-rich bedrock. Our results, together with previous reports, suggest that the brine below the Taylor Glacier hosts a viable ecosystem with microorganisms capable of growth, supported by chemical energy present in reduced iron and sulfur compounds. The metabolic and phylogenetic structure of this subglacial microbial assemblage appears to be controlled by glacier hydrology, bedrock lithology, and the preglacial ecosystem.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				JUN	2007	73	12					4029	4039		10.1128/AEM.01396-06	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01396-06								17468282					WOS:000247394200030

Clams were collected from the Sanguinet lake and the Dronne river (Southwest France), sites characterised by water of excellent and passable quality, respectively. Biological parameters studied were enzymatic activity (catalase, propionylcholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and NADH-cytochrome c reductase activities) and indicators of physiological (protein, carbohydrate, lipid and ash contents, fresh and dry tissue weights, condition factor) and reproductive (amount of oocytes present in gonads and clams incubating larvae in gills) status. Environmental parameters (e.g. water temperature, chlorophyll a concentration) were also monitored. Effects of site, sampling date and season (from spring to winter) were studied, as well as relationships between abiotic and biotic factors. Finally, an index of variability was calculated for each biomarker. Catalase, propionyleholinesterase, NADH-cytochrome c reductase and lipids experienced the most pronounced seasonal fluctuations, whereas glutathione S-transferase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and proteins Suffered less pronounced ones. For some parameters, results differed depending on the site. Most seasonal changes were related to the reproductive cycle and/or water temperature. Implications of such variations in the use of pollution biomarkers in environmental surveys are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanisms of these interactions in the mountainous territories have not been fully studied yet. The main aim of the research is to establish the relationship between the content of the major components in the tributaries waters of Lake Teletskoe and the features of their chemical denudation with the biogeochemical situation on the catchments. Methods. Water samples from the tributaries of Lake Teletskoe were collected in clean polyethylene dishes in the estuary of the rivers, during the spring-summer high water and autumn low water. Determination of the ionic composition of surface waters (HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+ Na+ and K+) was carried out according to standard methods, with titrimetric or spectrophotometric completion. Na+ and K+ in 2018 and 2019 were determined by atomic emission spectrometry on the IRIS Advantage Thermo Jarrell Ash Corp. instrument. (1999). Fe content in waters and water extracts from soils was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using electrothermal atomization on the SOLAAR M-6 device. Results. It is established that the waters of the Lake Teletskoe tributaries are characterized by a low total mineralization (TDS), from 18 to 159 mg/L. It is shown that the seasonal dynamics of the major ions is determined by the biogeochemical processes in the catchment. It is revealed that the waters of the eastern and western tributaries, draining different geological and landscape structures, as well as the degree of recreational load of the coast, differ both in content and in the ratio of the major ions. Thus, Cl- and SO42-, K+ and Na+ make a greater contribution to the ionic composition of the waters of the eastern tributaries originating on the Korbu granite ridge, whereas in the waters of the western tributaries, draining sedimentary deposits for the most part, bicarbonates and calcium dominate. The influence of biogeochemical conditions of catchment on the content and ratio of iron in water and water extraction of soils is shown. It is revealed that most of the tributaries carry bicarbonate-magnesium-calcium type waters. The indicators of ion runoff of three tributaries of the lake of different sizes are calculated, chemical denudation in their catchment basins is estimated. In one year, 364 thousand tons of soluble salts enter the lake with the waters of the largest tributary - the Chulyshman River. 21 tons of salts are removed from 1 km(2) of the Chulyshman River catchment (this is less than from the catchments of smaller tributaries), of which 12,8 tons are hydrocarbonates, 1,4 tons are chlorides, 1,6 tons are sulfates, 4,5 tons are calcium, 0,4 tons are magnesium.

The emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennisFairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is threatening North America's ash resource, including black ash and this centuries-old art form, resulting in grave concern about the availability of black ash trees for basketmaking and about movement of black ash (along with A. planipennis) from areas where it is cut to lands where it is pounded and split to make baskets. We evaluated the traditional practice of storing black ash logs submerged in water as a possible method for killing within-tree life stages of A. planipennis at the same time as preserving the wood's value for basketmaking. Black ash trees infested with overwintering A. planipennis larvae were felled and cut into 60-cm bolts in 2010 and in 2011. These were submerged in a river for different lengths of time and, after treatment, placed into rearing tubes to determine survival and adult emergence, or dissected within 24h to determine larval mortality, and then pounded and peeled into splints to assess colour and pliability. In 2010, all A. planipennis larvae had died and no adults emerged from logs submerged in spring for 10weeks or longer, whereas some larvae survived and adults emerged from logs submerged for up to 9weeks. In 2011, submergence for 18weeks during winter or 14weeks in spring resulted in complete mortality of A. planipennis larvae and no emergence of adults at the same time as still preserving wood quality for basketmaking.					; Poland, Therese/AAZ-9272-2021	Ciaramitaro, Tina/0000-0002-9660-0777; Poland, Therese/0000-0001-7684-1306													1461-9555	1461-9563				NOV	2015	17	4					412	420		10.1111/afe.12122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.12122													WOS:000363203900008

However, the factors behind increased hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes and reservoirs are often diverse and may involve processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we evaluate the combined effects of different anthropogenic pressures on the oxygen dynamics and water chemistry of Lake Enol, an emblematic mountain lake in Picas de Europa National Park (NW Spain). A multidisciplinary study conducted over a period of four years (2013-2016) indicates that the extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia has increased dramatically in recent years. The extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia is typical of meso-eutrophic systems, in contrast with the internal productivity of the lake, which remains oligo-mesotrophic and phosphorus-limited. This apparent contradiction is ascribed to the combination of different external pressures in the catchment, which have increased the input of allochthonous organic matter in recent times through enhanced erosion and sediment transport. The most important among these pressures appears to be cattle grazing, which affects not only the import of carbon and nutrients, but also the lake microbiology. The contribution of clear-cutting, runoff channelling, and tourism is comparatively less significant. The cumulative effects of these local human impacts are not only affecting the lake metabolism, but also the import of sulfate, nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen, and metals (Zn). However, these local factors alone cannot explain entirely the observed oxygen deficit. Climatic factors (e.g., warmer and drier spring and autumn seasons) are also reducing oxygen levels in deep waters through a longer and increasingly steep thermal stratification. Global warming may indirectly increase anoxia in many other mountain lakes in the near future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Examining the effects of water level fluctuations on waterbird abundance and analyzing the influencing mechanism is critical to waterbird protection in the context of hydrological alteration. In this study, the effect of water level regime on wintering goose abundance was examined and the influencing mechanism was interpreted. Synchronous waterbirds survey data, hydrological data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MODIS-NDVI) data and habitat data derived from Landsat TM/ETM data and HJ/CCD data were combined. The satellite-derived Green Wave Index (GWI) based on MODIS-NDVI dataset was applied to detect changes in goose food resources. It was found that habitat size and vegetation conditions are key factors determining goose abundance. Geese numbers were positively correlated with habitat area, while intermediate range of vegetation productivity might benefit the goose abundance. Water level affects goose abundance by changing available habitat areas and vegetation conditions. We suggested that matching hydrological regime and exposed meadows time to wintering geese dynamics was crucial in the Poyang Lake wetlands. Our study could provide sound scientific information for hydrological management in the context of waterbird conservation.					; chen, bin/KZA-1706-2024; Yu, Xiubo/A-5875-2016	Liu, Yu/0000-0002-1692-1811; chen, bin/0000-0003-0735-228X													1002-0063	1993-064X				APR	2017	27	2					248	258		10.1007/s11769-016-0840-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-016-0840-z													WOS:000400861700008

The most important factor for these activities is in addition to water, climate and its current situation - weather. The article is focused on the analysis of the climatic elements relevant from the standpoint of the summer recreation and bathing. Climatic elements are evaluated within the framework of the current regionalization of tourism regions of Slovakia. The results of the analysis indicate significant differences in the distribution of the climatic elements and thus the conditions for summer recreation in the various regions of tourism in Slovakia.																					978-80-88064-09-1				2015							237	248																WOS:000375063500020

Decadal ecosystem response to an anomalous melt season in a polar desert in Antarctica	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												Amplified climate change in polar regions is significantly altering regional ecosystems, yet there are few long-term records documenting these responses. The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) cold desert ecosystem is the largest ice-free area of Antarctica, comprising soils, glaciers, meltwater streams and permanently ice-covered lakes. Multi-decadal records indicate that the MDV exhibited a distinct ecosystem response to an uncharacteristic austral summer and ensuing climatic shift. A decadal summer cooling phase ended in 2002 with intense glacial melt ('flood year')-a step-change in water availability triggering distinct changes in the ecosystem. Before 2002, the ecosystem exhibited synchronous behaviour: declining stream flow, decreasing lake levels, thickening lake ice cover, decreasing primary production in lakes and streams, and diminishing soil secondary production. Since 2002, summer air temperatures and solar flux have been relatively consistent, leading to lake level rise, lake ice thinning and elevated stream flow. Biological responses varied; one stream cyanobacterial mat type immediately increased production, but another stream mat type, soil invertebrates and lake primary productivity responded asynchronously a few years after 2002. This ecosystem response to a climatic anomaly demonstrates differential biological community responses to substantial perturbations, and the mediation of biological responses to climate change by changes in physical ecosystem properties.					; Barrett, John/D-5851-2016; Adams, Byron/C-3808-2009; Wall, Diana/F-5491-2011; Sokol, Eric/HZL-4014-2023; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022; Gooseff, Michael/N-6087-2015	Wall, Diana H./0000-0002-9466-5235; Barrett, John/0000-0002-7610-0505; Vandegehuchte, Martijn L./0000-0003-1283-4654; Adams, Byron/0000-0002-7815-3352; Sokol, Eric/0000-0001-5923-0917; Gooseff, Michael/0000-0003-4322-8315													2397-334X					SEP	2017	1	9					1334	1338		10.1038/s41559-017-0253-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-017-0253-0								29046542					WOS:000417190400024

The percentage of all organisms hosting such protozoa averaged 11.6%. The phenomenon is apparently related to the highly eutrophic conditions existing in the lake; if the occurrence of epizoic peritrichs and suctorians is related to the degree of organic enrichment of a body of water, then the percentage of planktonic organisms hosting them could serve as a rapid and useful index of water quality. Several interesting symbiotic associations were noted. Tokophrya cyclopum was always found on the anterior end of its cyclopoid copepod hosts and Vorticella microstoma was found exclusively on the cladoceran Scapholeberis kingi.																			0003-0023						1979	98	4					495	508		10.2307/3225899	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3225899													WOS:A1979HY60000002

We set out to chart which cyst types are found in Finland and what their ecological preferences are, focusing on cyst-air temperature relationships that could be further utilized in reconstructing past winter/spring air temperatures and ice-free periods from sedimentary cyst assemblages. Surface sediment samples from lakes across Finland were analysed for their chrysophyte stomatocyst assemblages. Multivariate ecological techniques (e.g. canonical correspondence analysis, principal component analysis) were used to identify the environmental variables that most strongly affected the distribution of the cysts. This survey expanded the known geographical range for several cyst types. Lake water pH and ice-free periods (surrogate for air temperature) explained the statistically significant distribution and composition of the cyst assemblages studied. The results broaden our knowledge of cyst biogeography and strengthen the findings of previous studies of the environmental factors contributing to the occurrence of cysts. Highly variable and rich chrysophyte cyst assemblages in Finland are clearly associated with temperature, pH, electrical conductivity and total phosphorus, with good potential in contemporary and retrospective environmental assessment.					; Weckstrom, Jan/N-7665-2013; Weckström, Jan/N-7665-2013	Korhola, Atte A./0000-0003-2577-6502; Korkonen, Sanna/0000-0003-3598-8496; Weckstrom, Jan/0000-0001-5604-617X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2020	847	2					487	499		10.1007/s10750-019-04112-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-04112-0													WOS:000510396900011

Magnetic susceptibility as a biosignature in stromatolites	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Microbialites have long been a focus of study in geobiology because they are macroscopic sedimentary records of the activities of microscopic organisms. However, abiotic processes can result in microbialite-like morphologies. Developing robust tools for substantiating the biogenicity of putative microbialites remains an important challenge. Here, we report a new potential biosignature based on the detrital magnetic mineral component present in nearly all sedimentary rocks. Detrital grains falling onto a hard, abiogenic, chemically precipitated structure would be expected to roll off surfaces at high incline angles. Thus, the distribution of grains in an abiogenic microbialite should exhibit a dependence on the dip angle along laminae. In contrast, a microbialite formed by the active trapping and binding of detrital grains by microorganisms could exhibit a distribution of detrital grains significantly less dependent on the dip angle of the laminae. However, given that most ancient stromatolites are micritic (composed of carbonate mud), tracking detrital grains vs. precipitated carbonate is not straightforward. Recent advances in our ability to measure miniscule magnetic fields open up the possibility to map magnetic susceptibility as a tracer of detrital grains in stromatolites. In abiogenic carbonate precipitation experiments, magnetic susceptibility fell to zero when the growth surface was inclined above 30 (the angle at which grains rolled off). In cyanobacterial mat experiments, even vertically inclined mats held magnetic material. The results indicate that cyanobacterial mats trap and bind small grains more readily than abiogenic carbonate precipitates alone. A variety of stromatolites of known and unknown biogenicity were then analyzed. Tested stromatolites span many different ages (Eocene to Holocene) and depositional environments (hot springs, lakes), and compositional forms (micritic, sparry crusts, etc.). The results were consistent with the laboratory results.

J	Knuth, JM; Potter-McIntyre, SL				Knuth, Jordan M.; Potter-McIntyre, Sally L.			Stable Isotope Fractionation in a Cold Spring System, Utah, USA: Insights for Sample Selection on Mars	ASTROBIOLOGY												Stable delta C-13 isotope analysis at hot and cold springs suggests that rapid degassing overprints carbon isotopic biosignatures even when microbial activity produces biogenic textures in the minerals. Mineral precipitation and potential biosignature preservation are evaluated at a cold spring system in Ten Mile Graben, Utah, USA, with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and stable carbon isotopes. Putative biogenic mineral habits such as aragonite microspheres and botryoids, and biologic materials (EPS and diatom tests) are abundant in modern mats, but the delta C-13 values are between +2 parts per thousand and +7.8 parts per thousand, consistent with rapid CO(2)degassing reported by other researchers. Multiple factors, however, influence isotopic signatures of mineral precipitates in this spring system, including rapid degassing, preferential microbial uptake of light carbon isotopes via multiple carboxylation pathways, hydrocarbon-charged fluid, and other inherited isotopic signatures in the fluid, particularly from dissolution of older limestones; therefore, it is not likely that this narrow range of isotopic ratios definitively shows an abiotic signature. A fossil vent preserves biogenic mineral habits, but not microbial body fossils. This study highlights the need for novel biosignature detection methods-and an understanding of what an abiotic signature definitively is-as we prepare for sample caching of carbonate rocks by the Mars2020 mission and future sample return.

However, this study firstly discovers the new evidences that the summer rainfall over North China had a significant increasing tendency during 1979-1996; since 1997, this increasing tendency has halted while more summer droughts occurred over North China. One important cause for the halted increasing tendency over North China is the interdecadal decrease of the westerly water vapor transport during 1997-2016 in addition to the weakened EASM. The decrease of the westerly water vapor transport during 1997-2016 was due to the interdecadal warming over Lake Baikal. The interdecadal warming in the upper troposphere at 200 hPa forced the weakening of the upper-level zonal winds since 1997, which resulted in the anomalous descending flow over the north side of North China and the halted precipitation trend in North China.

Soil microbes transform organic N into inorganic N, which is available to plants, but soil microbe activity in drylands is sometimes critically suppressed by environmental factors, such as low soil substrate availability or high salinity. Tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) is a halophytic shrub species that is widely distributed in the drylands of China; it produces litter enriched in nutrients and salts that are thought to increase soil fertility and salinity under its crown. To elucidate the effects of tamarisks on the soil microbial community, and thus N dynamics, by creating "islands of fertility" and "islands of salinity," we collected soil samples from under tamarisk crowns and adjacent barren areas at three habitats in the summer and fall. We analyzed soil physicochemical properties, inorganic N dynamics, and prokaryotic community abundance and composition. In soils sampled beneath tamarisks, the N mineralization rate was significantly higher, and the prokaryotic community structure was significantly different, from soils sampled in barren areas, irrespective of site and season. Tamarisks provided suitable nutrient conditions for one of the important decomposers in the area, Verrucomicrobia, by creating "islands of fertility," but provided unsuitable salinity conditions for other important decomposers, Flavobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, by mitigating salt accumulation. However, the quantity of these decomposers tended to be higher beneath tamarisks, because they were relatively unaffected by the small salinity gradient created by the tamarisks, which may explain the higher N mineralization rate beneath tamarisks.					du, sheng/A-7528-2008; DU, SHENG/A-7528-2008; Norikazu, Yamanaka/D-4628-2019; taniguchi, takeshi/AAG-5450-2021	du, sheng/0000-0002-5580-399X; Yamanaka, Norikazu/0000-0003-4997-4060; Taniguchi, Takeshi/0000-0001-7386-1117; Tateno, Ryunosuke/0000-0001-8461-3696; Tatsumi, Chikae/0000-0001-7191-6049													0095-3628	1432-184X				MAY	2018	75	4					985	996		10.1007/s00248-017-1090-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-017-1090-z								29032430					WOS:000430393400017

A STUDY ON GROWTH CO-EFFICIENT AND RELATIVE CONDITION FACTOR OF THE MAJOR CARP (CATLA CATLA) IN TWO LAKES DIFFERING IN WATER QUALITY	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Physico-chemical water quality parameters viz. temperature, pH, alkalinity, turbidity, total solids, DO, BOD, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide coupled with diversity and density of plankton were studied during different seasons (monsoon, winter, summer) for two consecutive calendar years in two lakes to find out whether differences in water quality are reflected in growth coefficient and relative condition factor of the major carp, Catla catla. Significantly higher levels of nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, nitrite) and ammonia, low plankton diversity, and significantly higher density of cyanophyceae were found in Yennehole lake (YL) compared to Belikere lake (BL). In addition, desmids were conspicuous by their absence in YL in contrast to their presence in BL. Concomitantly, growth factor (b) and relative condition factor (Kn) of C. catla were < 3 and < 1 respectively in YL whereas they were close to 3 (or > 3) and > 1 respectively in BL in all the seasons in during the study period. The contrasting b and Kn values of the same species in two lakes differing in water quality provide an evidence that deterioration in water quality though not enough to cause death of fish, does adversely affect growth and well being of fish.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2008	6	3					33	47		10.15666/aeer/0603_033047	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/0603_033047													WOS:000265576400003

The total concentrations of the PFASs in the water phase of the five rivers ranged from 0.14 to 346.72 ng L-1. The PFAS concentrations in the water phase were correlated positively to some selected water quality parameters such as chemical oxygen demand (COD) (0.7913) and conductivity (0.5642). The monitoring results for the water samples showed significant seasonal variations, while those for the sediment samples showed no obvious seasonal variations. Among the selected 18 PFASs, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was the dominant PFAS compound both in water and sediment for two seasons with its maximum concentration of 320.5 ng L-1 in water and 11.4 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw) in sediment, followed by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with its maximum concentration of 26.48 ng L-1 in water and 0.99 ng g(-1) dw in sediment. PFOS and PFOA were found at relatively higher concentrations in the Shima River and Danshui River than in the other three rivers (Xizhijiang River, Dongjiang River and Shahe River). The principal component analysis for the PFASs concentrations in water and sediment separated the sampling sites into two groups: rural and agricultural area, and urban and industrial area, suggesting the PFASs in the riverine environment were mainly originated from industrial and urban activities in the region.

We simulated the linkages between several water sources in the prospective limestone mining area and its surroundings with various geological formations. The approach in this study is by integrating hydrochemical analysis, isotope data, and mass-balance calculations to understand the hydrological system's linkages in a geologically complex area, particularly in the proposed limestone mining site. Twenty-two samples for hydro -chemical and isotopic analysis were taken spatially (in each geological formation) to represent various water sources: springs, caves, shallow groundwater, and deep groundwater. Hydrochemical analysis indicates that both caves and springs have a low degree of mineralization and mostly simple facies (Ca-HCO3). Further, both have lighter isotope values (delta 18O and delta 2H), meaning they are relatively younger and have not experienced advanced hydrochemical processes. Yet, the most interesting point is that the mass-balance modelling shows the bold information that the southern caves are not related to the springs. It is due to the mismatch between the ther-modynamic calculation and the actual condition. The southern caves are primarily supplied by rainwater, where >95% of the ions are evolved due to water-rock interaction, while the springs receive recharge from rainwater (40%) and other systems. Synthesizing the information, we hypothesize that mining the limestone in the southern part (consisting of the caves) will not disturb the springs as they are unrelated.

Contemporary and historic dynamics of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) eggs, larvae, and juveniles suggest recruitment bottleneck during first growing season	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												To determine if a survival bottleneck occurs in Lake Erie's lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) population and explore possible mechanisms responsible, we examined contemporary and historical dynamics of lake whitefish eggs, larvae and juveniles. Widespread spawning and low overwinter egg retention were observed in 2016-2018, however subsequent larval CPUE remained consistent with historical observations when regular recruitment occurred. Highest larval CPUE was consistently observed in nearshore areas 3-11 km from mid-lake spawning locations. Fall age-1 juvenile presence was predicted by fall age-0 catches, indicating the bottleneck occurs during the first growing season. Our results suggest the following: (1) factors limiting recruitment affect survival during or after the pelagic larval stage to fall age-0, and (2) physical and biological processes underlying connectivity between spawning and nearshore nursery habitats may be limiting recruitment. Future research focusing on larval nursery habitat characterization and lake whitefish growth and survival may reveal mechanisms affecting recruitment.

Increases in periphyton growth in lakes can be indicative of changes in water quality, shifts in ecosystem structure, and increases in nutrient fluxes. In oligotrophic lakes, conservationists are interested in characterizing the influence of hydrological drivers on excessive periphyton growth along nearshore areas. We collected nutrient samples bi-weekly from groundwater and surface water during a 9-month monitoring period to evaluate the timing and availability of nutrients to eulittoral periphyton in Lake Tahoe. Groundwater discharge rates were measured synoptically using seepage meters and estimated indirectly using continuous head gradient measurements and aquifer properties estimated by slug tests. The discharge measurements made from the seepage meter measurements provide information about the spatial variability perpendicular from shore along and the change in groundwater discharge due to wave action. Algal biomass sampled from substrates and observed using underwater photographs were used to correlate seasonal growth and nutrient concentrations in groundwater and lake water. Results indicate that groundwater and nutrient discharge are temporally variable due to seasonal changes in recharge within the watershed, wave action, and lake stage. Groundwater discharge was enhanced by the seasonally-low lake stage and episodic recharge caused by precipitation falling as rain in the watershed. Increases in dissolved phosphorus and nitrate in the lake during winter are attributed to groundwater discharge and correlates to increases in algal biomass in the nearshore area. Results indicate that nutrient-rich groundwater discharge appears to stimulate seasonal periphyton blooms along the eulittoral zone of Lake Tahoe.

Inter-annual variability of plankton abundance in these data sets shows strong correlation with two modes of climatic variability in the North Atlantic: the latitudinal shifts of the north wall of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Detailed analyses reveal that the connection between environmental forcing and plankton response depends on various mechanisms, i.e., timing and intensity of the spring phytoplankton bloom resulting from changes in stratification levels, changes in temperature, and. in the case of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, advection of the population into the North Sea at the end of the winter season. Future attempts to predict changes in marine ecosystems on the basis of climate scenarios will require focusing major effort on biological-physical modelling and large-scale plankton population ecology. The maintenance of long-term monitoring programmes is also essential to determine whether the climate-plankton connections observed during several decades will persist in the future or will be overruled by other mechanisms and principally human-induced perturbations.

A shallow (5 m) sill near the entrance controls fluid exchange between the estuary and the ocean. The main estuarine basin is relatively deep and wide and is in turn bounded at the upstream end by a shallower (2 m) secondary sill. An understanding of the dynamics associated with the circulation and response of the deep basin over intertidal time scales was required to predict the dispersal of nutrients and provide data to validate numerical models of the system. The dynamics of the deep basin were documented with several C-T-D-DO transects during intensive summer and winter experiments. A variety of internal features including lee waves, undular bores, and basin scale seiching were observed over a tidal cycle. The circulation pattern and the basin response are shown to depend on the interaction between the tidal dynamics, the sill control, and the Stratification produced by the gravitational overflow. A one-dimensional, three-layered analytical model was constructed to explain the basin response.																			0733-9429					OCT	1997	123	10					863	873		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1997)123:10(863)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1997)123:10(863)													WOS:A1997XX49400004

Contrasting trends in two East Asian populations of the Greater White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons	WILDFOWL												East Asian Greater White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons populations are less well defined and monitored than those in Europe and North America. Here, we combine historical and newly-reported telemetry data, wintering waterbirds surveys and expert advice to synthesis and update our knowledge of movements between the breeding and wintering distributions for Greater White-fronted Geese in East Asia. These sources suggest the existence of two biological flyway populations with contrasting population trends. The first consists of birds breeding on the Russian arctic, extending from the Khatanga River to east of Svyatoy Nos Cape (near Yana Bay, Yakutia), which migrates to winter in China where it is now almost totally confined to the Yangtze River floodplain. In recent years, this population has numbered between 30,000-55,000 individuals (compared to 140,000 in the 1990s), with > 70% concentrated at Poyang Lake in winter. The number of key sites identified for the species in China has increased with improved survey coverage since 2004. Birds from the second population also breed in arctic Russia, from east of Svyatoy Nos Cape to the Anadyr River, and winter in Japan and South Korea where 224,000-242,000 (in 2017/18 and 2018/19) and 178,000-182,000 (2018/19 and 2019/20) occur, respectively, compared to a total population size of 60,000 reported in the late 1990s. Although the telemetry studies provide single examples of tracked birds moving between the two populations, suggesting some permeability, we contend that the populations are relatively discrete, but recommend retaining three management units (for China-, Japan- and Korea-wintering birds) because of the count, management and legislative logic of doing so. The results given here provide a robust assessment of the current status of these populations, but between-year differences in count totals underline the need for continued improvement of the count system in China. They also build a stronger basis for the effective conservation for this species in the region, highlighting the need for improved monitoring and management for the declining numbers wintering in China.

Michael			Environmental drivers of phytoplankton community dynamics in an agriculturally-influenced tributary in the lower Great Lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Phytoplankton community composition in tributaries differs from that in their receiving waters, due to light limitation from suspended particles and other factors such as nutrient availability and temperature. This study was designed to manipulate light levels in early, mid, and late summer to determine the combined effects of light attenuation and naturally varying nutrient availability on phytoplankton community composition in an agriculturally-influenced tributary of the lower Great Lakes. In all trials, in situ microcosm experiments show that phytoplankton abundance increased under three light attenuation treatments (60 %, 75 %, and 85 % attenuation) relative to time-zero, but higher light attenuation reduced total phytoplankton abundance relative to controls. Highest phytoplankton diversity in terms of richness and evenness occurred in September (late summer), and across all three trials was lowest under the highest light attenuation treatments (85 %). Phytoplankton community composition followed a normal seasonal shift from diatoms dominating in June (early summer), followed by cyanobacteria dominating in mid to late summer. In general, lower light levels (especially 85 % attenuation) corresponded with an increased dominance of cyanobacteria. These findings support the hypothesis that phytoplankton abundance and diversity vary with light and nutrient availability and that light attenuation promotes the shift from buoyant cyanobacteria to other taxa more tolerant of low light levels.

Climatic controls on the water balance of a pilot-scale oil sands mining pit lake in the Athabasca oil sands region, Canada	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINING RECLAMATION AND ENVIRONMENT												Energy companies in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region in Alberta, Canada are evaluating the viability of incorporating pit lakes into reclamation closure designs to both sequester tailings and re-integrate the mining lease into the broader natural landscape. Lake Miwasin is a pilot-scale oil sands pit lake encompassed by a constructed catchment where the volume of the water cap is not actively managed. This study compared the water balance during the open water season over two consecutive years with contrasting levels of summertime precipitation. The first year had above average rainfall triggering surface water inflow events that diluted the over-winter water volume by similar to 25%. Flushing of the deepest layers of the water column was restricted from May - September as thermal stratification inhibited complete lake mixing. The second year had below average rainfall resulting in minimal surface water inflow and a drop in lake stage of similar to 30 cm. As the constructed catchment lacks both natural water bodies and connectivity to a legacy groundwater system, freshwater additions to the lake during the summer season were governed by rainfall. This research highlights challenges with constructing sustainable reclamation landscapes within a region characterised by variations in interannual and decadal water cycles.					; Ketcheson, Scott/GYD-4338-2022	Petrone, Richard/0000-0002-9569-4337; Ketcheson, Scott/0000-0002-9780-0308													1748-0930	1748-0949				APR 20	2024	38	4					306	323	2270301	10.1080/17480930.2023.2270301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480930.2023.2270301		OCT 2023											WOS:001098240200001
J	SWAIDNER, JE; BERRA, TM				SWAIDNER, JE; BERRA, TM			ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FISH DISTRIBUTION IN GREEN CREEK, A SPRING-FED STREAM IN NORTHERN OHIO	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The distribution of fishes in Green Creek, a spring-fed tributary of Sandusky Bay in northern Ohio [USA], was studied during June 1976-June 1977. A total of 31 spp. representing 22 genera and 10 families was taken at 8 stations along the length of the creek. Two cold water springs interrupt the longitudinal succession of fishes and cause the stream to be divided into 4 divisions, each with its own ecological characteristics and fauna: upland warm-water tributaries with Catastomus commersoni and cyprinids dominant; cold-water trout stream produced by stocking Salmo gairdneri near the spring, Cottus bairdi being an abundant native species in this division; marl substrate of low gradient with C. commersoni, cyprinids, darters and C. bairdi; and estuary of Lake Erie with typical lake fishes. The stations with the highest macroinvertebrate biomass also had the highest fish biomass. Various physical and chemical measurements were made showing that the marl deposits of the springs were not conducive to fish productivity. The distribution of fishes in Green Creek does not follow the classical pattern of longitudinal zonation but is determined by the unusual physical and chemical parameters induced by the springs.																			0030-0950						1979	79	2					84	92																WOS:A1979GQ48000008

During the winter months, waterbirds require certain foods to supply them with energy through the cold winter. Due to changes in the plant resources available to waterbirds, their intestinal bacteria will vary accordingly. In this study, we analysed the relationship between food composition and intestinal bacteria in hooded cranes (Grus monacha). We found that food resources from similar habitats were more similar, and the corresponding hooded crane intestinal bacteria were also more similar. The results show that the intestinal bacteria of hooded cranes had a certain adaptability to the type of food being consumed. This study contributes novel insights into the diet of hooded cranes in the winter months, allowing for improved protection and management strategies. As food is recognised as an important factor affecting the intestinal microbiota, seasonal changes in diet can influence the community composition. The hooded crane (Grus monacha) is an endangered migratory waterbird species, with some of the population wintering in the sallow lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain. Their food resources have changed seasonally, with a reduction resulting from wetland degradation. To cope with seasonal changes in food availability, hooded cranes must constantly adjust their foraging strategies to survive. We studied the effect of changes in diet on the intestinal bacterial diversity of hooded cranes at Shengjin Lake, using faecal microanalysis and high-throughput sequencing. The results show that the main foods of hooded cranes were Polygonum criopolitanum, Oryza sativa, and Carex spp., which were significantly related to the composition of the intestinal bacterial community. In addition, foods available from the similar habitats were more similar, and the corresponding hooded crane intestinal bacteria were also more similar. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus acidipiscis in January and March was significantly higher than in November. Our research shows that the intestinal bacteria of hooded cranes actively adapt to diet changes to overcome the negative impact of the reduction in food resources, which is vital to the survival of hooded cranes.

Appearance and establishment of diazotrophic cyanobacteria in Lake Kinneret, Israel	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We propose that the appearance and establishment of Nostocales (cyanobacteria) species of the genera Aphanizomenon and Cylindrospermopsis in the warm subtropical Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel) from 1994 was linked to changes in climate conditions and summer nitrogen (N) availability. 2. From 1994 to 2009, an increase in frequency of events of elevated water temperature (>29 degrees C) in summer, and to some extent a greater frequency of lower summer wind speed events, affected water turbulence and water column stratification, thus providing better physical conditions for the establishment of these populations. 3. In recent years, N-depleted conditions in Lake Kinneret in early summer have promoted the development and domination of Nostocales that could gain an ecological advantage owing to their N2-fixing capability. 4. Nitrogen fixation rates coincided both with heterocyst abundance and with Nostocales biomass. The N supplied to the lake via nitrogen fixation ranged from negligible quantities when Nostocales represented only a minor component of the phytoplankton community to 123 tonnes when Cylindrospermopsis bloomed in 2005. This high N2 fixation rate equals the average summer dissolved inorganic nitrogen load to the lake via the Jordan River.

Iestyn			Widespread loss of lake ice around the Northern Hemisphere in a warming world	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Ice provides a range of ecosystem services-including fish harvest(1), cultural traditions(2), transportation(3), recreation(4) and regulation of the hydrological cycle(5)-to more than half of the world's 117 million lakes. One of the earliest observed impacts of climatic warming has been the loss of freshwater ice(6), with corresponding climatic and ecological consequences(7). However, while trends in ice cover phenology have been widely documented(2,6,8,9), a comprehensive large-scale assessment of lake ice loss is absent. Here, using observations from 513 lakes around the Northern Hemisphere, we identify lakes vulnerable to ice-free winters. Our analyses reveal the importance of air temperature, lake depth, elevation and shoreline complexity in governing ice cover. We estimate that 14,800 lakes currently experience intermittent winter ice cover, increasing to 35,300 and 230,400 at 2 and 8 degrees C, respectively, and impacting up to 394 and 656 million people. Our study illustrates that an extensive loss of lake ice will occur within the next generation, stressing the importance of climate mitigation strategies to preserve ecosystem structure and function, as well as local winter cultural heritage.

The results were compared with observations on populations in other Frisian lakes, and with the results reported by other authors on brackish-water and marine populations of this species. Three generations were observed: 1 overwintering generation and 2 summer generations. Reproduction stopped completely during winter. During 1980, population densities of N. integer were relatively low in all Frisian lakes. In Slotermeer the maximum population density was only 6 individuals m-2, production amounted to 10 mg dry wt m-2 yr-1. The annual P/B [production to biomass] ratio was 4.0. The diet on N. integer consisted, in terms of biomass, of > 95% detritus and animal food, the latter mainly consisting of Bosmina and cyclopoid copepods. Feeding intensity reached a maximum at sunset. It was still high during the 1st part of the night and was low in the morning just after sunrise.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	93	1-2					41	51		10.1007/BF00008097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008097													WOS:A1982PH64800006

Surface nuclear magnetic resonance observations of permafrost thaw below floating, bedfast, and transitional ice lakes	GEOPHYSICS												Lakes in Arctic systems contribute to hydrologic storage, biogeochemical cycling, and permafrost thaw. Here, we have used surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on lakes of Alaska's North Slope to investigate the extent of permafrost thaw below lakes with different annual ice conditions. Our purpose is to understand if annual lake ice conditions are related to development of thawed permafrost below lakes. We investigated 10 lakes and two terrestrial permafrost control sites using surface NMR and direct measurement under spring conditions when lake ice is nearly at its thickest. We did not observe unfrozen water below our surveyed bedfast ice lakes, whereas unfrozen water (indicating permafrost thaw) was measured below floating ice lakes. We found that transitional ice lakes, ones that alternate between floating and bedfast ice conditions over multiyear timescales depending on winter ice growth and lake level conditions, have complex vertical unfrozen water content profiles attributed to sporadic periods of thaw. Based on that finding, we speculate that predicting the presence of talik based on remotely sensed lake ice conditions is unreliable. We applied a scheme to subtract the lake water signal from the NMR data and found the resulting inversions to be improved.

J	Whaling, A; Shaw, J				Whaling, Amanda; Shaw, John			Changes to Subaqueous Delta Bathymetry Following a High River Flow Event, Wax Lake Delta, USA	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The construction of the subaqueous delta front is foundational to deltaic land building and field data is needed to validate conceptual models of delta front evolution. The bathymetric change that occurred across the entire delta front (similar to 75.9 km(2)) of the Wax Lake Delta (WLD) in coastal Louisiana was measured between February 2015 and July 2016. Sediment removal (- 9.85 x 10(6) m(3)) exceeded sediment accumulation (7.64 x 10(6) m(3)), making the delta front net-erosional (- 2.21 x 10(6) m(3)) despite the occurrence of a flood. These results factor in an estimated 4.28 cm of subsidence during the survey period. Deposition on the delta front was localized around channels and the northern and eastern flanks of the delta whereas erosion was more spatially uniform. This erosion coincides with an anomalously strong winter storm season that may have exported this sediment offshore and is consistent with a growing body of research that identifies winter storms as a significant mechanism for sediment removal from Atchafalaya Bay. Winter storm erosion is crucial to understanding and predicting volumetric growth of the WLD and has important implications to land building from sediment diversions. Future models of deltaic growth need to account for significant volume export and erosive episodes on the delta front.

J	Sullivan, AR; Flaspohler, DJ; Froese, RE; Ford, D				Sullivan, Alexis R.; Flaspohler, David J.; Froese, Robert E.; Ford, Daena			Climate variability and the timing of spring raptor migration in eastern North America	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Many birds have advanced their spring migration and breeding phenology in response to climate change, yet some long-distance migrants appear constrained in their adjustments. In addition, bird species with long generation times and those in higher trophic positions may also be less able to track climate-induced shifts in food availability. Migratory birds of prey may therefore be particularly vulnerable to climate change because: 1) most are long-lived and have relatively low reproductive capacity, 2) many feed predominately on insectivorous passerines, and 3) several undertake annual migrations totaling tens of thousands of kilometers. Using multi-decadal datasets for 14 raptor species observed at six sites across the Great Lakes region of North America, we detected phenological shifts in spring migration consistent with decadal climatic oscillations and global climate change. While the North Atlantic and El Nino Southern Oscillations exerted heterogeneous effects on the phenology of a few species, arrival dates more generally advanced by 1.18 d per decade, a pattern consistent with the effects of global climate change. After accounting for heterogeneity across observation sites, five of the 10 most abundant species advanced the bulk of their spring migration phenology. Contrary to expectations, we found that long-distance migrants and birds with longer generation times tended to make the greatest advancements to their spring migration. Such results may indicate that phenotypic plasticity can facilitate climatic responses among these long-lived predators.

J	VINCENT, WF; GIBBS, MM; SPIGEL, RH				VINCENT, WF; GIBBS, MM; SPIGEL, RH			EUTROPHICATION PROCESSES REGULATED BY A PLUNGING RIVER INFLOW	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Rotoiti (North Island, New Zealand) is a deep mesotrophic lake that has declined in water quality over the last 30 years. The main river entering the lake was identified as the primary enrichment source, but its interaction with the surrounding lakewater varied with season and time of day. During winter the river was colder than the lake and penetrated 6-8 km into the main basin as an underflow. In summer the river often entered as a plunging inflow during the early morning, but it warmed during the day, and in the afternoon entered the lake as a buoyant jet that flowed directly to a nearby outlet river. From continuous temperature measurements in the inflow and lake surface it was estimated that the river plunged and penetrated the lake as an interflow or underflow for 60.2% of the year. This translated into 31% of the N and 64% of the P loading on the lake. The river also injected phytoplankton into the main basin of Lake Rotoiti, including populations of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. The underflow was the dominant term in calculating the hydraulic flushing time of the main basin, and also made a large contribution of dissolved oxygen to the subsurface waters. These complex interactions between Lake Rotoiti and its inflowing river were controlled by small temperature differences (< 3-degrees-C), and had wide-ranging implications in the eutrophication process.

J	Reese, BK; Andersorr, MA; Amrhein, C				Reese, Brandi Kiel; Andersorr, Michael A.; Amrhein, Christopher			Hydrogen sulfide production and volatilization in a polymictic eutrophic saline lake, Salton Sea, California	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Salton Sea is a large shallow saline lake located in southern California that is noted for high sulfate concentrations, substantial algal productivity, and very warm water column temperatures. These conditions are well-suited for sulfide production, and sulfide has been implicated in summer fish kills, although no studies have been conducted to specifically understand hydrogen sulfide production and volatilization there. Despite polymictic mixing patterns and relatively short accumulation periods, the amount of sulfide produced is comparable to meromictic lakes. Sulfide levels in the Salton Sea reached concentrations of 1.2 mmol L-1 of total free sulfide in the hypolimnion and 5.6 mmol L-1 in the sediment pore water. Strong winds in late July mixed H2S into the surface water, where it depleted the entire water column of dissolved oxygen and reached a concentration of 0.1 mmol L-1. Sulfide concentrations exceeded the toxicity threshold of tilapia (Oreochromis mossumbicus) and combined with strong anoxia throughout the water column, resulted in a massive fish kill. The mixing of sulfide into the surface waters also increased atmospheric H2S concentrations, reaching 1.0 mu mol m(-3). The flux of sulfide from the sediment into the water column was estimated to range from 2-3 mmol m(-2) day(-1) during the winter and up to 8 mmol m(-2) day(-1) during the summer. Application of the two-layer model for volatilization indicates that up to 19 mmol m(-2) day(-1) volatilized from the surface during the mixing event. We estimate that as much as 3400 Mg year(-1) or approximately 26% of sulfide that diffused into the water column from the deepest sediments may have been volatilized to the atmosphere.

J	Rodo, X; Baert, E; Comin, FA				Rodo, X; Baert, E; Comin, FA			Variations in seasonal rainfall in southern Europe during the present century: Relationships with the North Atlantic Oscillation and the El Nino Southern Oscillation	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Analysis of data from seventeen rainfall stations in the Iberian Peninsula, Balearic Islands and Northern Africa has revealed significant El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signals in Europe. Both North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Southern Oscillation (SO) exert an influence on Iberian climate, but at different temporal and spatial scales. Though most of the peninsula is under NAO influence in winter, some stations in the eastern region show no connection with this phenomenon. The same is found for ENSO, with a positively correlated region appearing in the eastern part of Spain, while the rest of the peninsula remains insensitive. The correlation between ENSO and Iberian rainfall has increased towards the end of the present century, with strong positive signals spanning over half of the area studied. The percentage of springtime variability due to ENSO has similarly increased, reaching up to 50% in certain areas. We also show how there are outstanding climatic sensors of these phenomena such as Lake Gallocanta, which manifests a positive response to ENSO while appears insensitive to NAO. Common long-term patterns are observed between SOI and an inferred lake level series, suggesting a constant influence of the low-frequency component of ENSO throughout the period considered. Lake drying phases every 14 years reflect the impact of this signal, approximately every four ENSO events.

The opposing effects of predation and starvation mortality are predicted to result in trade-offs between traits that optimize fitness during periods of resource plenty (e.g., during the growing season) and those that optimize fitness during periods of resource scarcity (e.g., during the winter). We conducted a common environment experiment with two genetically distinct strains of rainbow trout to investigate trade-offs due to (1) the balance of growth and predation risk related to foraging rate during the growing season and (2) the allocation of energy to body size prior to the winter. Fry (age 0) from both strains were stocked into replicate natural lakes at low and high elevation that differed in winter duration (i.e., ice cover) by 59 days. Overwinter survival was lowest in the high-elevation lakes for both strains. Activity rate and growth rate were highest at high elevation, but growing season survival did not differ between strains or between environments. Hence, we did not observe a trade-off between growth and predation risk related to foraging rate. Growth rate also differed significantly between the strains across both environments, which suggests that growth rate is involved in local adaptation. There was not, however, a difference between strains or between environments in energy storage. Hence, we did not observe a trade-off between growth and storage. Our findings suggest that intrinsic metabolic rate, which affects a trade-off between growth rate and overwinter survival, may influence local adaptation in organisms that experience particularly harsh winter conditions (e.g., extended periods trapped beneath the ice in high-elevation lakes) in some parts of their range.

Here, we investigate the oxygen budget of four arctic lakes using high-frequency data during two winters in three shallow lakes (9-13 m maximal depth) and four winters in 24 m deep main basin of Toolik Lake. Incubation experiments measured sediment metabolism. Volume-averaged oxygen depletion measured in situ was independent of water temperature and duration of the ice-covered period. Average rates were between 0.2 and 0.39 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) in the shallow lakes and between 0.03 and 0.14 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) in Toolik Lake, with higher rates in smaller lakes with their larger sediment area to volume ratio. Rates decreased to similar to 20%-50% of initial values in late winter in the shallow lakes but less or not at all in Toolik. The lack of a decline in Toolik Lake points to continued oxygen transport to the sediment-water interface where oxygen consumption occurs. In all lakes, lower in situ oxygen depletion than in incubation measurements points toward increasing anoxia in the lower water column depressing loss rates. In Toolik, oxygen loss during early winter was less in years with minimal snow cover. Penetrative convection occurred, which could mix downwards oxygen produced by photosynthesis or excluded during ice formation. Estimates of these terms exceeded photosynthesis measured in sediment incubations. Modeling under ice-oxygen dynamics requires consideration of optical properties and biological and transport processes that modify oxygen concentrations and distributions.					; Schwefel, Robert/AAF-7505-2019; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022	Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; Schwefel, Robert/0000-0003-1610-4181; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2023	68	7					1470	1489		10.1002/lno.12357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12357		APR 2023											WOS:000977024600001

Phylogenies of Microcystin-Producing Cyanobacteria in the Lower Laurentian Great Lakes Suggest Extensive Genetic Connectivity	PLOS ONE												Lake St. Clair is the smallest lake in the Laurentian Great Lakes system. MODIS satellite imagery suggests that high algal biomass events have occurred annually along the southern shore during late summer. In this study, we evaluated these events and tested the hypothesis that summer bloom material derived from Lake St. Clair may enter Lake Erie via the Detroit River and represent an overlooked source of potentially toxic Microcystis biomass to the western basin of Lake Erie. We conducted a seasonally and spatially resolved study carried out in the summer of 2013. Our goals were to: 1) track the development of the 2013 summer south-east shore bloom 2) conduct a spatial survey to characterize the extent of toxicity, taxonomic diversity of the total phytoplankton population and the phylogenetic diversity of potential MC-producing cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Planktothrix and Anabaena) during a high biomass event, and 3) compare the strains of potential MC-producers in Lake St. Clair with strains from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Our results demonstrated a clear predominance of cyanobacteria during a late August bloom event, primarily dominated by Microcystis, which we traced along the Lake St. Clair coastline downstream to the Detroit River's outflow at Lake Erie. Microcystin levels exceeded the Province of Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standard (1.5 mu g L-1) for safe drinking water at most sites, reaching up to five times this level in some areas.

J	Yuan, Y; Liu, BL; Liu, H				Yuan, Yi; Liu, Baolin; Liu, Hao			Geochemical characteristics of sediments from East Dongting Lake and their implications for provenance and weathering	GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL												Dongting Lake is the second-largest freshwater lake in China. To better understand the geochemical characteristics of the sediment in different seasons and identify the possible provenance, 44 sediment samples collected from East Dongting Lake (ED Lake) in summer (ED-S) and winter (ED-W) were used for elemental geochemical analysis. Geochemically, the sediment samples are classified as shale, and the chondrite normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns of the ED-S and ED-W have light REE (LREE) enriched, flat heavy REE (HREE) patterns with a negative Eu anomaly. In the present study, the correlations between certain elements show that the variations in sigma REE contents in sediments may be due to the concentrations of heavy minerals like monazite, whereas grain size is not responsible for that variations. Chemical index of alteration (CIA), plagioclase index of alteration (PIA) values, A-CN-K diagram, and Th/U ratios of the ED-S and ED-W sediment indicate a moderate to high intensity of chemical weathering in the source area. The Al2O3/TiO2 ratio, discriminant function diagram, REE patterns, and elemental ratios indicate the contribution of sediments from felsic and intermediate source rocks. The provenance index (PI) based on REEs geochemical parameters suggest that elemental compositions of sediment in East Dongting Lake approach the Upper Yangtze River.																			1226-4806	1598-7477				JUN	2022	26	3					335	348		10.1007/s12303-021-0040-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12303-021-0040-4		FEB 2022											WOS:000755411300001

The exploration the phytoplankton index of biotic integrity (P-IBI) has been proposed to assess the ecological health of the large drinking-water reservoirs. This study investigated phytoplankton communities and environmental variables at 19 sampling sites in the Danjiangkou Reservoir from October 2019 to July 2021. Results showed that 170 species of phytoplankton from 9 phyla were detected in Danjiangkou Reservoir, and the total density varied from 0.61 x 10(5) to 36.64 x 10(5) cells/L, with the mean value of 8.83 x 10(5) cells/L. The P-IBI values were higher in winter and lower in spring in terms of time, and the spatial trend of P-IBI values from high to low was outlet of the reservoir > entrance of Dan Reservoir > entrance of Han Reservoir > Han Reservoir > Dan Reservoir. Linear regression analysis showed that the evaluation results of P-IBI and the comprehensive trophic level index (TLI) evaluation were generally consistent. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed significant correlations between P-IBI and candidate indicators and major environmental factors with significant differences between seasons. The P-IBI is an effective tool to evaluate the ecological health of large drinking-water reservoirs and could provide some scientific reference for the ecological health assessment of large drinking-water reservoirs.

Benthic nitrogen regeneration, fixation, and denitrification in a temperate, eutrophic lake: Effects on the nitrogen budget and cyanobacteria blooms	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Nitrogen (N) transformations and fluxes at the sediment-water interface (SWI) were measured in Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain, to clarify the role of N in cyanobacterial blooms in temperate, eutrophic lakes. N sources (e.g., N fixation and tributary inputs), sinks (e.g., denitrification/anammox), and internal "links" (e.g., dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+; DNRA) were evaluated at a river discharge (PRM) and in the central basin (MB). Sediments were a more effective NO3- sink at PRM than MB. Sediments at both sites were a net NH4+ source to the water column, but DNRA was not a consistent NH4+ regeneration pathway. Net N-2 production at PRM in summer reversed to net N-2 consumption/fixation in fall. MB sediments produced N-2 at lower rates than PRM; these rates also reversed late in the season. Denitrification was limited by NO3-, especially at MB, and anammox may have contributed up to 10% of total N-2 production. Sediment N-2 fixation occurred simultaneously with denitrification throughout the ice-free season and, on average, compensated 25-30% of total microbial N losses. A bottom-water hypoxia event at MB in early July 2009 altered the N cycle, with lower actual denitrification rates and higher NH4+ effluxes (not from DNRA), while phosphorus (P) flux was unaffected. The hypoxia-altered N transformation pathways enhanced N bioavailability (but not P) and may have contributed to a non-N-fixing cyanobacterial bloom (Microcystis) observed 5 d later. A preliminary N budget incorporating sediment and water column sources and sinks and external loads suggested an ecosystem-wide N deficit.

WINTERING OF PASSERINE BIRDS IN THE LAGUNA OF MEDINA (CADIZ, SPAIN)	REVISTA DE SOCIEDAD GADITANA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Wintering passerines birds in the Lagoon of Medina. By performance 36 linear transects in the bush and 26 in the marsh vegetation it has been obtained that the most abundant populations studied during in the winters have been those of Erithacus rubecula, Turdus philomelos and Sylvia atricapilla in the thicket, and Turdus philomelos in the marsh vegetation. The resulting density was high, reaching 270 birds/10 ha in scrub land, and 284 birds/10 ha in the marsh area. The dominance has also proven to be high and is conditioned by Sylvia atricapilla in the bush and Turdus philomelos in the marsh area. Therefore, the community of passerines in this lake fluctuates depending on the populations of the three species that come to spend the winter.																			1577-2578	2340-5759					2015	9						35	39																WOS:000215554400008

Wind effects on habitat use by wintering waders in an inland lake of the Iberian Peninsula	ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Wind effects on habitat use by wintering waders in an inland lake of the Iberian Peninsula. We aimed to identify the effects of the direction and wind speed on feeding habitat selection of wintering dunlins and little stints in an inland lake of the Iberian Peninsula. Feeding habitat (muddy surface or shallow water) and location in the lake with respect to wind direction (windward and leeward) of feeding flocks of both species were assessed on days with different wind speed (light or strong). We also performed visual counts of potential prey items (zooplankton) in mud and water habitats. In light wind conditions, wader flocks mostly selected the shallow water on the lake's leeward shore. On the contrary, in strong wind conditions, the birds tended to forage on the windward shore, with a similar frequency in mud and shallow water habitats. The abundance of prey items in the mud and water column varied according to wind conditions, being higher in the sites preferred by waders. Our findings advance knowledge on how small-sized waders cope with environmental dynamics of wind in non-tidal lakes.

ORGANIC TREATMENTS FOR CONTROL OF PEPPER WEEVIL (COLEOPTERA: CURCULIONIDAE)	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST												The pepper weevil, Anthonomus eugenii Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major pest of pepper (Capsicum spp.; Solanales: Solanaceae) in the southern United States, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Feeding and oviposition cause flower and fruit abscission and internal fruit damage resulting in serious yield losses. Females lay eggs in flower buds and small fruits, shielding larvae from contact pesticides, leaving only the adult stage vulnerable. The purpose of this study was to investigate low-risk and organic products for use against the pepper weevil to provide both organic and conventional growers with more control options. A neem product (Ecozin (R) 1.2% ME), kaolin clay (Surround (R) WP), diatomaceous earth (Red Lake Earth (R)) and a product based on plant terpenes (Requiem (R)), were tested in lab and field trials for efficacy against pepper weevil. The neem product did not reduce feeding or oviposition in lab choice and no choice tests, so it was not tested in the field. Kaolin clay, diatomaceous earth and Requiem reduced feeding and oviposition in lab trials. Spring and fall field tests of these products were conducted in small plots along with a standard pesticide rotation of Actara and Vydate and an untreated control. The only treatment to increase marketable yield was the standard pesticide rotation. In the spring field trial, the standard treatment doubled yield per plant compared to the untreated controls but the yield was not different from those in the kaolin clay and surround plots. While the organic products did not increase marketable yield significantly, they did decrease overall damage, indicating possible usefulness in combination with conventional insecticides or in low population pressure by spraying early and following appropriate cultural practices such as adequate fallow periods and crop destruction. We recommend further testing of diatomaceous earth in particular in combination with conventional and organic insecticides as part of future IPM program research.

However, it is unclear whether the mechanisms responsible for Asian dust storms during the Holocene varied on different timescales, and thus it is unclear whether there was a shift from a natural forcing to an anthropogenic forcing of dust storms. We reconstructed a high-resolution Holocene record of dust storms from the sediments of an undisturbed alpine lake on the Chinese Loess Plateau. We found that Asian dust storm activity generally increased during the Holocene, with the largest fluctuations occurring during the past 2000 years. The increase in dust storm activity was in contrast to the decrease in East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) intensity during the Holocene, indicating that the EAWM played a limited role in modulating dust storms. By contrast, the increase in dust storms corresponded to a decrease in East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation. This demonstrates that EASM precipitation was the dominant control of dust storm activity on a millennial timescale, because decreased EASM precipitation expanded the desert area and thus increased the dust storm activity. The increasing intensity of human activity in the region since the Bronze Age resulted in an acceleration of dust storm activity against the background of decreased EASM precipitation. As human disturbance continued to intensify, beginning at least at -2 cal ka BP, increased dust storms were closely linked to increasing human populations in the dust source regions, and there is a strong temporal coherence between increased dust storms and higher EASM precipitation. This was completely different from when natural processes are dominant. During that period, fewer dust storms occurred during periods of a strengthened EASM. Therefore, there was a shift from a natural forcing to an anthropogenic forcing of dust storms on a multi-decadal to centennial timescale, and was a mode in which "human activity overtook the EASM as the dominant control of the Earth surface system".

This study aimed to clarify hydrothermal flows within recharge and discharge areas of a geothermal system. We selected a well-known high-temperature geothermal field with twophase reservoir in Southern Bandung, West Java (Indonesia) as a case study target, and collected 31 river/spring samples and 8 well rock samples. The measured total REE series concentrations ranged widely in the water samples, i.e., rivers: 3.4-35 ppt, cold springs: 0.3-284 ppt, and hot springs: 1.4 ppt to 102 ppm. Enrichment of light REEs (LREEs) in the water samples was characterized more clearly by Post Archean Australian Shale normalization than by chondrite normalization. Speciation analysis derived the following interpretations: dissolved REEs in the river water originated from free ions or Ln3+ that are typically contained in near-surface groundwater, and the dominant components were carbonate (LnCO3+) and Ln3+ complexes in the cold springs and LnCO3+ complexation in the hot springs. Steam and gas condensation into less-oxygenated groundwater can be indicated by rich LnCO3+. Only one hot spring was interpreted as being directly connected with the reservoir by strong H2S condensation and LREE enrichment. The water of the other cold and hot springs probably underwent dilution, evaporation, and magmatic gas condensation through shallow, deep, and deep-perched aquifers, permeable zones, and a major fault within the recharge and discharge areas. REE results also suggest that the main constituents of the aquifers are carbonates and silicate minerals and hydrothermally altered lahars, andesitic lava, and pyroclastic flow deposits. REEs facilitate detailed interpretation of geochemistry facies in shallow-deep waters of a hydrothermal system. Finally, integration of the analysis results of REEs, major anions and cations, water isotopes, and strontium isotopes improved a conceptual model of groundwater flows and recharge-discharge interactions in aquifers feeding a geothermal reservoir.					; Kashiwaya, Koki/IAQ-2759-2023; Katsuaki, Koike/AAF-6438-2020; Shoedarto, Riostantieka/AAU-1583-2021; Iskandar, Irwan/AAB-4848-2021	Shoedarto, Riostantieka Mayandari/0000-0003-1324-7865; Koike, Katsuaki/0000-0003-2195-1369; 													0375-6505	1879-3576				NOV	2022	105								102507	10.1016/j.geothermics.2022.102507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2022.102507		JUL 2022											WOS:000831708900003

During an ESCS, northern Eurasia is controlled by large-scale positive SLP anomalies and an anomalous anticyclone that continuously transport northern cold air to North China, causing significant, persistent, lower-than-normal daily temperatures. In fact, these positive SLP and anticyclonic wind anomalies begin to appear over northwestern Europe about 10 days prior to the ESCS. The anticyclonic wind anomalies keep moving southeastward and expand to the west of Lake Baikal until two days before the ESCS. Then, the center of the anomalous low-level anticyclone moves over Lake Baikal, inducing northerly wind anomalies that transport cold air into North China. In the following days, as the positive SLP anomalies weaken, the anomalous anticyclone and related northerly winds appear to wane, and the ESCS gradually comes to an end. The results may prove meaningful for the prediction and early warning of ESCSs.

Cadmium Health Risk Assessment and Anthropogenic Sources of Pollution in Mount-Lebanon Springs	EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic heavy metal with low permissible limits. This study aims at conducting a health risk assessment for Cd and examining potential sources of pollution in springs of the Mount-Lebanon Governorate, a semi-urbanized area in Lebanon. A total of 31 spring samples were collected during the wet and dry seasons and tested for water quality. Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry was used to quantify Cd levels in water. Risk assessment was performed by means of a survey on water consumption and usage, and followed the USEPA Hazard Quotient (HQ) model. Correlations with different human activities were examined using different linear regression models and spatial analysis tools. Results highlight springs within El Metn and Keserwan Districts as posing a non-carcinogenic health risk in (1) Ain Saadeh both in adults (HQ(wet) = 1.94) and iron-deficient children (HQ(wet) = 1.29), and (2) Faraya both in healthy (HQ(wet) = 1.33; HQ(dry) = 1.19) and iron-deficient children (HQ(wet) = 2.67; HQ(dry) = 2.37), as well as in iron-deficient adults (HQ(wet) = 1.57; HQ(dry) = 1.39). In addition, Cd levels increased significantly with proximity to upstream open dumps (Pearson's r = - 0.511; p = 0.003), agricultural land surface area, increased upstream industrial activity, mainly jewelry and fine stones industries in both bivariate (r = 0.33; p = 0.001) and multivariate analyses (r = 0.41; p = 0.002), plastic industries (Pearson's r = 0.36; p = 0.05), and furniture manufacturing (Pearson's r = 0.38; p = 0.038). Our findings constitute the first report assessing Cd health risk and identifying sources of pollution in Mount-Lebanon, and make a strong basis for a risk management strategy.

Based on the recent data obtained by a digital recorder and laboratory experiments newly conducted on the rock's electrical properties, we have reexamined the nature of the seismic resistivity changes. New findings so far obtained from in-situ observation are as follows. (1) A coseismic step lakes place on arrival of the S-wave rather than that of the P-wave. (2) The polarity of the coseismic step shows no correlation to the source mechanism of the earthquake, but shows a clear seasonal variation; i.e. positive steps appear in summer but are negative in winter. (3) There is a seasonal variation in the Earth's resistivity with minimum and maximum in October and in April, respectively. The polarity of coseismic resistivity steps has a good correlation with the rate of seasonal variation of the ground resistivity itself. Combining these observations with results of recently made laboratory experiments, we present a tentative model for coseismic resistivity step generation which proposes mixing of temperature stratification in the shallow ground due to ground oscillation by seismic S-waves.

Water-quality characteristics and contaminants in the rural karst-dominated Spring Mill Lake watershed, southern Indiana	PERSPECTIVES ON KARST GEOMORPHOLOGY, HYDROLOGY, AND GEOCHEMISTRY: A TRIBUTE VOLUME TO DEREK C. FORD AND WILLIAM B. WHITE	Geological Society of America Special Papers				Annual Meeting of the Geological-Society-of-America	NOV 04, 2003	Seattle, WA	Geol Soc Amer				The Spring Mill Lake watershed is located in the Mitchell Plateau, a karst area that developed on Mississippian carbonates in southern Indiana. Spring Mill Lake is a reservoir built in the late 1930s and is located in Spring Mill State Park. Within the park, groundwater from subsurface conduits issues as natural springs and then flows in surface streams to the lake. From 1998 to 2002, surface and subsurface hydrology and water quality were investigated to determine the types and sources of potential contaminants entering the lake. Water samples collected during base flow and a February 2000 storm event were analyzed for selected cations, anions, trace elements, selected U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary and secondary drinking-water contaminants, nitrogen isotopes, suspended solids, Escherichia coli, and pesticides. All of the water samples met the EPA drinking-water standards for inorganic constituents, except those collected at five sites in August 1999 during a drought. Nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations were highest during base-flow conditions and displayed a dilutional trend during peak-flow periods. The NO3-N concentrations in water samples collected during the 2001 spring fertilizer applications tended to increase from early to late spring. All of the delta N-15 values were low, which is indicative of either an inorganic source or soil organic matter. Storm discharge contained increased concentrations of total suspended solids; thus, storms are responsible for most of the sediment accumulation in the lake. E. coli levels in 24% of the samples analyzed contained a most probable number (MPN) greater than 235/100 mL, which is the maximum acceptable level set for recreational waters in Indiana. E. coli does appear to be a potential health risk, particularly at Rubble spring. The sources of E. coli found at this spring may include barnyard runoff from a horse barn or wastes from a wastewater treatment facility. The pesticides atrazine, metolachlor, acetochlor, and simazine were detected during the spring of 2001. Atrazine, metolachlor, acetochlor, and simazine are used to suppress weeds during corn and soybean production. Additional sources of atrazine and simazine may result from application to right-of-ways, orchards, and managed forest areas.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2404-1				2006	404						153	167		10.1130/2006.2404(13)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2006.2404(13)													WOS:000271201000014

Also, a nutrient bioassay was conducted to clarify whether the growth rate and photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry of small and large phytoplankton are limited by nutrient availability. Large phytoplankton, which have lower intracellular Chl-a concentrations, had higher maximum PSII photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) but lower non-photochemical quenching (NPQ(NSV)) than small phytoplankton under both dark and increased light conditions. The nutrient bioassay revealed that the PSII photochemistry of small phytoplankton was restricted by N and P deficiency at the pelagic site even at the end of the stratification period, while that of large phytoplankton was not. These results suggest that large phytoplankton have lower susceptibility to PSII photodamage than small phytoplankton due to lower intracellular Chl-a concentrations. The size dependency of susceptibility to PSII photoinactivation may play a key role in large algal blooms in oligotrophic water.

Here, we examined if spatial allocation of the wastewater discharge by a specially constructed sediment diffuser pipe system enhanced the microbial nitrate reduction processes. Full-scale experiments were set on two Finnish lake sites, Keuruu and Petajavesi, and effects on the nitrate removal processes were studied using the stable isotope pairing technique. All nitrate reduction rates followed nitrate concentrations, being highest at the wastewater-influenced sampling points. Complete denitrification with N-2 as an end-product was the main nitrate reduction process, indicating that the high nitrate and organic matter concentrations of wastewater did not promote nitrous oxide (N2O) production (truncated denitrification) or ammonification (dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium; DNRA). Using 3D simulation, we demonstrated that the sediment diffusion method enhanced the contact time and amount of wastewater near the sediment surface especially in spring and in autumn, altering organic matter concentration and oxygen levels, and increasing the denitrification capacity of the sediment. We estimated that natural denitrification potentially removed 3-10% of discharged wastewater nitrate in the 33 ha study area of Keuruu, and the sediment diffusion method increased this areal denitrification capacity on average 45%. Overall, our results indicate that sediment diffusion method can supplement wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) nitrate removal without enhancing alternative harmful processes. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Our objective was to compare the responses of the littoral and pelagic plant communities to this physical disturbance. Water-chemistry changes were muted, and neither nitrogen nor phosphorus concentration changed. Phytoplankton biomass, species assemblages, productivity, and nutrient status were largely unaffected except for small changes in species diversity and relative abundance of cyanobacteria and cryptophytes. Despite possible transient changes in functional and structural properties, the principal disruption for benthic algae was loss of colonizable surfaces. Floating-leaved and submersed macrophytes (hydrophytes) responded initially with large decreases in biomass and cover. The subsequent response of hydrophytes to drawdown varied: relative frequency of isoetids such as Eriocaulon septangulare decreased, while that of pondweeds such as Potamogeton spirillus increased. The trophic impacts of declining lake levels, whether due to hydroelectric reservoir manipulations or climate change, are likely to be much greater in the littoral zone than in the pelagic zone if major nutrients are unaltered.																			0706-652X					MAY	2005	62	5					991	1003		10.1139/F05-003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F05-003													WOS:000229594600004

The Effect of an Extreme Rain Event on the Biogeochemistry and Ecosystem Metabolism of an Oligotrophic High-Elevation Lake	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We characterized the effect of an extreme rain event on the biogeochemistry and ecosystem metabolism of an oligotrophic Sierra Nevada (California) lake. During a 10 hour period of an autumn season rainfall event, lake discharge increased from <1.0 L s(-1) to over 3000 L s(-1), reaching a rate one order of magnitude higher than found during peak snowmelt. Large quantities of terrestrial particulate and dissolved organic matter were washed into the lake. An entire season of autochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was flushed and replaced by allochthonous DOC as light attenuation increased by >300%. The resulting truncation of the photic zone, reduction of water column chlorophyll-a, and increase in particulate and dissolved organic matter available to microbes resulted in a 47% reduction in whole lake gross primary production and 30% increase in respiration relative to average autumn values. As a consequence, the lake went from being slightly autotrophic to strongly heterotrophic. If rain events increase in frequency, as many climate change models predict, increased terrestrial inputs to Sierran lakes may result in more frequent periods of reduced primary production, increased periods of hypoxia and anoxia, and an ecosystem shift toward net heterotrophy during the ice-free season.

To assess long-term environmental change experienced by low-nutrient, dimictic New Brunswick lakes we use sedimentary remains of algal pigments and Cladocera in dated cores from impact (prone to late-summer algal blooms, Lac Unique) and reference (no observed algal blooms, First and States) lakes. Overall, all three lakes now exhibit greater bosminid abundance and fewer daphniids, lower Cladocera richness, and smaller average cladoceran body size, although some lake-specific differences in assemblage response exist that cannot be related solely to top-down or bottom-up forces. Zooplankton trends are most pronounced at Lac Unique and First Lake, where algal production is generally greater. Across all three lakes, the only significant (IndVal: p < 0.05) cladoceran bioindicator of the post-1990 period is the pelagic bosminid group, whereas prior to 1990, Daphnia longispina-complex and several littoral taxa were significant (IndVal: p < 0.05) bioindicators. These temporal shifts suggest that the smaller-bodied bosminid group may now be favored over its larger-bodied pelagic competitor Daphnia sp. in these lakes, irrespective of heterogeneous long-term algal patterns inferred from stable sedimentary pigments. We suggest that the indirect effects of climate change, principally during the spring and summer quarters in New Brunswick, may be associated with marked shifts in limnological structure, as evidenced by changes in dominant zooplankton of the pelagic zone. However, further research is needed to rule out whether or not size-selective predation, and its potential interactions with climate change and other stressors, are key mechanisms favoring increased bosminids in low-nutrient, dimictic lakes.

Stronger southern atmospheric circulation up to the latitude of Colonia was found for the penultimate glacial with lower temperatures than during the last glacial, while strengthening of the South American summer monsoon (SASM) circulation started during the last interglacial and progressively enhanced a longer wet summer season from 95 ka until the present. Past MAAT variations and fire history were possibly modulated by eccentricity, although with signatures which differ in average and in amplitude between the last 180 ka. Vegetation responses were driven by the interplay between the SASM and southern circulation linked to Antarctic ice volume, inferred by the presence of a cool mixed evergreen forest from 180 to 45 ka progressively replaced by a rainforest. We report cooler temperatures during the marine isotope stage 3 (MIS 3: 57-29 ka) than during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 23-19 ka). Our findings show that tropical forest dynamics display different patterns than mid-latitude during the last 180 ka.

J	Poiger, T; Buser, HR; Müller, MD				Poiger, T; Buser, HR; Müller, MD			Photodegradation of the pharmaceutical drug diclofenac in a lake: Pathway, field measurements, and mathematical modeling	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Vertical concentration profiles of diclofenac were measured in Lake Greifensee (Switzerland) under mixed (February/December) and stratified (July) lake conditions. The concentrations ranged from 1 to 12 ng/L and were lower in summer than in winter, especially near the lake surface, pointing to an efficient elimination of diclofenac by photodegradation in the lake. Laboratory experiments confirmed the rapid photodegradation of diclofenac in water when exposed to sunlight. First-order reaction rates varied seasonally according to actual solar radiation (half-lives, tau = 0.2-1.7 h). The initial photoproduct was 8-chlorocarbazole-1-acetic acid, which photodegraded even faster than the parent compound. Carbazole-1-acetic acid, previously reported as the main photoproduct, was only formed in the presence of a H-source, such as methanol. In the absence of a H-source and of air, hydroxycarbazole-1-acetic acid was formed. However, hydroxycarbazole-1-acetic acid was not observed in the presence of air and, thus, under conditions similar to those in a lake, likely because of its rapid further photooxidation. Computer simulations using a one-dimensional lake model taking actual solar radiation and flushing data of the lake into account confirmed that photolysis is the predominant elimination pathway for diclofenac in Lake Greifensee. These calculations further showed that the expected concentrations of the photoproduct 8-chlorocarbazole-1-acetic acid are less than the current detection limits of approximately 3 ng/L.

The respiration percentage of incorporated glucose ranged from 25-61% with highest values during the summer months. Respiration may be influenced by the nature of the indigenous bacterial population and by temperature.

Variations in the strength of ecological interactions between seasons have received little attention, despite an increased focus on climate alterations on ecosystems. Particularly, the winter situation is often neglected when studying competitive interactions. In northern temperate freshwaters, winter implies low temperatures and reduced food availability, but also strong reduction in ambient light because of ice and snow cover. Here, we study how brown trout [Salmo trutta (L.)] respond to variations in ice-cover duration and competition with Arctic charr [Salvelinus alpinus (L.)], by linking laboratory-derived physiological performance and field data on variation in abundance among and within natural brown trout populations. 2. Both Arctic charr and brown trout reduced resting metabolic rate under simulated ice-cover (darkness) in the laboratory, compared to no ice (6-h daylight). However, in contrast to brown trout, Arctic charr was able to obtain positive growth rate in darkness and had higher food intake in tank experiments than brown trout. Arctic charr also performed better (lower energy loss) under simulated ice-cover in a semi-natural environment with natural food supply. 3. When comparing brown trout biomass across 190 Norwegian lakes along a climate gradient, longer ice-covered duration decreased the biomass only in lakes where brown trout lived together with Arctic charr. We were not able to detect any effect of ice-cover on brown trout biomass in lakes where brown trout was the only fish species. 4. Similarly, a 25-year time series from a lake with both brown trout and Arctic charr showed that brown trout population growth rate depended on the interaction between ice breakup date and Arctic charr abundance. High charr abundance was correlated with low trout population growth rate only in combination with long winters. 5. In conclusion, the two species differed in performance under ice, and the observed outcome of competition in natural populations was strongly dependent on duration of the ice-covered period. Our study shows that changes in ice phenology may alter species interactions in Northern aquatic systems. Increased knowledge of how adaptations to winter conditions differ among coexisting species is therefore vital for our understanding of ecological impacts of climate change.

Recent volcanic eruptions in Iceland have highlighted the consequences of tephra fall for ecosystems and human health. Improved understanding of the mechanisms behind ecosystem recovery following tephra fall is particularly important for Iceland. Today similar to 42% of the country is classified as desert and unvegetated and sparsely vegetated areas are unable to trap tephra fall and prevent subsequent wind erosion. This paper presents palaeoenvironmental reconstructions before and after the Hekla 4 tephra from two lakes in Northwest Iceland, from within a woodland in the lowland, and in open woodland under stress at the highland margin. The c. 4,200 cal bp. Hekla 4 tephra is one of the most extensive Icelandic Holocene tephra layers and the eruption produced an estimated similar to 9 km(3) of tephra. The palaeoecological reconstructions provide an insight into the responses of two relatively stable ecosystems to thick tephra deposits during a period of cooling climate. The understory vegetation in the lowland woodland was buried by the tephra, however Betula pubescens trees were not severely affected and the woodland recovered relatively quickly. In contrast, open woodland at the highland margin that was already at its ecological limit, shifted to dwarf shrub heath, a more resilient vegetation community in response to the tephra fall and cooling climate.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				JUL	2017	26	4					389	402		10.1007/s00334-017-0603-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-017-0603-5													WOS:000402462400003

The study involved 84 samples of fish meat. The cholesterol content was determined with the modified Liebermann-Burchardt colorimetric method using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (UV-VIS-NIR-3100). As analyses indicated there were no statistically significant differences in the total cholesterol content in the meat of females and males of ruffe caught during spring (42.27 and 44.35 mg.100 g(-1), respectively). The statistically significant differences were determined between individuals of females and males of ruffe collected in autumn from Lake Gopto. These values ranged from 48.95 mg.100 g(-1) for females to 59.29 mg.100 g(-1) for males. There were found no statistically significant differences in the total cholesterol content in the meat of perch collected from Lake Gap/a (57.80 mg.100 g(-1)) and Lake Goreckie (61.45 mg.100 g(-1)). Analyses which concerned the total cholesterol content in the meat of four different fish species collected from Lake Gap/a confirmed a statistically significant interspecies differences in the total cholesterol content.

Surprisingly, 50% of cloned bacterial genes were closely related to a coherent cluster within Candidate Division OP10. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an environmental gene clone library that exhibits a dominance of OP10-related clones. Several other sequences, many with long branch lengths, clustered within eight separate bacterial divisions and the diatom chloroplasts. Most of these divisions are commonly found in freshwater environments. However, gene sequences from characterized metal-oxidizing or metal-reducing bacteria were not identified. The archaeal gene clone libraries contained diverse sequences, most with close homology to previously characterized gene clones of methanogens or uncultivated Crenarchaeota from soil and lacustrine environments. This study identified a unique environment where OP10 bacteria are potentially abundant. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the metal-rich particles from this reservoir support a diverse and interesting community of microorganisms.

J	EATON, KA				EATON, KA			THE LIFE-HISTORY AND PRODUCTION OF CHAOBORUS-PUNCTIPENNIS (DIPTERA, CHAOBORIDAE) IN LAKE NORMAN, NORTH-CAROLINA, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The life history and production of C. punctipennis (Say) in Lake Norman, North Carolina, USA were studied from Feb. 1978-Jan. 1979. Four sublittoral (.apprx. 8 m) and 2 profundal (.apprx. 30 m) locations were sampled. Larvae and pupae were collected with a modified Petersen grab and a plankton net, and adults were collected with emergence and light traps. Larval, pupal and adult collections indicate that 2 generations occur per year; an overwintering spring generation and a summer generation. Annual dry weight standing stock biomass, dry weight production, and P/B [production/biomass] ratio were stimulated from each sampling location and depth zone. Production was estimated by the size-frequency method. Standing stock biomass (30.9 mg .cntdot. m-2) and production (170.8 mg .cntdot. m-2) were highest in the profundal zone. In the sublittoral zone, standing stock biomass and production were 4.7 and 29.6 mg .cntdot. m-2, respectively. Annual P/B ratios in the profundal and sublittoral zones were 5.5 and 6.3, respectively.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1983	106	3					247	252		10.1007/BF00008123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008123													WOS:A1983RN46500008

The water quality of the Asagi Firat River basin has been degrading for some time, primarily as the result of pollutants associated with the discharges from numerous domestic and agricultural point sources. Aquatic macroinvertebrate samples were collected from eight lakes conducted by using both hand-nets and an Ekman-Birge grab sampler during the summer and autumn of 2014, focusing on the species composition and distribution of aquatic oligochaetes in eight lakes of the Asagi Firat River basin, and their relationships with physico-chemical parameters measured in those lakes using Principal Component Analysis. Results of analyses of all identified benthic macroinvertebrates clearly indicate the percent dominance of oligochaetes in benthic samples in the eight dam lakes that were sampled: Hacihidir lake (62.9%); Ataturk lake (49.6%); "Ucoz lake (28.9%); Dumluca lake (22.01%); Seve lake (13.9%); Cat lake (8.5%); Karakaya lake (7.8%) and Birecik lake (5%). During this study, 1044 oligochaete specimens representing 10 species of two subfamilies within the family Naididae were identified. The most abundant taxa were Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri (48.94%), Potamothrix hammoniensis (19.3%), Tubifex tubifex (13.1%), Nais simplex (5.2%) and Nais communis (4.1%).					; FINDIK, Özlem/AAY-2116-2021	aras, seval/0000-0002-6392-0117; FINDIK, Ozlem/0000-0001-8126-1250													0006-3088	1336-9563				JAN	2016	71	1					38	43		10.1515/biolog-2016-0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-0001													WOS:000372095600006
J	Yu, B; Zhang, XB				Yu, Bin; Zhang, Xuebin			A physical analysis of the severe 2013/2014 cold winter in North America	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The severe 2013/2014 cold winter has been examined in the context of the previous 55 winters using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data for the period 1960-2014. North America is dominated by pronounced cold anomalies over the Great Plains and Great Lakes in December 2013 and February 2014 but exhibits an east-west contrast pattern with warm anomalies over most of the North American West in January 2014. A relevant temperature index, defined as land surface temperature anomalies averaged over (40 degrees-60 degrees N, 105 degrees-80 degrees W), reveals a warming trend as well as interannual variability with a significant power peak of 6.0 years. While 2013/2014 was the second coldest winter during 1960-2014, it is the coldest one in the linearly detrended series, with a negative anomaly of 2.63 standard deviations. This indicates that the long-term warming has made the 2013/2014 winter less severe than it could have been. The temperature and circulation variability in association with the zonally symmetric variability of the polar vortex projects weakly on the corresponding anomalies in the 2013/2014 winter, whereas the variability associated with the principal mode of North American surface temperature projects strongly on the corresponding anomalies in the winter. This mode is associated with a sea surface temperature (SST) pattern of significant anomalies over the North Pacific and North Atlantic middle and high latitudes. The anomalous atmospheric circulation shows an anticyclonic anomaly over the Gulf of Alaska-Bering Sea and a cyclonic anomaly downstream over North America. It bears resemblance to the North Pacific Oscillation/Western Pacific pattern and drives the SST in the North Pacific. Over western-central Canada and the northern U.S., below-average heights are associated with above-normal precipitation, implying enhanced upward vertical motion and variation of local cloud forcing, leading to a variation of the surface energy budget dominated by surface longwave radiation anomalies. Over North America, there is less downwelling longwave radiation at the surface when the atmosphere is cold, which is offset by the corresponding reduction in outgoing longwave radiation.

J	Obertegger, U				Obertegger, Ulrike			Temporal and spatial differences of the under-ice microbiome are linked to light transparency and chlorophyll-a	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Under-ice community dynamics are barely understood. Temporal and spatial studies are needed to fully understand the consequences of a declining ice cover on microbial biodiversity. Here, bacterial communities of different years (2015, 2017-2021) and layers (upper and lower euphotic layer, euphotic layer, hypolimnion) were assessed by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Alpha- and beta-diversity of summer and under-ice hypolimnetic communities were similar, and a seasonal difference was found only when excluding summer hypolimnetic communities. Similarly, in non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), summer and under-ice communities were different even though hypolimnetic communities were similar. Investigating under-ice conditions, the year 2017 showed highest under-ice light and chlorophyll-a while 2021 showed no under-ice light and lowest chlorophyll-a. Under-ice communities were not linked to layer differences implying that a spatial distinction under ice was less important than in summer, especially in years with little or no under-ice light. Most under-ice bacterial classes and ASVs showed direct and indirect dependencies on light availability and primary production. Similarly in NMDS with only under-ice communities, light transparency and primary production were important. In the future, ice conditions with less snow cover might lead to bacterial communities similar to that of high-light years (2017, 2018, 2020).

J	Gunnell, Y; Anupama, K; Sultan, B				Gunnell, Yanni; Anupama, Krishnamurthy; Sultan, Benjamin			Response of the South Indian runoff-harvesting civilization to northeast monsoon rainfall variability during the last 2000 years: instrumental records and indirect evidence	HOLOCENE												Compared with the southwest monsoon, the mechanisms and history of northeast monsoon (NEM) variability over South Asia are poorly known. The NEM nevertheless contributes > 50% of rainfall to semi-arid southeast India, and has underpinned the success, over the last 2000 years, of a widespread indigenous water resource management system based on rainwater harvesting and storage in man-made lakes. Based on a power spectrum analysis of 60- to 100-yr instrumental rainfall records, we show that NEM rainfall is both chaotic in the high-frequency time domain and spatially unpredictable, but that the sustainability of the agricultural water-harvesting infrastructure is tied to excess rain from NEM cyclones. Cyclonic activity has declined sharply since 1977. Based on twentieth-century analogues, we propose a qualitative model in which storminess decreases when NEM wind intensities increase and Eurasian winter temperatures are anomalously low. Extrapolating to the Holocene time frame, model expectations for the palaeorainfall record correlate with the independently established chronologies of ' oscillations, and Indian runoff-irrigation development and the 'Mediaeval Warm Period'-'Little Ice Age further suggest that NEM and SWM rainfall anomalies have covaried with the same sign from seasonal to millennial timescales. The fortunes of the reservoir system are therefore tangibly climate-driven.					; Sultan, Benjamin/C-8957-2012	Anupama, K./0000-0003-3130-0113; Sultan, Benjamin/0000-0003-0416-0338													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2007	17	2					207	215		10.1177/0959683607075835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683607075835													WOS:000244835800005

In the deepest area of the ML 111, a monimolimnion was observed, that persisted for the years 1996-1999. It disappeared in 2000 and again formed in 2001. The definition of the main physical properties, such as the temperature compensation for electrical conductivity, in acidic mining lakes required a lake specific approach. The relation between conductivity, temperature and density was determined for the acidic ML 111. The variation in dissolved substances affected these relationships such that conductivity varied with temperature even in different layers of the water column and the limitations for a lake wide correlation was evident. Variation in the conductivity of the epilimnion could be verified, and agreed with the estimates of evaporation from the lake surface during summer stratification. Calculations, following the gradient flux method, indicated vertical transport coefficients between 10(-7) and 10(-6)m(2)/s throughout the hypolimnion. The heat budget indicated that heat was transferred into the lake bed or the ground during spring.

Therefore, identifying gut microbes will shed light on understanding the annual life of animal species, particularly those that are threatened or endangered. In the present study, we conducted nucleotide sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA genes of gut microbiome of the hooded cranes (Grus monacha) wintering at Shengjin Lake, China, by Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. We acquired 503,398 high-quality sequences and 785 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 15 fecal samples from different cranes, representing 22 phyla that were dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. A total of 305 genera were identified that were dominated by Clostridium, Lysinibacillus, and Enterobacter. The core gut microbiome comprised 26 genera, including many probiotic species such as Clostridium, Bacillus, Cellulosilyticum, and Cellulomonas that could catabolize cellulose. The findings reported here contribute to our knowledge of the microbiology of hooded cranes and will likely advance efforts to protect waterbirds that inhabit Shengjin Lake Reserve during winter.

J	Nicol, S; Haynes, TB; Fensham, R; Kerezsy, A				Nicol, Sam; Haynes, Trevor B.; Fensham, Rod; Kerezsy, Adam			Quantifying the impact of Gambusia holbrooki on the extinction risk of the critically endangered red-finned blue-eye	ECOSPHERE												Managing competing endangered and invasive species in spatially structured environments is challenging because it is often difficult to control invasive species without negatively impacting the endangered species. Effective management action requires an understanding of the factors affecting the presence and absence of each species so that promising sites for relocation of endangered species combined with eradication of invasive species can be identified. We investigate competing hypotheses about the factors affecting occupancy of the critically endangered red-finned blue-eye (Scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis; hereafter 'RFBE'), a native Australian fish with a global distribution that is restricted to a group of shallow artesian springs. RFBE are threatened by competition with invasive mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki), which are steadily colonizing the springs, resulting in local extinctions of RFBE in most cases. While hypotheses about the influences of Gambusia on RFBE exist, none have been tested with a quantitative model. We used a spatially-structured two-species occupancy modeling approach to examine the occupancy dynamics of these fish and tested competing hypotheses on how Gambusia occupancy affected RFBE. Gambusia occupancy had a strong negative effect on RFBE occupancy and colonization potential; increasing the probability of local extinction at a spring and decreasing the persistence probability of RFBE in a spring by 8.0% +/- 2.7% (mean +/- 1 SE). We found strongest support for the hypotheses that elevation and spring area influence colonization, and that spring area influences patch extinction probability. Using colonization and local extinction estimates for both species, we identify promising sites for eradication of Gambusia and relocation of RFBE.

Holocene climate and environmental history of Brurskardstjorni, a lake in the catchment of vre Heimdalsvatn, south-central Norway	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Holocene lake history, vegetation history and climate history of Brurskardstjorni, an alpine lake in the Jotunheimen Mountains of south-central Norway, are reconstructed. The reconstructions are based on fossil pollen, plant macrofossils, diatoms, chironomids and sediment characteristics. Subsequent to deglaciation, the lake was formed at about 11,000 cal years BP. A diverse chironomid assemblage quickly colonised the lake, whereas the first diatoms were found about 400 years later. At that time, the lake water was turbid with a high pH. The surrounding soils were immature and unstable and dominated by open pioneer vegetation. Compared to the present, summer temperatures were warmer and there was less winter precipitation. From about 10,000 cal years BP, local organic production increased rapidly and from about 9,500 cal years BP a few macrofossils and a high pollen influx of birch suggest that the tree-line was close to the lake. Pine most likely reached its highest tree-line altitude around 9,000 cal years BP and has receded since that time. From about 5,000 cal years BP, the total amount of trees and shrubs decreased and the landscape became more open, probably due to decreasing temperatures and increasing effective moisture lowering the birch tree-line. Coinciding with a cooling during the last 3,000 years, lake-water pH decreased. There is large incongruence between the Holocene July temperatures inferred from pollen and chironomids. The biological proxies responded to a combined effect of environmental change and biotic interactions. This response is interpreted with reference to taxon-environment relationships in the modern calibration data sets and with reference to the latent structure and ecological demands of the fossil assemblages.

Enhanced particulate Hg export at the permafrost boundary, western Siberia	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Arctic permafrost soils contain large amounts of organic carbon and the pollutant mercury (Hg). Arctic warming and associated changes in hydrology, biogeochemistry and ecology risk mobilizing soil Hg to rivers and to the Arctic Ocean, yet little is known about the quantity, timing and mechanisms involved. Here we investigate seasonal particulate Hg (PHg) and organic carbon (POC) export in 32 small and medium rivers across a 1700 km latitudinal permafrost transect of the western Siberian Lowland. The PHg concentrations in suspended matter increased with decreasing watershed size. This underlines the significance of POC-rich small streams and wetlands in PHg export from watersheds. Maximum PHg concentrations and export fluxes were located in rivers at the beginning of permafrost zone (sporadic permafrost). We suggest this reflects enhanced Hg mobilization at the permafrost boundary, due to maximal depth of the thawed peat layer. Both the thickness of the active (unfrozen) peat layer and PHg run-off progressively move to the north during the summer and fall seasons, thus leading to maximal PHg export at the sporadic to discontinuous permafrost zone. The discharge-weighed PHg:POC ratio in western Siberian rivers (2.7 +/- 0.5 mu g Hg: g C) extrapolated to the whole Ob River basin yields a PHg flux of 1.5 +/- 0.3 Mg y(-1), consistent with previous estimates. For current climate warming and permafrost thaw scenarios in western Siberia, we predict that a northward shift of permafrost boundaries and increase of active layer depth may enhance the PHg export by small rivers to the Arctic Ocean by a factor of two over the next 10-50 years.

J	GELLER, W; MULLER, H				GELLER, W; MULLER, H			THE FILTRATION APPARATUS OF CLADOCERA - FILTER MESH-SIZES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS ON FOOD SELECTIVITY	OECOLOGIA												The filtering apparatus of 11 cladoceran species was studied. The distances between the setulae, which act as filters, were measured. Among adult individuals, they vary from 0.2 .mu.m in Diaphanosoma brachyurum to 4.7 .mu.m in Sida crystallina. Species can be grouped according to the mesh-sizes, as fine mesh filter-feeders: D. brachyurum, Ceriodaphnia quadrangula, Chydorus sphaericus, Daphnia cucullata and D. magna; medium mesh filter-feeders: D. galeata, D. hyalina, D. pulicaria and Bosmina coregoni; and coarse mesh filter-feeders: Holopedium gibberum and S. crystallina. In D. hyalina, the distances between setulae increase from 0.3-0.4 .mu.m in small juveniles to 0.8-2.0 .mu.m in adults. In D. magna, the mesh-size of the filter does not increase significantly with growth. The relative abundance of the filter-feeding types apparently varies with the trophic state of the lake. In oligotrophic lakes the coarse mesh filter-feeders usually dominate throughout the year. The seasonal succession of zooplankton species in eutrophic lakes can be interpreted as a succession of feeding types; during winter coarse mesh filter-feeders dominate, while fine mesh filter-feeders are most abundant during summer phytoplankton blooms. The species composition of filter-feeding zooplankton seems to be strongly influenced by the amount of suspended bacteria which are available as food only for filter-feeding species with fine meshes.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1981	49	3					316	321		10.1007/BF00347591	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00347591								28309989					WOS:A1981LZ15700005
J	DUCKETT, JG; DUCKETT, AR				DUCKETT, JG; DUCKETT, AR			REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY AND POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF WILD GAMETOPHYTES OF EQUISTEUM	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The reproductive biology of wild gametophytes of E. arvense L., E. fluviatile L. and E. palustre L., which form extensive populations during the summer months on previously inundated bare mud along the margins of reservoirs and lakes in Northern England and Wales [UK], was studied. The gametophytes have all the characteristics of pioneer species: they rapidly attain sexual maturity and are adversely affected by competition. Early in the summer mixtures of male and female gametophytes are produced. The former are smaller and their frequency (which is always less) diminishes throughout the season as a result of bryophytic competition. The rarity of bisexual, initially female, gametophytes, in wild populations is related to the absence of metabolite accumulation which mediates this change in culture. Significantly different sex ratios between populations and species underlines the labile nature of the sex-determining mechanism in Equisetum. The high frequency of females bearing sporophytes indicates that intergametophytic fertilization is highly effective in nature. Absence of any correlation between the incidence of fertilized females and the proportions of males, in conjunction with a consideration of the male gamete dispersal distance, suggests that sporophyte formation is restricted by the availability of ripe archegonia. Sexual reproduction in Equisetum is probably limited by the narrow range of conditions under which gametophytes can become established rather than availability of water for fertilization. The majority of females, which bear one sporophyte, are smaller than unfertilized or polyembryonic females. Their small size results from nutrient demands and allelopathic compounds from the sporophytes which also probably prevent the establishment of gametophytes within mature stands of the parent species. Correlations between female diameters and frequencies of males suggest that gametophytes are more likely to produce archegonia under favorable conditions. The natural reproductive biology of Equisetum is in accord with predictions based on an understanding of the mechanism of sex determination in axenic culture. Several striking parallels between sexuality in Equisetum and dioecious angiosperms are revealed. The absence of winter flooding at 2 of the gametophyte sites led to the establishment of mature stands of Equisetum, which produced cones after 3-4 yr; 2 hybrids, E. fluviatile .times. E. arvense and E. fluviatile .times. E. palustre, were detected.																			0024-4074	1095-8339					1980	80	1					1	+		10.1111/j.1095-8339.1980.tb01655.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1980.tb01655.x													WOS:A1980JU41800001
J	Perrow, MR; Meijer, ML; Dawidowicz, P; Coops, H				Perrow, MR; Meijer, ML; Dawidowicz, P; Coops, H			Biomanipulation in the shallow lakes: State of the art	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Cascades in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Lakes	AUG 20-25, 1995	WARSAW, POLAND	Inst Ecol, Polish Acad Sci, Univ Warsaw, Polish Hydrobiol Soc				The current state of biomanipulation was the subject of much discussion at Shallow Lakes '95. This led to a workshop focusing on the factors influencing the establishment of macrophytes and the mechanisms responsible for their stability following biomanipulation. The purpose of the current paper is to distil current knowledge on biomanipulation in shallow lakes gleaned from discussions at the conference and recent literature. Biomanipulation should be used in the theoretical context of two alternative stable equilibria, as the extreme perturbation required to move from a phytoplankton dominated state to one dominated by macrophytes. Understanding the nature of the factors and mechanisms responsible for turbid water, is critical if biomanipulation is to be appropriate. We suggest that with sufficient information, particular components of the fish community may be targeted and precise figures for removal, designed to exceed critical threshold values, may be set. Without this knowledge, a 'play-safe' strategy should be adopted and at least 75% of the fish removed. Stocking with piscivores may be a useful additional measure to fish removal. The principal objective of biomanipulation in shallow lakes is to generate a period of clear water of sufficient length to allow macrophytes to establish. To this aim, as well as for technical reasons, biomanipulation is best undertaken in winter and early spring to generate clear water as early as possible in the season. In the cases where grazing is important, this coincides with the spring peak of Daphnia spp. Biomanipulation may have to be repeated if macrophytes do not colonise effectively within the first season. The factors responsible for the lag in response of macrophytes in some cases and the potential mechanisms contributing to the maintenance of clear water in macrophyte beds are discussed. From empirical data sets from many lakes, both a relative increase in the piscivorous fish stock and a reduction in nutrient levels are thought to be important in stabilising the system in the long-term. Whether biomanipulation may lead to alternative equilibria (i.e. high diversity macrophyte communities with piscivorous fish at high P) is unknown. Further study of exceptional cases, theoretical modelling and development and analysis of more long-term (> 10 years) case histories is recommended.					; Dawidowicz, Piotr/N-7405-2018	DAWIDOWICZ, PIOTR/0000-0001-8385-6215; 													0018-8158					JAN 17	1997	342						355	365		10.1023/A:1017092802529	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017092802529													WOS:A1997WZ13900038

Methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide emissions from two clear-water and two turbid-water urban ponds in Brussels (Belgium)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Shallow ponds can occur either in a clear-water state dominated by macrophytes or a turbid-water state dominated by phytoplankton, but it is unclear if and how these two alternative states affect the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. We measured the dissolved concentration of CO2, CH4, and N2O from which the diffusive air-water fluxes were computed, in four urban ponds in the city of Brussels (Belgium): two clear-water macrophyte-dominated ponds (Silex and Tenreuken), and two turbid-water phytoplankton-dominated ponds (Leybeek and P & ecirc;cheries) on 46 occasions over 2.5 years (between June 2021 and December 2023). Ebullitive CH4 fluxes were measured with bubble traps in the four ponds during deployments in spring, summer, and autumn, totalling 48 d of measurements. Measured ancillary variables included water temperature, oxygen saturation level ( %O2), concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrite (NO2-), nitrate (NO3-), and ammonium (NH4+). The turbid-water and clear-water ponds did not differ significantly in terms of diffusive emissions of CO2 and N2O. Clear-water ponds exhibited higher values of ebullitive CH4 emissions compared to turbid-water ponds, most probably in relation to the delivery of organic matter from macrophytes to sediments, but the diffusive CH4 emissions were not significantly different between clear- and turbid-water ponds. Across seasons, CH4 emissions increased with water temperature in all four ponds, with ebullitive CH4 fluxes having a stronger dependence on water temperature (Q10) than diffusive CH4 fluxes. The temperature sensitivity of ebullitive CH4 fluxes decreased with increasing water depth, implying that shallow sediments would respond more strongly to warming (e.g. heat waves). Total annual CH4 emissions (diffusive + ebullitive) in CO2 equivalents equalled those of CO2 in turbid-water ponds and exceeded those of CO2 in clear-water ponds, while N2O emissions were negligible compared to the other two GHGs. Total annual GHG emissions in CO2 equivalents from all four ponds increased from 2022 to 2023 due to higher CO2 diffusive fluxes, likely driven by higher annual precipitation in 2023 compared to 2022 (leading putatively to higher inputs for organic or inorganic carbon from run-off), possibly in response to the intense El Ni & ntilde;o event of 2023. The findings of this work suggest that it might be necessary to account for the presence of submerged macrophytes when extrapolating ebullitive CH4 fluxes in ponds at a larger scale (regional or global) (particularly if Chl-a is used as a descriptor), although it might be less critical for the extrapolation of diffusive CH4, CO2, and N2O fluxes.

The seasonal cycle of cyclopoid copepods during and following an approximately 50% reduction in planktivorous fish biomass was studied in shallow, eutrophic Lake Vaeng, Denmark, from 1986 to 1990. 2. The dominant cyclopoid copepods changed from Cyclops vicinus and Mesocyclops leuckarti during 1986-1989 to M. leuckarti and Megacyclops viridis in 1990. The abundance of cyclopoid copepods gradually increased from 1986 to 1988-89, decreased in autumn 1989 and markedly decreased in 1990. 3. The increase in the abundance of cyclopoid copepods from 1986 to 1988 is attributed mainly to the reduction in fish predation pressure, there being no concomitant increase in edible phytoplankton. The appearance of M. viridis in 1990, and the general decrease in cyclopoid copepod density in autumn 1989 and in 1990, are attributed to the appearance of submerged macrophytes. 4. Temperature, predation and availability of edible phytoplankton appear to determine whether C. vicinus or M. leuckarti dominates the cyclopoid copepod population of eutrophic Lake Vaeng.

Anabaenopsis morphospecies (Cyanobacteria, Nostocales) from Los Patos shallow lake (Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina)	PHYTOTAXA												The genus Anabaenopsis comprises about 20 morphospecies distributed in plankton of tropical, subtropical and temperate regions during warm periods. The morphological diversity and population dynamics of Anabaenopsis species from one artificial shallow lake from the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, was studied during summer 2005 and 2006; and from April 2012 to May 2014. The most common and abundant species were identified as A. elenkinii and A. cf. cunningtonii (first report in Argentina). Anabaenopsis circularis and A. milleri (first report in the American continent and Argentina) were less common, whereas A. nadsonii was rarely observed. Almost all species contributed to algal blooms during warm periods. However, some species were registered even under the lowest temperatures recorded (7.5 degrees C) and sustained biovolume also during winter (A. milleri, A. elenkinii and A. cf. cunningtonii). These results indicate that some species of the genus are capable of growing at temperatures much lower than 20 degrees C. The species richness noted in this study suggests that there is likely much more diversity remaining on this genus to be reported in Argentina.

Hydrology of the Cold-Arid Himalaya	HIMALAYAN WEATHER AND CLIMATE AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT												Hydrological characteristics of the Cold-arid trans-Himalayan region is least known due to lack of studies in the region. Hydrology of a region having around 60 mm of mean annual precipitation can be thought as a paradox. But the area have numerous glaciers constituting more than 75% of the Indian glacier resource and significant snow cover area mainly constrained over the top of the mountain range. These glaciers and snow sustain the livelihood of immediate lowland of arid valley bottom and contribute to the flow of Indus and its major tributaries like Shyok and Zanskar. These big rivers sustain livelihood of millions further downstream. Along with snow and glaciers; large extent of permafrost areas makes the hydrology of the cold-arid regions unique as compared to other regions of Indian Himalaya. Present study focus on the Ladakh range of the cold-arid system. Small glaciers with <1 km(2) area is characteristic of the Ladakh and Zanskar ranges. Discharge in the stream reach between glacier and foothill is restricted around 43% days as the mountain reach of the stream freezes in winter. Summer discharge show significant reduction during the lean snow years when ground ice melt component probably contributing to the stream flow. Steep precipitation and temperature gradients are another key feature of the cold-arid system. The temperature gradient during summer months surpasses 9.8 K/km and play a key role in sustaining the mountain cryospheric system in the region. Water related disasters are also very common in the area and have varied genesis such as Cloudburst, Glacial Lake Outburst Floods, Landslide Dam Outburst Flood and glacial surge dam outburst floods. More studies are imperative to comprehend the hydrology of this area in a better way. Mass and Energy balance of bigger glaciers, Permafrost thaw modeling, Groundwater dynamics and recharge areas and climate modeling at valley-ridge scale are some of the key topic to be pursued in greater details in future.

J	Qin, K; Guo, GM; Wu, LX				Qin, Kai; Guo, Guangmeng; Wu, Lixin			Surface latent heat flux anomalies preceding inland earthquakes in China	EARTHQUAKE SCIENCE												Using data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the paper analyzed the surface latent heat flux (SLHF) variations for five inland earthquakes occurred in some lake area, moist area and arid area of China during recent years. We used the SLHF daily and monthly data to differentiate the global and seasonal variability from the transient local anomalies. The temporal scale of the observed variations is 1-2 months before and after the earthquakes, and spatial scale is about 10 degrees x10 degrees. The result suggests that the SLHFs adjacent the epicenters all are anomalous high value (> mu+2 sigma)8-30 days before the shocks as compared with past several years of data. Different from the abnormal meteorological phenomenon, the distribution of the anomalies was isolated and local, which usually occurred in the epicenter and its adjacent area, or along the fault lines. The increase of SLHF was tightly related with the season which the earthquake occurs in; the maximal (125 W/m(2), Pu'er earthquake) and minimal (25 W/m(2), Gaize earthquake) anomalies were in summer and winter, respectively. The abundant surface water and groundwater in the epicenter and its adjacent region can provide necessary condition for the change of SLHF. To further confirm the reliability of SLHF anomaly, it is necessary to explore its physical mechanism in depth by more earthquake cases.

John; Foy, Robert H.; Engstrom, Daniel R.; Rippey, Brian; Alamgir, Farah			Climate forcing of diatom productivity in a lowland, eutrophic lake: White Lough revisited	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In cultural landscapes, lake response to climate can be masked by land-use change and nutrient loss from their catchments. Palaeolimnological methods were used to reconstruct the ecological response of diatoms in a eutrophic lowland lake (White Lough, Co. Tyrone, Northern Ireland) to altered nutrient P loading and precipitation variability over c. 100 years. 2. 210Pb-dated sediment cores were analysed to determine diatom assemblage variability, biogenic silica concentration, geochemical phosphorus concentration and accumulation rate. Manure P and agricultural N surplus data were collated from documentary sources. Long-term trends in annual temperature and precipitation were derived from the Armagh Observatory. 3. Diatom community turnover from 1890 until c. 1960 was limited, and assemblages were dominated by Aulacoseira subarctica; after this date, changes primarily reflected a eutrophication sequence owing to increased diffuse nutrient inputs associated with intensification of land use (external P loading increased by a factor of three). 4. Diatom and biogenic Si profiles were compared with North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) records, an index of regional weather patterns. Biogenic Si exhibited a c. 7-year cycle, which tracked a cycle of similar timescale in the Armagh climate record for dry summers. In turn, this cycle was related to the variation in the NAO. 5. Monitoring data from 1971 to 2007 of nitrate exports from the Blackwater River showed that these too followed a roughly 7-year cycle at least up to 2000, in which dry summers were followed by sharp increases in nitrate export. It is argued that diatom production in White Lough reflects the cyclic behaviour in nitrate loading and the constraints that nitrogen availability places on the spring diatom bloom in a lake that is dominated by cyanobacteria.

Until the end of October in the epi- and metalimnia, HNF grazing rates on bacteria using the fluorescently labeled bacteria (FLB) technique were 2.3 to 15.1 (average 8.4) bacteria/HNF.hr, and average clearance rates of individual HNF were calculated as 0.22 to 3.68 (average 1.55) nl/HNF.hr. Total bacterial consumption rates by HNF were 1.1 to 9.5 (average 5.0) x 10(4) cells/ml.hr, and bacterial production rates, measured by H-3-thymidine incorporation method, were 2.5 to 12 (average 6.2) x 10(4) cells/ml.hr during the same period in the epi- and metalimnia. In the thermocline, the production:consumption ratio of bacteria directly affected the fluctuation of bacterial abundance, although bacterial abundance remained fairly constant, around 4 x 10(6) cells/ml. These results indicate that the HNF consumption of bacteria was closely coupled with bacterial production, and that grazing pressure of HNF was one of the most important factors responsible for keeping the bacterial abundance in relatively narrow range. In the hypolimnion or during the winter season in upper two layers, however, the abundance and the grazing rate of HNF were quite low and total bacterial consumption rates by HNF were 1.4 to 9.6 (average 3.9) x 10(3) cells/ml.hr, suggesting that the role of HNF as bacterial consumers was of less importance in the hypolimnion and during low water temperature seasons.																			0003-9136					AUG	1991	122	2					129	145																WOS:A1991GH96400001

There are thermal and DO stratification in deep-water reservoirs with long hydraulic retention time, which change N2O production mechanism compared with shallow-water reservoirs. To promote our understanding of the relationship of N2O production in reservoirs at different depths, spatiotemporal variations in water environmental factors and N2O from cascade reservoirs of Chaishitan (CST), Longtan (LT), Yantan (YT) and Dahua (DH) reservoirs in the Zhujiang River were detected, and the LT and YT reservoirs were compared as representatives of deep-water and shallow-water reservoirs in April and July 2019. The average N2O concentrations in the LT and YT reservoirs were 22.82 & PLUSMN; 2.21 and 21.55 & PLUSMN; 1.65 nmol L-1, respectively. During spring and summer, the WT (water temperature) and DO (dissolved oxygen) concentrations in the YT reservoir were well mixed. In contrast, the LT reservoir, as a deep-water reservoir, had thermal and DO stratifications in both the shallow and middle water, especially in the summer when the solar radiation intensity was high. During summer stratification, the DO concentration in the LT reservoir showed obvious spatial variation, ranging from 1.23 to 9.84 mg L-1, while the DO concentration in the YT reservoir showed very little variation, ranging from 6.45 to 7.09 mg L-1. Structural equation modeling results showed that NH4+ was the main determinant of the N2O concentration in the YT reservoir, and DO was the most influential factor of the N2O concentration in the LT reservoir. These results suggest significant variations in the factors influencing N2O concentration among reservoirs. Additionally, the mechanisms of N2O production differ between deep-water and shallow-water reservoirs. This study highlights the spatio-temporal variations and influential factors contributing to N2O concentration. Furthermore, it discusses the production mechanisms of N2O in different types of reservoirs. These findings contribute to our understanding of N2O distribution in hydropower systems and provide valuable data for the management of hydropower facilities and research on greenhouse gas emissions.

Here we present evidence indicating that the discrepancy can be attributed to the combination of seasonal biases in the proxy temperature records and insufficient understanding of the mechanisms within climate models. We obtained independently dated records of mean annual air temperature (MAAT) based on glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) from Bangong Co in the western Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and two loess-palaeosol sections in the northeastern QTP. One of the most prominent features in the composite MAAT record is the relatively cool Middle Holocene, similar to 2 degrees C cooler than the Early and Late Holocene. The MAAT variations are consistent with orbitally forced modelling results that show increasing regional temperatures since the Middle Holocene, but they contrast with global temperature reconstructions that mainly reflect summer temperature variations. Our findings suggest that changes in boreal summer insolation that led to variations in precipitation patterns and vegetation dynamics were the key factor modulating MAAT during the Holocene. Overall, our study sheds light on possible approaches to solving the Holocene temperature conundrum by considering internal feedbacks within the climate system.

J	van der Schriek, T; Giannakopoulos, C				van der Schriek, Tim; Giannakopoulos, Christos			Determining the causes for the dramatic recent fall of Lake Prespa (southwest Balkans)	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Mediterranean lake-wetland systems are threatened by climate change and intensive human impacts. Individual lake responses to these threats are poorly known but urgently required to steer preservation strategies. The dramatic water-level fall (similar to 8m since 1987) of Lake Megali Prespa endangers this global biodiversity hotspot and the wider catchment's water resources. Annual lake fluctuations are found to be strongly related to wet-season (Oct.-Apr.) precipitation variability, which is linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation. The lake primarily adjusts to sustained inflow changes through amending surface evaporation. Cumulative water abstraction since 1951 (similar to 19x10(6)m(3)/year: similar to 0.006% of lake volume) explains similar to 70% of the long-term decrease in surface evaporation; climate variability explains the remainder. Persistent low lake levels after 1995 are caused by water abstraction. Compared to 1952/53-1977/78, the period 1978/79-2003/04 experienced significant decreases in wet-season precipitation, snowfall and discharge; the number of very dry years increased.					; Giannakopoulos, Christos/H-6827-2014; van der Schriek, Tim/D-1495-2009	Giannakopoulos, Christos/0000-0003-1822-7716; van der Schriek, Tim/0000-0003-4379-3349; 													0262-6667	2150-3435					2017	62	7					1131	1148		10.1080/02626667.2017.1309042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2017.1309042													WOS:000400253900008

Dynamical and Precipitation Structures of Poleward-Moving Tropical Cyclones in Eastern Canada, 1979-2005	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Tropical cyclones in the western North Atlantic basin are a persistent threat to human interests along the east coast of North America. Occurring mainly during the late summer and early autumn, these storms often cause strong winds and extreme rainfall and can have a large impact on the weather of eastern Canada. From 1979 to 2005, 40 named (by the National Hurricane Center) tropical cyclones tracked over eastern Canada. Based on the time tendency of the low-level (850-700 hPa) vorticity, the storms are partitioned into two groups: "intensifying'' and "decaying.'' The 16 intensifying and 12 decaying cases are then analyzed using data from both the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and the NCEP global reanalysis. Composite dynamical structures are presented for both partitioned groups, utilizing both quasigeostrophic (QG) and potential vorticity (PV) perspectives. It is found that the proximity to the tropical cyclone and subsequent negative tilt (or lack thereof) of a precursor trough over the Great Lakes region is crucial to whether a storm "intensifies'' or "decays.'' Heavy precipitation is often the main concern when tropical cyclones move northward into the midlatitudes. Therefore, analyses of storm-relative precipitation distributions show that storms intensifying (decaying) as they move into the midlatitudes often exhibit a counterclockwise (clockwise) rotation of precipitation around the storm center.

Hydroclimatic variations over the last millennium in eastern Finland disentangled by fossil Cladocera	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Future climate warming is expected to alter atmospheric moisture balance and therefore paleoclimatic archives of past moisture and hydrological patterns may provide understanding of the magnitude, speed, and ecosystem responses to the regionally altered climatic regimes. The present study aimed at disentangling millennial variation in hydroclimatic parameters, including summer effective moisture (lake levels) and ice-free season by using sedimentary cladoceran fossils. We used a site-specific cladoceran-based inference model to reconstruct lake level fluctuations in a 1500-yr sediment record from Lake Pieni-Kauro, eastern Finland in the context of previously established paleoclimatic data of summer temperature and precipitation. In addition, we applied cladoceran planktonic/littoral ratio, mean body size, and abundance of fossil ephippia as supplementary proxies for paleoclimatic interpretations. The results showed that lake level was lower during the pre- and early Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, around 500-1000 AD) than at present and started to rise toward the culmination during the Little Ice Age (LIA, around 1600-1700 AD) when the lake level was higher than at present. Pelagic cladoceran body size was larger and abundance of ephippia increased during the LIA suggesting significant reduction in the length of the ice-free season and lower water temperatures. Comparison of the lake level reconstruction with the previous paleoclimatic data suggested that effective moisture has had a long-term negative relationship with temperature and positive relationship with summer precipitation in eastern Finland. The results indicated that the pre- and early MCA was warm and dry (long ice-free season, low summer effective moisture) and the culmination of the LIA was cool and moist (reduced ice-free season, increased summer effective moisture). Unraveling the seasonality of the multicentury hydroclimatic patterns in eastern Finland may offer important insights in linking the large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns to seasonal climate events.

J	HINO, S				HINO, S			VARIATIONS IN PHYSIOLOGICAL STATES CORRESPONDING TO CELLULAR PHOSPHORUS-CONTENT IN FRESH-WATER PHYTOPLANKTON - CORRELATIONS WITH ADENYLATE ENERGY-CHARGE AND PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Variations in physiological states corresponding to cellular phosphorus content were studied in phytoplankton from Lake Barato Japan and in experiments in vitro. When the level of cellular, acid-soluble phosphorus (ASP) was low in phytoplankton from Lake Barato during the summer, both the values of adenylate energy charge (AEC) and the level of photosynthetic activity had declined markedly by comparison to values observed in the spring. Starvation by removal of all sources of phosphorus also introduced a decline in the value of AEC and the level of photosynthetic activity, in addition to a decline in the ASP content of the cells. Addition of a source of phosphorus to phosphorus-deficient algal cultures rapidly reestablished normal values for ASP, ATP, and AEC, and photosynthetic activity gradually returned to normal levels. In contrast, the AEC value and the photosynthetic activity were constant in nitrogen-deficient algal cultures. These results suggest that the determination of the physiological state of phytoplankton is dominated by the ASP content, and that photosynthetic activity is subject to control by the physiological state of phytoplankton.																			0003-9136					AUG	1988	113	2					295	305																WOS:A1988Q178000008

Communal pair spawning behaviour of vendace (Coregonus albula) in the dark	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Mating in nature is rarely random, and most fish species have refined mating systems. The vendace (Coregonus albula) is a short-lived, small-sized, cold-water-adapted pelagic schooling species that is known to spawn in groups, but the actual mating system of this species, like many other group-spawning fishes, has not been described in detail. Vendace typically spawn in the littoral or sublittoral zones of lakes in late autumn, and the hatching of larvae occurs close to icebreak in the following spring. In our large study lake, vendace larvae were caught in 93% of 1,149 random sampling locations lake-wide. We examined the courtship and mating of vendace under experimental conditions by nonintrusive observation of the natural behaviour, to clarify whether spawning activity is associated with illumination and to assess the postspawning mortality of vendace. Here, we describe and document in detail for the first time the spawning behaviour of vendace: they spawn in the dark, and females release a small portion of their eggs (on average 1% of mean total individual fecundity) when the female and male, side by side, dart from near the bottom up towards the surface, that is perform a spawning rise. Males and females had several spawning rises (on average 1,200). Our results showed high postspawning mortality (56%). The spawning stress seems to be a potential component of mortality regulating the lifespan duration of vendace.					; Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015	Marjomaki, Timo J./0000-0002-0563-3099; Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174													0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2018	27	2					542	548		10.1111/eff.12368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12368													WOS:000426610900003

The diurnal signals are associated with periodic changes in surface melting, and the longer-period signals are associated with the episodic drainage of supra-glacial lakes. Ice velocity doubles around 2 hours after peak daily melting and returns approximately to wintertime levels around 12 hours afterwards, demonstrating an intimate link between the surface and basal hydrology. During late summer, the ice sheet accelerates by 35% per positive degree-day of melting. The observed link between surface melting and enhanced flow is typical of Alpine glaciers, which may provide an appropriate analogue for the evolution of the GrIS in a warming climate.

Nevertheless, the area around these lakes contains numerous wetland systems that have been formed: along lake shorelines; along faults where hot, warm and cold springs have developed; and along river systems that cross the rift floor. Six major types of wetland are recognized: Proximal Hot Springs; Hot Spring Marshes; Blister Wetlands; Typha and Cyperus papyrus Swamps; Floodplain Marshes; Hypersaline Lake Littoral Wetlands; and Freshwater Lake Littoral Wetlands. These show significant variability in terms of geomorphic setting, water chemistry, temperature, plant communities and diatom floras. They are variously dominated by macrophytes, such as Cyperus laevigatus, Typha domingensis and Cyperus papyrus. In some cases macrophytes are absent. In hot spring settings and in hypersaline lake littoral zones bacterial mats are common. Although absent in some samples, diatoms occur in at least parts of all of the wetlands, varying in diversity, abundance and species composition. Canonical correspondence analysis indicates that diatom floras show a close relationship with pH, temperature, and specific conductivity, with other environmental variables such as Si and nitrate being of secondary importance. Common diatoms include: Anomoeoneis sphaerophora var. guntheri, Navicula tenella, N. cuspidata, and Nitzschia invisitata in hot springs, where diversity is generally low and abundance is variable. Other wetland types contain distinctive diatom floras that variously include: Fragilaria brevistriata, Gomphonema parvulum, Navicula tenelloides, Nitzschia communis, N. latens, N. sigma, Rhopalodia gibberula, and Stauroneis anceps.

On the continent of monsoonal Asia, however, only a few terrestrial temperature reconstructions extend to the Younger Dryas (YD). This hampers the understanding of how the Asian monsoon system responded to large-scale boundary changes in ice-sheet dynamics and reorganizations of atmospheric-oceanic circulation between the last deglaciation and the Holocene. Here, we report an alkenone-inferred temperature record from varved sediments of the maar lake Sihailongwan, northeastern China. Alkenone provides temperatures that represent the water temperature during the growing season when the lake is ice-free. Annually laminated sediments provide a reliable time control. Reconstructed temperatures reveal a distinctive pattern of variations during the last deglaciation: a temperature increase of 6 degrees C at the onset of the BOlling-AllerOd, two cold intervals (during the Older Dryas and the intra-AllerOd cold period), a relatively minor temperature decrease of 1-3 degrees C during the YD, and a rapid temperature increase of 4-5 degrees C at the early Holocene. The reconstructed temperature records from Lake Sihailongwan and adjacent regions indicate that summer (or growing season) temperature changes were smaller than is evident in Greenland ice core records that are weighted toward winter.

The origins of water and gas of the hot springs, lakes, rivers, and rain in the Arxan volcanic region (AVR), northeastern (NE) China, were investigated by conducting a field survey and geochemical analysis. The low electrical conductivity (40-835 mu S/cm) and low total dissolved solids (TDS, 23.83-540.00 mg/L) of the water samples indicate that they are fresh water. delta O-18 and delta D values of the water samples range from -4.1% to -16.0% and from -61.3% to -119.9%, respectively. Enrichment of heavy isotopes in the rainwater and the crater lake waters was caused by evaporation. The component H2O of the water samples predominantly originated from the meteoric water, with less than 1 vol% contributed by deep-earth fluids. Ions in the rain sample were predominantly derived from sea salt and continental aerosol. Ions in the surface water samples had multiple origins (mineral dissolution, atmospheric, and anthropogenic sources). While the ions in the hot spring water were predominantly derived from both the dissolution of rocks and deep-earth fluids, the latter contributed 73%-87% of Cl- and 86%-99% of Na+ to the hot spring waters. Gases from the hot springs were composed of more than 95% N-2 and less than 5% O-2 and Ar, with He-3/He-4 ratios of 0.14-1.17 R-A (R-A=1.4x10(-6)). Excess N-2, Ar, He, and CO2 of the hot springs were mainly derived from both the crust and upper mantle. About 3%-23% of the total He in the bubbling gases from the crater lake waters and hot springs is derived from the mantle, implying a supplement of heat energy from the mantle to the geothermal systems. Significantly, about 12% of the He dissolved in the Budonghe water is derived from the mantle, indicating that plenty of mantle-derived heat transported by deep-earth fluids keeps the river water from freezing. Our results indicate that Cl and Na ions and He-3/He-4 ratio are the feasible geochemical indicators for source partitioning of geothermal fluids.

J	Mercado, ML				Mercado, Monica L. L.			"Catholicism Is Getting to Be the Style": White Women and the Making of Catholic Culture at the Catholic Summer School of America, 1892-1914	RELIGION AND AMERICAN CULTURE-A JOURNAL OF INTERPRETATION												This article presents a new account of the Catholic Summer School of America (CSSA), founded in 1892 as the "Catholic Chautauqua. " Long relegated to the footnotes of book history and Catholic studies, the Summer School and its reading circle antecedents are here reclaimed for the study of women and American religion. As a Catholic institution, the Summer School was directed by clergy and laymen; men's names fill the published histories of the site as a religious and educational retreat. I argue, however, that it was Summer School women who nurtured a complementary vision of middle-class respectability and intimate association among a white Catholic elite that promoted theirs as the aspirational and ascendant U.S. Catholic "style " at the turn of the new century. Loosened from their parish boundaries, these summer Catholics traveled north to New York's Adirondack region and converged on the lakefront, lecture hall, and ballroom, extending their social networks, and creating an exclusive space of belonging that distinguished themselves from the diverse "immigrant church " at home. With close readings of the traces that Summer School visitors left behind in visual and textual sources-including photographs, postcards, local newspaper reports, and previously overlooked fiction and nonfiction by Catholic women writers-I draw attention to the Summer School during its first decades as a critical site for studying an upwardly mobile white Catholic leisure class concerned with its social and cultural reproduction.						/0000-0002-3900-1276													1052-1151	1533-8568					2022	32	2					236	266	PII S1052115122000083	10.1017/rac.2022.8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/rac.2022.8		NOV 2022											WOS:000890808600001

Water geochemistry of shallow lakes from the southeastern Pampa plain, Argentina and their implications on mollusk shells preservation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A seasonal sampling of sediments, column and interstitial water for physico-chemical analysis were performed in littoral and open water areas in three freshwater shallow lakes (Nahuel Ruca, Las Mostazas and Los Carpinchos) from Southeastern Pampa plain, Argentina. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate how the characteristics of the depositional environments could be affecting mollusk shell preservation. These lakes are very shallow (2 m) and are characterized by an extensive littoral area, dominated by the emergent macrophyte Schoenoplectus californicus, which forms a complete ring around the lake, and an open water area, in general free of vegetation. Five samples of sediments in each compartment were extracted for analysis of pH, moisture, organic matter and carbonates content using a gravity corer, while five samples from column and interstitial water were extracted for chemical analysis (pH, conductivity, major ions, minor ions and hardness). Besides, calcite and aragonite saturation indices and the redox potential were calculated for each lake. The results show the significant impact of water chemistry and redox conditions on the preservation potential of freshwater mollusk and consequently in the quality of paleonvironmental reconstruction based on the biological record from the study region. The higher concentration of organic matter and lower pH registered in the littoral area, mainly during warm months (autumn and summer), suggest worst environments for mollusk preservation, compared to open waters. Moreover, water geochemistry analysis showed aragonite and calcite indices near equilibrium or slightly subsaturated in interstitial water associated with more acid pHs, while column water is strongly oversaturated related to alkaline pHs. These results suggest that carbonate remains within sediments will be subject to dissolution affecting negatively their preservation potential. However, mollusk shells in contact with the column water are not expected to be dissolved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Turnock, WJ; Wise, IL; Matheson, FO				Turnock, WJ; Wise, IL; Matheson, FO			Abundance of some native coccinellines (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) before and after the appearance of Coccinella septempunctata	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												The seven-spotted lady beetle, Coccinella septempunctata L., was first reported in Manitoba in 1988. The effect of this introduced species on the relative abundance of the more common native coccinellines was determined from D-Vac Insect Net(R) and sweepnet samples in alfalfa in 1983-2001, by sweepnet and visual sampling in field crops and other vegetation in 1989-2001, and by transect sampling of aggregations of coccinellines in spring and autumn on the shore of Lake Manitoba from 1989 to 2001. The trends of annual changes in the abundance of six species in southern Manitoba were similar, whether based on the mean density per 200 sweeps in alfalfa or on their relative abundance in alfalfa, on other vegetation, and in aggregations on the beach. Before 1988, Hippodamia tredecempunctata tibialis (Say), Coccinella transversoguttata richardsonii Brown., and Hippodamia convergens Guerin were the most abundant species, followed by Hippodamia parenthesis (Say) and Coccinella trifasciata perplexa Mulsant. By 1992, C. septempunctata had become the dominant species, but H. tredecempunctata has since been the dominant species in most collections. The relative abundance of C. transversoguttata, H. convergens, H. parenthesis, and C. trifasciata has decreased since the establishment of C septempunctata. The decline in abundance of these species seems to be caused by their competitive displacement by C. septenipunctata. Their displacement also might be a contributing factor in the slight increase in abundance of H. tredecempunctata because C septempunctata may compete less directly with this species than with other native coccinellines.																			0008-347X					MAY-JUN	2003	135	3					391	404																WOS:000182980500005

Multivariate statistical techniques including cluster, discriminant, and principal component/factor analysis were applied with pre-analysis screening such as kurtosis and skewness checking, correlation testing, ANOVA test, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin statistics, and Bartlett's test to assess and treat the dataset used in this study. This study used two water quality datasets collected on monthly and 8-day basis from 22 and 8 monitoring stations, respectively, within the study area from 2001 to 2013. The two datasets were handled separately. Strong positive correlations were observed between BOD and COD, and between BOD and T-P, indicating the presence of biologically active organic matter. The temporal analysis of individual months and seasons revealed that emphasis ought to be placed on the management of SS and T-P concentrations, especially in January and February during the winter season as well as in June and July during the summer. It is considered based on the spatial analysis that for effective management of water quality focus ought to be on the areas represented by monitoring stations; Wonpyeong A/3, Gobu A/3, Dongjin A/3, and Jeong up A/6 in Dongjin basin as well as Iksan, Iksan 1, Jeonju A/6, Tapcheon A, and Gimje/Mangyeong B in Mangyeong basin, especially during January, February, June, and July.

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Biogeochemical proxy records from Icelandic lake sediment track large-scale shifts in North Atlantic Holocene climate and highlight the impact that North Atlantic Oceanand atmospheric circulation has on Iceland's climate and environment. Following Early Holocene warmth, centennial-scale climate change is superimposed on millennial-scale cooling, culminating in the transition to the Little Ice Age (similar to 1300-190 0 CE). Although the long-term cooling trend is presumably driven by variations in Earth's orbit and the concomitant decline in Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer insolation, the centennial-scale variability has been linked to the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), volcanism coupled with sea ice/ocean related feedbacks, internal modes of atmospheric variability, and plausibly variations in solar irradiance. One manifestation of these regional climate changes on Iceland is the intensification of soil erosion, resulting in the degradation of ecosystems and landscape. In recent millennia, persistent and severe soil erosion has also been linked to human impact on the environment following the settlement similar to 870 CE, rapid population growth, introduction of livestock and the poorly consolidated nature of tephra dominated soils. Lake proxy composite records suggest that although event-dominated landscape instability and soil erosion from the Early to Middle Holocene were likely triggered by large volcanic eruptions, the landscape was capable of recovering. However, a threshold was reached-5 ka BP, resulting in a state change whereby the Icelandic landscape could no longer fully recover from cold-events and/or tephra fall. Landscape sensitivity to climate further intensified at-1.5 ka BP as identified by regime shift analysis. Hence, widespread and irreversible soil erosion began several centuries before the acknowledged settlement of Iceland, with a second acceleration similar to 1250 CE. A 2 ka fully coupled climate transient simulation using CESM1.1 shows a-0.5 degrees C reduction in summer tem-perature around Iceland in the first millennium CE, consistent with increased landscape instability and soil erosion in Iceland. A second phase of persistent summer cooling in the model occurs after 1150 CE, with stronger cooling after 1450 CE, reaching a maximum shortly after 1850 CE, similar to 1 degrees C lower than at the start of the simulation. Our results suggest that natural variations in regional climate and volcanism are likely responsible for soil erosion prior to human impact, with intensification of these processes following settlement particularly during the cooling associated with the Little Ice Age. Given that the conclusions drawn in this review diverge from the standard paradigm of human-induced soil erosion history in Iceland, research should continue to focus on this complex question from multiple disciplines. In particular, a combination of emerging biogeochemical techniques (e.g. lipid biomarkers and ancient DNA) may be best poised to test and quantify the relative roles of natural environmental variables and human settlement in the history of soil erosion on Iceland.

Vulnerability to climate change and anthropogenic activities have contributed to dramatic inter-annual and seasonal changes of the lakes. In this study, we explored the high spatio-temporal dynamics of the lakes of Central Asia using the terraPulse (TM) monthly Landsat-derived surface water extent dataset from 2000 to 2015 and the HydroLAKES dataset. The results identified 9493 lakes and significant linear decreasing trends were identified for both the number (rate: -85 lakes/year, R-2: 0.69) and area (rate: -1314.1 km(2)/year, R-2: 0.84) of the lakes in Central Asia between 2000 and 2015. The decrease rate in lake area accounted for 1.41% of the total lake area. About 75% of the investigated lakes (7142 lakes), mainly located in the Kazakh steppe (especially in the north) and the Badghyz and Karabil semi-desert terrestrial ecological zones, experienced a decrease in the water area. Lakes with increasing water area were mainly distributed in the Northern Tibetan Plateau-Kunlun Mountains alpine desert and Qaidam Basin semi-desert zones in the east-south corner of Central Asia. The possible driving factors of lake decreases in Central Asia were explored for the Aral Sea and Tengiz Lake on yearly and monthly time scales. The Aral Sea showed the greatest decrease in the summer months because of increased evaporation and massive irrigation, while the largest decrease for Tengiz Lake was observed in early spring and was linked to decreasing snowmelt.					liu, jiping/MTA-6852-2025	Sun, Qing/0000-0001-7221-2246														2072-4292				MAR	2021	13	5							1032	10.3390/rs13051032	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13051032													WOS:000628513000001

The record broadly follows the trend in northern hemisphere summer insolation. However, it diverges during a period of increased moisture and thermal conditions during the past similar to 1300 years, broadly corresponding to the ASM "2-kyr shift". This shift as referred by Cheng et al. (Nature 534:640-646, 10.1038/nature18591, 2016) may be related to Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation variations, and potentially to increased forcing by greenhouse gases coincident with reduced ENSO activity. The record is punctuated by several weak monsoon intervals. Cross-correlation of the sub-millennial-scale monsoon record with solar activity and ENSO records shows that most of the monsoon variability potentially results from changes in solar irradiation, and has a strong teleconnection with ENSO activity.

Routinely collected national data sets were used to calculate annualised, age-standardised injury rates. The independent variable of interest was ethnicity (Maori or non-Maori).ResultsThere were 11,834 unintentional injury-related hospitalisations in the study period (n = 1444 for Maori). Overall, there was no significant difference in the age-standardised hospitalisation rate between Maori and non-Maori (Standardised Rate Ratio [SRR] = 0.96 [95% CI 0.90, 1.02]). Falls were the most common mechanism of injury among Maori and non-Maori overall (50% and 71%) and relative risks of falls increased with age. Non-Maori were 57% less likely to be hospitalised for unintentional poisoning than Maori (SRR = 0.43, [0.34, 0.59]).ConclusionsThe mechanisms of injury, and variation in unintentional injury-related hospitalisation rates between Maori and non-Maori, change throughout older age, and incidence increase0073 with age. Falls cause significant injury-related hospitalisations for older Maori and responsive injury prevention and rehabilitation efforts are warranted to achieve equitable health outcomes.					; Kerse, Ngaire/AFF-8119-2022; Cavadino, Alana/CAG-8915-2022	Kerse, Ngaire/0000-0002-5992-3681; Cavadino, Alana/0000-0002-5709-367X; Hikaka, Joanna/0000-0001-6792-6607													1440-6381	1741-6612				JUN	2024	43	2					359	368		10.1111/ajag.13279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajag.13279		JAN 2024						38268323					WOS:001148159900001

Origin of accretionary lapilli within ground-hugging density currents: Evidence from pyroclastic couplets on Tenerife	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Aggregation of airborne particles is an important way in which the atmosphere is cleansed of fine dust particles, such as following explosive eruptions and meteorite impacts. We identify successive stages in the growth history of particle aggregates based upon well-preserved ash aggregate-bearing pyroclastic layers on Tenerife. The layers are persistently organized into couplets made up of a lower ignimbrite layer and an upper, widespread coignimbrite ash-fall layer. The upper part of each ignimbrite contains whole and fragmented concentric-laminated accretionary lapilli, whereas the overlying coignimbrite ash-fall layer lacks accretionary lapilli and is composed of framework-supported smaller and nonlaminated ash pellets, sometimes slightly deformed or partly disaggregated. The pellets resemble the cores of the larger accretionary lapilli in the underlying ignimbrite layer. These field relations are repeated numerous times in several different successions, and they indicate that ash pellets, not accretionary lapilli, form within the coignimbrite ash plumes. Some pellets fell directly to the ground, producing coignimbrite ash-fall layers, but others settled into pyroclastic density currents, where they accreted successive concentric laminations of fine ash as they circulated through the variously turbulent levels of the stratified current, and heat of the lower part of the current dried and partly lithified them into brittle accretionary lapilli. The fully formed whole and broken accretionary lapilli were then deposited from the current along with ash and pumice lapilli. Numerous ignimbrite veneers on Tenerife have the form of ash layers, a few centimeters thick, that drape topography and locally contain matrix-supported accretionary lapilli. Most volcanoes lack laterally continuous field exposure, and such accretionary lapilli-bearing layers might he mistaken for ash-fall deposits. We highlight the value of careful distinction between different types of ash aggregate facies when interpreting the origin of pyroclastic deposits, for example, during hazard assessments.					; Harris, Pablo/H-4148-2019; Davila Harris, Pablo/C-7891-2013	Branney, Michael/0000-0002-9126-7178; Davila Harris, Pablo/0000-0002-0620-5459													0016-7606	1943-2674				JAN-FEB	2010	122	1-2					305	320		10.1130/B26449.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B26449.1													WOS:000273295200018

The seasonal variability of particulate hydrocarbons was studied in the epilimnion and the hypolimnion, focusing on specific periods such as high phytoplankton productivity and rising herbivorous zooplankton activity (May 1986), clearness of waters (June 1986) and intense mixing of waters (February 1986). Analysis of non-aromatic hydrocarbons (NAH) indicated that their major source is the autochtonous phytoplankton. Year 1986 was characterized by a spring bloom of nanoplankton (chlorophyceae and cryptophyceae) which remained predominant during summer and fall. These biological events were correlated with an increase of biogenic NAH, particularly n-alkane and alkene concentrations; the latter increased by one order of magnitude in May. n-Alkane distributions maximized at n-C-17 or n-C-29, and the n-C-17/n-C-29 ratio varied in surface water from 2.8 in May to 0.06 in November of the preceding year, reflecting phytoplankton dominant species. Values of NAH/POC, n-alkanes/POC, alkenes/POC and pristane/phytane ratios underwent seasonal and vertical variations which could be related to grazing and/or settling of particles. NAH, n-alkane and alkene enrichment in hypolimnion particles was interpreted to be a result of zooplankton migrations. A series of 37 monoenes and polyenes having from 15 to 31 carbon atoms, originating from planktonic sources, were recognized in the particulate matter by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Their distribution was described in 3 sized particles (> 200-mu-m, 200-60-mu-m and < 60-mu-m, identified as adult zooplankton, young zooplankton and nanoplankton respectively) at two different periods of the biological cycle, May and June 1986. Low level inputs originating from terrestrial higher plants were evident in particles; the value of the Carbon Preference Index (CPI) in the carbon range 23-35 was less than 2.8. In all samples analyzed by GC, an unresolved complex mixture of hydrocarbons (UCM) was present and was interpreted, at least in May, as partly originating from the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms. Typical anthropogenic PAH, such as benzofluoranthene and dibenzo (a) anthracene, were found at a low level (9 and 3 ng l-1 respectively). The absence of hopane-type hydrocarbons, except in November 1985 and in September 1986, and typical combustion PAH associated with particles indicated high temperature pyrolytic contaminants rather than petroleum-derived compounds.																			0018-8158					NOV 22	1990	207						319	331		10.1007/BF00041471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00041471													WOS:A1990EW45800038
J	Wittmeier, HE; Bakke, J; Vasskog, K; Trachsel, M				Wittmeier, Hella E.; Bakke, Jostein; Vasskog, Kristian; Trachsel, Mathias			Reconstructing Holocene glacier activity at Langfjordjokelen, Arctic Norway, using multi-proxy fingerprinting of distal glacier-fed lake sediments	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Late Glacial and Holocene glacier fluctuations are important indicators of climate variability in the northern polar region and contain knowledge vital to understanding and predicting present and future climate changes. However, there still is a lack of robustly dated terrestrial climate records from Arctic Norway. Here, we present a high-resolution relative glacier activity record covering the past similar to 10,000 cal. a BP from the northern outlet of the Langfjordjokelen ice cap in Arctic Norway. This record is reconstructed from detailed geomorphic mapping, multi-proxy sedimentary fingerprinting and analyses of distal glacier-fed lake sediments. We used Principal Component Analysis to characterize sediments of glacial origin and trace them in a chain of downstream lakes. Of the variability in the sediment record of the uppermost Lake Jokelvatnet, 73% can be explained by the first Principal Component axis and tied directly to upstream glacier erosion, whereas the glacial signal becomes weaker in the more distal Lakes Store Rundvatnet and Storvatnet. Magnetic susceptibility and titanium count rates were found to be the most suitable indicators of Holocene glacier activity in the distal glacier-fed lakes. The complete deglaciation of the valley of Sor-Tverrfjorddalen occurred similar to 10,000 cal. a BP, followed by a reduced or absent glacier during the Holocene Thermal Optimum. The Langfjordjokelen ice cap reformed with the onset of the Neoglacial similar to 4100 cal. a BP, and the gradually increasing glacier activity culminated at the end of the Little Ice Age in the early 20th century. Over the past 2000 cal. a BP, the record reflects frequent high-amplitude glacier fluctuations. Periods of reduced glacier activity were centered around 1880, 1600, 1250 and 950 cal. a BP, while intervals of increased glacier activity occurred around 1680, 1090, 440 and 25 cal. a BP. The large-scale Holocene glacier activity of the Langfjordjokelen ice cap is consistent with regional temperature proxy reconstructions and glacier variability across Norway. Long-term changes in the extent of the northern outlet of the Langfjordjokelen ice cap largely followed trends in regional summer temperatures, whereas winter season atmospheric variability may have triggered decadal-scale glacial fluctuations and generally affected the amplitude of glacier events.

J	Restrepo, NC; Arain, MA				Restrepo, NC; Arain, MA			Energy and water exchanges from a temperate pine plantation forest	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Annual Hydrology Session Meeting of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union	MAY, 2003	Banff, CANADA	Canadian Geophys Union, Hydrol Sect				This paper summarizes the energy and water vapour fluxes for the first 14 months at a newly initiated flux tower site at a 65-year-old temperate conifer forest (Pinus strobus L.) in southern Ontario, Canada. These fluxes have: been measured continuously since February 2002 using the eddy covariance technique as a part of long-term tower flux measurement programme over a chronosequence of white pine stands. The site is located 12 km south of Simcoe, near Turkey Point in St Williams Forest Tract, owned and managed by the Ontario Ministry Natural Resources. The site was originally sandy, abandoned land, which was planted with conifer and deciduous forests. The trees are about 22 m in height. The mean trunk diameter of the trees is 33 cm and the stand stem density is 750 ha(-1). Leaf area index is about 3(.)2 to 4(.)0. The soil is loamy fine sand and very fine sandy loam with low soil-moisture holding capacity. The closure of the daily mean energy balance (H + LE)/(R-n - G - S) was 0(.)90. Typical values of midday Bowen ratio (H/LE) in the growing season were approximately 1(.)4, whereas the midday Bowen ratio values for the winter season were typically 14 to 25. Surface conductance followed variations in solar radiation and vapour pressure deficit. In the growing season, surface conductance values were typically 5(.)12 mm s(-1). Transpiration mainly responded to vapour pressure deficit, rather than surface conductance. However, on warm summer days, when soil moisture was low, vapour pressure deficit exerted strong control on canopy conductance, thereby reducing photosynthetic uptake and water loss. Priestley-Taylor alpha values were low during most of the growing season, indicating dry soil conditions and conservative water loss. In the growing season, maximum daily evaporation values were 3(.)4 mm day(-1). In winter, maximum observed evaporation was 0(.)05-0(.)2 mm day(-1), mostly as a result of snow sublimation. Total calculated evapotranspiration for the 14 month measurement period was 465 +/- 93 mm, and the total measured precipitation was 996 mm, indicating approximately 47% of water loss in the form of evapotranspiration.

J	MCKINLEY, KR				MCKINLEY, KR			LIGHT-MEDIATED UPTAKE OF GLUCOSE-H-3 IN A SMALL HARD-WATER LAKE	ECOLOGY												The occurrence of photoheterotrophy, the light-mediated assimilation of organic compounds at or near natural substrate concentrations, was studied in the phytoplankton of a lake. The pelagic zone of Lawrence Lake, an oligotrophic, dimictic, hard-water lake in southwestern Michigan [USA] was selected as the study site because of extensive information is already available on its C cycle. The uptake of glucose by the plankton was monitored in light and dark bottles over an annual period. Uptake was measured during 3 sampling periods throughout the daylight hours (i.e., sunrise, midday and sunset) and at 3 depths within the water column (i.e., 2, 6 and 10 m). The patterns of dark heterotrophic activity, chemoheterotrophy and light-mediated heterotrophic activity, photoheterotrophy, were significantly related to the variables of months, depths and time of day. Chemoheterotrophic activity generally increased throughout the daylight period and with greater depth within the water column. Maximal values were generally observed during the sunset-incubation series and at 10 m depth. Generally high and uniform activities with respect to depth were observed during periods of water circulation. Increasing activity at greater depth during the stratified summer period was also observed. Maximal values for photoheterotrophy were observed during spring circulation and late summer stratification. Activity was generally greatest below 2 m and during morning and midday incubation periods. There was an apparent shift during the daylight period in the area of maximal uptake from 2 and 6 m in the morning to 6 and 10 m as the day progressed. Chemoheterotrophy and photoheterotrophy are temporally and spatially separated with respect to activity within the water column on a diurnal and seasonal basis. Dark bottle measurements of heterotrophic activity underestimate total activity and can be justified as a means of assessing chemoheterotrophic activity only. Light bottle uptake values averaged 146% of dark bottle estimates during the light period. Photoheterotrophy was quantitatively comparable to chemoheterotrophy within the pelagic zone. Photoassimilation averaged 67.6% of chemoheterotrophic activity based on individual comparisons (N = 360) over an annual period. Photoheterotrophy represents an important step in the further understanding of the C cycling within aquatic systems and of biological interactions within the planktonic community.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1977	58	6					1356	1365		10.2307/1935087	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1935087													WOS:A1977ES71000012

Our data indicates that calcite precipitation takes place as a short Pulse that lasts less than 14 d in response to photosynthetic CO2 uptake in late summer probably by cyanobacterial picoplankton. In up to 8.4 times supersaturated water 30 mum large calcite crystals precipitate that show surface features typical for eutrophic lakes (rough surface and enhanced columnar growth). Subsequently, during the long period of ice coverage calcite is completely dissolved in strongly undersaturated bottom waters. Sediment calcite concentrations therefore are below, 0.3%, although the comparison of trap fluxes and sediment accumulation rates indicates that they could be as high as 25%. The theoretical annual accumulation of calcite in Hagelseewli is similar in magnitude to a single spring precipitation event in a low-altitude temperate, hardwater lake, In the most recent sediments the occurrence of higher amounts of organic carbon and Sulfur indicates increasing bottom water anoxia during the last 30 to 40 yr.

Recently, in the Hungarian Lake Balaton we observed dark water patches forming between every autumn and spring because of the inflow of black suspended/dissolved organic matter into the bright lake water. Earlier, the polarization characteristics of such water surfaces were mapped by imaging polarimeters from the ground. In order to measure the reflection-polarization patterns of these dark lake patches from the higher viewpoint of flying polarotactic aquatic insects, we designed a drone-based imaging polarimeter. We found that the dark lake patches reflected light with very high (60% = d = 80%) degrees of horizontal polarization at the Brewster's angle, while the bright lake water was only weakly (d < 20%) horizontally polarizing. There was a large contrast in both the radiance and degree of polarization between dark lake patches and bright lake water, while there was no such contrast in the angle of polarization. The ecological implication of these findings could be that these dark lake patches attract water-seeking polarotactic insects, which may oviposit more frequently in them than in the brighter lake water. However, it might not matter if they lay their eggs in these dark patches rather than the bright lake water, because this may simply increase the abundance of breeding flying insects in areas where dark patches are common.

Methane Efflux Measured by Eddy Covariance in Alaskan Upland Tundra Undergoing Permafrost Degradation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Greenhouse gas emissions from thawing permafrost in arctic ecosystems may amplify global warming, yet estimates of the rate of carbon release, and the proportion of carbon released as methane (CH4) or carbon dioxide (CO2), have a high degree of uncertainty. There are many areas where no measurements exist, and few year-round or long-term records. Existing year-round eddy covariance measurements of arctic CH4 fluxes suggest that nongrowing season emissions make up a significant proportion of tundra systems emissions on an annual basis. Here we present continuous CH4 flux measurements made at Eight Mile Lake, an upland tundra ecosystem undergoing permafrost degradation in Interior Alaska. We found net CH4 emissions throughout the year (1.2 +/- 0.011g C-CH4 m(2)/yr) that made up 61% of total radiative forcing from annual C emissions (CO2 and CH4; 32.3g C m(2)/yr) when taking into account the greenhouse warming potential of CH4 relative to CO2. Nongrowing season emissions accounted for 50% of the annual CH4 budget, characterized by large pulse emissions. These were related to abrupt increases in air and shallow soil temperatures rather than consistent emissions during the zero curtaina period of the fall/early winter season when subsurface soil temperatures remain near the 0 degrees C freezing point. Weekly growing season CH4 emissions in 2016 and 2017 were significantly related with thaw depth, and the magnitude of CH4 emissions between these seasons was proportional to the rate of active layer thaw throughout the season.

The major outflow point of the waters of the cave system is the Boltiv spring, which feeds the artificial Malom Lake. Previous radon measurements in the cave system and in the spring established the highest radon concentration (71 BqL(-1)) in the springwater. According to previous studies, the origin of radon was identified as iron-hydroxide containing biofilms, which form where there is mixing of cold and thermal waters, and these biofilms efficiently adsorb radium from the thermal water component. Since mixing of waters is responsible for the formation of the cave as well, these iron-hydroxide containing biofilms and the consequent high radon concentrations mark the active cave forming zones. Based on previous radon measurements, it is supposed that the active mixing and cave forming zone has to be close to the spring, since the highest radon concentration was measured there. Therefore radon mapping was carried out with the help of divers in order to get a spatial distribution of radon in the cave passages closest to the spring. Based on our measurements, the highest radon activity concentration (84 BqL(-1)) was found in the springwater. Based on the distribution of radon activity concentrations, direct connection was established between the spring and the Istvan-room of the cave, which was verified by an artificial tracer. However, the distribution of radon in the cave passages shows lower concentrations (18-46 BqL(-1)) compared to the spring, therefore an additional deep inflow from hitherto unknown cave passages is assumed, from which waters with high radon content arrive to the spring. These passages are assumed to be in the active cave formation zone. This study proved that radon activity concentration distribution is a useful tool in underwater cave exploration.

PAH results from the first year of atmospheric sampling (Oct 1997-Oct 1998) at a suburban site near New Brunswick, NJ and a coastal site at Sandy Hook, NJ are presented. PAHs (36) were analyzed at both sites including phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene whose concentrations ranged from 0.74 to 20.9 ng/m(3) and 0.0020 to 0.62 ng/m(3), respectively. PAH concentrations at the suburban site were 2x higher than concentrations measured at the coastal site, consistent with the closer proximity of NE to urban/industrial regions than SH. The seasonal trends of particulate PAH concentrations indicate that PAH sources such as fuel consumption for domestic heating and vehicular traffic drive their seasonal occurrence. While gaseous concentrations of methylated phenanthrenes and pyrene were higher during the winter and similar to high molecular weight PAHs, phenanthrene and fluoranthene show the opposite seasonal trend with concentrations peaking in the summer months. Because temperature accounted for less than 25% of the variability in atmospheric concentrations, seasonal variability could not be attributed to temperature-controlled air-surface exchange. PAH concentrations in the New Jersey coastal atmosphere indicate the importance of local and regional sources originating from urban/industrial areas to the N, NE, and to the SW.					; Dachs, Jordi/LOU-0520-2024	Dachs, Jordi/0000-0002-4237-169X; 													0013-936X					SEP 1	2000	34	17					3547	3554		10.1021/es9912372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es9912372													WOS:000089059700016

In a well-dated core constrained by 8 radiocarbon dates, diatom counts were carried out at 1-mm intervals through an interval spanning 1 cm above and below the tephra layer with each 1 mm sub-sample represented about 2 years of deposition. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and Stratigraphically Constrained Incremental Sum of Squares (CONISS) analyses were carried out and three distinct diatom assemblages were identified throughout the interval. The lowermost "PreWRAe Assemblage (Pre-WRAeA)'' was indicative of slightly acidic and eutrophic lacustrine conditions. Winter deposition of the tephra layer drove a subsequent diatom flora shift to the "WRAe Assemblage (WRAeA)'' the following spring. The WRAeA contained elevated abundances of taxa associated with oligotrophic, nutrient depleted and slightly more alkaline lake waters. These changes were only apparent in samples within the WRAe containing interval indicating that they were short lived and only sustained for a single year of deposition. Immediately above the WRAe horizon, a third, "Post-WRAe Assemblage (Post-WRAeA)'' was observed. This assemblage was initially similar to that of the Pre-WRAeA but gradually became more distinct upwards, likely due to climatic patterns independent of the WRAe event. These results suggest that lacustrine environments are sensitive to perturbations such as deposition of ash fall, but that ecological communities in subarctic systems can also have high resilience and can recover rapidly. If subsampling of the freeze cores was carried out at a more standard resolution (0.5-1 cm) these subtle diatom ecological responses to perturbation associated with the WRAe depositional event would not have been observed. This research illustrates the importance of high-resolution subsampling when studying the environmental impact of geologically "near instantaneous'' events such as episodic deposition of ashfalls.

Although they are increasing in number in several parts of the world, they still form a recent and little studied environmental problem, especially regarding the quality and toxicity of its waters, which may represent worrying environmental risks. This study describes the results of the seasonal analysis of chemical, ecotoxicological and genotoxicological aspects of the waters of three disused gold mining pit lakes located in Mara Rosa, Goias, Brazil. Samples were collected in profile in two different climatic seasons, winter and summer, and were chemically analyzed to determine their load of metals and anions. Ecotoxicological Tests and Comet Assays were also developed with fish of the Danio rerio species. The results indicated that the concentrations of the chemical species analyzed were predominantly increased in the surface-bottom direction and higher during the dry season. Lago Azul waters have been shown to be chemically more compromised as they are acidic and rich in potentially toxic analytes such as aluminum, cadmium, lead, copper, manganese, nickel, and zinc. No significant ecotoxicological alterations were identified for any of the analyzed samples, although, in genotoxicological terms, Lago Azul presented DNA damage from concentrations of 25% in the dry season and 50% in the wet season.					; de Melo e Silva, Daniela/I-1047-2014; Filho, Nelson/R-8297-2019; Bárbara, Viníciu/AAK-9296-2020	Silva, Daniela de Melo/0000-0003-0362-0988; Antoniosi Filho, Nelson Roberto/0000-0002-3067-0385; de Oliveira D'Alessandro, Natalia Cristina/0000-0002-7475-5102													1413-4152	1809-4457				JAN-FEB	2019	24	1					131	142		10.1590/S1413-41522019176320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-41522019176320													WOS:000465570000014
J	Chessman, BC				Chessman, Bruce C.			Freshwater turtle hatchlings that stay in the nest: strategists or prisoners?	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Hatchlings of several species of freshwater turtles have been reported to remain in subterranean nests for extended periods following hatching from the egg. It has been suggested that this delayed emergence, including overwintering in the nest in populations at temperate latitudes, is an evolved adaptation that enables hatchlings to enter the aquatic environment at the most propitious time for survival and growth. I monitored nests of a temperate-zone population of the freshwater Australian eastern long-necked turtle (Chelodina longicollis) for up to a year after nest construction in fine-grained soils adjacent to oxbow lakes and farm ponds. An estimated 84% of nests were preyed on, probably mainly by non-native red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), whereas hatchlings emerged from autumn to spring from an estimated 5% of nests. The remaining 11% of nests were neither preyed on nor had emergence by a year after nest construction. Live hatchlings were present in some nests with no emergence up to 10 months after nest construction, but substantial numbers of dead hatchlings were present beyond nine months. It therefore seems unlikely that emergence occurs more than a year after nest construction. Delayed emergence of this species in this environment appears less likely to be an adaptive strategy than to be a consequence of imprisonment in the nest by hard soil that is difficult for hatchlings to excavate.

Historical changes shown by these plankton remains indicated that the Daphnia population has not produced resting eggs since the 1980s, but it has remained the most abundant zooplankton species in the lake. Plankton monitoring data collected from 1966 to 2000 revealed that the overwintering individuals (January-March) of D. galeata plankters showed a significant increasing trend in recent years, such increase being negatively correlated with ephippial abundance in the sediment samples. Further analyses showed that the dominant phytoplankton in winter has changed from large inedible diatoms to edible flagellated algae, probably due to changes in vertical mixing regimes resulting from winter warming. These changes that occurred in the last several decades suggest that global warming has improved winter food conditions and thus enabled the Daphnia plankton to maintain its population without producing resting eggs in Lake Biwa.

We combined proxy moisture records with the results from a transient simulation forced by changes in orbital parameters to analyse their relationships during the Holocene (9.5-0 ka BP). The proxy records and simulation results generally agree with a relatively dry early Holocene, the wettest period in the middle Holocene, and a dry late Holocene in East Asia. These periods were not solely controlled by precession-driven East Asian summer monsoon variability, but were significantly influenced by precipitation during the other seasons and by evaporation. However, different proxy records show contrasting results for moisture changes in arid central Asia during the Holocene. To study this, we analysed the climatic signals of the competing proxy records by comparing these proxy records with simulation results. We found that speleothem delta O-18 was significantly influenced by water vapour sources and evaporation rather than by the amount of precipitation. Thus, the model data reveals a persistent wetting trend throughout the Holocene that was out-of-phase with the trend in East Asia. The wetting trend in arid central Asia was caused by precipitation that increased faster than evaporation during the Holocene. The enhanced water vapour input from South Asia and the Middle East was the main cause of the increase in precipitation in arid central Asia, which in turn gave rise to the intensification of evaporation.

Dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) was the best individual predictor of late summer epilimnion thickness (r2 = 0.69). Total chlorophyll a, the number of days between ice-out and late-summer stratification, and lake area collectively explained an additional 14% of the variation in epilimnion thickness. The three attributes of summer weather that we examined, mean daily temperature, mean daily wind speed, and mean daily hours of bright sunshine, did not add to the predictive ability of our regression model. Lake acidity also did not add directly to the predictive ability of the model, likely because DOC concentrations already reflected the effects of pH. Our study supports an increasing body of evidence indicating that the dominant effects of climate change on lake thermal structure in small lakes will be through effects on processes that affect lake transparency.

They are characterized by high biodiversity, in addition to which they are astatic and subject to strong anthropopressure due to agricultural production, leading to their eutrophication. The main factors indicating water eutrophication include phosphorus and nitrogen compounds, but of significance are also heavy metals, trace elements and other macro- and microelements contained in water. The study was conducted in two small, in-field ponds in temperate climate. The aim of the undertaken study was to analyse and assess selected macro- and microelements in surface water of two in-field ponds and in groundwater under cultivated soil adjacent to the ponds. The content of the following elements was tested in water: Mg, Ca, Fe, Mn, Na, K, Zn. Among the analyzed macro- and microelements in the studied surface water and groundwater, the highest mean values were observed for calcium and chlorides, and the content of all the elements can be presented in the following order: Ca > Cl > Mg > Na > K > Fe > Mn > Zn. The highest levels of Ca, Cl. Mg and Na were recorded in groundwater under an intensively farmed field in Stare Czarnowo and in the in-field pond located in the middle of this field. Significant seasonal changes in the content of particular macro- and microelements were observed, with frequent peaks, primarily in the summer and autumn, resulting from the mobilization of internal resources from the bottom sediment or water flora.

The Extent and Regulation of Summer Methane Oxidation in Northern Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Inland waters have a significant influence on atmospheric methane (CH4) levels. However, processes determining the strength of CH4 emissions from these systems are not well defined. Aerobic oxidation is a major sink of CH4 in freshwater environments and thus an important determinant of aquatic CH4 emissions, yet strikingly little is known about its drivers. Here we assessed the extent of water column CH4 oxidation at the whole ecosystem scale using stable carbon isotopic (C-13) mass balance of CH4 in 14 northern lakes spanning wide range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. We show that the extent of oxidation can vary from near zero to near complete, and for concentrations of 1.9-11mg/L, DOC is a key modulator of CH4 oxidation during the summer stratification period. Increasing DOC concentrations enhances oxidation in the upper layers by reducing light inhibition on methanotrophic activity, while reducing oxygen available for oxidation in the deeper layers. The effect of this light inhibition was also observable over the diurnal cycle. We developed simple predictive empirical models (r(2)>0.82) to estimate the extent of oxidation in the different layers of lakes for the summer period. Applying our surface layer model to a larger data set suggests that about 30% of CH4 transported to or generated within the epilimnion of Quebec lakes is oxidized during summer. Our results imply that DOC concentration, through its effect on the light regime of lakes, has the potential to affect strongly the magnitude and patterns of summer CH4 emissions.					; Prairie, Yves/B-9108-2008; Thottathil, Shoji/JRY-6701-2023; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	Prairie, Yves/0000-0003-1210-992X; Reis, Paula CJ/0000-0001-6940-0545; Thottathil, Shoji/0000-0002-3246-8930; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159													2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT	2018	123	10					3216	3230		10.1029/2018JG004464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004464													WOS:000450721000009

This study examines microplastic distribution in surface waters, including springs and primary streams, located within small, urban Karst watersheds, with and without sources of wastewater treatment discharge. Study locales were in Texas, United States, either in Waco on the Brazos River or in or downstream from San Marcos on the San Marcos River. Research teams collected 800 ml surface water from four different small watersheds and an urban pond (n = 779) and filtered them through 53 mu m Nitex mesh. Teams collected samples from springs or primary streams to the lower end of creeks and across stream transects based on distance from the bank and the presence of vegetation and debris. Teams also replicated samples seasonally. Stereo microscopy examined each filter for microplastic particles and subsequently color and type (i.e., fragment, fiber, or sphere). Additionally, we analyzed the influence of urbanization and land use on the origin and transport of the microplastics. Overall, the filters recovered 1,198 microplastic fibers and fragments. On average, 56.7% of all samples at each study locale contained microplastics. Particle abundance was the highest at Proctor Springs ( x over bar = 3.38 ) and lowest at the pond ( x over bar = 0.98 ) , both headwaters. Local human use and runoff were thus potentially important factors in microplastic presence, while sewage discharge was not unilaterally the primary determinant of microplastic abundance. Peak pollution events occurred in June, September, and October, indicating seasonality of rainfall and recreation affected microplastic frequency and type.

Factors difficult to determine in its water balance are evaporation and groundwater inflow, some of which emanate as submarine groundwater discharge. A vertical buoyant jet generated by the difference in densities between the groundwater and the Dead Sea brine forms at submarine spring outlets. To characterize this flow field and to determine its volumetric discharge, a system was developed to measure the velocity and density of the ascending submarine groundwater across the center of the stream along several horizontal sections and equidistant depths while divers sampled the spring. This was also undertaken on an artificial submarine spring with a known discharge to determine the quality of the measurements and the accuracy of the method. The underwater widening of the flow is linear and independent of the volumetric spring discharge. The temperature of the Dead Sea brine at lower layers primarily determines the temperature of the surface of the upwelling, produced above the jet flow, as the origin of the main mass of water in the submarine jet flow is Dead Sea brine. Based on the measurements, a model is presented to evaluate the distribution of velocity and solute density in the flow field of an emanating buoyant jet. This model allows the calculation of the volumetric submarine discharge, merely requiring either the maximum flow velocity or the minimal density at a given depth.

The objective of the dissertation was to assess the quality of Samoleskie Lake waters that was delivered based on the studies carried out in spring and summer, when the waterbody demonstrates excessive fertility. The studies covered the analysis of the basic physical and chemical parameters of the lake water. The measurement was carried out on a fortnight basis by means of a measurement apparatus such as the photometer and the Secchi disc. The collected results are presented with the use of figures later in this paper, whereas their in-depth analysis allowed to compile and formulate conclusions.

Zooplankton of different size was seasonally sampled for two years in three deep Italian subalpine lakes (Maggiore, Como, Iseo) with the aim of determining the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), DDT, and PCB, and assessing the seasonality impacts on contaminants concentrations. In general, Lake Maggiore showed the highest concentrations for each group of contaminants, with mean values of 7.6 ng g(-1) ww for PFAS, 65.0 ng g(-1) dw for DDT, and 65.5 ng g(-1) dw for PCB. When considering the composition pattern, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was detected in 96% of the samples and it was the predominant PFAS compound in all of the lakes. pp' DDE was the most detected congener among DDTs and their metabolites, while for PCBs, the prevalent group was hexa-CB that constituted 35.4% of the total PCB contamination. A seasonal trend was highlighted for all contaminant groups with concentrations in colder months greater than in spring and summer; it was evident that the contaminant concentrations were more dependent from seasonality than from size, trophic levels, and taxa composition of zooplankton. Principal component analysis showed that one of the main driver for the accumulation of most of the studied contaminants is their lipophilicity, except for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and octachlorobiphenyl.

Recruitment events occurred sporadically during December and between March and July at Botany Bay and between February and July at Lake Illawarra. Recruitment did not occur during late winter or spring at either location, although small numbers of recruit medusae could potentially occur during any time of year. Despite anecdotal observations that recruitment sometimes occurred after periods of heavy rain, we found no correlation between the timing of recruitment and rainfall in Botany Bay over a period of 8 years. Cohort analyses indicated growth of small medusae was very rapid (max. 4.81 mm day(-1)), with growth rates decreasing as medusae grew larger. Medusae appeared to grow faster at Botany Bay than Lake Illawarra. A conservative estimate indicated medusae of C. mosaicus can live for up to 13 months.

Springs and groundwater from the northern, western and southern parts of the lake basin display relatively stable compositions, close to those of the mean precipitation, evidencing their fast infiltration rate. Springs located in the eastern part of the basin have enriched compositions, which are on the mixing line between the "non evaporated" water and the evaporated take water. This underlines the hydraulic continuity between the lake and the eastern springs and supports a previous proposition of grounwater outflow from Lake Masoko. The mixing parts of lake water calculated at each spring are constant through time, evidencing the inertia of the system. Furthermore, the mixing part of the lake water decreases linearly with the distance from the lake, suggesting an homogeneous and continuous aquifer. These observations point to a west to east groundwater flow, in agreement with the altitude of different potentials.					; Majule, Amos/ABD-5185-2020; Garcin, Yannick/IUQ-1103-2023	MAJULE, AMOS/0000-0002-9928-7632; Garcin, Yannick/0000-0001-8205-494X; 													0262-6667					OCT	2005	50	5					867	880		10.1623/hysj.2005.50.5.867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.2005.50.5.867													WOS:000232584200010

Species turnover drives β-diversity patterns across multiple spatial and temporal scales in Great Lake Coastal Wetland Communities	HYDROBIOLOGIA												beta dissimilarity indices have described community variation occurring from unique structuring processes: species turnover and nestedness. However, the importance of scale definition remains critical and challenging during beta assessments with a need for simultaneous spatial and temporal assessment to determine ecological phenomena governing biological communities. We aim to examine the contribution of turnover and nestedness structuring processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales to demonstrate the importance of scale consideration in beta assessments. Using a site-to-basin-wide spatiotemporal hierarchical design, we examined diversity patterns, testing spatial, and temporal facets of beta diversity structuring Laurentian Great Lake coastal wetland fish and macroinvertebrate communities from 2000 to 2012. Both fish and macroinvertebrate communities were analyzed using beta dissimilarity indices under the same hierarchical design. Results indicated strong spatial and temporal turnover structuring with increasing beta diversity and community turnover as scale localized. We suggest that high turnover is the result of inhospitable winter conditions followed by random re-colonization events in the spring. With relatively unique communities across space and time, biodiversity-oriented management of coastal wetlands should consider an all-inclusive approach as biodiversity hotspots are not apparent.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2016	777	1					55	66		10.1007/s10750-016-2762-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2762-2													WOS:000379019900004
J	PADISAK, J				PADISAK, J			THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT DISTURBANCE FREQUENCIES ON THE SPECIES RICHNESS, DIVERSITY AND EQUITABILITY OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN SHALLOW LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The relationships between the species richness, diversity and equitability of phytoplankton is discussed in the context of Connell's (1978, Science 199: 1304-13 1 0) Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH). The records of 759 vertical phytoplankton samples, which were obtained from four shallow central European lakes (Balaton, Neusiedlersee, and two small artificial ponds) at daily to weekly intervals were analysed. 1) The Shannon-Weaver function was used to measure diversity of the recorded species composition of the phytoplankton. It is shown on fictitious data that compositional diversity is sensitive to the number of coequilibrating species provided that the suspected interrelationship between diversity and 'complexity' is amenable to the application of this method. 2) The disturbance scale that was developed on the basis of the field records fits well to Reynolds' (1988, Verh. int. Ver. Limnol. 23: 683-691) derivation: <3 days qualifies as high frequency, approximately 3-8 days as intermediate frequency and > 8-9 days as low frequency of disturbance for phytoplankton. 3) Arithmetical means of the compositional diversity of phytoplankton under different frequencies of disturbance support the hypothesis that maximal diversity appears at intermediate frequencies. 4) There are different reasons for decrease in diversity at higher and lower frequencies. Inequitability diminishes diversity at low disturbance; while species number decreases at high frequencies. 5) Tle case of Neusiedlersee calls attention to the fact that it is difficult, if at all possible, to differentiate between the indices under continuous stress and high frequency of disturbance in lakes in temperate regions. Similar species number-equitability pattern are induced by both and it is also presumable that high frequency disturbance can itself effect a serious stress. 6) The striking effects that regular major periodic events (e.g. significant changes in the grazing pressure at the onset of the clear-water phase, autumnal cooling) in the plankton have on its species diversity are evident. Thus, the relative importance of intermediate frequency disturbances has its own seasonality: it is increasingly important in periods (partly in the spring, but mostly in the summer-autumn equilibrium phases), in which competition among phytoplankton species is increasing. This observation suggests a way by which the stochasticity-based IDH can be incorporated into rather more deterministic explanations (e.g. PEG-model; Sommer et al., 1986. Archiv fur Hydrobiologie 106: 433-47 1) of plankton succession. 7) The most controversial issue and, therefore, the main difficulty, with IDH is that it not only maintains species richness in an ecosystem but it also supposes its presence. The lack of either early or late successional species in a given community can inactivate the mechanism. From the point of view of the diversity-species richness relationship, the persistence of disturbance at given frequencies is of greater importance than the temporal alterations themselves in the evolutionary ecology of the phytoplankton. 8) For characteristically unperturbed phytoplankton communities (no case was studied here), equilibrium concepts (niche diversification, etc.) should be more strongly applicable to their diversity and species richness.

Food Habits of Wintering Waterfowl on the Great Salt Lake, Utah	WATERBIRDS												Two invertebrates, brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) and brine flies (Ephydridae), occur in great densities in the Great Salt Lake (GSL) but it is unknown whether ducks forage extensively on them during winter or rely on freshwater food. Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata) and Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca) were collected from the GSL during winters 2004-05 and 2005-06 to evaluate their food habits. Brine shrimp and brine flies comprised more than 70% of the winter diet of these ducks. Common Goldeneyes consumed mainly brine fly larvae (68% based on dry weight biomass), which live primarily along the substrate. Northern Shovelers fed on brine shrimp cysts (52%) and adult brine shrimp (20%) while Green-winged Teal consumed mainly brine shrimp cysts (80%). In some years, up to half of the brine shrimp cysts in the GSL are commercially harvested. Care should be taken so that this commercial harvest does not adversely impact ducks that depend on these brine shrimp cysts for winter food. Received 23 June 2010, accepted 4 November 2010.

Long-term decline in stream total phosphorus concentrations: A pervasive pattern in all watershed types in Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Cultural eutrophication of the Great Lakes resulted in actions to reduce phosphorus loading beginning in the 1970's. Despite these measures, a resurgence of harmful algae blooms began in the 1990s. Non-point sources and changing agricultural practices are frequently cited as contributing to this resurgence. We examined changes in total phosphorus concentrations ([TP]) and several other water quality parameters from April through November from 1979 to 2011 using 56 streams throughout Ontario, including agricultural, undeveloped, urban, and mixed-use watersheds. Growing season median [TP] was not significantly different among stream types, but decreased in 32 of the 56 sites; only one urban site increased. There were weak differences among land uses; mixed sites typically had the highest [TP] and steepest declines. Soluble reactive P concentration [SRP] decreased at 12 sites, and increased at one agricultural and three urban sites. Where trends were significant, suspended solids typically decreased, while [Cl-] and alkalinity typically increased. As adequate winter data were not available and there may have been changes in the seasonal distribution of high flow during the period we studied, the changes we observed in median growing season [TP] may not reflect changes in loading. However, seasonal discharge trends were not significant except for one site with a decreasing trend in spring discharge. Possible mechanisms for pervasive downward trends in TP include improved rural and urban land use practices, reduced acid precipitation, increased nitrogen availability in terrestrial ecosystems, and ongoing forest regrowth after initial clear-cutting.

Annual and seasonal dynamics of fish in the brackish-water Matsalu Bay, Estonia	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH					Conference on Behaviour and Ecology of Freshwater Fish - Linking Ecology and Individual Behaviour	AUG 22-26, 2004	Silkeborg, DENMARK	Danish Inst Fisheries Res, Dept Inland Fisheries & Ecol Freshwater Fish				Matsalu Bay in the Vainameri (West-Estonian Archipelago Sea) is a relatively shallow but large bay. It is the only real delta estuary in the northern Baltic Sea. The fish fauna is strongly dominated by freshwater species such as perch Perca fluviatilis, roach Rutilus rutilus, white bream Blicca bjoerkna and rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus. The study presents CPUE data describing annual and seasonal variations in the species composition, abundance and spatial distribution, based on 1 year of monthly samplings from August 2001 to August 2002 and routine coastal monitoring (in late July-early August) between 1994 and 2003. The bay can be divided into three rather distinct parts. The fish fauna of the inner part (salinity 0-2 p.p.t.) is different from two open parts and resembles that of freshwater lakes. In the openmost part (salinity usually 4-6 p.p.t.) some marine species, such as herring Clupea harengus membras, flounder Platichthys flesus and eelpout Zoarces viviparus may seasonally be abundant. Species composition and abundance of most species varies seasonally and interannually. Only the abundance of few species such as pike Esox lucius and pikeperch Stizostedion lucioperca was not impacted by seasonality. The most dynamic period in the bay is spring, when several species (some of them very rare in summer, such as herring and smelt Osmerus eperlanus) enter the bay for spawning.

Mysterious increases of whiting events in the Bahama Banks	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												"Whiting" events in the Bahama Banks, due to high concentrations of carbonate-rich particles suspended in the water, have been reported and discussed widely in the past 80 years. However, little is known about their distributions and particularly about their long-term changes. Here, using a deep learning (DL) model, we objectively delineate and quantify whiting features from Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite images (250-m resolution) and establish an 18-year data record (2003-2020) of whiting occurrences in the Bahama Banks. Both the Great Bahama Bank (GBB) and the Little Bahama Bank (LBB) show clear seasonality in whiting areas, where a primary peak in spring and a secondary peak in winter are found in the GBB but only one peak in winter is found in the LBB. Such a seasonality may be explained using a hydrodynamic hypothesis on calcium carbonate precipitation. The mean size of individual whiting patches in the GBB is about 2.4 +/- 6.1 km2 (-0.1 to 226 km2), while in the LBB is 1.4 +/- 2.7 km2 (-0.1 to 95 km2). The total whiting coverage in a typical cloud-free image is 87.1 km2 in the GBB and 32.0 km2 in the LBB, representing 0.14% and 0.76% of the entire GBB and LBB, respectively. Significant increases in the mean coverage have been found in the GBB since 2011, with peak coverage (-200 km2) in 2013-2015 being at least 4 times higher than before (20-70 km2). Although the whiting area started to decrease after 2015, it did not reach the pre-2011 level until 2020. On the other hand, correlation analysis and principal component analysis of several environmental factors (pH, light, salinity, carbonate, aragonite, winds, currents) provided some hints on which factors may have contributed. From these, we infer a potential 'Goldilocks' scenario, whereby decreases in pH and carbonate concentration, concomitant with increases in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and current speeds, created conditions increasingly favorable for whitings from 2011 to 2015. Continuation of these environmental trends after 2015, however, resulted in conditions increasingly unfavorable for whiting formation, yet without field-based measurements it is difficult to conclude the potential reasons for increases and decreases of whiting formation in the GBB.					; hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012	Barnes, Brian/0000-0003-0056-3500; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				FEB 1	2023	285								113389	10.1016/j.rse.2022.113389	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113389		DEC 2022											WOS:000896858300003

During a 1-year study, major ions (Na+, NH4 + K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl, F, NO3 , NO2 , SO4 2 and PO4 3) were determined in groundwater samples from boreholes, the springs that feed Lake Goreckie and the lake itself. The vertical variability of water-soluble constituents of sediments near the lake was also studied. It was found that changes in groundwater-dependent ecosystems are related to the type of sediment, groundwater, springs and lake eutrophication. Nitrate and chloride concentrations in groundwater and springs were found to exceed the water quality standards set by both the Polish national limits and those of the World Health Organisation.

Aquifer and surface-water ostracodes in Quaternary paleowetland deposits of southern Nevada, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A diverse assemblage of Late Quaternary continental ostracodes (Class Crustacea) belonging to at least 15 genera and 40 species (including 11 new species and one new genus, Plicocandona, described here) was found in sediments of former groundwater discharge deposits located in valleys of southern Nevada, U.S.A. The fossiliferous deposits are located in Las Vegas, Coyote Springs, Indian Springs, Sandy, and Pahrump Valleys. The ostracodes include species that were probably living in wetmeadow, seep, flowing-spring, stream, and wetland environments, and include aquifer species. Those environments indicate a higher level of effective moisture than occurs today during several episodes of the Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene, from similar to 140 to similar to 9 ka. The ostracode assemblages are significant to our understanding of regional paleohydrology and also contribute to the growing knowledge of aquifer taxa diversity and biogeography.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2017	786	1					41	57		10.1007/s10750-016-2966-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2966-5													WOS:000390031100004
J	Noel, J; Changnon, D				Noel, J; Changnon, D			A pilot study examining US winter cyclone frequency patterns associated with three ENSO parameters	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Teleconnections were used to link three El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) parameters to winter (December-February) cyclone frequencies over the United States during the 1949-96 period. Since each ENSO event is not exactly the same, small subsets of ENSO events were examined in addition to the more common composite ENSO event. Mean winter cyclone frequencies, derived by counting cyclones passing through 30, 5 degrees latitude equal-area circles located in a grid from 70 degrees to 120 degrees W and 30 degrees to 50 degrees N were determined for classes of El Ninos and La Ninas based on 1) the intensity of the equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly, 2) the intensity of the Tahiti-Darwin sea level pressure anomaly, and 3) the location of the 28 degrees C isotherm. The average cyclone count for each class of El Nino and La Nina was compared to the average count for winters when no ENSO event occurred. Expected differences in cyclone frequency patterns when comparing an average of all El Nino winters to all La Nina winters were found; however, large pattern differences were also determined when comparing winters with strong El Ninos to moderate-weak El Ninos and similarly for La Ninas. Significant differences in number of cyclones were found in 8 of 30 circles located in the Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes, New England, and the Southeast. The differences found in the cyclone frequency patterns for El Ninos and La Ninas of different intensities and locations indicated that using a composite of air El Ninos or La Ninas may provide misleading information while examination of each of these parameters independently may assist in the preparation of long-range climate predictions.																			0894-8755					AUG	1998	11	8					2152	2159		10.1175/1520-0442-11.8.2152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442-11.8.2152													WOS:000075420300021

J	WilliamsHowze, J				WilliamsHowze, J			Biology and morphology of the marine harpacticoid copepod Heteropsyllus nunni Coull, during encystment diapause	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Symposium on Diaupause in the Crustacea	SEP 12-17, 1994	ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA	Russian Fdn Fundamental Investigat				Heteropsyllus nunni Coull, a meiobenthic harpacticoid copepod is the only marine crustacean to undergo a state of diapause within a cyst. A 12 month field study indicated H. nunni adults reached peak population densities in winter, with nauplii maturing in the spring, becoming adults by April or May. At the last stage of development, a mature but unmated adult, they begin to prepare for encystment diapause. The copepods remain within their cyst in a state of diapause for 4-6 months during the summer only. Studies on the effects of temperature and photoperiod suggested that these two environmental cues are not crucial for induction or termination of diapause. Low temperature delayed development and time to encystment, while high temperatures accelerated development, making the time to encystment shorter. There were more males than females in the cysts in laboratory experiments. Upon excystment, the copepods mate, and females begin egg production within one week. Adults that have excysted and mated die after a few weeks of active reproductive effort. Nauplii go on to mature and begin the univoltine diapause/reproductive cycle. The copepods prepare for dormancy in two ways: they begin to produce and store two types of secretory products to be used in cyst construction; then they produce large quantities of lipid to be used as a nutrient supply throughout diapause. Histochemistry of the cyst-building material indicated the lower urosome is full of two chemically different products. Dorsally, there is a storage sac of proteinaceous material. The ventral sac of secretory product is a mucopolysaccharide. The copepod builds the spherical cysts in a matrix of small and large sand grains. The cysts fit tightly around the ventral portion of the animal in the its flexed position: however, there is a large space between the cyst and the sides of the copepod. Biochemical analysis of the cyst showed it is composed of an amino acid complex similar to collagenous material. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a complex of large cuticular pores located in the lower urosome and caudal rami. There are specific pores for secretion of the two cyst-building products.																			0018-8158					MAR 1	1996	320	1-3					179	189		10.1007/BF00016819	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016819													WOS:A1996UE14900021

The seasonal dynamics in temperate lake plankton communities, with emphasis on both physical and biological forcing factors, were captured in the 1980s in a conceptual framework, the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model. 2.Taking the PEG model as our starting point, we discuss anticipated changes in seasonal and long-term plankton dynamics and extend this model to other climate regions, particularly polar and tropical latitudes. Based on our improved post-PEG understanding of plankton dynamics, we also evaluate the role of microbial plankton, parasites and fish in governing plankton dynamics and distribution. 3.In polar lakes, there is usually just a single peak in plankton biomass in summer. Lengthening of the growing season under warmer conditions may lead to higher and more prolonged phytoplankton productivity. Climate-induced increases in nutrient loading in these oligotrophic waters may contribute to higher phytoplankton biomass and subsequent higher zooplankton and fish productivity. 4.In temperate lakes, a seasonal pattern with two plankton biomass peaks in spring and summer can shift to one with a single but longer and larger biomass peak as nutrient loading increases, with associated higher populations of zooplanktivorous fish. Climate change will exacerbate these trends by increasing nutrient loading through increased internal nutrient inputs (due to warming) and increased catchment inputs (in the case of more precipitation). 5.In tropical systems, temporal variability in precipitation can be an important driver of the seasonal development of plankton. Increases in precipitation intensity may reset the seasonal dynamics of plankton communities and favour species adapted to highly variable environments. The existing intense predation by fish on larger zooplankters may increase further, resulting in a perennially low zooplankton biomass. 6.Bacteria were not included in the original PEG model. Seasonally, bacteria vary less than the phytoplankton but often follow its patterns, particularly in colder lakes. In warmer lakes, and with future warming, a greater influx of allochthonous carbon may obscure this pattern. 7.Our analyses indicate that the consequences of climate change for plankton dynamics are, to a large extent, system specific, depending on characteristics such as food-web structure and nutrient loading. Indirect effects through nutrient loading may be more important than direct effects of temperature increase, especially for phytoplankton. However, with warming a general picture emerges of increases in bacterivory, greater cyanobacterial dominance and smaller-bodied zooplankton that are more heavily impacted by fish predation.

The inorganic matter-generated turbidity in Lake Chapala (Mexico) was taken as a study case to expose the influence of such factors. Ground-based data from this study and historical records were used as references. We take advantage of the at-surface reflectance from Landsat-8, sun-glint corrections, a reduced NIR-band range, and null organic matter incidence in these wavelengths to diminish the physical phenomena-related radiometric artifacts; leaving the spatio-temporal relationships as the principal factor inducing the model uncertainty. Non-linear correlations were assessed to calibrate the best empirical model; none of them presented a strong relationship (<73%), including that based on hourly delays. This last model had the best predictability only for the summer-fall season, explaining 71% of the turbidity variation in 2016, and 59% in 2017, with RMSEs < 24%. The instantaneous turbidity maps depicted the hydrodynamic complexity of the lake, highlighting a strong component of spatial randomness associated with the temporal delays. Reasonably, robust empirical models will be developed if several dates and sampling-sites are synchronized with more satellite overpasses.

The study area covers the main (central) part of the Lena River catchment in the Yakutia region of Siberia (Russia), extending from east of Yakutsk to the central Siberian Plateau, and from the southern Lena River to north of the Vilyui River. Approximately 90% of the area is underlain by continuous permafrost. Remote sensing products were used to analyze changes in water bodies, land surface temperature (1ST), and leaf area index (LAI), as well as the occurrence and extent of forest fires, and the area and duration of snow cover. The remote sensing analyses (for 1ST, snow cover, LAI, and fire) were based on MODIS-derived NASA products (250-1000 m) for 2000 to 2011. Changes in water bodies were calculated from two mosaics of (USGS) Landsat (30 m) satellite images from 2002 and 2009. Within the study area's 315,000 km(2) the total area covered by lakes increased by 17.9% between 2002 and 2009, but this increase varied in different parts of the study area, ranging between 11% and 42%. The land surface temperatures showed a consistent warming trend, with an average increase of about 0.12 degrees C/year. The average rate of warming during the April-May transition period was 0.17 degrees C/year and 0.19 degrees C/year in the September-October period, but ranged up to 0.49 degrees C/year during September-October. Regional differences in the rates of land surface temperature change, and possible reasons for the temperature changes, are discussed with respect to changes in the land cover. Our analysis of a broad spectrum of variables over the study area suggests that the spring warming trend is very likely to be due to changes in the area covered by snow. The warming trend observed in fall does not, however, appear to be directly related to any changes in the area of snow cover, or to the atmospheric conditions, or to the proportion of the land surface that is covered by water (i.e., to wetting and drying).

Occupation, body size and sex ratio of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in established and newly invaded areas of an Ontario river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Invasive species represent a challenge because the particular characteristics of a species' invasion are often unknown before the invasion. To provide some clarity as to how invasive species demographic structure might change as a population advances its range, we compared the proportion of occupied sites, size structure and sex ratio of round gobies in the area where they first invaded with more recently invaded areas at the extent of their range in a river in south-eastern Ontario. We used a standardized angling technique to sample gobies larger than 45-mm total length in the summer and early autumn of 2007. Round goby at the upstream and downstream extent of their range occupied a lower proportion of randomly selected sites, and contained a wider distribution of sizes as well as significantly larger individuals. Sex ratios in all areas were male-biased and the male-to-female ratio was significantly higher in the upstream segment of the river (2.2:1) compared to the area of first introduction (1.4:1). The difference between the newly invaded and the established sites suggests that round goby population structure may be affected by density. The results of this study help us further describe the demographic characteristics of biological invasions whilst examples of population structure and behaviour in gobies and other species provide a basis for generating hypotheses for range expansion.

High rates of mercury biomagnification in fish from Amazonian floodplain-lake food webs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Despite a global phase out of some point sources, mercury (Hg) remains elevated in aquatic food webs, posing health risks for fish-eating consumers. Many tropical regions have fast growing organisms, potentially short food chains, and few industrial point sources, suggesting low Hg baselines and low rates of trophic magnification with limited risk to people. Nevertheless, insufficient work on food-web Hg has been undertaken in the tropics and fish consumption is high in some regions. We studied Hg concentrations in fishes from floodplain lakes of the Jurua River, Amazonas, Brazil with three objectives: 1) determine rates of Hg trophic magnification, 2) assess whether Hg concentrations are high enough to impact humans eating fish, and 3) determine whether there are seasonal differences in fish Hg con-centrations. A total of 377 fish-muscle samples were collected from 12 floodplain lakes during the low-water (Septem-ber 2018) and falling-water (June 2019) seasons and analysed for total Hg and stable nitrogen (N) isotopes. The average trophic magnification factor (increase per trophic level) was 10.1 in the low-water season and 5.4 in the falling-water season, both well above the global average for freshwaters. This high rate of trophic magnification, coupled with higher-than-expected Hg concentrations in herbivorous species, led to high concentrations (up to 17.6 ng/g dry weight) in predatory pirarucu and piranha. Nearly 70% of all samples had Hg concentrations above the rec-ommended human-consumption guidelines. Average concentrations were 42% higher in the low-water season than the falling-water season, but differences varied by species. Since Hg concentrations are higher than expected and fish consumption in this region is high, future research should focus on Hg exposure for human populations here and in other tropical-rainforest regions, even in the absence of local point sources of Hg.

The wolf spiders of artesian springs in arid South Australia, with a revalidation of Tetralycosa (Araneae, Lycosidae)	JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY												Artesian springs, commonly referred to as mound springs, are isolated unique threatened wetlands in and central Australia that harbor a large number of endemic and relict species. Wolf spiders (Lycosidae) are the dominant invertebrate predators in mound springs and are the most abundant spider family present. Nine species are common, five of which are known to occur in other Australian wetland habitats, such as river floodplains and lakeshores: Artoria howquaensis Framenau 2002, Hogna crispipes (L. Koch 1877) new combination (= Trochosa pulveresparsa (L. Koch 1877) new synonymy; = Geolycosa tongatabuensis (Strand 1911) new synonymy; = Tarentula tanna Strand 1913 new synonymy; = Lycosa waitei Rainbow 1917 new synonymy; = Lycosa strenua Rainbow 1920 new synonymy; = Lycosa rainbowi (Roewer 1951) new synonymy), Venatrix arenaris (Hogg 1905), V. fontis Framenau & Vink 2001, and V. goyderi (Hickman 1944). Four species commonly found in mound springs are described as new: Artoria victoriensis new species, Hogna diyari new species, H. kuyani new species, and Tetralycosa arabanae new species. Venatrix fontis and T. arabanae are mainly found at mound springs and have only rarely been recorded from other wetland habitats. Tetralycosa Roewer 1960 is revalidated with Lycosa meracula Simon 1909 as type species. The genus is defined by its unique mate pedipalp morphology with a deeply divided tegulum that carries a mesally directed spur on its retrolateral section opposing the book-shaped median apophysis. Three Australian species are transferred to Tetralycosa: T. alteripa (McKay 1976) new combination, T. eyrei (Hickman 1944) new combination and T. oraria (L. Koch 1876) new combination (= Trochosa candicans (L. Koch 1877) new synonymy; = Lycosa meracula Simon 1909 new synonymy). Hogna pexa (Hickman 1944) new combination, an Australian wolf spider closely related to Hogna kuyani new species, is transferred from Pardosa.

Introducing water from the main channel can increase oxygen levels in backwaters, but can also increase current velocity and reduce temperature during winter, which may reduce habitat suitability for fish. In 1993, culverts were installed to introduce flow to the Finger Lakes, a system of six backwater lakes on the Mississippi River, about 160 km downstream from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The goal was to improve habitat for bluegills and black crappies during winter by providing dissolved oxygen concentrations > 3 mg/L, current velocities < 1 cm/s, and temperatures > 1 degrees C. To achieve these conditions, we used data on lake volume and oxygen demand to estimate the minimum flow required to maintain 3 mg/L of dissolved oxygen in each lake. Estimated flows ranged from 0.02 to 0.14 m(3)/s among lakes. Data gathered in winter 1994 after the culverts were opened, indicated that the estimated flows met habitat goals, but that thermal stratification and lake morphometry can reduce the volume of optimal habitat created.

Placing environmental DNA monitoring for new detections into perspective: Fishes in the Milwaukee River, Wisconsin	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Invasive species management frameworks, such as the early detection of and rapid response to invasive species, use monitoring programs to detect new species occurrences. Resource managers use environmental DNA (eDNA) as one tool for these monitoring programs. An eDNA detection in a new location may lack perspective for resource managers and researchers because of the rarity of potential invaders and the randomness in their dispersal and detection. An example monitoring program is the eDNA-based sampling approach used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for bigheaded carps Hypophthalmichthys spp. in the upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Basins that collects hundreds of water samples per event. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service detected a single positive sample for Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis during the spring 2021 sampling event in the Kinnickinnic River within the Milwaukee River Basin, and detected a second single positive sample for bigheaded carps during the fall 2021 sampling event in the Milwaukee River. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not detect any bigheaded carps in previous years (2015 to 2020) or in either the spring or fall 2022 sampling events. These detections lacked perspective, such as detection numbers for other species. We reanalyzed the 2021 and 2022 samples for four existing species of fish: two fairly common species (Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum) and two fairly rare species (Burbot Lota lota and Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella). We detected Common Carp during all four sampling events, Gizzard Shad during three of four sampling events, and Burbot and Grass Carp during two of four sampling events. These results demonstrated that current sampling efforts could detect other species, and bigheaded carp eDNA was not common in the Milwaukee River compared to these species. More specifically, this finding indicates bigheaded carp eDNA detections are as rare as, or rarer than, Grass Carp eDNA detections, a recent invader to the basin. Our findings also demonstrated how reanalyzing eDNA samples after positive detections for targeted species can help managers understand the context of the detections and provide perspective for the relative abundance of the targeted species. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of completing long-term eDNA-based monitoring rather than a single sampling or inventory event. These detections may have been missed in a single year or sampling event, whereas a multiyear monitoring program provides an opportunity to observe trends through time.

However, further research is needed as these wetlands transition to warmer and drier states. This study focused on the diversity and richness of wintering birds in the alpine wetlands of the Yamzho Yumco Lake. By analyzing data collected from 17 sampling sites over seven years, we examined the abundance changes of waterbirds in the lake and surrounding land and determined the relationship between the structure of waterbird communities and climate data. The results have shown that the abundance, richness, and alpha-diversity index of wintering waterbirds fluctuated. Wintering waterbirds were positively correlated with monthly mean temperature and monthly mean higher temperature and negatively correlated with monthly total precipitation and water level. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that temperature contributed the most to the wintering waterbirds. Bird abundance and diversity in the drying wetlands of Yamzho Yumco Lake showed the same results. As temperatures continue to increase and precipitation decreases, the number of wintering waterbirds may also increase. We have highlighted the indicative role of Yamzho Yumco Lake in climate change responses from warming and humidification to warming and aridification and suggest that decision makers strengthen monitoring of the Yamzho Yumco Lake Reserve, restrict human activities, improve water resource management, and actively respond to the challenges brought about by climate change.

Development of Monitoring Techniques for Endangered Spring Endemic Invertebrates: An Assessment of Abundance	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												We monitored Roswell springsnail (Pyrgulopsis roswellensis), Koster's springsnail (Juturnia kosteri), and Noel's amphipod (Gammarus desperatus), three endangered aquatic invertebrates, from 2014 through 2017 at Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, Chaves County, New Mexico. We initiated the effort to develop baseline abundance estimates in a rigorous, repeatable framework, and to inform long-term monitoring efforts. Surveys were focused on three spring systems. Density estimates for the two species of springsnails combined ranged from 7870 +/- 1693 SE snails per m(2) (CV = 22%) to 39,704 +/- 10,035 SE snails per m(2) (CV = 25%) in the three systems combined. Noel's amphipod density estimates ranged from 144 +/- 42 SE individuals per m(2) (CV = 29%) to 404 +/- 109 SE individuals per m(2) (CV = 27%). We can detect a proportional change (alpha = 0.1, power = 0.8) in density ranging from 30% to 60% in Bitter Creek, Sago Springs, and the Snail Unit. We predicted increases in statistical power that could be gained from increases in survey effort. Because of seasonal changes in density in some systems, year-to-year evaluation of trends must be focused on a given season. Likewise, seasonal changes in spring flows may impact density estimates. We provide estimates of density, precision, and power that can inform future efforts to monitor both species status and restoration efforts.

Deepwater sculpin is prey for lake trout Salvelinus namaycush and feeds on benthos. Populations have been declining with possible reasons being oligotrophication, quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), predation, and impacts of round goby Neogobius melanostomus competition or predation on eggs. Deepwater sculpins are thought to spawn during winter based on gravid females and appearance of larval fish in spring, but a male guarding a nest has not been documented. We used remotely operated vehicle technology during December 2015, March 2017, and March 2021 in 70-191 m in Grand Traverse Bay, Lake Michigan to identify the distribution of deepwater sculpins, round gobies, and nests with a guarding male. Round gobies were much more abundant (observations/hr = 139) in water 125 m than were deepwater sculpins (11/hr), while in water 166 m, deepwater sculpins were much more common (39/hr) than at shallow sites. At deep sites, round gobies were more abundant (51/hr) than deepwater sculpins (39/hr). On 16 March 2021 in 190 m of 1.9 C surface water we discovered several presumptive, unoccupied nests, but one nest in a depression next to a branch contained a deepwater sculpin and a clump of eggs. This is first evidence of where and how deepwater sculpins spawn. We also documented round gobies in the same area with one within 2 m of the nest, creating the possibility for consumption of eggs potentially affecting their long-term survival.

J	SOLOMON, AM; BLASING, TJ; SOLOMON, JA				SOLOMON, AM; BLASING, TJ; SOLOMON, JA			INTERPRETATION OF FLOODPLAIN POLLEN IN ALLUVIAL SEDIMENTS FROM AN ARID REGION	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Pollen was collected from modern alluvium and from the atmosphere to document the nature and amount of paleoenvironmental information reflected by alluvial pollen chronologies. Pollen in alluvium is a homogeneous mixture derived almost entirely from the floodplain itself. The few pollen grains derived from nonfloodplain plant communities and preserved in alluvial sediments are so well mixed that their frequencies no longer reflect the geographic distribution of the specific plant communities in which they originated. The abundance of alluvial pollen grains, derived from the major floodplain taxa (Chenopodiineae, Ambrosia type), varies with summer and winter climate. This annual variation is preserved in alluvial pollen assemblages through a combination of processes within sedimentation basins involving discontinuous deposition events and mechanical pollen degradation. The high-frequency, wide-amplitude pollen variance in alluvial pollen assemblages contrasts with the low-frequency, narrow-amplitude pollen variance in sediments of lakes and ponds. The slight geographic variance in alluvial pollen assemblages, in contrast to the large variance in soil pollen, allows use of alluvial pollen to infer climate throughout the watershed in which pollen is sampled.

In this study, the hydrologic alteration of Dongting Lake induced by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) was assessed using indicators of hydrologic alteration and range of variability approach. The results demonstrate a declining trend in autumn water level (0.52-2.26m) and 5-35days' advancement for date of minimum annual water level because of the impound of water by the TGD in early autumn. The spatial patterns in the degree of the indicators of hydrologic alteration were different among the sub-lake regions. Annual minimum water level and timing of annual extreme water level suffered a high degree of alteration in the eastern part of the lake, whereas autumn water level, date of minimum water level, and number of reversals in the western part of the lake showed a high degree of alteration. The average integrated degree of hydrologic alteration (D-0) for Dongting Lake was 50.40%, indicating that the hydrologic regime suffered a moderate alteration. The most ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators are critical for understanding eco-hydrology. On the basis of principal component analysis, the five selected ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators were 90-day minimum, date of minimum, high pulse duration, date of maximum, and May water level. Further studies are required to understand the impact of the TGD on water conditions in Dongting Lake, especially related to the response of the aquatic ecosystem.					; Cheng, Junxiang/S-4125-2018; Xu, Ligang/K-2584-2013; Wang, XiaoLong/AGP-5220-2022	Cheng, Junxiang/0000-0002-3406-2838; 													1535-1459	1535-1467				SEP	2018	34	7					686	696		10.1002/rra.3297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3297													WOS:000444080300007

Patterns of variation among these snails include a steep cline linking two nominal species, and a gentler one tending to link one of these with a third nominal species from an adjacent spring system. The form of these clines is apparently explained by the presence or absence of gene flow barriers in the spring system, although alternative explanations are discussed. A review of ideas on the origin of aquatic habitats in the basin suitable for Mexipyrgus suggests that the clines represent secondary intergradation, with divergence having occurred in allopatric populations isolated by desiccation of a barrial lake(s) or fragmentation of a massive, continuous spring, and secondary contact made possible by reintegration of habitats. The results, suggesting genetic exchange among distinctive populations having restricted distributions, support an earlier contention that these populations comprise a single, polytypic species.																			0076-2997	2168-9075					1986	27	2					357	374																WOS:A1986F577600013

The metals were analyzed by a graphite furnace AAS after filtration with a 0.45-mu m membrane filter. The concentrations of copper in the water were in the range 10(-9) to 5 x 10(-8) M and showed clear seasonal changes, being higher in summer and lower in winter. The concentrations of copper did not decrease on passage through the lake. The values of dissolved chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) showed a similar behavior, an interaction of copper in the lake water with organic matter was estimated. The concentration of copper in the lake became sometimes higher than the value of EC(50) for Microcystis, however, the metal forms stable complex species with organic matter and the toxic effect may be reduced. The concentrations of iron, on the other hand, showed wide variation, but no obvious seasonal change. The concentrations of iron decreased very markedly during flow of water through the lake.

Assessment in two shallow lakes of a hydroacoustic system for surveying aquatic macrophytes	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes	JUN 05-09, 2005	Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS					A technique for the rapid surveying of submersed aquatic vegetation by post-processing of data collected using a high frequency (420 kHz) digital echo sounder (BioSonics DT4000) has recently been developed and successfully tested in an estuarine environment by Sabol et al. [Sabol, B. M., R. E. Melton, R. Chamberlain, P. Doering & K. Haunert, 2002. Evaluation of a digital echo sounder system for detection of submersed aquatic vegetation. Estuaries 25: 133-141.], where it was used to map the cover and height of freshwater tape grass (Vallisneria americana) and seagrasses (Thalassia testudinum, Haladule wrightii and Syringodium filiforme). This technique, which is also spatially referenced by input from a global positioning system, has many potential applications in macrophyte studies in shallow lakes, although it has not yet been extensively tested in such habitats using systems of lower sound frequency. This paper reports such a test in two shallow (maximum depth c. 5.9 m) lakes of the Cotswold Water Park, U.K., using a 200 kHz digital echo sounder (BioSonics DT6000 and DT-X upgrade) and post-processing analysis using the now commercially available software EcoSAV, which incorporates the algorithms of Sabol et al. (2002). Hydroacousticassessment of the coverage by macrophytes, mainly Nuttall's pondweed (Elodea nuttallii) and charophytes (Chara spp.), showed high agreement with those recorded during a simultaneous visual survey by underwater video recording (r (2) = 0.8478, n = 74, P < 0.001). Assessment of macrophyte height was also apparently consistent between the two systems, although the video system could not produce quantitative data and so statistical assessment of the agreement was not possible. Repeated hydroacoustic surveys over the course of the winter of 2003-2004 were conducted in one lake and illustrate the application of this new macrophyte survey technique. Such applications include the rapid measurement of mean Percentage Volume Inhabited (PVI), which fell from 12.15% (95% confidence limits, +/- 0.55%) to 7.10% (+/- 0.40%) over the course of the winter.					, Marian/JSL-4087-2023; Winfield, Ian/I-6085-2012; Onoufriou, Chloe/JOZ-6905-2023	Godlewska, Malgorzata/0000-0001-5598-1086; O'Connell, Mark/0000-0003-3402-8880; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2007	584						111	119		10.1007/s10750-007-0612-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0612-y													WOS:000246583500012

J	Hooke, RL				Hooke, RL			Lake Manly(?) shorelines in the Eastern Mojave Desert, California	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Near Mesquite Spring on the southern edge of the Soda Lake basin in the Mojave Desert, there is a shoreline of an ancient lake at an elevation of 340 m above sea level. At present, Soda Lake would overflow at 280 m; a lake surface at 340 m would extend similar to 240 km northward, to the northern end of Death Valley. Shorelines and lacustrine deposits near the Salt Spring and Saddle Peak Hills, 75 km north of Mesquite Spring, are at similar to 180 m; a lake surface at this elevation today would also extend to the northern end of Death Valley. The most prominent shoreline of the pluvial lake that occupied Death Valley during the Pleistocene, Lake Manly, is that of the Blackwelder stand which ended similar to 120,000 yr ago. This shoreline is similar to 90 m above sea level. The Mesquite Spring and Salt Spring Hills shorelines were probably formed by the Blackwelder stand and subsequently displaced with respect to one another, tectonically, due to transpression in the northeastern Mojave Desert and NW-SE extension across Death Valley. This tectonic regime would result in subsidence of Death Valley and the Salt Spring Hills relative to Mesquite Spring. A reconstruction suggests that the topography at the time of the Blackwelder stand would have had a sill near the level of the highest lake, and also one similar to 20 m lower, corresponding to the next most prominent shoreline in Death Valley. Expansion of the lake over these sills would have increased evaporation, thus possibly stabilizing the lake level.

J	Aoki, S; Fuse, Y; Yamada, E				Aoki, S; Fuse, Y; Yamada, E			Determinations of humic substances and other dissolved organic matter and their effects on the increase of COD in Lake Biwa	ANALYTICAL SCIENCES												Humic substances and other dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Lake Biwa and the surrounding rivers were investigated to elucidate their origins and behavior. An annual increase in chemical oxygen demand (COD) has been observed in the northern basin of Lake Biwa since 1985. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the northern and southern basins of Lake Biwa were 1.7 - 2.4 mgCl and 1.9 - 2.6 mgC/l, respectively. The DOC concentrations tended to be high in summer and low in winter, and the seasonal changes in the concentrations of humic substances were small. The humic substances content of DOM was considered to be comparatively small because the ratio of the concentration of humic substances to DOC was in the range of 0.14 - 0.32. From the results of the fractionation of DOM in lake waters, it was estimated that hydrophobic acids, such as humic substances and hydrophilic acids, were about 25% and 45%, respectively. The main origin of hydrophobic acids in Lake Biwa may be humic substances from soils around the rivers that flow into Lake Biwa, while hydrophilic acids may be due to the inner production by phytoplankton. Therefore, the increase of COD in the northern basin of Lake Biwa may be attributed to the contributions of not only humic substances but also hydrophilic acids.

HABITAT TYPES - WHAT THEY CAN TELL US NOW AND IN THE FUTURE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Habitat classification systems utilize the relationship between the herbaceous layer and potential climax vegetation to classify forest vegetation. Habitat classification systems have been developed throughout the United States including Michigan. In 2010, ten years after the first sampling, 30 of the original 200 plots throughout the Western Upper Peninsula were resampled twice during the growing season. Exotic earthworm populations were also sampled in early September at all 30 plots. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination was used to discern differences in habitat types between years (2000 vs. 2010) and between seasons in 2010 (spring vs. summer). Overstory trees per hectare (TPH) decreased from 2000 to 2010, likely the result of forest management activities. A greater number of herbaceous species were observed in 2010; however, the majority of these new species were weedy or invasive. Exotic European earthworms were observed in all habitat types; earthworm densities generally increased with increasing soil richness and site quality, with herbaceous plant cover negatively associated with earthworm biomass. Continual monitoring of these plots will allow scientists and managers to assess how herbaceous community change through time and observe the effects of invasive species and changing climatic patterns on forest ecosystems of the Great Lakes region.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2015	13	3					893	913																WOS:000354731000020
J	Liu, JM; Deng, XZ				Liu, Jiaomei; Deng, Xiangzheng			Influence of different land use on urban microenvironment in Beijing City, China	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT												The urban air temperature is gradually rising in all cities in the world. Records of the past years showed that the climate of built-up regions differs significantly from rural regions. One of the most obvious and important modifying effects of urbanization on local climate is the urban heat island (UHI). In order to clarify the spatial distribution of urban thermal field and to evaluate the urban environment quality synthetically, 5 sites including Xidan, the commercial centre of Beijing district; Mudanyuan, the residential areas; Kunming Lake in Summer Palace, the water body; Chaoyang Park, the urban green space; and Wenquan Village, the suburb of Beijing, were investigated from December 2007 to August 2008. The meteorological factors of temperature and humidity of underlying surfaces in these 5 sites were monitored simultaneously in 10 hours period. The results indicate that the temperatures of underlying surfaces in different sampled landscapes were in the order of suburb <water area<green space<residential area<commercial centre in winter, and water area<suburb<green space<residential area<commercial centre in summer; while the humidity was in the opposite order in terms of landscape. The largest temperature difference was 6.3 degrees C at 18:00 h in commercial centre, the largest humidity difference was 25.9% at 8:00 h in residential area compared to rural area. Finally, this paper provides a concise and comprehensive understanding for the temporal and spatial microclimatic dynamics of these four kinds of urban ground cover in the five observation sites. There is influence of urban land use and ground cover on the microclimate of Beijing, monitoring and analyzing urban growth patterns and evaluating their impacts on land surface temperature (LST), provides sound. basis for ecological construction, environment improvement, urban planning and management.

Modeling the Effect of Environmental Parameters on Feeding Ecology of the Shortnose Sturgeon in the Saint John River, New Brunswick	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We examined the effects of spatial, temporal, and environmental parameters on the feeding habits of the shortnose sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum. We sampled sturgeon gut contents using colonic flushing, a new, low-impact technique. We found that heavy feeding continued until at least November, when water temperature reached 8 degrees C. In all seasons, foraging shortnose sturgeon used shallow water (2-8 m); however, in late fall this trend was even stronger, when 50% of the sturgeon were captured in less than 3 m depth. Over 60 families of prey items were identified from 166 colonic samples collected at four points between spring and late fall from seven locations throughout the lower Saint John River, New Brunswick. Samples from freshwater sites contained mainly Gastropoda, Sphaeriidae, Chironomidae, and Gammaridae. Samples from saline and brackish environments contained mostly Gammaridae, Corophiidae, softshell clam Mya arenaria, Cyathura polita, and Chironomidae. We used sensitivity analysis to determine the number of shortnose sturgeon required to obtain a representative sample of the diet. We found that 20-40 gut samples from sturgeons in both brackish and freshwater environments would suffice for a general description of the diet but that complete knowledge of the sturgeon diet and a comparison among several sites would require the sampling of hundreds of fish. The digestibility of prey varied from 77% of the ingested volume in a saline environment to only 6% in freshwater samples. Shortnose sturgeon from freshwater sites had higher ingested volumes and more prey per ingested volume than did those from brackish sites, which indicated further differences in feeding efficiency between the environments. Salinity was a significant parameter in the redundancy analysis of ingested prey items. In freshwater sites the significant factors were season, sturgeon length, ingested volume, number of ingested prey, and number of ingested taxa. In saline sites the significant factors were season, location, ingested volume, and the number of ingested prey. Our findings identified the spatial and temporal gradients in shortnose sturgeon foraging and provided insight into foraging efficiency in this species.					; Litvak, Matthew/F-4159-2011	Watmough, James/0000-0002-0126-0504; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2012	141	1					238	256		10.1080/00028487.2012.654890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2012.654890													WOS:000301154500023

Effect of snowmelt on the dynamics, isotopic and chemical composition of runoff in mature and regenerated forested catchments	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Using isotopic and hydrochemical tools, we focused our study on water and element fluxes with snowmelt in two headwater catchments with different forest stands. One catchment is with mature, and the other catchment is with forest regenerating after a tree dieback. Sampling and analysis of the surface water and precipitation throughout one hydrological year, and of snowpack in snow season, enabled us to estimate the isotopic balance and chemical snowpack evolution, but also the snowmelt contribution to inlets and outlets of lakes. Stable isotope values varied from snowpack formation to snowmelt with delta H-2 amplitudes of -25 parts per thousand in the mature and -17 parts per thousand in the regenerating forest catchments over the duration of the snowpack persistence. The mature forest had one month longer duration of snow cover and higher concentration of solutes in the throughfall and snowpack. In both catchments, heavier isotopes of the water molecule (O-18 and H-2) preferentially left the snowpack, which stored considerable amount of rainwater and snowmelt. This resulted in heavy isotopes depletion in the end of the spring snowmelt. Ions were also eluted from the snowpack during rain events and partial snow melting throughout the winter, causing fluxes of diluted water at the end of the snowmelt. Our results demonstrate the hydrological and hydrochemical variability of the snowpack, which in the future may even increase with rising temperatures and changes of precipitation patterns.

The biomass dominants of this community, N2-fixing blue-green algae (e.g. Calothrix, tolyopthrix, and Nostoc) were persistent and retained their nitrogenase activity throughout the year. Seasonal rates of N2 fixation exhibited considerable variation, with a distinct summer maximum and winter minimum. Uptake of both NO3- and NH4+ followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Kt values were typically extremely high (> 100 .mu.g N liter-1) compared to the ambient concentrations of these forms of nitrogen (< 10 .mu.g N liter-1). N2 fixation was the most important source of inorganic N to the yearly N budget of this benthic community. Low ambient substrate concentrations coupled with a low physiological affinity for these substrates at ambient levels were responsible for the relative unimportance of NO3- and NH4+ uptake. Dark uptake of NO3-, NH4+, and N2 fixation were all significant and could not be neglected in determining rates of daily inorganic nitrogen utilization. This blue-green algal community is not adapted for efficient use of NO3- or NH4+ and can survive in the N-deficient environment because of its ability to use N2. In striking contrast, the phytoplankton in Lake Tahoe has no N2-fixing organisms and depends on NO3- and NH4+ for its production.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	1986	31	1					149	160		10.4319/lo.1986.31.1.0149	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.1.0149													WOS:A1986A266300013

Furthermore, recent chemical and isotopic data of He, CO2, and CH4 in hot spring gases at Changbaishan volcano are also presented. Bubbling gas samples were collected periodically from 2014 to 2019 in three hot spring areas in the Changbaishan volcanic field: one on the shoreline of the Tianchi caldera lake and two on the north and southwest flanks. The helium isotopes of the bubbling gases from the three hot spring areas suggested a major magmatic source, up to 5.8 Ra (where Ra represents the atmospheric He-3/He-4 ratios). However, the CH4 exhibited a biotic signature in carbon isotopes (delta C-13) as low as -60.9%0, and the concentrations of CH4 among the three hot spring areas exhibited remarkable variations from 0.02% to 17.04%. After evaluating the influence of air contamination, crustal and organic contributions, and thermodynamic processes, we suggest that CH4 from the three hot spring areas primarily originated from two sources: (1) a previously formed gas reservoir in the crust with significant contributions from the ancient subductions and (2) the MORB-like materials from the present upwelling asthenosphere. Based on these observations, we propose a model to explain the processes that formed these two sources, which demonstrates the existence of ancient subduction fluids in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. In addition, our study of volcanic gases does not support the conspicuous material connections between the subducting west Pacific slab and Changbaishan volcano. Finally, based on our results, suggestions for volcanic gas monitoring at the Changbaishan volcano are provided. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the seismic records and piston cores, 4 stratigraphic units overlying the Proterozoic bedrock (unit 1) were defined and interpreted: (unit 2) glacial till deposited by a westward flowing ice sheet, (unit 3) rhythmically bedded clays and silts presumably deposited in glacial Lake Ojibway, (unit 4) postglacial marine muds deposited in the Tyrrell Sea overlain by undifferentiated modern marine muds, and (unit 5) distal fluvio-deltaic sediments from Grande Riviere de la Baleine. Similar stratigraphic units have been described onshore. Textural and geochemical analyses suggest that unit 3 rhythmites are true varves; dark ''summer'' laminae were deposited mainly by underflows during the open water season, and light ''winter'' laminae were deposited by overflows-interflows along thermal stratifications under a seasonal ice cover. Unit 5 covers approximately 400 km2 and occurs as a deltaic constructional wedge protruding as far as 11 km offshore of the Grande Riviere de la Baleine entrance with thicknesses reaching 30 m along the coast. It was deposited between 3500 BP and the present from remobilization of glacial sediments farther upstream due to river downcutting during emergence.																			0705-7199						1993	47	2					147	166		10.7202/032945ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/032945ar													WOS:A1993MG17300003

Total otolith length was chosen as the most useful otolith dimension for back-calculation of fork length at emergence. Sockeye from the various tributaries show different fork length-otolith length relationships necessitating a weighting procedure for comparisons involving samples of mixed stocks from the lake. Instantaneous daily growth rate and In fork length during the early lake-rearing period were significantly correlated. Smaller juveniles grew more slowly than larger individuals in mid-July, and a hierarchy of sizes was maintained. The distributions of total otolith length at emergence for fry, surviving juveniles, and smolts indicate selective mortality of fish with smaller otoliths, hence of small size at emergence. Survivals from the lower and upper halves of the initial total otolith length distribution were 8.9 and 63.6%, respectively. Comparable estimates for back-calculated fork lengths at emergence were 27.2 and 43.4%. Size-selective mortality is most intense in the late summer and early autumn, and may be associated with predation and parasitism.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1987	44	4					712	721		10.1139/f87-086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-086													WOS:A1987H801500002

Microbiological monitoring of technogenically polluted reservoirs of the Absheron industrial region	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												The presence of water bodies of anthropogenic origin on the territory of the Absheron industrial region is one of the acute problems. Many lakes have become receivers of wastewater and polluted water, they have a negative impact on adjacent environments - soil cover, groundwater and the atmosphere of the entire Absheron Peninsula, including the capital of the country, Baku, with its three million population. The object of research in 2016-2017 was the largest and most polluted lakes of the Absheron Peninsula - Boyuk-Shor (the surface of this reservoir is 1300 hectares) and Zykh (20 hectares). The research is devoted to the study of the structure of the microbiocenosis of reservoirs contaminated with oil and oil products, biogenicity and their self-cleaning ability. In the self-purification of these reservoirs, oil-oxidizing microorganisms play an important role, the abundance of which in the water of reservoirs ranges from 103 to 105 cells/dm(3). The most active decomposition of organic substances in water occurs in the summer and autumn. This is favored, first, by the temperature factor. The difference in the degree of biogenicity in different zones of water bodies is associated with high levels of hydrocarbon pollutants, namely: in the areas of pollutant intake, self-cleaning ability does not compensate for the rate of their destruction.

Heterocypris incongruens, llyocypris bradyi, Darwinula stevensoni, Pseudocandona compressa, and Psychrodromus olivaceus) were collected from a newly developed spring between October 2001 and October 2004. The first 5 species have cosmopolitan distribution in the Holarctic region. The ratio of non-cosmopolitan to cosmopolitan species (called 'pseudorichness') was 0.2. suggesting dominance of cosmopolitan species. Among the species. C. neglecta displayed the highest tolerance to 6 different environmental variables, although its estimated optimum values varied. Except foor redox potential and salinity. optimum values for H. incongruens were the highest. High tolerance and optimum values seemed to provide more advantages for cosmopolitan species to increase their survival in a variety of habitats. Considering that this spring is newly developed, the ostracod species' composition may be demonstrating the first stages of ecological succession, in which the first invader animals can be cosmopolitan species due to their wide-ranging tolerance.

ROTENONE USE AND SUBSEQUENT PREY LOSS LOWERS OSPREY FLEDGING RATES VIA BROOD REDUCTION	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												Fisheries managers used the fish toxicant rotenone to eradicate an undesirable brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) population and all other fish species at Hyatt Reservoir, Oregon, on 12 October 1989. This 4-yr study (1988-1990, 1992) compared effects of that rotenone project on Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) nesting at Hyatt Reservoir and nearby Howard Prairie Reservoir (untreated reference)-the latter a reservoir where both brown bullheads and hatchery-released rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) prospered. Because Hyatt Reservoir was treated after Osprey fall migration in 1989, the first 2 yr (1988 and 1989) yielded pretreatment information: number of Osprey pairs was unchanged and reproductive rates were similar and consistent at the two reservoirs. Yearling fish (200-250 mm) were restocked at Hyatt Reservoir in the spring of 1990 and Ospreys returned each year following rotenone treatment, with no decline in the number of occupied or active nests. The negative effect of the rotenone treatment on Ospreys was short-term, resulting in reduced reproductive rates (young/occupied nest, young/active nest, and young/successful nest) during the first nesting season posttreatment, although hatching rates were not affected. Osprey dive success and prey delivery rates declined sharply in 1990, leading to competition for food among siblings and brood reduction. Osprey reproductive rates and prey delivery rates at Hyatt Reservoir in both 1990 and 1992 remained below the extremely high pretreatment rates, but within the range required for population stability. Serious adverse effects of the fish loss on Osprey reproduction were minimized by: (1) the delay of the rotenone application until after breeding season, (2) the restocking of the treated reservoir in the following spring with some larger (yearling) fish (though the timing was late), (3) the maintenance of a supplemental feeding program for a nesting pair of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), which minimized kleptoparasitism on Ospreys, and perhaps most important (4) the presence of nearby water bodies, where Osprey obtained some fish in the 1990 and 1992 breeding seasons.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				MAR	2022	56	1					37	54		10.3356/JRR-21-14	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/JRR-21-14													WOS:000795670200004

Age was estimated from scales and otoliths collected from walleyes (N = 2,072) sampled with gill nets from eight Kansas reservoirs during fall in 1991-1999. Age-0 gizzard shad abundance was indexed based on summer seining information, and temperature data were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Parameter estimates of von Bertalanffy growth models indicated that the growth of walleyes in Kansas was more similar to that of southern latitude populations (e.g., Mississippi and Texas) than to that of northern (e.g., Manitoba, Minnesota and South Dakota) or middle latitude (e.g., Colorado and Iowa) populations. Northern and middle latitude populations had lower mean back-calculated lengths at age 1, lower growth coefficients, and greater longevity than southern and Kansas populations. A relative growth index (RGI; [L-t/L-s] X 100, where L, is the observed length at age and L, is the age-specific standard length derived from a pooled von Bertalanffy growth model) and standardized percentile values (percentile values of mean back-calculated lengths at age) indicated that the growth of walleyes in Kansas was above average compared with that of other populations in North America. The annual growth increments of Kansas walleyes were more variable among years than among reservoirs. The growth increments of age-0 and age-1 walleyes were positively related to the catch rates of gizzard shad smaller than 80 mm, whereas the growth of age-2 and age-3 walleyes was inversely related to mean summer air temperature. Our results provide a framework for comparing North American walleye populations, and our proposed RGI provides a simple, easily interpreted index of growth.																			0275-5947					AUG	2003	23	3					677	692		10.1577/M02-050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M02-050													WOS:000185111600003

Isotope hydrology of precipitation, surface and ground waters in the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia, Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Rapid population growth in the intermontane, semi-arid, Okanagan Valley of Western Canada has led to water shortages with increasing debate over competing water interests. Nevertheless, the relationships between the various water resources of the Okanagan remain poorly defined. Stable isotopes of hydrogen (delta H-2) and oxygen (O-18) were used to assess rainfall importance and the sources and flux of water to and from rivers and lakes in watersheds, and to evaluate the origin of ground water resources. Precipitation isotopes resulted in a meteoric water line of delta H-2 = 6.6 (delta O-18) - 22.7 for the Okanagan Valley. Isotopic seasonality in precipitation was evident, with summer precipitation clearly affected by local recycling of water vapor. The H-2 and O-18 of surface waters were more positive than mean annual precipitation, indicative of basin-scale evaporation of surface waters; however, Okanagan Lake and its downstream river and lake system were isotopically synchronous, indicating that they behaved as a single well-mixed hydrologic unit. Isotopic mass-balance modeling revealed similar to 35% of inflow to the Lake Okanagan watershed was lost to evaporation, validating a meteorological water balance model for the region. Highland bedrock was recharged with snow-melt and early spring rains, with the isotopic composition dependent on elevation. Ground waters in the Valley bottom aquifers west of Osoyoos were recharged by irrigation water obtained from the Okanagan River system, with no evidence of recharge connections from the highland bedrock.

Food Web Interactions Associated With a Lahontan Cutthroat Trout Reintroduction Effort in an Alpine Lake	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Fisheries managers have stocked Lahontan Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi into Fallen Leaf Lake, California, since 2002 in an attempt to reestablish a naturally reproducing lacustrine population. However, the food web in Fallen Leaf Lake has been altered by the past introduction of nonnative species that may prey on or compete with reintroduced Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. Therefore, we used a combination of stomach content and stable isotope analyses to evaluate trophic characteristics within the aquatic species assemblage in Fallen Leaf Lake. Lahontan Cutthroat Trout preyed on mysid shrimp Mysis diluviana, aquatic insects, terrestrial arthropods, signal crayfish Pacificus leniusculus, and fishes. Diet overlap was greatest between Lahontan Cutthroat Trout and Mountain Whitefish Prosopium williamsoni; however, these species exhibited a generalized feeding strategy that may allow them to partition prey resources in order to avoid competitive interactions. Nonnative Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush and Brown Trout Salmo trutta are top-level predators in Fallen Leaf Lake and both consumed Lahontan Cutthroat Trout during this study. Lake Trout delta C-13 and delta N-15 increased following Lahontan Cutthroat Trout stocking, a change consistent with incorporating isotopically enriched Lahontan Cutthroat Trout into their diet. Managers should consider the effects of predation by Lake Trout and Brown Trout on Lahontan Cutthroat Trout when developing future management and stocking programs for Fallen Leaf Lake. Additionally, intentional manipulation of the isotopic composition of hatchery-reared fish prior to stocking may be useful for evaluating predation in Fallen Leaf Lake and other systems.

It has become dominant, replacing much of the former vegetation in the Botany Wetlands, a series of shallow urban swamps and lakes near Sydney, Australia. Studies of L. peruviana were essential to the development of a management plan for the Botany Wetlands. Ecological studies were conducted in situ and supplemented by a series of germination and growth experiments in controlled environments. Flowering peaked in early autumn. Seed production for 1990-91 was similar to 450000 seeds m(-2) and there was also similar to 65000 seeds m(-2) in the soil seed bank and similar to 300000 seeds m(-2) in old fruits that remained on the stems over winter. The seeds are similar to 0.8 mm long, weigh similar to 0.05 mg, are hydrophobic, usually germinate while afloat, and are easily dispersed by water, machinery and birds. Viability of fresh seed was 99% (tetrazolium dye test), and similar to 20% of seeds were dormant. Dormancy appeared to break down within two years. Propagation and dispersal may also occur by means of stem pieces that produce new shoots. New plants from seed, seedlings or stem fragments may become established on strand lines or form floating islands that may eventually become stranded. Management needs to focus on control of the seedlings and soil seed bank.

J	Kasse, C				Kasse, Cornelis			Fluvial response to rapid high-amplitude lake-level changes during the Late Weichselian and early Holocene, Ain River valley, Jura, France	BOREAS												In the present paper the effects of rapid, high-amplitude base-level changes during the last glacial-interglacial transition were studied for the Ain River in eastern France. During the Wurm glacial maximum (MIS 2) rapid aggradation by deep-water Gilbert-type deltas and shallow-water fan deltas occurred at the margins of a 20 to 50 m deep proglacial lake. A temporal high-amplitude lake-level fall of 60 m resulted in gravel deposition by forced-regressive deltas, followed by rapid lake-level rise and fine-grained glaciolacustrine deposition. During the final deglaciation, a rapid base-level fall of 40 m resulted in a complex fluvial response. Knickpoint formation and headward incision of the highstand deltas and concomitant deposition of gravel sheets by forced-regressive deltas and braided systems occurred in several depocentres on the former glacial lake floor. Preservation of highstand and falling-stage deposits and terrace formation in the incised valley depended on vertical incision and lateral channel migration. Terraces are well developed in the former lake-floor depressions, whereas vertical incision was dominant in the higher lake-floor areas. The Ain terrace staircase was likely formed by autogenic processes during a single allogenic base-level fall. This case study possibly offers an analogue for the preservation of interglacial highstand coastal deltas during sea-level fall at warm-to-cold climate transitions, although the rates of base-level fall are different.

Ice core evidence for an orbital-scale climate transition on the Northwest Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The influences on climate in the Northwest Tibetan Plateau (NwTP) have changed on millennial to precessional timescales and have been dependent on the size of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, and the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). All these influences control the position and intensity of the westerlies over Central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau and of the Asian Monsoon over South Asia. The top 187.4 m of a 309.7-m ice core (2015GP) drilled on the plateau of the Guliya ice cap contains a 41-kyr climate history of the NwTP, a region where information on past climate and environment is limited. The oxygen isotope ratio (818O), and ammonium (NH4+) and dust concentration records from 2015GP show that during the glacial (41-17.5 ka BP) temperature and precipitation in the NwTP were primarily influenced on the precessional timescale by summer insolation, while at millennial resolution the climate was linked to the North Atlantic temperature via the westerlies. During the deglaciation (17.5-12 ka BP) summer insolation remained an important temperature forcing, but the influence of the North Atlantic climate on the NwTP climate weakened as the westerlies shifted northward. The Guliya Holocene 818O record shows that NwTP climate was no longer in phase with decreasing summer insolation or with North Atlantic climate, perhaps as the moisture source and pathways were more determinative factors in isotopic fractionation than temperature, and/or incoming solar radiation (insolation) forcing was replaced by rising greenhouse gas concentrations as the primary driver of warming in NwTP.

An ancient city was has been built at the shore of the lake. During the sixties a big part of the lake has been drained. As a result the lake's extent varies during the year. It covers a small area during the summer period and floods a quite big area during the winter. The objective of this study was to process multitemporal and multisensor satellite data in order to monitor the changes of the lake extent and the environmental consequences. In order to detect those changes we used multitemporal and multisensor satellite images. The former image that we used is a Landsat 1 MSS subscene acquired on July 1975. The newer image is an Envisat SAR image acquired on October 2003. We also used Landsat TM and ETM images covering the period from 1977 to 2003. The general conclusion is that we can use satellite data from different sensors for the lake extent mapping and the environmental monitoring.					; Pavlopoulos, Kosmas/X-8566-2019; Nikolakopoulos, Kostantinos/B-5379-2018	nikolakopoulos, konstantinos/0000-0003-1028-9541; PAVLOPOULOS, KOSMAS/0000-0003-4503-9120; 													0277-786X		0-8194-5515-6				2004	5568						102	111		10.1117/12.567172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.567172													WOS:000225600100010

Winter-kill caused a considerable reduction in numbers and biomass of the zooplankton and benthos. Due to a decrease in the zooplankton pressure, the phytoplankton biomass in the year following the winter-kill was relatively high for this lake level, although phytoplankton production was low.

Due to this fact, we studied the variables that influence the abundance of natural populations of planktonic cyanobacteria in temperate lakes of central and southern Chile. These lakes differed in trophic state and watershed use. Cyanobacteria dominated in meso- and eutrophic systems and their occurrence correlated to watershed use (tree plantations and urban). Ochrophyta and Bacillariophyta were dominant in oligotrophic lakes, where native forest dominated land usage. In these lakes, the maximum depth of the euphotic zone influenced the community structure and the genera of cyanobacteria. Dolichospermum was the most abundant, frequent, and widely distributed genus, found in oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes, forming blooms in eutrophic systems. The concentration of total phosphorus and total nitrogen positively influenced cyanobacterial abundance and bloom formation, mainly by Aphanizomenon, Aphanocapsa, Aphanothece, and Dolichospermum, and Microcystis. In contrast to many reports on their occurrence in the northern hemisphere, these genera occurred widely at less than 20 degrees C, forming dispersive blooms, at low temperatures in autumn and winter (10.8-15.6 degrees C). This shows that eutrophication is the main factor for bloom formation and these genera can form blooms independent of temperature. However, some genera, such as Microcystis, increased their abundance and presented more intense blooms (scums) at high temperatures. Our study provides baseline data to document long-term changes in lentic systems of the western south-central area of South America, including genera that could respond by increasing their abundance with eutrophication and projected climatic changes.

Sediment in lakes from glacial catchments indicates their catchments were ice-free during this interval. Statistical treatment of the high-resolution multi-proxy paleoclimate lake records shows that despite great variability in catchment characteristics, the sediment records document more or less synchronous abrupt, cold departures as opposed to the smoothly decreasing trend in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Although all lake records document a decline in summer temperature through the Holocene consistent with the regular decline in summer insolation, the onset of significant summer cooling occurs similar to 5 ka at high-elevation interior sites but is variably later at sites closer to the coast, suggesting that proximity to the sea may modulate the impact from decreasing summer insolation. The timing of glacier inception during the mid Holocene is determined by the descent of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), which is dominated by the evolution of summer temperature as summer insolation declined as well as changes in sea surface temperature for coastal glacial systems. The glacial response to the ELA decline is also highly dependent on the local topography. The initial similar to 5 ka nucleation of Langjokull in the highlands of Iceland defines the onset of neoglaciation in Iceland. Subsequently, a step-wise expansion of both Langjokull and northeast Vatnajokull occurred between 4.5 and 4.0 ka, with a second abrupt expansion similar to 3 ka. Due to its coastal setting and lower topographic threshold, the initial appearance of Drangajokull in the NW of Iceland was delayed until similar to 2.3 ka. All lake records reflect abrupt summer temperature and catchment disturbance at similar to 4.5 ka, statistically indistinguishable from the global 4.2 ka event, and a second widespread abrupt disturbance at 3.0 ka, similar to the stepwise expansion of Langjokull and northeast Vatnajokull. Both are intervals characterized by large explosive volcanism and tephra distribution in Iceland resulting in intensified local soil erosion. The most widespread increase in glacier advance, landscape instability, and soil erosion occurred shortly after 2 ka, likely due to a complex combination of increased impact from volcanic tephra deposition, cooling climate, and increased sea ice off the coast of Iceland. All lake records indicate a strong decline in temperature similar to 1.5 ka, which culminated during the Little Ice Age (1250-1850 CE) when the glaciers reached their maximum Holocene dimensions.

The eelgrass Zostera marina L. is the most widely distributed seagrass species and dominates the temperate northern hemisphere. However, an alarming decline in seagrass has been occurring worldwide due to multiple stressors. Seagrass meadow degradation is particularly serious in the Bohai Sea, in temperate China; however, large areas (> 500 ha) of seagrass meadows and population recruitment have rarely been reported in this area. In the present study, we report on a large eelgrass bed in a eutrophic bay of the Bohai Sea. Sonar and field survey methods were used to investigate the distribution of seagrass and its population recruitment. We also analyzed the major threats to this large seagrass bed. Results showed that a large Z. marina bed with an area of 694.36 ha occurred in this area of the Bohai Sea, with a peripheral area of similar to 25 km(2). Seagrass canopy height and plant coverage had a significant correlation with water depth. Asexual reproduction principally occurred in autumn and played a dominant role in population recruitment in vegetated areas, where no seedlings successfully colonized. In contrast, a considerable number of seedlings survived in the seagrass meadow gaps, and thus played a critical role in the recruitment in these areas. The maximum reproductive shoot densities were about 100 and 70 shoots m(-2) at sampling site (S)-1 and S-2 in 2018, respectively, which was about two times more than in 2019 (50 and 20 reproductive shoots m(-2) at S-1 and S-2, respectively). The potential seed output per unit area in 2019 was about 1020 seeds m(-2) at S-1 and 830 seeds m(-2) at S-2, and the seed output in the study area was at a low level compared with global values. Overall, high spring and summer water temperature appeared to induce sexual reproduction of Z. marina in the study area, including reproductive effort, reproductive investment, and seedling development. Furthermore, eelgrass height, aboveground biomass, and density were significantly related to water temperature. Among the potential threatening factors to seagrass in this area, the activities of clam harvesting were intense with daily clam catches > 2000 kg, leading to patchy seagrass meadows, especially in the fringe areas. The seagrass bed was also threatened by marine pollution (nutrient loading) and land reclamation. Therefore, the protection and restoration of this seagrass bed are strongly recommended. Our study will provide fundamental information for the conservation and management strategies of large eelgrass beds in the Bohai Sea.

Advanced modeling techniques based on the new Derived EOLE Joumine Model (DEOLE-J) and metaheuristic approaches were used to model thermocline stratification in the Joumine reservoir in the North of Tunisia. Relative Water Column Stability (RWCS) and thermocline parameters such as thermocline depth and strength index (TSI) were used to assess the water temperature profile and the impact of the thermocline on the phytoplankton community distribution and abundance. Monthly samplings were conducted at eight gauging stations from May 2021 to August 2021. Water samples were collected to measure physical and biological parameters. Joumine's thermal stratification can be divided into three periods: Mixing, Formative, and Stable. During the Mixing period, TSI and air temperature had a significant negative correlation. Similarly, significant negative correlations were observed between TSI, air temperature, and RWCS during the Formative period. Our results reveal that weaker stratification in spring is primarily driven by increased inflow discharge, while summer stratification intensifies, creating sharp thermal gradients. The model successfully captures seasonal thermocline fluctuations and shows that wind speed plays a critical role in regulating vertical mixing. However, moderate wind speeds typical of the Joumine region have limited impact on the deeper layers of the reservoir, particularly during summer. A comparison of model estimates and measured data indicates a bias due to distant meteorological stations and the exclusion of horizontal fluxes, such as water withdrawal and throughflow. Despite these limitations, the DEOLE-J provides valuable insights into the thermal dynamics of reservoirs, showing that prolonged stratification periods reduce vertical mixing and nutrient circulation, potentially degrading water quality. These findings have significant implications for water quality management, particularly in the context of climate change, where extended stratification periods are expected leading to exacerbate water quality issues. Future research should explore two-dimensional models to enhance temperature estimation accuracy and include horizontal fluxes. Keywords: DEOLE-J, Thermal stratification, Joumine reservoir, Thermocline strength, Thermocline depth, phytoplankton distribution, water temperature.

However, much of our evidence for human diet and land use during this period comes from dry cave and rockshelter sites where it can be challenging to distinguish plant and small animal remains deposited as a result of human versus nonhuman activity. This study presents new direct evidence for Younger Dryas and early Holocene human diet in the northern Great Basin through multiproxy analysis of nine human coprolites from the Paisley Caves, Oregon, USA. The evidence indicates that Western Stemmed Tradition occupants consumed plants, small mammals, fish, and insects, including direct evidence for consumption of whole rodents and several types of beetle. Occupation of the caves occurred during the summer and fall by individuals foraging on wetland, sagebrush grassland, and riparian ecological landscapes suggesting geographical and seasonal variability in land-use patterns during the Younger Dryas and early Holocene periods. This research suggests that Western Stemmed Tradition settlement patterns were seasonally centered on productive valley bottom lakes and wetlands but also included forays to a variety of ecological landscapes. The results highlight the importance of plant and small animal resources in the human diet during the terminal Pleistocene settlement of North America and contribute to debates about the process of the peopling of the Americas.					; Blong, John/AEE-8021-2022; Shillito, Lisa-Marie/D-1655-2012; Adams, Martin/GRO-3992-2022; Sanchez, Gabriel/LCM-3544-2024; Bull, Ian/AAV-1474-2020	Sanchez, Gabriel/0000-0001-8342-3268; Bull, Ian/0000-0002-5881-5654; Blong, John/0000-0002-3868-807X; 													1866-9557	1866-9565				AUG 28	2020	12	9							224	10.1007/s12520-020-01160-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12520-020-01160-9													WOS:000566904500001

The diatom assemblages were well preserved in a 1,122 cm long, C-14-dated sediment core spanning the last 17,900 years, and were in support of an early deglaciation of Lago Puyehue. The presence of a short cold spell in South Chile, equivalent to the Younger Dryas event in the Northern Hemisphere, the Antarctic Cold Reversal in Antarctica, or the Huelmo-Mascardi event in southern South America, was not clearly evidenced in the diatom data, although some climate instability may have occurred between 13,400 and 11,700 cal. yr. BP, and a relatively long period (between 16,850 and 12,810 cal. yr. BP) with low absolute abundances and biovolumes could be tentatively interpreted as a period of low rainfall and/or temperatures. An increase in the moisture supply to the lake was tentatively inferred at 12,810 cal. yr. BP. After 9,550 cal. yr. BP, inferred stronger and longer persisting summer stratification, may have been the result of the higher temperatures associated with an early-Holocene thermal optimum. The mid-Holocene appeared to be characterized by a decrease in precipitation, culminating around 5,000 cal. yr. BP, and rising again after 3,000 cal. yr. BP, likely associated with a previously documented lowered frequency and amplitude of El Nino events. An increase in precipitation during the late Holocene (3,000 cal. yr. BP-present) might have marked subsequent increased frequency of El Nino occurrences, leading to drier summers and slightly moister winters in the area.

Rising temperature can transform these ecosystems over a broad range of factors (water mixing, water quality, biological conditions, etc.). In the case of rivers, their thermal regimes also can be modified by local conditions (e.g., tree cover, adjoining water bodies, etc.). In this paper, we address the functioning of the river-lake system in northern Poland (Kocunia River-Lake Slawianowskie) in terms of the effect of the lake on temperature conditions in the river. Dependencies in daily water temperatures between stations located above and below the lake were assessed with linear regression. Based on daily morning water temperatures for the period 2012-2017, it was determined that water temperature in the river below the lake was higher than at the measurement site located above the lake by an average of 1.1 degrees C. The greatest differences were recorded in summer-autumn months when average monthly downstream water temperatures were as much as 3.9 degrees C higher than upstream water temperatures. This phenomenon is an example of a local factor (the lake) magnifying global factors, i.e. rising temperatures associated with climate change. The information in this paper can provide future reference for decision makers and state institutions with responsibility for measures aimed at reducing the effects of climate change.

Infections from human and animal reservoir hosts occur due to the consumption of raw or undercooked fish withC. sinensismetacercariae. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence ofC. sinensismetacercariae in fish in South-East Asia via systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and Chongqing VIP databases for studies published between 1976 and 2020 that are related to the prevalence ofC. sinensismetacercariae in fish. Studies were screened with keywords based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seventy-one eligible articles were identified, covering three countries: China, Korea and Vietnam. The pooled prevalence ofC. sinensismetacercariae in fish from South-East Asia was 30.5%, with 35.1% in China, 29.7% in Korea and 8.4% in Vietnam. In subgroup analyses of climate, season, water source and publication date, the highest prevalence was identified in the Dwb climate type (43.3%), summer (70.2%), river (34.5%) and pre-2001 publications (38.9%), respectively. In comparison, the lowest prevalence was found in the Dfa climate type (14.5%), winter (19.5%), lake (8.0%) and post-2001 publications (23.8%). Meta-regression results indicated that country (p = .009), the published time (p = .035) and water source subgroups (p = .003) may be the source of heterogeneity. Overall, our study indicates that a high prevalence ofC. sinensisinfections occurs in fish in China, Korea and Vietnam, illuminating a significant public health concern in these countries.					qiu, yangyuan/HNJ-1565-2023; Gong, Qing-Long/AAV-2127-2020; lv, qingbo/HTN-5162-2023; Chang, Qiao-Cheng/GPF-6176-2022; gao, junfeng/IAM-4648-2023	qingbo, lv/0000-0003-1158-7620; Gong, Qing-Long/0000-0002-7658-997X; Wang, Chun-Ren/0000-0003-2726-2644													0140-7775	1365-2761				NOV	2020	43	11					1409	1418		10.1111/jfd.13245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.13245		SEP 2020						32880984					WOS:000565380900001

Lipid content of Mysis diluviana in the offshore region of southeastern Lake Michigan in 2009-2010	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The lipid content of Mysis diluviana in the offshore region of southeastern Lake Michigan was determined in 2009 and 2010. Total lipids (mg) increased with Mysis length, but percent lipids (% dry weight) did not. Increases in lipids for juveniles (<10 mm) were related to increases in structural lipids (i.e., phospholipids and sterols), whereas increases in total lipids for adults were related to increases in storage lipids (i.e., triacylglycerols). Percent lipids varied seasonally, and were in general, highest in spring or late fall for juveniles and small adults (<15 mm). For the largest adults (16+ mm), % lipid content did not vary much over the year in 2009, but in 2010, % lipids peaked in July. The rate of lipid retention differed among cohorts of juveniles, but it did not differ among cohorts of adults. In 2009 and 2010 respectively, 14% and 40% of Mysis >13 mm had lipid content <14%, a value associated with a high percentage of docosahexaenoic acid that may reflect starvation for this size of Mysis. Food availability (chl a levels or zooplankton biomass) was not correlated with Mysis lipid content for any size group of Mysis. Seasonal gradients in food availability might not be large enough to elicit strong responses in lipid content of Mysis.

In freshwater habitats, including wetlands, biodiversity is expected to decline on a greater scale than in terrestrial ecosystems. Ephemeral wetlands are little studied habitats compared to other wetlands, such as permanent lakes and rivers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the vertebrate fauna present by ephemeral vernal pools and to see whether vernal pools increase the activity and diversity of vertebrates in a boreal forest ecosystem in northern Europe. We studied the activity and species richness of birds and mammals with direct observations, camera traps, feces tracking, and snap-trapping by ten vernal pools and ten permanent wetlands. Bird activity was higher in the spring period in vernal pools than in permanent wetlands. For large mammals, both activity and species richness were greater around vernal pools than by permanent wetlands. Of individuals species, the moose (Alces alces), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and hares (Lepus europaeus and Lepus timidus) used vernal pools significantly more between seasons compared to permanent wetlands. Small mammal activity was higher by vernal pools in April, while in May and June the pattern reversed. In the light of these results, vernal pools seem to have different importance and use depending on the vertebrate group, e.g., for sheltering, foraging, resting, nesting, or thermoregulation.

This work aims to investigate the levels, patterns and distribution of semi-volatile organoclorine pollutants and to improve the understanding of the long-range atmospheric transport and fate of contaminants on the Tibetan Plateau. A total of 60 fish samples were collected from eight lakes located between 2813 and 4718 m above sea level across the Plateau. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were measured in fish muscle. The results showed that concentrations of DDT, HCH and HCB were comparable to or lower than those found in remote mountains of Europe, Canada and US, while PCB concentrations in fish were, on average, about 4-150 times lower on Tibet than at other mountain areas. The transport and fate of contaminants in the Plateau are significantly influenced by the unique climatological and meteorological conditions, particularly by the summer Indian monsoon and winter westerly jet stream.

We quantified seasonal and spatial patterns in the concentrations of nitrate N and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) at 17 sites distributed among tributaries and along the mainstem of the River Raisin, Southeastern Michigan, and also determined land cover, surficial geology, and discharges from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). Annual flow-weighted mean concentrations (FWMCs) ranged from nondetectable le, els to 18.1 mg L-1 for nitrate and to 184 mu g L-1 for SRP. Nitrate concentrations increased from headwaters to river mouth, and were highest in spring and in association with high runoff episodes. Mean nitrate concentration correlated strongly with the ratio of agricultural to forested land upstream of the sampling location. Concentrations of SRP also increased markedly from headwaters downstream, and exhibited little seasonal variation other than a modest increase during the summer period of low flow. Geology and phosphorus loading from WWTPs best predicted SRP concentrations. The annual yield of nitrate was consistent with expectations based on land use. Point source loading contributed a negligible fraction of the river's discharge of nitrate and at most one-fourth of its SRP discharge, Compared with findings from headwater sites and other, less altered rivers, nutrient concentrations in this catchment appear strongly influenced by human activity.

We compare water use, labor use, income and the conditions for collective action in three sets of communities: two have protected springs and piped homestead connections; two have protected springs but no homestead connection; and three draw potentially contaminated water from unprotected springs. We find that piped water reduces the work of women and girls, and facilitates home garden and livestock production. Together these changes lead to increased household incomes. Women recognize clear time-benefits. Men, however, experience extra work. No overall pattern emerges regarding the preconditions for collective action. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This phenomenon has great impact on the phytoplankton (algae) populations, fisheries management and water supply quality, deficiency of dissolved oxygen in the lower region of ponds, lakes and rivers. Thus, our main moto in this article is to highlight the features of mixed convection in Powell-Eyring fluid deformed by an inclined stretchable sheet. Characteristics of heat transfer are exposed via thermal stratification. The solutal stratification and chemical reaction of first order are accounted to elaborate the nature of mass transfer. The coupled non-linear equations with ordinary derivatives are acquired after utilizing suitable transformation. The homotopic approach is adopted to accomplish the convergent series solution. Analysis of various emerging parameters on the fluid's temperature, velocity and concentration fields is elaborated through graphs. Surface drag, Sherwood and Nusselt numbers are studied through graphical data corresponding to numerous parameters. In conclusion, dominant solutal and thermal stratified parameters are responsible for reduction of concentration and temperature fields, respectively, which enables us to prevent the formation of fluid layers with different density regions.

One reservoir, Solotvino No. 7, was the subject of detailed limnological (hydrographic and hydrochemical) studies. The reservoir has an area of 8493 m(2), a maximum depth of 20.5 m, and holds Cl--Na+ brines. The water in the near-surface layer is hyposaline (3-20 g/L), but periodically becomes mesosaline (20-50 g/L). Hypersaline waters with mineralization > 250 g/L are found below 3 m. The reservoir has three persistent distinct mixolimnion layers that clearly indicate their meromictic type: the surface layer, a chemocline (where the water chemistry changes), and a lower monimolimnion layer. The thermal properties of the reservoir deserve special attention. The water is heated during all seasons at the boundary between the chemocline and monimolimnion; the water temperature is 32 degrees C in winter and 54 degrees C in summer, despite the lack of volcanism. The water is heated by a physical phenomenon in the layer where the water density increases, which is a heliothermal process. Also noteworthy is that throughout the year, the oxygen profiles are positive and heterograde, with the water being up to 380% oxygen saturated.																			1025-9112	1616-1068				SEP	2022	41	3					817	827		10.1007/s10230-022-00887-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10230-022-00887-2		JUL 2022											WOS:000822477300001

This sharp drop in daily temperature is called a cold surge and is one of the most hazardous weather phenomena in East Asian winters. An upper-level baxoclinic wave of 60 degrees wavelength propagating eastward at a phase speed of 12 degrees longitude per day across the continent of northern China from the west of Lake Baikal toward the eastern coast of China causes the outbreak of cold air over South Korea. The cooling associated with the upper-level baroclinic wave is found at all altitudes under the geopotential height-fall center near the tropopause. The development in the ridge seems to derive the early evolution of the eastward-propagating sinusoidal wave, whereas the trough is connected directly with the tropospheric temperature-drop. An enhancement of the wintertime East Asian jet stream after the outbreak of a cold surge is a response to the steep temperature gradient associated with the developing baroclinic wave.																			0256-1530					JUL	2005	22	4					509	524		10.1007/BF02918484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02918484													WOS:000230684600004

Stopover ecology of the least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla) in Iowa: implications for reservoir management	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Vanausdall RA, Dinsmore SJ. 2021. Stopover ecology of the least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla) in Iowa: implications for reservoir management. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Multipurpose reservoirs can be used to manage habitat for shorebirds during migration, an energetically costly event that may influence demographics and population numbers. This is particularly true for shorebirds that migrate through the interior of the United States, which has lost much of its wetland habitat. Shorebirds use aquatic systems during stopover periods throughout migration to rest and refuel. Understanding the factors that influence the probability of a shorebird remaining at a stopover area can inform decisions regarding reservoir management. We examined the influence of habitat and environmental covariates and body condition on the daily local residency probability of migrant least sandpipers (Calidris minutilla) at Saylorville Lake, a reservoir in central Iowa. We monitored 189 least sandpipers in fall 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 using radiotelemetry. Using a nest survival model, our most competitive model included significant negative effects of water level (beta = -8.35, 85% CI = -11.18, -5.52) and body condition (beta = -4.91, 85% CI = -6.82, -3.01) on residency probability. We calculated a mean daily local residency probability of 0.78 (95% CI 0.56, 1.00) and used this value to calculate a minimum stopover duration of 3.96 d (95% CI = 3.45, 4.46). Our findings indicate that the timing of water level management at Saylorville Lake can impact the residency probability of the least sandpiper. Drawing down water levels just prior to fall migration and maintaining water levels at or below the conservation pool level (254.8 m) can provide habitat for this species and likely other shorebirds.

However, our understanding of the distribution and ecology of macroinvertebrates in lotic karst habitats is still incomplete. Therefore, to fill the knowledge gaps, the current study was conducted in the Dinaric and Carpathian-Balkan Mountains in Serbia, Southeastern Europe. We studied aquatic macroinvertebrates and their relationship with environmental parameters at 25 sampling sites in three habitat types (springs, the upper reaches, and tufa barriers) in 12 rivers and streams in Serbia, seasonally, between 2019 and 2022. We recorded 85,072 individuals within 206 taxa. Most environmental variables were comparable among the three habitat types, which most probably resulted in comparable abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates. However, taxa richness was lower in springs compared to upper reaches and tufa barriers. Environmental parameters had a greater impact than spatial effects on shaping the macroinvertebrate community. Moreover, IndVal analysis revealed a list of 30 indicator taxa associated with specific habitat types. We emphasized that highly specialized species support vulnerable functions in high-diversity karst freshwater ecosystems. Therefore, this study establishes a scientific foundation for implementing effective management strategies for these unique aquatic ecosystems.

J	Cano, MG; Casco, MA; Claps, MC				Gabriela Cano, Maria; Adela Casco, Maria; Cristina Claps, Maria			Vertical distribution of epiphyton biomass and diversity in a shallow lake during contrasting ecosystem regimes	AQUATIC BOTANY												We investigated seasonal and depth variations in biomass and composition of bulrush-associated epiphyton in a shallow seepage lake in Argentina and examined whether differences existed in the vertical profiles between sites, whether the zonation with respect to depth changed according to different regimes of the ecosystem, and what conditions most greatly affected the epiphyton vertical distribution. We performed sample collection every 4 weeks for one year at both the centre and the periphery of the bulrush stand, sectioned the bulrush stems into segments to give a fixed 7-level vertical profile, and recorded the water physicochemical characteristics over the same profile. The epiphyton vertical variations were similar at both sampling locations. The epiphyton-biomass profiles underwent an abrupt change at a depth of 45-65 cm during the clearwater period, while comparable values were recorded along the profiles during the turbid phase. The temperature had a positive effect during late spring-early summer that coincided with the transitional period and beginning of the clear period. The principal driver of the epiphyton-biomass vertical distribution is the light availability, followed by the exposure to water movements. The resident species with high contributions to the overall biovolume were related to the percentage of incident light, and particularly those community members that were predominant in the clear-water period.

J	Ding, XD; Zheng, LW; Zheng, XF; Kao, SJ				Ding, Xiaodong; Zheng, Liwei; Zheng, Xufeng; Kao, Shuh-Ji			Holocene East Asian Summer Monsoon Rainfall Variability in Taiwan	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Characterizing the spatiotemporal variability of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) advances our understanding of its rhythm, dynamics, and future impacts. East Asian summer monsoon variations during the Holocene have been reconstructed from a variety of geological archives and proxies. However, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of EASM rainfall during the Holocene remains controversial. Taiwan is geographically suitable for studying the EASM history, through its geological archives. Herein, we synthesize the reported lake and peat sedimentary records of the entire Holocene, in addition to the records of mass-wasting and on-land deposition from cores collected from Taiwan to illustrate the EASM induced hydroclimate changes in Taiwan throughout the Holocene. Records from Taiwan indicate that the EASM rainfall maximum occurred during the early Holocene, concurring with other EASM records from monsoon regions in southern China. We suggest that the early Holocene EASM rainfall maximum in southern China was mainly forced by the higher Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP). A synthesis of EASM rainfall records from across China shows that the timing of the Holocene EASM rainfall maximum occurred progressively later than that from southern to northern China. This time-transgressive EASM rainfall maximum may be due to the latitudinal shift of the westerlies and Western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) that was induced by changes of interhemispheric temperature gradients (Delta TN-S) and the northern high latitude ice volume. Moreover, records from Taiwan suggest a significant collapse of the EASM in Taiwan at similar to 4-2 ka BP. Based on the records from Taiwan, coastal East Asia, and the Tropical Pacific, we propose that the SSTs of the WPWP and/or El Nino-Southern Oscillation activity may have exerted a strong influence on the EASM rainfall changes during the late Holocene. Moreover, increased EASM rainfall in southern China during the last 2 ka was likely caused by a southward shift of WPSH, which is associated with gradual decreases in Delta T(N-S)during the late Holocene.					; Zheng, Xufeng/HPC-4252-2023; Kao, Shuh-Ji/F-8418-2015	Zheng, Li-Wei/0000-0001-9772-9698; Ding, Xiaodong/0000-0002-9034-7344; Kao, Shuh-Ji/0000-0002-5054-9099														2296-6463				JUL 30	2020	8								234	10.3389/feart.2020.00234	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.00234													WOS:000561612600001

A log-normal spectral analysis of inorganic grain-size distributions from a Canadian boreal lake core: Towards refining depositional process proxy data from high latitude lakes	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Better methods for interpreting grain-size spectra will enhance current understanding of past transport-depositional processes. A high-resolution inorganic grain-size dataset has been measured from a freeze core extracted from Alberta Lake E' a boreal fresh water lake 40km east of the Athabasca Oil Sands in north-eastern Alberta, Canada. The grain-size spectra are remarkably consistent throughout the core, exhibiting a structure comprising six persistent grain-size distributions below ca 250m, plus a rare medium-sand distribution. Automated deconvolution of the grain-size spectra produced poor results. Constraining the modes of two of the distributions produced deconvolution solutions that were statistically excellent and consistent with the structure of each spectrum. Statistical analysis of the constrained' solutions indicates that deconvolution successfully extracted independent grain-size populations. Conversely, the multimodal spectra generate traditional measures (for example, mean grain size) that are inconsistent combinations of different individual populations and thus are poor proxies of transport-depositional processes. Alberta Lake E is situated in a boreal wetland landscape where sediment delivery is dominated by overland flow transport during spring melt. This context means that the Alberta Lake E grain-size spectra can be interpreted to reflect: (i) a bedload component transported during short-duration high discharge events that reflect the intensity of the melt; and (ii) a finer suspended load component representing material whose magnitude is controlled by the volume of the spring melt. Stratigraphically, bedload and suspended load populations demonstrate different short-wavelength and long-wavelength cyclicity, suggesting that spring melt is likely to be driven by cyclic external forcing factors. The links between the grain-size spectra and spring melt have potential for generating proxy records that better capture the external controls over spring melt in boreal systems and the risks associated with these energetic hydrodynamics. This is exemplified by the coarsest Alberta Lake E distributions, which indicate that more intense spring-melt dynamics occurred in pre-historical times.

J	Johnson, WP; Beauchamp, JS; Butler, MJ; Sanchez, J				Johnson, William P.; Beauchamp, Jeffrey S.; Butler, Matthew J.; Sanchez, Jeffrey, I			Successful establishment of endangered springsnails following habitat enhancement and translocations	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Spring-associated aquatic invertebrates tend to be narrow-range endemics. Globally, they are threatened with extinction as a result of habitat loss caused by declining aquifers and by climate change. Extinction risks to narrow-range endemics may be reduced by having multiple, separate populations, yet there have been few attempts to use conservation translocations to create new populations. Pyrgulopsis roswellensis (Roswell springsnail), Juturnia kosteri (Koster's springsnail) and Gammarus desperatus (Noel's amphipod) are range-restricted, spring-associated endangered species. Each species has lost one or more populations owing to habitat loss, and their distributions are now largely restricted to Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico. In 2014, Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge enhanced a series of springs by re-routing a channelized section of river away from them. The goal was to create habitat suitable for establishing new populations of P. roswellensis and J. kosteri, and for expansion of G. desperatus. After assessing risks and benefits of translocations, approximately 6,177 P. roswellensis and 8,707 J. kosteri were introduced into the project area from 2015 to 2018. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing the abundance of invertebrates in the translocation site through time, and by comparing springsnail abundance with three reference spring systems. From 2014 to 2021, invertebrates were monitored twice annually in the translocation area. In reference spring systems, P. roswellensis and J. kosteri were monitored twice annually in 2020 and 2021. Counts of springsnails in the translocation area were comparable to one or more reference areas, which suggests that translocations were successful. In addition, the proportion of P. roswellensis, the less common springsnail, to J. kosteri was similar to references areas. G. desperatus did not increase, which may be because some measures of water quality have not stabilized. Globally, climate change and aquifer declines necessitate immediate consideration be given to conservation translocations as a means of keeping spring-associated species from becoming extinct.

In Lake Ojagaike, Chiba, Japan, turions started to germinate and develop in late autumn, reaching maximum development during May. Flowering took place in late spring (May) and fruits could be collected during May-June. Turions were formed during May-June, turion development taking .apprx. 2 wk. Non-dormant turions collected from the lake were of 2 different colors, brown and green. The rate of germination of brown turions was lower than than that of green turions. The germination of non-dormant green turions was affected by water temperature but not by light intensity. Dormancy was fully broken by a cold treatment (5.degree. C) for 1 wk, a warm treatment (30.degree. C) for 2 wk or a heat treatment (35.degree. C) for 2 wk, but not by an almost freezing temperature (-1 to 2.degree. C). There was significant interaction between the length of heat treatment and light or dark conditions. IAA and GA3 (10-5 and 10-6 M) broke dormancy of warm-treated turions; in high concentrations (10-3 and 10-4 M) the dormancy was fully broken even in non warm-treated turions. With higher concentrations GA3 promoted shoot elongation in light; in the dark, shoot elongation was inhibited.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1981	10	2					161	173		10.1016/0304-3770(81)90018-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(81)90018-8													WOS:A1981LL91800006

Application of Modern Low-Cost Sensors for Monitoring of Particle Matter in Temperate Latitudes: An Example from the Southern Baikal Region	SUSTAINABILITY												The aim of this study was to expand the monitoring network and evaluate the accuracy of inexpensive WoMaster ES-104 sensors for monitoring particulate matter (PM) in temperate latitudes, using the example of the Southern Baikal region. The research methods included continuous measurements of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, temperature, and humidity at three stations (Listvyanka, Patrony, and Tankhoy) from October 2023 to October 2024, using the LCS WoMaster ES-104. ERA5-Land reanalysis data and the HYSPLIT model were used to analyze meteorological conditions and air mass trajectories. The results of this study showed a high correlation between the WoMaster ES-104 and the DustTrak 8533; the correlation coefficient was 0.94 (R2 = 0.85) for both fractions. The seasonal dynamics of PM2.5 and PM10 were characterized by a dual-mode distribution with maxima in summer (secondary aerosols, high humidity) and winter (anthropogenic emissions, inversions). The diurnal cycles showed morning/evening peaks associated with transport activity and atmospheric stratification. Extreme concentrations were recorded in anticyclonal weather (weak north-westerly winds, stable atmosphere). This study confirms the suitability of the LCS WoMaster ES-104 for real-time monitoring of PM2.5 and PM10, which contributes to sustainable development by increasing the availability of air quality data for ecologically significant regions such as Lake Baikal.

In spring, recruitment is a key process in the cyanobacterial life cycle and in blooms formation. An increase in spring water temperature likely plays an important role in driving cyanobacterial recruitment. Moreover, spring is a warm suddenly and cold still season, effects of cold spell on the time course and the amount of recruitment were yet to be explored. In this paper, effects of cold spell on recruitment of benthic cyanobacteria were investigated in a simulated experiment by using hiemal sediment samples from Chaohu Lake. Results showed that cold spell (a three-day cold spell at 4 degrees C or 9 degrees C) mainly slowed down cyanobacterial growth rate and postponed their dominance establishment. Especially, more attention should be given to the cold spell of lower than 9 degrees C in early spring, which could affect the duration and intensity of blooms to a certain extent.

This parameter, as a measure of the transparency of the medium, is a good indicator of water quality. Degradation of the optical properties of water due to anthropogenic disturbances is a common phenomenon in freshwater ecosystems. In this study, we used four algorithm-based Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A/B MSI images to estimate the diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation in Lake Villarrica located in south-central Chile. The algorithms' estimated data from the ACOLITE module were validated with in situ measurements from six sampling stations. Seasonal and intralake variations of the light attenuation coefficient were studied. The relationship between the diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation, meteorological parameters, and an optical classification was also explored. The best results were obtained with QAA v6 KdPAR Nechad (R-2 = 0.931, MBE = 0.023 m(-1), RMSE = 0.088 m(-1), and MAPE = 35.9%) for spring and QAA v5 Kd490 algorithms (R-2 = 0.919, MBE = -0.064 m(-1), RMSE = -0.09 m(-1), and MAPE = 30.3%) for summer. High KdPAR values are associated with the strong wind and precipitation events suggest they are caused by sediment resuspension. Finally, an optical classification of freshwater ecosystems was proposed for this lake. The promising results of this study suggest that the combination of in situ data and observation satellites can be useful for assessing the bio-optical state of water and water quality dynamics in Chilean aquatic systems.					; Duran Llacer, Iongel/AAE-4362-2021; González Rodríguez, Lisdelys/JYQ-0867-2024	Rodriguez Lopez, Lien/0000-0002-0550-0253; Gonzalez Rodriguez, Lisdelys/0000-0002-7892-4604; Garcia-Tunon, Wirmer/0000-0001-5648-0179; Duran Llacer, Iongel/0000-0003-3290-4947														2072-4292				SEP	2022	14	18							4568	10.3390/rs14184568	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14184568													WOS:000859512000001

Nearshore (5- and 10-m depth contours) vertical distributions of segregated Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout, between spring and autumn of the 1st 18 mo. after transfer, did not differ significantly from those in their sympatric lake. Dolly Varden were captured mainly near the bottom while cutthroat trout were more evenly distributed throughout the water column. Nevertheless, initially the allopatric Dolly Varden rapidly became highly planktivorous, virtually eliminating midwater populations of Chaoborus trivittatus and C. americanus (3rd and 4th instar larvae) within a year. They later ate mainly benthic organisms as in the sympatric lake. Although allopatric cutthroat trout had a similar effect on Chaoborus larvae in their lake, they also ate more large benthic prey than did those in sympatry with Dolly Varden in the donor lake.

This investigation involved comprehensive sampling of daily precipitation and river water with a 5 d interval as well as observing hydrometeorological factors spanning 13 hydrological years from January 2010 to December 2022, combined with the temporal and spatial correlation analyses based on linear regression and the isotopic Atmospheric Water Balance Model. Key findings are as follows: river water delta 2H (delta 2HR) exhibited significant seasonal variation, with the most positive and negative values occurring in the spring flood period and summer drought period, respectively, in alignment with those observed in precipitation. The correlations of the delta 2HR with corresponding hydrometeorological factors with a 5 d interval were commonly weak due to the seasonality of precipitation isotopes and mixing of various water bodies within the basin, but the changes in the runoff (Delta R) and delta 2HR (Delta delta 2HR) between two contiguous samplings with 5 d or higher intervals showed significant responses to the corresponding accumulated precipitation and evaporation. Prolonged rainless intervals with high evaporation rates in 2013 and 2022 as well as significant precipitation events in major flood periods in 2011 and 2017 had a significant impact on the delta 2HR and runoff discharge. However, the most positive delta 2HR values were primarily influenced by precipitation input with the most enriched isotopes in the spring flood period, while the moderately isotope-depleted precipitation during limited wetness conditions led to the most negative delta 2HR. The spatial correlation analysis between water isotopes and hydrometeorological factors at the observing site and in the surrounding regions supported the representation of the Changsha site in the Xiangjiang River basin. These results underscore the potential of Delta delta 2HR as a proxy that reflects the seasonal variations in local environments, while caution is advised when interpreting extreme isotopic signals in river water. Overall, this study provides insights into the seasonal variation, extreme signal interpreting, and controlling factors of delta 2HR in the study area, which was valuable for paleoclimate reconstruction and establishment of isotope hydrologic models.

Mechanisms of long-term variations in the thermal structure of a warm lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Analysis of a 39-yr record (1969-2008) of temperature profiles from Lake Kinneret, Israel, revealed that average epilimnion thickness decreased by similar to 1.2 m (similar to 3 cm yr(-1)), metalimnion thickness decreased by between similar to 1.0 m (December) and similar to 2.0 m (April), and average temperature of the epilimnion increased by similar to 1 degrees C (similar to 0.028 degrees C yr(-1)). Average hypolimnetic temperature remained constant (similar to 15 degrees C), so that the thermal gradient across the metalimnion increased. The average duration of the stratification period (similar to 286 d) remained unchanged. We show that the stratification changes were the result of a decrease in lake level, a slight increase in air temperature during the spring and summer, and a reduction of inflows to the lake. These changes in time affected the stratification pattern in the same direction, i.e., an increase in the lake epilimnetic temperature and an increase in the thermal gradient across the metalimnion. Analysis of the data indicates that the effect of overpumping, which leads to a reduction in lake level, is larger than the effect of changes due to air-temperature increase and the reduction in inflow volumes.					; Opher, Tamar/O-7781-2019	Rimmer, Alon/0000-0003-1291-6975; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2011	56	3					974	988		10.4319/lo.2011.56.3.0974	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2011.56.3.0974													WOS:000290678100017

As a result of this climate variability in the Sikkim Himalaya, a detailed study of the Gurudongmar lake complex (GLC) evolution and outburst susceptibility assessment is required. Glacial lake volume estimation and lake outburst susceptibility assessment were carried out to reveal different characteristics for all four lakes (GL-1, GL-2, GL-3, and GL-4) from the lake complex. Each of these lakes has a moderate to very high potential to outburst. As the dam of GL-1 provides no retention capacity, there is a very high potential of a combined effect with the sudden failure of the moraine-dams of GL-2 or GL-3 located upstream. Temporal analysis of GLC using optical remote sensing data and in-field investigations revealed a rapidly increasing total lake area by ~74 +/- 3%, with an expansion rate of +0.03 +/- 0.002 km(2) a(-1) between 1962 and 2018 due to climate change and ongoing glacier retreat. The overall lake area expansion rates are dependent on climate-driven factors, and constantly increasing average air temperature is responsible for the enlargement of the lake areas. Simultaneously, changes in GLC expansion velocity are driven by changes in the total amount of precipitation. The deficit in precipitation probably triggered the initial higher rate from 1962 to 1988 during the winter and spring seasons. The post-1990s positive anomaly in precipitation might have reduced the rate of the glacial lake area expansion considerably.					; Chowdhury, Arindam/KEH-8681-2024; De, Sunil Kumar/AAW-4887-2021	DE, SUNIL KUMAR/0000-0001-7828-1488; Chowdhury, Arindam/0000-0002-6895-2038; Debnath, Dr. Manasi/0000-0003-4224-257X; Kroczek, Tomas/0000-0002-7398-6523														2073-4441				DEC	2021	13	24							3565	10.3390/w13243565	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13243565													WOS:000742868000001
J	Moreno, IM; Avila, A; Losada, MA				Maria Moreno, Isabel; Avila, Alberto; Angel Losada, Miguel			Morphodynamics of intermittent coastal lagoons in Southern Spain: Zahara de Los Atunes	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Coastal lagoons are valuable water bodies since they are of great ecological and economic interest throughout the world. Their existence is controlled by variations in sea level and the geological substrate of their location. Their morphology is linked to local topography, alternation of high and low pressure, the presence of a river, as well as tidal regime. All these factors influence lagoons along the coastline in the south of Spain. The main morphological characteristics of such lagoons are the following: intermittence, one-dimensional morphology, small size, shallow waters, high area/depth ratio, no flood- or ebb tide deltas, overwash of their low barriers during storms, high evaporation rates and feeding by rivers. Effective management of these systems requires the evaluation not only of their hydrodynamics and opening and closure rate, but also the prediction of possible future scenarios as a response to meteorological events. This paper describes the behavior of a coastal lagoon in Zahara de los Atunes (Cadiz) by means of a numerical model implemented with the objective of serving as a tool for optimizing the coastal zone management. Although the coastal lagoon at Zahara de los Atunes is closed most of the year, it is artificially opened at the beginning of the summer. The results of our study showed that during this period, the lagoon is flood-dominated with a pumping-mode response. It naturally tends to close since it is a trap for littoral drift sediments. The precise date of closure depends on the events that take place during the autumn, which determine whether the sediments deposited in the inlet by the littoral drift are flushed out by the river flow or flushed in by the waves.

However, the distribution characteristics and migration behaviour of Po in ice-water-sediment systems under freezing and thawing conditions in cold and arid regions remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the forms of Po and its contribution to endogenous P pollution. We selected three lakes (Dai, Hu, and Wu Lake) and employed phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (P-31-NMR) techniques to analyse the following: (1) The total phosphorus (TP) content, which was the highest in the water from Dai Lake (0.16 mg/L), with substantial seasonal variation observed in Wu Lake, where P content was four times higher in summer than in winter because of farmland drainage. (2) Eutrophication analysis, which indicated that Dai Lake had significantly higher eutrophication levels than Wu Lake, with P being the controlling factor in Dai Lake and both N and P in Wu Lake. The proportion of Po in the TP content was 90%, 70%, and 55% for Wu, Dai, and Hu Lake, respectively, indicating that Po was the main component of eutrophic lakes. (3) P-31-NMR, which revealed that orthophosphate (Ortho-P) and monoester phosphate (Mon-P) were the main P components in the winter, with a higher P content in Dai Lake. Ortho-P has a higher content in ice, indicating that inorganic phosphorus (Pi) migration is the main factor in ice-water media. Mon-P showed multiple peaks in Dai Lake, indicating a complex composition of adenosine monophosphate and glucose-1-phosphate. (4) The ice-water phase change simulation experiments, which showed that phosphate was the least repelled in ice, while pyrophosphate (Pyro-P) and macromolecular P were more repelled. Adding sediment enhanced the migration of P but did not change the repulsion of macromolecular P, suggesting the molecular structure as the main influencing factor. These results provide important scientific evidence for the quantitative analysis of Po pollution in lake water environments, aiding in P load reduction and risk prevention and control.

Dynamics of an Introduced and Unexploited Lake Whitefish Population in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												To evaluate biological potential of a commercial fishery for an unexploited Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis population in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, we estimated population parameters related to production and yield. The length frequency based on trap-netting in autumn 2005 was normal with a mean of 448 mm TL, whereas the length frequency based on gillnetting in spring 2006 was bimodal with a mean of 390 mm TL. Sex composition was skewed toward females (0.66) during autumn trap-netting. Shape parameters beta of weight-length models for females (beta = 3.38) and males (beta = 3.45) were similar to those of other unexploited populations. Instantaneous growth rates K for females (K = 0.144 per year) andmales (K = 0.153 per year) were among the lowest for unexploited populations across the species' range. Age at 50% maturity (females: 6.5 years; males: 6.0 years) and length at 50% maturity (females: 390 mm TL; males: 378 mm TL) were high for unexploited populations. The natural mortality rate M (0.149 per year, ages 11-36) was among the lowest observed for unexploited populations. Adult population density was lower than that of other populations based on total surface area (mean = 1.35 fish/ha; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-1.78 fish/ha) but was average based on lake area shallower than 70 m (4.07 fish/ha; 95% CI = 3.35-5.35 fish/ha). Population density of juveniles and adults averaged 84 fish/ha (95% CI = 52-143 fish/ha) over the entire surface area and 278 fish/ha (95% CI = 173-474 fish/ha) over depths shallower than 70 m. The difference between the low M of the unexploited population in Lake Pend Oreille (M = 0.149 per year; annual mortality rate A = 14%) and the high sustainable total mortality Z of exploited stocks in the Laurentian Great Lakes (Z = 1.204; A = 70%) suggests a large scope for sustainable fishingmortality F (1.055 per year; exploitation rate u = 61%) that is equivalent to a sustainable Lake Whitefish harvest of 55,000 individuals (50,000-60,000 individuals) and 49,000 kg (45,000-54,000 kg) from Lake Pend Oreille.

Plankton dynamics and their relationship with environmental factors shape fish community structure in fluvial ecosystem: A case study	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												Phytoplankton and zooplankton serve as bioindicators and are critical components for the functioning of ecosystem and support a wide range of ecosystem services. To understand the interrelationship between plankton, fish and habitat parameters; aforementioned parameters were recorded seasonally from six sites, representing different habitat types along the stretches of Ib River, a tributary of Mahanadi River system in India. A total of 47 phytoplankton and 14 zooplankton species were recorded. Maximum density and diversity of phytoplankton and fish were observed at downstream sites while those of zooplankton were recorded in upstream sites. Maximum phytoplankton and zooplankton were recorded in summer season. A high correlation of species richness was observed with water and air temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity, turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS) and total nitrogen. Plankton always had complex interactions with ecological abiotic factors and variations in the distribution of plankton affect the fish diversity of the region. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to establish relationship between important fish species and environmental variables. Maximum plankton abundance in the winter months also coincided with maximum fish diversity corroborating an existing positive relationship between the plankton and fish. The study helps in better understanding the influence of plankton and habitat parameters in determining fish community structure and its importance to ecosystem services.					; , A.K.Jaiswar/AAE-5769-2022; SINGH, SANJAY K/HIR-6999-2022; TYAGI, LALIT/HHZ-4032-2022	Tyagi, Dr. Lalit Kumar/0000-0002-3711-7689; Mohindra, Vindhya/0000-0003-3685-9880													0970-6011						2021	68	4					1	13		10.21077/ijf.2021.68.4.111193-01	http://dx.doi.org/10.21077/ijf.2021.68.4.111193-01													WOS:000740703800001
J	Li, YL; Zhang, Q; Yao, J; Tan, ZQ; Liu, XG				Li, Yunliang; Zhang, Qi; Yao, Jing; Tan, Zhiqiang; Liu, Xinggen			Assessment of water storage response to surface hydrological connectivity in a large floodplain system (Poyang Lake, China) using hydrodynamic and geostatistical analysis	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												Floodplains play a significant role in affecting the transport of water, dissolved matter and sediments during wide-ranging drying and wetting. This study uses a hydrodynamic model and geostatistical method to explore the variations of water storage and its relationship with the surface hydrological connectivity, exemplified by the large Poyang Lake-floodplain system (in China). The simulations show that the floodplain storage exhibits largely similar behavior to that of the total lake water storage, but the water storage in the main lake is distinctly higher than the floodplains. The lake storage is estimated to be from 20 x 10(8) to 163 x 10(8) m(3) and differs considerably between seasons, and the contribution of the floodplain to the total lake storage varies from 18 to 34%. Geostatistical analysis reveals that the degree of surface hydrological connectivity can be classified as high connectivity in summer, low connectivity in winter, and intermediate connectivity during other seasons. Higher variability of water storage and lower frequency of hydrological connectivity are found in the seasonal floodplains, whereas the lower variability and higher frequency are observed in the main lake, indicating that water storage is inextricably linked to the dynamic behaviors of surface hydrological connectivity. Additionally, the estimated water storage significantly increases from the low and intermediate conditions to the high connectivity condition, mainly due to the key process of the west-east connectivity in controlling lake-floodplain interactions. This study improves understanding of Poyang Lake floodplain behavior and other similar floodplain systems by providing knowledge of water balance, water allocation and water management.

J	Li, B; Yang, GS; Wan, RR; Hörmann, G				Li, Bing; Yang, Guishan; Wan, Rongrong; Hoermann, Georg			Dynamic water quality evaluation based on fuzzy matter-element model and functional data analysis, a case study in Poyang Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Comprehensively evaluating water quality with a single method alone is challenging because water quality evaluation involves complex, uncertain, and fuzzy processes. Moreover, water quality evaluation is limited by finite water quality monitoring that can only represent water quality conditions at certain time points. Thus, the present study proposed a dynamic fuzzy matter-element model (D-FME) to comprehensively and continuously evaluate water quality status. D-FME was first constructed by introducing functional data analysis (FDA) theory into a fuzzy matter-element model and then validated using monthly water quality data for the Poyang Lake outlet (Hukou) from 2011 to 2012. Results showed that the finite water quality indicators were represented as dynamic functional curves despite missing values and irregular sampling time. The water quality rank feature curve was integrated by the D-FME model and revealed comprehensive and continuous variations in water quality. The water quality in Hukou showed remarkable seasonal variations, with the best water quality in summer and worst water quality in winter. These trends were significantly correlated with water level fluctuations (R = -0.71, p < 0.01). Moreover, the extension weight curves of key indicators indicated that total nitrogen and total phosphorus were the most important pollutants that influence the water quality of the Poyang Lake outlet. The proposed D-FME model can obtain scientific and intuitive results. Moreover, the D-FME model is not restricted to water quality evaluation and can be readily applied to other areas with similar problems.

This river is exposed to intense anthropic influence by numerous shoes, leather, petrochemical, and metallurgy industries. Water samples were collected at two moments (winter 2006 and spring 2006) at five sites of Sinos River and evaluated using in vitro V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (cytotoxicity, comet assay and micronucleus test) and Allium cepa test (toxicity and micronucleus test). Comet and micronucleus tests revealed that water samples collected exerted cytotoxic, toxic, genotoxic and mutagenic effects. The results showed the toxic action of organic and inorganic agents found in the water samples in all sites of Sinos River, for both data collections. The main causes behind pollution were the domestic and industrial toxic discharges. The V79 and A. cepa tests were proved efficient to detect toxicity and genotoxicity caused by complex mixtures. This study also showed the need for constant monitoring in sites with strong environmental degradation caused by industrial discharges and urban sewages. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To test the hypothesis that the development of peatland in the Changbai Mountains responds to the variability of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), the developmental history of the Hani peatland was investigated based on peat basal ages. It can be concluded that the development of Hani peatland is the paludification. The development of the northern region started 13,685 cal. yr BP, while that of the southern region was initiated 7705 cal. yr BP. In addition, the moisture changes and development of the Hani peatland can be divided into three periods. From 16 to 7 ka cal. BP, the increase in the EASM was induced by the lower sea level and southward displacement of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), resulting in increasing moisture in the Hani peadand. Peat was gradually established in the northern region. From 7 to 2 ka cal. BP, the increased relative sea level and northward displacement of the WPSH induced the maximum EASM. The EASM and Northeast Monsoon (NEM) induced the maximum moisture in the Hani peatland. Both the northern and southern regions were covered with peat during this period. Since 2 ka cal BP, the decreasing EASM might be related to the seasonal decrease in the Northern Hemisphere summer insulation and ENSO intensity. Thus, the decreasing EASM induced the decrease in the moisture in the Hani peatland. Peat further accumulated in both the northern and southern regions. This study will help to understand the future EASM behavior in NE China and the development of similar peatlands in response to ongoing and future climatic change. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sherony, DF; Ewald, BM; Kelling, S				Sherony, DF; Ewald, BM; Kelling, S			Inland fall migration of red-throated loons	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Lake Ontario is the only Great Lake where a significant number of Red-throated Loons are seen during fall migration. Observations from Hamlin Bench State Park, New York during fall months, 1993-1997, were used to analyze their movements. Annually an average of 7750 Red-throated Loons were counted moving mostly west on the south shore of Lake Ontario. Their median date of occurrence was 22 November with the peak period of migration from 17 November to 1 December. The earliest migrants appeared in mid-October and became extremely rare after December. The seasonal timing on Lake Ontario corresponds to that observed on the Atlantic Ocean at Avalon, New Jersey. Their occurrence on Lake Ontario was analyzed with respect to local and mid-arctic weather conditions. The variable which best correlates with their appearance is mid-arctic temperature. On average, large flights (>200 loons pet day) began on Lake Ontario 3 d after the invasion of a cold air mass is centered approximately 1100 km to the north, After this event, the period of sustained flight was maintained for 7-16 d when 80% of migration takes place. The fall arrival pattern of Red-throated Loons on Lake Ontario implies that migration lakes place under any type of weather conditions, but local temperature, wind direction, and the movement of cold fronts are all weakly correlated to their migration. Inland fall sight records of Red-throated Loons from American Birds suggest that the main inland migration route is through western Pennsylvania.

This study investigates the potential of Irrigation Best Management Practices (IBMPs) to enhance water productivity and contribute to the lake's restoration. Three strategies (i) deficit irrigation, (ii) adjustment of planting dates, and (iii) adoption of transplanting methods were assessed in the Miandoab region using the AquaCrop simulation model. The impacts of these strategies on dry yield, biomass, and water productivity were evaluated. Results showed that early planting of winter crops (wheat and barley) and delayed planting of spring crops (sugar beet) could save approximately 50.71 Mm3 of water and increase water productivity by 13%, 2%, and 5%, respectively, compared to conventional dates. Deficit irrigation, which reduced net irrigation water requirements by 10-50%, improved water productivity by 29% (wheat), 20% (barley), and 26% (sugar beet). Additionally, removing two irrigation events increased water productivity by 32% for wheat and 22% for barley. Transplanting sugar beet also proved effective, achieving water savings with minimal yield loss. The combined implementation of these non-structural strategies could reduce agricultural water consumption by approximately 131.59 Mm3 (26%). These findings demonstrate not only the feasibility of significantly reducing water use in agriculture without compromising yields, but also the critical role such strategies play in restoring vital ecosystems like Lake Urmia. Accordingly, given the national goal of a 40% reduction in agricultural water use, the results suggest that scaling up IBMPs across the Lake Urmia basin could achieve even greater water savings.																			2363-5037	2363-5045				JUL 16	2025	11	4							83	10.1007/s40899-025-01255-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-025-01255-y													WOS:001530611800001

Evaluation of Legacy Forest Harvesting Impacts on Dominant Stream Water Sources and Implications for Water Quality Using End Member Mixing Analysis	WATER												Forests are critical water supply regions that are increasingly threatened by natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Evaluation of runoff-generating processes within harvested and undisturbed headwater catchments provides insight into disturbance impacts on water quality and drinking water treatability. In this study, an extensive hydrologic dataset collected at the experimental Turkey Lakes Watershed (TLW) located on the Canadian Shield was used to quantify sources of stormflow in legacy clear-cut (24-years post harvesting) and forested (control) headwater catchments using an end member mixing analysis (EMMA) model. Stream water, groundwater, soil water, and throughfall water quality were evaluated during spring snowmelt, stormflow, and fall wet-up. Groundwater chemistry was similar to stream water chemistry in both catchments, suggesting that groundwater is a major contributor to stream flow. The water chemistry in small wetlands within the study catchments was comparable to stream water chemistry, suggesting that wetlands are also important contributors to stream flow. Differences in wetland position between the legacy clear-cut and control catchments appeared to have a greater influence on source contributions than legacy harvesting. Results from this study provide insight into runoff-generation processes that reflect event/seasonal flow dynamics and the impacts on water quality.

J	Downs, SG; Macleod, CL; Lester, JN				Downs, SG; Macleod, CL; Lester, JN			Mercury in precipitation and its relation to bioaccumulation in fish: A literature review	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Increases in industrial mercury (HE) emissions in recent years have led many researchers to believe that Hg from the atmosphere constitutes a main source of Hg to aquatic biota in the absence of point source discharges. Established background levels for fish (0.2-1.0 mg kg(-1)) now exceed the pre industrial level of 0.15 mg kg(-1), suggesting an anthropogenic origin. This review of recent literature illustrates how levels of mercury (Hg) species in the atmosphere are effectively transported into the aquatic arena, where chemical parameters combine to determine bioaccumulation rates in fish. Limited studies on methyl mercury (MeHg) in precipitation shown that concentrations average from 5% of total-I-Ig (T-Hg), to 1% in industrial regions. Observations of increased Hg is snow and precipitation from the Arctic Circle, related to poleward atmospheric circulation patterns, also demonstrate a spring maximum accompanying ozone depletion. Increases in oxidants and soil derived Hg in the atmosphere during the summer best explain summer Hg maximums observed in precipitation, while increased temperatures raise fish metabolism increasing Hg uptake through respiration and ingestion rate. The major route of entry for MeHg to fish appears to be biomagnification, after input from precipitation, runoff and inlake methylation. Regions buffered against acid precipitation maintain low fish-Hg levels by reduced MeHg production and maintaining gill function. When considering the bioaccumulation of Hg in fish this study shows that there are many variables to consider, not all of which originate from inside the aquatic arena. Both catchment and atmospheric processes combine with aquatic variables to dictate the overall levels of MeHg observed in fish tissue. There now appears to be sufficient knowledge to develop an axiom for the identification of aquatic systems likely to be susceptible to bioaccumulation from atmospheric derived Hg.

In the present study, the characteristics of N deposition and its contribution to water eutrophication were investigated in the Taihu Basin. The results showed that the annual average total deposition (TN), total wet deposition (TNW), and total dry deposition (TND) rates were 6154, 1142, and 5012 kg.km(-2), respectively. Moreover, seasonal fluctuations in TN, TNW, and TND deposition were observed, with a higher N deposition rate occurring in spring and summer. Spatially, the distribution of TN and TND deposition throughout the Taihu Basin was similar. However, the TN deposition rate declined gradually from the southeast to the northwest, while the TNW deposition rate increased. A significant positive correlation was also found between the TN deposition contents with rainfall (R = 0.803, P = 0.01), rainfall frequency (R = 0.767, P < 0.01), and rainfall intensity (R = 0.659, P < 0.05). The TN deposition concentration was significantly negatively correlated with rainfall (R = -0.999, P < 0.01), rain frequency (R = 0.805, P < 0.01), and rainfall intensity (R = 0.783,P < 0.01). The riverine input of TN was estimated to be 112,500 t.N.a(-1), and the main N pollutants originated from domestic sewage (accounting for 48.88%) and agriculture (accounting for 28.17%). Livestock and aquaculture contributed 90% of the agricultural pollutants. Additionally, TN deposition contributed 14,400 t N.a(-1) to the lake, which accounted for 12.36% of the annual riverine TN inputs. The TN deposition load already exceeds the eutrophication critical load in theory. Furthermore, the contribution of N deposition to the lake has been increasing in recent years, which may accelerate eutrophication of Taihu Lake.

Adverse weather during this period may delay sporting events, while snow and ice-covered streets and highways may impede access by the athletes and spectators to the venues. While winter snowstorms and other large-scale weather systems typically have widespread impacts throughout northern Utah, hazardous winter weather is often related to local terrain features (the Wasatch Mountains and Great Salt Lake are the most prominent ones). Examples of such hazardous weather include lake-effect snowstorms, ice fog, gap winds, downslope windstorms, and low visibility over mountain passes. A weather support system has been developed to provide weather information to the athletes, games officials, spectators, and the interested public around the world. This system is managed by the Salt Lake Olympic Committee and relies upon meteorologists from the public, private, and academic sectors of the atmospheric science community. Weather forecasting duties will be led by National Weather Service forecasters and a team of private weather forecasters organized by KSL, the Salt Lake City NBC television affiliate. Other government agencies, commercial firms, and the University of Utah are providing specialized forecasts and support services for the Olympics. The weather support system developed for the 2002 Winter Olympics is expected to provide long-term benefits to the public through improved understanding, monitoring, and prediction of winter weather in the Intermountain West.

Seasonal fluctuation in water quality due to natural and anthropogenic influence in tropical lowland lakes of Nepal brings variations in algal diversity. The purpose of the study was to assess seasonal variation of the algal diversity in response to physicochemical parameters of lakeshore water. Sampling was performed for algae during monsoon and winter season in the year 2018-2019. The value of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solute (TDS) and conductivity were recorded highest during winter while highest temperature was recorded during monsoon season. Chlorophyceae was found to be dominant during both seasons. Shannon -Weiner Index was higher during monsoon with more evenly distributed algae species. Closterium sp. and Glaucocystis sp. were more frequent while Gomphonema sp. was highly abundant during monsoon. Dictyosphaerium sp., Anabaena sp., Pinnularia sp. and Closterium sp. showed high abundance with high conductivity during winter but Cymbella sp., Ulnaria sp. and Pleurotaenium sp. seemed concentrated towards high DO during winter.

Consequences of lake and river ice loss on cultural ecosystem services	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												People extensively use lakes and rivers covered by seasonal ice. Although ice cover duration has been declining over the past 150 years for Northern Hemisphere freshwaters, we know relatively little about how ice loss directly affects humans. Here, we synthesize the cultural ecosystem services (i.e., services that provide intangible or nonmaterial benefits) and associated benefits supported by inland ice. We also provide, for the first time, empirical examples that give quantitative evidence for a winter warming effect on a wide range of ice-related cultural ecosystem services and benefits. We show that in recent decades, warmer air temperatures delayed the opening date of winter ice roads and led to cancellations of spiritual ceremonies, outdoor ice skating races, and ice fishing tournaments. Additionally, our synthesis effort suggests unexploited data sets that allow for the use of integrative approaches to evaluate the interplay between inland ice loss and society.

High abundance and diversity of flagellates under ice cover in Lake Baikal revealed by microscopy and metabarcoding	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lakes located in the north temperate zone may be covered with ice for long periods. Under the ice, a habitat is created, different from the open water period, which is characterized by low temperature and reduced light due to ice and snow cover. We investigated phytoplankton in sub-ice communities (SI) at the ice-water interface and the 0-25 m under-ice water column communities (UW) in the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal. Community structure was assessed using microscopy and metabarcoding of fragments of 18S rRNA gene. Flagellate diversity included 34 taxa from 64 microalgae identified by microscopy and 48 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 56 identified by metabarcoding. In conditions of complete snow-covered ice, high diversity and abundance of flagellates (up to 14 million cells L-1) were observed, with an advantage due to their mobility and different feeding modes. Both microscopy and metabarcoding data show that the taxonomic structure of SI and UW is different. SI communities of Lake Baikal showed mass development of a mixed group of nanoflagellates, which consisted of "Spumella- and Chlamydomonas-like flagellates". SI communities were less taxonomically diverse, suggesting that available resource gradients on the ice bottom are more tightly constrained, and taxa have to be ice bottom specialists to survive there. The relative spatial heterogeneity of SI communities is reflective of greater homogenization of habitat parameters in the winter water column and more dynamic conditions on the ice bottom. The data obtained expand the understanding of the diversity and abundance of organisms in under-ice habitats in north temperate latitudes.

We found that seston particles, similarly as dissolved organic matter (DOM), undergo intensive decomposition processes in lake water, but only after their previous colonization by bacteria. In lakes of low or moderate trophic status free-living microorganisms predominated. They preferentially utilized low molecular weight, dissolved organic compounds. Increases in particulate organic matter (POM) content in these environments caused rapid change of substrate exploitation strategy and adaptation of these bacteria to live in particle-attached forms. In lakes of POM and colloidal DOM (CDOM) abundant particle-attached microheterotrophs, although less metabolically active than free-living bacteria, were mainly responsible for secondary production and POM mineralization A mechanisms that permit effective POM exploitation by seston-attached bacteria was overproduction of relatively low active (high Km) enzymes (e.g. aminopeptidase) and/or synthesis of the enzymes (e.g. beta-glucosidase or glucosaminidase) that were optimally adapted (low Km) to the environment.

Thus seasonality changes due to long-term insolation variations may have contributed significantly to the oxygen isotope records for lakes where a seasonal precipitation peak is characteristic. The Lake Zurich catchment experiences a summer precipitation peak, but the reduced winter precipitation in the lowlands is isotopically compensated for by cold precipitation in the Alpine hinterland. Consequently, seasonality change should no have significantly affected the latest Pleistocene-Holocen oxygen isotope record for Lake Zurich. Oxygen isotope ratios derived for past lake waters form sedimented benthic carbonate, corrected for the isotopically heavier atmospheric moisture of the latest Pleistocene, indicate mean annual air temperatures for the last Glacial which were 10 to 15.5.degree. C colder than at present depending on the temperature-.delta.18O relationship for precipitation. Likewise a mean annual air temperature of 1.5 to 2..degree. C below that of today is indicated for ca. 12,400 years B.P. (mid Bolling), when meltwaters from stagnant glacial ice masses had permanently ceased to enter Lake Zurich.

We estimated nutrient excretion by gizzard shad in a eutrophic reservoir (Acton Lake, Ohio) during April-October 1994 by measuring N and P excretion of field-caught fish (n = 135). Excretion rates were then extrapolated to nutrient release by the gizzard shad population using quadrat rotenone biomass estimates, electrofishing surveys, and historic seasonal trends. N and P excretion were positively correlated with fish wet mass and temperature, but mass-specific excretion declined with increasing fish mass. Lakewide gizzard shad biomass in July 1994 was 417 kg ha(-1). Our estimates of nutrient excretion by the gizzard shad population ranged from 0.487 to 0.769 mu mol NH3-N liter(-1) d(-1) and 0.022 to 0.057 mu mol soluble reactive phosphorus liter(-1) d(-1), with the highest excretion occurring during mid-summer through early fall. The low N:P ratio at which gizzard shad excrete [mean molar N:P = 16.75 (+/-0.89 SE)] may alter phytoplankton community composition, favoring cyanobacteria. Our results indicate that nutrient excretion by detritivorous fish can be an important source of nutrients to open waters, especially when other sources of nutrients are reduced.

Gravitational Seismodislocations in Mountainous regions of Southeastern Kazakhstan	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												Data on rock falls and landslides caused by strong earthquakes in the Zhetysu Alatau, Ile Alatau, Kungei Alatau and Teriskei Alatau mountain ranges on the territory of Southeastern Kazakhstan are presented. The study revealed more than 60 large seismogenic rock falls and landslides, the volume of 25 of them varies from 10 to 100 mil. m(3), and the volume of the four largest exceeds 100 mil. m(3). The volume of the largest rock fall in the valley of the Ulken Almaty river in the Ile Alatau mountain range is estimated at 380 mil. m(3). The highest density of seismogenic landslides was recorded in the low-mountain zone of the northern slope of the Ile Alatau range where the magnitude 9 earthquake of 1887 caused a massive formation of landslides with the volume totaling more than 400 mil. m(3) and a density of 1/5 km(2). The proportion of landslide-affected areas is estimated at 5% of the area of their occurrence. In the mid- and high-mountain zones of Zhetysu, Ile and Kungei Alatau, the density of seismogenic rock falls varies from 1/100 to 1/50 km(2), and the proportion of rock fall-affected areas varies from 1 to 1.5%. It is found that seismogenic rock falls have dammed 26 lakes, and the volume of nine such lakes exceeds 10 mil. m(3). The largest rock fall-affected lakes is Upper Zhasylkol in the valley of the Aganakty river in Zhetysu Alatau with the volume of 44 mil. m(3). Data from earthquake catalog were used to compile the map for the recurrence frequency of earthquakes of magnitude higher than 6, capable of causing seismogenic rock falls and landslides. It is found that during the last 130 years, in Ile and Kungei Alatau such earthquakes recurred four times. It is established that earthquakes with maximum magnitude 9 are possible in the mountainous regions of Southeastern Kazakhstan.																			1875-3728	1875-371X				JAN	2018	39	1					79	87		10.1134/S1875372818010110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1875372818010110													WOS:000429963100011

Standing crop of the plants ranged from 0 g/m2 in winter to 60 g/m2 (dry wt) in summer. A significant reduction in standing crop during Aug. could be the result of high temperatures (up to 42.degree. C) observed in the plant stand just prior to the reduction in standing crop. Maximum standing crop of M. spicatum in this study was less than that observed for this plant in some freshwater lakes and ponds. Lower standing crop of M. spicatum is attributed to physical factors. The estuarine littoral area experienced lower light penetration, more dynamic currents, and coarser sediments than the other areas studied. A negative correlation between percent composition of leaf biomass and total plant standing crop is attributed to sloughing of old leaves as the plant stems grow. Particulate material on the plants ranged between 0.8-3.8 g/g M. spicatum biomass and constituted more matter in the littoral area than did the plants.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1979	6	4					365	375		10.1016/0304-3770(79)90075-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(79)90075-5													WOS:A1979HT40700005

For this application the CRCM, which uses a grid mesh of 45 km on a polar stereographic projection, 10 vertical levels, and a timestep of 15 min, is nested with the second generation Canadian General Circulation Model (GCM) simulated output. A numerical simulation of the climate of eastern North America, including the Laurentian Great Lakes, is then performed in order to evaluate the coupled model. The lakes are represented by a "mixed layer" model to simulate the evolution of the surface water temperature, and a thermodynamic ice model to simulate evolution of the ice covet: The mixed-layer depth is allowed to vary spatially. Lake-ice leads are parametrized as a function of ice thickness based on observations. Results from a 5-year integration show that the coupled CRCM/lake model is capable of simulating the seasonal evolution of surface temperature and ice cover in the Great Lakes. When compared with lake climatology, the simulated mean surface water temperature agrees within 0.12 degrees C on average. The seasonal evolution of the lake-ice cover is realistic but the model tends to underestimate the monthly mean ice concentration on average.

Winter sedimentation on spawning groups of lake whitefish (C. clupeaformis) ranged from 0.03 to 0.14 g dry wt sediment .cntdot. cm-2. This deposited a layer 1-4 mm in depth. The sediment, low in organic content, was categorized as silty clay. The effect of this winter sedimentation on survival of whitefish eggs was tested at 4 sites over a range of winter sedimentation rates. Three of the sites were whitefish spawning areas. Egg survival was significantly higher for eggs incubated in cages designed to minimize exposure to sedimentation compared with survival in cages allowing full exposure to sedimentation. Winter sedimentation rates and whitefish egg survival were negatively correlated for cages designed to minimize exposure to sedimentation, while egg survival in the exposed cages was uniformly low.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	4					701	705		10.1139/f84-081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-081													WOS:A1984SU52800014

The results showed that changes in the phase of the PDO have a significant effect on winter temperatures and precipitation over the southern Tibetan Plateau. Changes in the sea surface temperature (SST) during the positive PDO can weaken the Walker circulation and increase the SST in the Indian Ocean. Our analyses of the moist static energy showed that warming of the tropical troposphere over the Indian Ocean caused by the increased SST has resulted in the horizontal advection of anomalous moist enthalpy by the climatological zonal winds, which was responsible for anomalous ascending motion over the Tibetan Plateau. The additional moisture budget suggests that enhanced vertical motion contributes to the increase in winter precipitation and related total cloud cover over the Tibetan Plateau, leading to the increase of snow depth. The increased total cloud cover and snow depth, in turn, reduces net surface shortwave radiation. The surface air temperature of the Tibetan Plateau is then decreased as a result of the reduction in the net surface shortwave radiation. The PDO therefore has an important modulating role in the interdecadal variability of the winter climate over the Tibetan Plateau. We therefore need to focus on changes in the PDO in research related to the decadal prediction of the climate over the Tibetan Plateau. Under the background of global change, the climate of the Tibetan Plateau has undergone significant changes, and it has an important impact on the regional and global climate. Therefore, it is very important to find out the mechanisms of climate variabilities on the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we aim to investigate the influences of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on the winter climate of the Tibetan Plateau and the related physical mechanisms by using observational data and a long-term piControl simulation from the Community Earth System Model Version 2. Results suggest that the PDO has an important modulating role in the interdecadal variability of the winter climate over the Tibetan Plateau. The positive PDO phase can increase winter precipitation and decrease the surface air temperature of the Tibetan Plateau. The related mechanisms are also investigated in this study. The positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) can increase the precipitation and thereby decreasing the temperature in winter over the southern Tibetan Plateau The horizontal advection of anomalous moist enthalpy is responsible for anomalous ascending motion and increased precipitation The anomalous advection of zonal warm air is caused by warming of the tropical troposphere over the Indian Ocean due to the positive PDO					Wang, Tao/AAI-9782-2020	Xu, Hongna/0000-0003-0157-6928													2169-897X	2169-8996				MAR 28	2024	129	6							e2023JD038653	10.1029/2023JD038653	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD038653													WOS:001187096600001

A protracted series of explosive eruptions of moderate volume from September 1995 until July 1996 at Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand, its largest eruptive episode this century, afforded an opportunity to study these remobilisation processes in detail. All significant sub-plinian eruptions occurred in mid-winter, forming metre-thick tephra accumulations on steep slopes covered with perennial ice and seasonal snow. Subsequent events demonstrated the variety and complexity of the erosion processes that remobilise primary pyroclasts in such a setting. These processes arose from the complex interactions of tephra with snow and ice, and liquid water in varying proportions, and were very diverse in nature and scale. Their effectiveness can be gauged from the fact that there is almost no stratigraphic record of any of the >40 eruption episodes recorded in the past 100 years at Ruapehu. Syn-eruptive remobilisation processes included the generation of eruption-triggered lahars by the ejection of hot water from the Crater Lake. Post-eruptive interactions mainly remobilised fall deposits from proximal areas, and included rain-triggered lahars, which were among the largest and most hazardous events with the greatest distal impacts.

They are habitats for Chironomidae. Mountain rheocrenes are inhabited by cold-adapted midges. The fauna of springs in the river valleys is diverse. Midges living in the Skodra L.' spring system prefer higher water temperatures and hard substrates. Chironomidae are known to occur in small, even astatic water bodies like seepages, rheocrens, pools and wells. The Balkan Peninsula reveals a high variability of small water bodies, with springs (rheocrens, limnocrens and helocrens) being the most widely distributed. In this review, we give a brief presentation of the Chironomidae communities in valley and mountain small water bodies, and in Lake Skadar (Shkodra) spring system. River valleys offer a large variety of small freshwater habitats. Their presence strongly increases of midge (Chironomidae) diversity, providing a habitat for the cold-stenotherms and semiterrestrial taxa that do not occur in rivers and lakes. The species richness in small water bodies strongly depends on their hydrological conditions (i.e. perennial vs. astatic water bodies), size and microhabitat complexity. Mountain spring communities depend on precipitation and exhibit altitudinal zonation. The higher mountain zones (1400-1500 m a.s.l.) have the most diverse midge assemblages, due to their stable perennial hydrological conditions. Human activity may alter species composition in riparian springs, favouring taxa that are not typical to the local fauna. By studying these small aquatic habitats, the significance of their Chironomidae fauna is being recognised, thereby filling a gap in the knowledge of freshwater insects biodiversity in the Balkan region.					; Pesic, Vladimir/AFP-7820-2022; Dmitrović, Dejan/AAD-8428-2019; Plociennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018; Płóciennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018; Dmitrovic, Dejan/AAD-8428-2019; Gadawski, Piotr/AAH-1711-2021; berlajolli, violeta/LXW-7822-2024	Gadawski, Piotr/0000-0001-9334-1960; Plociennik, Mateusz/0000-0003-1487-6698; Dmitrovic, Dejan/0000-0001-9134-3276; Berlajolli, Violeta/0000-0002-9776-1804; Pesic, Vladimir/0000-0002-9724-345X														2823-1465				JUL 10	2023	59								6	10.1051/limn/2023005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2023005													WOS:001022573500001

Fish samples were collected on a seasonal basis and were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Gills and liver accumulated relatively higher heavy metal concentrations. All fish organs accumulated the highest metal content in winter and the lowest in summer. Heavy metals accumulated in the order Fe>Zn>Ni>Cu>Pb>Cr>As in the body of Labeo rohita and the tissues with the abundance were liver>gills>skin>muscles. Similarly, the sequence of heavy metal accumulation in Wallago attu was Fe>Zn>Cu>Ni>Cr>Pb>As, and the targeted tissues were gills>liver>skin>muscles. Heavy metal bioaccumulation was different in both species. Fe was the highest and As was the least accumulated heavy metal in both of these fish species. The tissues of Wallago attu accumulated higher concentrations of Ni (83%), Cu (64%), Cr (50%), Fe (2.95%), and Zn (26%) compared to tissues of Labeo rohita. However, Pb (67%) and As (22%) accumulation in tissues of Labeo rohita were higher compared to their concentrations in tissues of Wallago attu. Overall metal burden was 10% higher in Wallago attu compared to Labeo rohita. Heavy metal concentration in fish tissues were compared with FAO threshold values.					; yassar, abderrahim/T-6705-2017	Mahfooz, Yusra/0000-0002-9717-7931; 													1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	2					627	633		10.15244/pjoes/66850	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/66850													WOS:000399967900016

Remotely sensed surface water variations during drought and deluge conditions in a Northern Great Plains terminal lake basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Northern Great Plains (NGP) region, North Dakota, USAStudy focus: Understanding climate change impacts on surface water dynamics of permanent and seasonal water areas under drought to deluge conditions in the Devils Lake Basin (DLB) utilizing a high-resolution global surface water dataset (GSWD).New hydrologic insights: Four phases of dry and wet conditions were experienced in the DLB during the 1990-2018 study period: wetting (1990-1999), stable (2000-2003), recent wetting (2004-2013) and recent drying (2014-2018). A substantial transition from bare land to permanent and seasonal water area is observed during the wetting period (1990-99) while during the stable period (2000-2003), changes are barely observed despite NGP-wide drought. In the recent wetting period (2004-2013), a noticeable gain of permanent water from seasonal and bare land is observed. During the recent drying period (2014-2018), a significant loss of seasonal water area to bare land occurred. The difference between the spring and summer surface water areas is high during the recent wetting period (e.g., 2009, 2011, 2013), but much lower as the DLB approaches a drought condition. The inter-annual and intra-annual water dynamics of permanent and seasonal water areas show different rates of change and varying hydrological lags to changing hydroclimatic drivers and these changes are sensitive to basin antecedent conditions.

Climatic impacts on an Arctic lake since 1300 AD: a multi-proxy lake sediment reconstruction from Prins Karls Forland, Svalbard	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												On the remote Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, there is increasing evidence of environmental impacts from climate change. The analysis of lake sedimentary records can be used to assess how strongly these recent changes have altered lake ecosystems. Sediments deposited during the last millennium from Lake Blokkvatnet, Prins Karls Forland, were analysed using a multiproxy approach, including stable isotope and X-ray fluorescence analysis. The results were interpreted as reflecting variability of (1) soil organic matter inwash, and potentially catchment and lake primary production, and (2) catchment weathering and erosion. Organic content began increasing after 1920 AD to the present, likely in response to warming. Earlier peaks of a similar magnitude occurred on three occasions since 1300 AD, with evidence indicating that these may have coincided with multidecadal-scale periods with higher temperatures, reduced sea ice and negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation. Catchment weathering and fluvial erosion began to increase around 1800 AD and peaked during the early twentieth century, potentially due to rising temperatures in autumn and winter causing increased liquid water availability. The records suggest that similar levels of erosion and weathering occurred between approximately 1300 and 1600 AD, spanning the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age.					; Miettinen, Arto/AAG-2835-2019; Koinig, Karin/F-2542-2013; Kjellman, Sofia/ABF-4812-2020; Husum, Katrine/HGD-4711-2022	Husum, Katrine/0000-0003-1380-5900; Koinig, Karin/0000-0002-3659-4934; Kjellman, Sofia/0000-0003-1165-8601; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				MAR	2023	69	3					249	266		10.1007/s10933-022-00271-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-022-00271-8		OCT 2022											WOS:000876893600001

These observations have conventionally been lake water samples analyzed for a suite of physical and chemical parameters and are indicative of only the days or hours immediately before sampling. Monitoring approaches that sample a broader scope of limnological parameters over a continuous period are needed to augment existing strategies. A study of the seasonal changes to limnological parameters in Noell Lake was performed by analyzing continuous, hourly data collected from a series of automated and non-automated moorings over the period July 2012 to July 2013. Noell Lake was found to be strongly stratified throughout the open-water and under-ice seasons, with two prominent mixing periods in spring and fall. Processes of cryoconcentration and respiration intensified density-driven stratification while the lake is ice-covered, with the deep holes of Noell Lake becoming particularly saline and oxygen-depleted all year. Hypoxia was prevalent during the under-ice season because these physical and biogeochemical processes eliminated mixing from the lower lake depths while oxygen demand remained high. Use of continuous hourly monitoring facilitated improved understanding of the dynamical response of Noell Lake to atmospheric forcing.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				JUN	2018	71	2					149	166		10.14430/arctic4716	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic4716													WOS:000462920700004

Hydrological budget, carbon sources and biogeochemical processes in Lac Pavin (France): Constraints from δ18O of water and δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY					6th International Symposium on Applied Isotope Geochemistry	NOV 11-16, 2005	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					Lac Pavin (French Massif Central) is a permanently stratified lake: the upper water layers (mixolimnion, from 0 to 60 m depth) are affected by seasonal overturns, whereas the bottom water layers (monimolimnion, from 60 to 90 m depth) remain isolated and are never mixed. Hence, they are capable of storing important quantities of dissolved gases, mainly CO2. With the aim of better constraining the water balance and of gaining new insights into the carbon cycle of Lac Pavin, an isotopic approach is used. The delta O-18(H2O) profiles lead the authors to give a new evaluation of the evaporation flow rate (8 L s(-1)), and to propose and characterize two sub-surface springs. The sub-surface spring located at the bottom of the lake can be deduced from the 1% isotopic difference between the upper water layers (mean delta O-18(H2O) Value: -7.3 parts per thousand) and the bottom water layers (delta O-18(H2O) = -8.4 parts per thousand). It is argued that this sub-surface spring has isotopic and chemical characteristics similar to those of the magmatic CO2-rich spring (i.e. Fontaine Goyon, delta O-18(H2O) = -9.4%), and we calculate its flow rate of 1.6 L s(-1). The second sub-surface spring is located around 45 m depth, with a composition close to those of the water surface streams (delta O-18(H2O) < -7 6 parts per thousand). Methane (4 mM) and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations (approximate to 14 mM) allow the reestimation of the relative DIC contributions in the bottom of the lake (90 m depth): 1/3 deriving from methanogenesis (delta C-13(DIC) approximate to +7%) and 2/3 from the magmatic CO2-rich spring (delta C-13(DIC) approximate to -5 parts per thousand). Above 80 m depth, the variations in DIC concentrations (ranging from 0.5 to 10 mM) and delta C-13(DIC) values (ranging from -6.5 parts per thousand to 4.4 parts per thousand) are partly explained by the usual methanotrophy, organic matter oxidation, photosynthesis and CO2 equilibrium with atmosphere. The unusually high delta C-13(DIC) values in the upper water layers (ranging from -6 parts per thousand to 0 parts per thousand) compared to the expected delta C-13(DIC) values assuming only organic matter oxidation, demonstrate the leakage of 13C-enriched DIC from the bottom water layers of Lac Pavin (delta C-13(DIC) values ranging from -5 parts per thousand to 3 parts per thousand.).

J	Roesky, B; Hayashi, M				Roesky, Benjamin; Hayashi, Masaki			Effects of lake-groundwater interaction on the thermal regime of a sub-alpine headwater stream	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Stream thermal regimes are critical to the stability of freshwater habitats. There is growing concern that climate change will result in stream warming due to rising air temperatures, decreased shading in forested areas due to wildfires, and changes in streamflow. Groundwater plays an important role in controlling stream temperatures in mountain headwaters, where it makes up a considerable portion of discharge. This study investigated the controls on the thermal regime of a headwater stream, and the surrounding groundwater processes, in a catchment on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Groundwater discharge to the headwater spring is partially sourced by a seasonal lake. Spring, stream and lake temperature, water level, discharge and chemistry data were used to build a conceptual model of the system. Meteorological data was used to set up a stream temperature model. This study presents a unique example of an indirectly lake-headed stream, that is, a lake that only has transient subsurface hydrologic connections to the stream and no surface connections. The interaction of groundwater and lake water, and the subsurface connectivity between the lake and the headwater spring determine the resulting stream temperature. Radiation dominated the non-advective fluxes in the stream energy balance. Sensible and latent heat fluxes play a secondary role, but their effects generally cancel out. During snowfall events, the latent heat associated with melting of direct snowfall onto the water surface was responsible for rapid stream cooling. An increase in advective inputs from groundwater and hillslope pathways did not result in observed cooling of stream water during rainfall events. The results from this study will assist water resource and fisheries managers in adapting to stream temperature changes under a warming climate.					; Hayashi, Masaki/E-2600-2012	Roesky, Benjamin/0000-0002-6540-7149; Hayashi, Masaki/0000-0003-4890-3113													0885-6087	1099-1085				FEB	2022	36	2							e14501	10.1002/hyp.14501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14501													WOS:000760417000013
J	Martinsen, KT; Andersen, MR; Sand-Jensen, K				Martinsen, Kenneth Thoro; Andersen, Mikkel Rene; Sand-Jensen, Kaj			Water temperature dynamics and the prevalence of daytime stratification in small temperate shallow lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Small lakes are understudied compared to medium- and large-sized lakes, but have recently received increased attention due to their abundance and importance for global scale biogeochemical cycles. They have close terrestrial contact, extensive environmental variability, and support high biodiversity among them. Temporal and spatial variability of water temperature, oxygen, and stratification-mixing dynamics were examined during a year in nine small Danish lakes. We found that diel mean surface water temperatures were similar among lakes while the diel range decreased with increasing water depth. Vertical temperature stratification occurred on 47% of the days during the entire year and 64% of summer days, usually with daytime stratification and nocturnal convective mixing. The probability of daytime stratification increased with higher incident irradiance, higher air temperature, and lower wind speed. During spring, daytime stratification caused differences in oxygen saturation between surface and bottom waters. These findings offer new insights on the high variability of water temperature and oxygen in time and space in small temperate shallow lakes. The variable water temperature and the regular stratification-mixing processes will have a pronounced influence on biogeochemical cycles. Also, these features are expected to affect the performance and evolutionary process of organisms associated with small lakes.

J	Miyabuchi, Y; Hara, C				Miyabuchi, Yasuo; Hara, Chihoko			Temporal variations in discharge rate and component characteristics of tephra-fall deposits during the 2014-2015 eruption of Nakadake first crater, Aso Volcano, Japan	EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE												The 2014-2015 eruption of the Nakadake first crater at Aso Volcano in southwestern Japan was characterized by continuous ash emissions and intermittent strombolian eruptions. In this paper, we present the distribution, discharged mass, and components of tephra-fall deposits to examine the sequence of activities. We installed 21 ash samplers around the crater (SW crater rim to 9 km in all directions) and calculated the mass of ash-fall deposits based on 28 isomass maps. From November 25, 2014, to the end of January 2015, the cumulative erupted mass increased at a high discharge rate (2.2 x 10(4) tons/day). After February 2015, the cumulative erupted mass decreased to a low rate of 0.6 x 10(4) tons/day, although this rate rose slightly in March and late April 2015. The 2014-2015 tephra-fall deposits consisted of glass shards, crystal, and lithic grains. In the November 25-27, 2014 ash-fall deposits, lithic fragments, which are interpreted to be derived from lavas or pyroclasts of previous eruptions, were dominant (59-68%). Thereafter, the proportion of glass shards, which are probably juvenile materials of newly ascending magma, gradually increased with time, and the December 21-23, 2014 ash contained abundant glass grains (63%). The proportions of glass shards ranged from 29 to 50% until February 25, 2015. Subsequently, they decreased with time and reached 14% on March 17. Afterward, the proportions increased again prior to April 27 and ranged between 20 and 30% in May 2015. The total erupted tephra mass from the November 2014-May 2015 activity of Nakadake first crater was 2.1 x 10(6) tons (1.2 x 10(4) tons/day), which was less than the tephra deposits of previous activities that have occurred within the past few decades.

J	Kozak, A				Kozak, A			Seasonal changes occurring over four years in a reservoir's phytoplankton composition	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												In the period 1993-1996, the Maltanski Reservoir was found to host 233 phytoplankton taxa, belonging to 9 taxonomic classes. The most numerous were cyanobacteria. After regression of the Cyanobacteria-induced water blooming in the spring, chrysophytes, cryptophytes, green algae or diatoms were dominant. The remaining taxonomic groups were clearly less numerous. Changes in the number of a cells and of individual organisms and changes in the phytoplankton biomass were monitored in seasonal cycles. The shares of individual size fractions, i.e., of microplankton (> 60 mu m) and nanoplankton (2-60 mu m) in the total numerical force and biomass of phytoplankton were estimated. Considering the size structure of phytoplankton organisms, nanoplankton comprised 50-100%, particularly in the period between November, 1994 and April, 1995, as well as in the early summer (May, June). Microplankton prevailed in total numbers of organisms between April and October, in particular. High correlation were noted between the number of organisms, number of cells and biomass of phytoplankton on one hand and the physico-chemical parameters of water such as transparency, temperature, pH, BOD5 index, conductivity and total phosphorus on the other. This pointed to the role played by these parameters in the development of algae. On the other hand, dissolved phosphates, nitrite and ammonium nitrogen exerted no limiting effects on the development of phytoplankton.

J	Sweet, CW; Weiss, A; Vermette, SJ				Sweet, CW; Weiss, A; Vermette, SJ			Atmospheric deposition of trace metals at three sites near the Great Lakes	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The concentrations of vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in precipitation and on airborne particles were measured at three Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) monitoring stations on Lakes Superior, Michigan and Erie during 1993 and 1994. These data were used to estimate annual wet and dry deposition fluxes at these sites. In most cases, both wet and dry deposition make an important contribution to the total atmospheric flux of trace metals. Total (wet + dry) annual loadings of Zn and Cr are higher at the Lake Erie site than at the Lake Michigan and Lake Superior sites. Atmospheric loadings of the other metals are similar at all three sites. Wet deposition of metals is more closely related to precipitation amount than to the concentration of metals in the precipitation. Dry deposition fluxes are controlled by the concentration of trace metals on large particles. Total particle mass concentrations are higher during the summer and fall at the Lake Erie site, however no seasonal trends in total particle mass at the other sites or trace metals at any of the sites were detected. The total atmospheric loadings calculated in this work are in agreement with other estimates of metals deposition to the Great Lakes.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	1998	103	1-4					423	439		10.1023/A:1004905832617	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004905832617													WOS:000072601600025
J	Chen, XF; Shen, ZY; Yang, Y				Chen, Xiaofeng; Shen, Zhenyao; Yang, Ye			Response of the turbidity maximum zone in the Yangtze River Estuary due to human activities during the dry season	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The interaction between a river and the sea results in a turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) within the estuary, which has a great impact on the local ecosystem. In the Yangtze River Estuary, the magnitude and extent of the TMZ vary with water discharge. In this study, the cumulative human activity altered the water discharge regime from the river to the estuary. In the post-Three Gorges Dam (TGD) period, water discharge increased by 35.10 % at Datong in February compared with that in the pre-TGD period. The effects of water discharge variation on the characteristics of the TMZ were analyzed during spring and neap tidal periods using the three-dimensional environmental fluid dynamic code (EFDC) model. The area of the TMZ decreased by 3.11 and 17.39% during neap and spring tides, respectively. In addition, the upper limit of the TMZ moved 11.68 km seaward during neap tide, whereas the upper limit of the TMZ in the upstream and downstream areas moved seaward 9.65 and 2.34 km, respectively, during spring tide. These findings suggest that the area and location of the TMZ are more sensitive to upstream runoff during spring tide than during neap tide. These changes in the TMZ will impact the biochemical processes in the Yangtze River Estuary. In the foreseeable future, the distribution characteristic of TMZ will inevitably change due to variations in the Yangtze River discharge resulting from new human activities (i.e., new dams), which are being constructed upstream in the Yangtze River system.

However, the respective contributions of these two types of moisture are not clear. From June to September, the excess deuterium values of precipitation and river water in the Nam Co basin are higher than those for the southern Tibetan Plateau. This reflects the mixing of evaporation from Nam Co and local atmospheric vapor. On the basis of theory for estimating the contribution of evaporative vapor from surface water bodies to atmospheric vapor and relative stable isotopes in water bodies (precipitation, river water, atmospheric moisture and lake water), this study preliminarily estimates that the average contribution of evaporation from the Lake Nam Co to local atmospheric vapor has varied from 28.4% to 31.1% during the summer monsoon season in recent years.					丛, 志远/E-5237-2012; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018	Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005													1001-6538	1861-9541				MAY	2011	56	14					1511	1517		10.1007/s11434-011-4467-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4467-2													WOS:000290274400015

MBP has been found to occur in marine sediments. MBP in the sediments of the Yellow Sea and its coastal areas was measured by gas chromatography from 2004 to 2007. MBP levels in surface sediments were 0.19-38.24 ng kg(-1) in the shelf of the Yellow Sea, 0.34-17.15 ng kg(-1) in the Jiaozhou Bay, 2.11-71.79 ng kg(-1) in the Sanggou Bay and 0.28-319.32 ng kg(-1) in the rivers around the Jiaozhou Bay. High levels of MBP occurred in the northern and middle areas of the Yellow Sea. Obvious seasonal variation of MBP was observed in surface sediments of the Sanggou Bay, with the highest MBP level occurring in summer and the lowest in winter. MBP in surface sediments of the inner Jiaozhou Bay was higher than those in the outer region. MBP levels increased with depth in the top 5-10 cm sediments of the Jiaozhou Bay and on the intertidal flats. Environmental factors such as type of sediments, temperature, organic matter and human activity were found to affect the concentrations and distribution of MBP in marine sediments.

Development of predictive models for geosmin-related taste and odor in Kansas, USA, drinking water reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												The presence of taste and odor compounds can greatly reduce the quality of drinking water supplies. Because the monetary costs associated with the removal of these compounds can be high, it is impractical for most facilities to continuously treat their raw water. Instead, new tools are needed to help predict when taste and odor events may be most likely to occur. Water quality data were collected between June and October in 2006-2007 from five Kansas (USA) reservoirs in order to develop predictive models for geosmin, a major taste and odor compound; two of these reservoirs were also sampled during specific taste and odor events in December 2006 and January 2007. Lake trophic state alone was not a good predictor of geosmin concentrations as the highest average geosmin concentration was observed in the reservoir with the lowest nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations. In addition, taste and odor events were not confined to summer months; elevated geosmin concentrations were observed in several reservoirs during the winter. Growth limitation by inorganic phosphorus appeared to be the primary determinant of geosmin production by algal cells in these reservoirs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Moyo, NAG				Moyo, NAG			Aspects of the feeding ecology of Sargochromis codringtonii in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Sargochromis codringtonii has always been considered a good candidate for the biological control of snails. However, there is lack of data on the feeding ecology of this species. The diet of S. codringtonii was examined by an analysis of stomach contents. The food of adult S. codringtonii in Lake Kariba is dominated by prosobranch snails. Pulmonate snails form a small insignificant component of the diet of S. codringtonii, and the reasons for this are discussed. Electivity indices were used to investigate prey selection. S. codringtonii does not show a particular preference for any snail species. It feeds on any snail species that is readily available. A morphometrical analysis of the feeding structures of S. codringtonii showed that the fish is well adapted to handling a molluscivorous diet. The daily food consumption of S. codringtonii was estimated over different seasons using the Elliot & Persson (1978) model [J. Anim. Ecol.47,977-991]. Estimates of food consumption indicate that the fish consumed 14.0% of their dry body weight per day in summer and this falls to 4.5% in winter. The low consumption of pulmonates means that S. codringtonii cannot be a successful biological control agent against the vectors of schistosomiasis.

A comprehensive dataset with over 4600 water clarity maps, reconstructed from 2511 Landsat series images, was compiled. The water clarity changes of these 17 lakes have a clear seasonal variation pattern, with the highest in summer and the lowest in winter. Over the past 40 years, water clarity of 59 % lakes shows a downward trend, with Junshan Lake showing the highest decrease rate of -0.0231 m/yr. 41 % lakes water clarity are showing an upward trend. From 1984 to 1990, the highest average ZSD (Secchi disk depth) values were recorded in Changhu Lake, Junshan Lake, Honghu Lake, Futou Lake, and Gehu Lake. These lakes, however, experienced the most significant declines compared to period from 2021 to 2023. Chaohu Lake, Taihu Lake, Caizi Lake, and Nanyi Lake, which had the lowest average ZSD during 1984-1990, showed the most substantial increases. Analyzing the monthly distribution of water level and ZSD data reveals that water clarity exhibits different seasonal variations in relation to water levels. The comprehensive dataset and analysis provide a crucial scientific basis for informed water resource management and policy-making in the region.

S.; Laudon, Hjalmar; Lundmark, Tomas; Peichl, Matthias			The carbon balance of a managed boreal landscape measured from a tall tower in northern Sweden	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Boreal forests exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere. A managed boreal landscape usually comprises various potential CO2 sinks and sources across forest stands of varying age classes, clear-cut areas, mires, and lakes. Due to this heterogeneity and complexity, large uncertainties exist regarding the net CO2 balance at the landscape scale. In this study, we present the first estimate of the net CO2 exchange over a managed boreal landscape (similar to 68 km(2)) in northern Sweden, based on tall tower eddy covariance measurements. Our results suggest that from March 1, 2016 to February 28, 2018, the heterogeneous landscape was a net CO2 sink with a 2-year mean uptake of -87 +/- 6g C m(-2) yr(-1). Due to an earlier and warmer spring and sunnier autumn, the landscape was a stronger CO2 sink during the first year (-122 +/- 8g C m(-2)) compared to the second year (-52 +/- 9g C m(-2)). Footprint analysis shows that 87% of the CO2 flux measurements originated from forests, whereas mires, clear-cuts, lakes, and grassland contributed 11%, 1%, 0.7%, and 0.2%, respectively. Altogether, the CO2 sink strength of the heterogeneous landscape was up to 38% lower compared to the sink strength of a mature stand surrounding the tower. Overall, this study suggests that the managed boreal landscape acted as a CO2 sink and advocates tall tower eddy covariance measurements to improve regional carbon budget estimates.

The aim of these measurements was to investigate some of the physical processes in this small shallow lake during its ice-covered period. Detailed measurements of ice thickness and condition, snow thickness, water temperature, salt content, and currents were developed into a database. Within this database are the winters 1994/95 and 1995/96, which are characterized by a very sharp change between positive and negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This note investigates and compares the effects of these two NAO phases on the regional climate and their relation to the thermal regime of Lake Vendyurskoe. It became clear that the ice-covered period length did not vary much from one winter to the other; however, a large difference was observed in the maximum average ice cover thickness and in the average water temperature at ice formation ( e. g., larger thickness and colder water temperature during the 1995/ 96 winter).					; Uvo, Cintia/C-6060-2009	Bertacchi Uvo, Cintia/0000-0002-8497-0295; Ali Maher, Osama/0000-0002-0594-951X; 													1525-755X					OCT	2005	6	5					775	783		10.1175/JHM449.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM449.1													WOS:000233288800013
J	STROSS, RG				STROSS, RG			LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE REQUIREMENTS FOR DIAPAUSE DEVELOPMENT AND RELEASE IN DAPHNIA	ECOLOGY												The light and thermal requirements for diapause development and release in Daphnia pulex were determined for the ephippia from a pseudo-sexual strain cultured in the laboratory and from an autumnal diapausing, bisexual strain in Paul Lake, Michigan. Light was essential for termination of diapause in the laboratory-cultured strain regardless of the temperature or duration of ephippia storage. Ephippia from the lake population were activated by light, but prolonged storage in constant dark eliminated the requirement for light, thereby implicated photoperiodic control of diapause release. The laboratory population completed diapause development within a period of 3 to 6 weeks when stored in constant dark at 22[degree]C. Storage at 3.5[degree]C in constant dark prolonged diapause. In the Paul Lake strain, low temperature was a requirement for diapause development, and at 3.5[degree]C the eggs were in diapause for a period of 5 or 6 months. The contrasting light and thermal requirements are discussed in the context of environments regulating the duration of diapause in summer and winter diapausing populations of Daphnia.[long dash]Author.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1966	47	3					368	+		10.2307/1932977	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932977													WOS:A19668082200003

Samples examined consisted of spring migrants (o-ayu), fall migrants (ko-ayu), and juvenile residents in the lake at a predifferentiated stage. Compared to amphidromous fish, the landlocked fish, overall, were characterized by a lower genetic diversity that has resulted from lower haplotype diversity and a higher similarity in nucleotide sequences between haplotypes. Some nucleotide diversities that were unique to the samples showed that the landlocked ayu are not genetically homogeneous, suggesting the occurrence of a single metapopulation throughout the Biwa Lake system. The pairwise fixation index inferred different respective local populations for the o-ayu and ko-ayu ascending the same stream in the same year class, as well as the isolation by distance among local populations of ko-ayu, For conservation practices during transplantation with fish from non-native stocks, it should be taken into account that the Biwa Lake stocks have a high probability of not being genetically uniform.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				FEB	2002	68	1					138	143		10.1046/j.1444-2906.2002.00399.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1444-2906.2002.00399.x													WOS:000174244100018
J	Mckay, CP				Mckay, Christopher P.			Testing the Doran summer climate rules in Upper Wright Valley, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Based on data from low elevation lake sites, previous studies have suggested three quantitative relationships related to summer (December, January and February) air temperatures in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica: i) decrease with altitude at the dry lapse rate of 9.8 degrees C km(-1), ii) increase with distance from the coast at a rate of 0.09 degrees C km(-1), and iii) degree-days above freezing during the summer months is logarithmically proportional to the maximum summer air temperature. Here, we tested the first two of these rules at high elevation sites in Upper Wright Valley. Direct measurements confirmed that the summer lapse rate followed the dry lapse rate. For the three furthest stations, Tyrol Valley, Mount Fleming and Horseshoe Crater, the average difference between the measurements and the predicted summer monthly averages are -2.1 +/- 1.4 degrees C, -0.5 +/- 1.0 degrees C and -0.4 +/- 0.9 degrees C, respectively. By contrast, at Linnaeus Terrace (54 km from the coast) the monthly average is warmer than predicted by several degrees: +4.3 +/- 1.3 degrees C. The inland temperature gradient at these high elevation sites may result from sunlight effects rather than coastal wind as previously shown for the lower valleys. The warm conditions observed c. 50 km from the coast may reflect a zone affected by both sunlight and coastal wind.

Widespread infection of lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis with the swimbladder nematode Cystidicola farionis in northern lakes Michigan and Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We estimated the prevalence, intensity, and abundance of swimbladder nematode infection in 1281 lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) collected from four sites in northern lakes Huron (Cheboygan and DeTour Village) and Michigan (Big Bay de Noc and Naubinway) from fall 2003 through summer 2006. Morphological examination of nematode egg, larval, and mature stages through light and scanning electron microscopy revealed characteristics consistent with that of Cystidicola farionis Fischer 1798. Total C. farionis prevalence was 26.94%, while the mean intensity and abundance of infection was 26.72 and 7.21 nematodes/fish, respectively. Although we detected C. farionis in all four stocks that were examined, Lake Huron stocks generally had higher prevalence, intensity, and abundance of infection than Lake Michigan stocks. A distinct seasonal fluctuation in prevalence, abundance, and intensity of C. farionis was observed, which does not coincide with reported C. farionis development in other fish species. Lake whitefish that were heavily infected with C. farionis were found to have thickened swimbladder walls with deteriorated mucosa lining, which could affect swimbladder function. Whether C. farionis infection may be negatively impacting lake whitefish stocks in the Great Lakes is unclear; continued monitoring of C. farionis infection should be conducted to measure responses of lake whitefish stocks to infection levels.

J	Gillespie, R; Brook, BW				Gillespie, Richard; Brook, Barry W.			Is there a Pleistocene archaeological site at Cuddie Springs?	ARCHAEOLOGY IN OCEANIA												The juxtaposition of stone tools, charcoal and bones at Cuddie Springs has been used to support claims that people were butchering now-extinct animals, and grinding seeds about 30,000 BP. Statistical analysis of dates for the site shows significant sediment disturbance, and the anomalous presence of hair residues in the absence of bone collagen suggests that bones and stone tools are not the same age. We argue that the published studies on the Cuddie Springs claypan deposits do not show a stratified and undisturbed Late Pleistocene archaeological site, as proposed by the excavators, instead revealing a palimpsest of Late Holocene and European occupational debris superimposed on a much longer-term record of Quaternary landscape evolution. There is no reliable evidence that extinct Australian megafauna coexisted with people using seed-grinding technology at Cuddie Springs, nullifying the excavators' support for climate change models of extinction and dietary choice.

The lake is a warm monomitic water body of low conductivity (82 .mu.jS cm-1) and a high seasonal water column stability. The waters are oligotrophic, with epilimnetic dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations typically <1 mg m-3. The concentration of NO3-N is seasonally variable but generally high in winter and spring with maximum epilimnetic values approaching 70 mg m-3. This contrasts with other central North Island lakes. Horizontal variability in surface chlorophyll a is low as are the absolute values ( < 1- 2 mg m-3). A notable feature is the formation of a deep chlorophyll maximum within the metalimnion comprised largely of Sphaerocystis schroeteri as opposed to diatoms and flagellates which normally dominate the epilimnion. Vascular macrophytes (maximum biomass 659 g m-2 dry weight) extended to 9 m and characeans (maximum biomass 447 g m-2 dry weight) to 16 m. Total phytoplankton primary production was calculated as 4524 t C y-1 and macrophyte production as 578 t C y-1. The proportion of macrophyte to phytoplankton production (0.14) is higher than in the other deep lakes of the central North Island.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Howard-Williams, Clive/0000-0002-8323-6806													0028-8330	1175-8805					1986	20	4					583	597		10.1080/00288330.1986.9516179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1986.9516179													WOS:A1986H418400007

Unionid shells (Hyriopsis cumingii) record manganese cycling at the sediment-water interface in a shallow eutrophic lake in China (Lake Taihu)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Aquatic eutrophication is becoming a serious environmental problem throughout the world. The utility of bi-valves as bio-filters to improve water quality and reduce algal blooms has been widely acknowledged, but the potential usefulness of bivalve shells as retrospective monitors of eutrophication-induced environmental change has received little attention. Here, we present the first multi-year, high-resolution Mn/Ca-shell records of the freshwater mussel, Hyriopsis cumingii (Lea, 1852) from a shallow eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China). Mn/Ca-shell time series of the two studied shells exhibit a high degree of synchrony after being placed in a precise temporal context by means of growth pattern analysis. There is a large inter-annual variability of Mn/Casheii records during 20112015, with the highest value occurring in 2013. Mn/Ca-shell also displays a pronounced intra-annual variability with maxima consistently occurring during late spring/early summer. The high reproducibility of Mn/Ca-shell time-series among contemporaneous specimens highlights the existence of strong environmental rather than biological control on the incorporation of Mn into the shells. In particular, the striking feature of late spring/early summertime Mn/Cashell maxima is synchronous with the occurrence of reducing conditions beneath the sediment-water interface (SWI). The latter results in substantial increases of biologically available Mn2+ in the sediment pore water and organic particles, the element being rapidly taken up from these sources by the mussels with subsequent incorporation of Mn into their shells. Therefore, Mn/Ca-shell can potentially serve as a high-resolution proxy of the mobility of Mn at the SWI. As demonstrated by the present study, documenting and understanding geochemical properties of bivalve shells can help to retrospectively monitor eutrophication-induced environmental change in aquatic ecosystems.

J	Ganor, E; Foner, HA; Gravenhorst, G				Ganor, E; Foner, HA; Gravenhorst, G			The amount and nature of the dustfall on Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee), Israel: flux and fractionation	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The dustfall flux on Lake Kinneret, Israel was measured by a network of 15 sampling stations around the lake over a 3 year period, with partial measurements over a further 2 years. The dustfall was characterized by dividing it into fractions including inorganic water insoluble matter (IWI), i.e. insoluble minerals; inorganic water soluble matter (IWS); and total organic matter (TORG). The total dustfall was fairly constant over the years with a mean input of 12,000 t on the 170 km(2) lake surface. The proportion of atmospheric input to total solids entering the lake is inversely dependent on the amount of rain in a particular year and varied between 17% and 46% (mean = 34%). The dustfall is composed of roughly equal proportions of TORG, IWI and IWS. The organic matter itself is about 50% water soluble. The most variable fraction of the dustfall is the insoluble mineral content (IWI) which is dependent on violent dust storms usually occurring in spring and autumn. The amount of aeolian matter entering the lake is sufficiently large, compared to the fluvial input, to have a significant effect on the water quality. Much of the dustfall entering the lake is more finely divided than the fluvial suspended matter and this will presumably increase its relative effect. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Invader invaded: population dynamics of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) in polymictic Oneida Lake, NY, USA (1992-2013)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasive zebra (ZM) and quagga (QM) mussels continue to spread within and across inland waters worldwide. Oneida Lake, NY, USA, is a large (207km(2)), mesotrophic, polymictic lake surveyed annually for dreissenids across substrates since 1992. We estimated abundance and distribution of ZMs and QMs across substrates, calculated lakewide density and biomass, analyzed seasonal and annual differences in veliger density, and explored dynamics of species replacement. ZMs and QMs were detected in 1991 and 2005, respectively. ZM density peaked at almost 30,000 ind/m(2) in 1992, declined to between 2600 and 7600 ind/m(2) until 2008, and further declined to 370-560 ind/m(2) in 2010-2013 concurrent with increasing QM abundance. ZM biomass remained stable from 1992 to 2008 (140-530g shell-on dry wt/m(2)) but declined to<10g from 2010 to 2013. QMs increased from 38% of the total biomass in 2008 to90% from 2010 to 2013 which was accompanied by a decrease in ZM lengths and increase in QM lengths. In shallow (<9m) waters, both mussels were more abundant on rock than sand and silt substrate. Only QMs were abundant in deep silt substrate. The shift from ZM to QM dominance increased total biomass, but not density, due to larger QMs. Veliger densities were higher in May and August-November after arrival of QMs; however, there was no correlation between number of veligers and new recruits in fall or adult mussel biomass. The replacement of ZM occurred over about 4years even though published mechanisms for QM dominance are not operating in summer in Oneida Lake.

The influence of mixing on seasonal carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in ponds	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Inland waters are important sources of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Ponds have amongst the highest CO2 and CH4 fluxes of all aquatic ecosystems, yet seasonal variation in fluxes remain poorly characterized, creating challenges for accurately estimating annual emissions. Further, ponds can exhibit a range of mixing regimes, yet the impact of mixing regimes on gas emissions remains unclear. Here, we assessed annual dynamics of CO2 and CH4 in four temperate ponds (Minnesota, USA) that varied in mixing regimes. The ponds ranged from annual sinks to sources of CO2 (-1 to 15 mol m(-2) yr(-1)) and were all significant sources of CH4 (4.3-8.2 mol m(-2) yr(-1)), with annual fluxes in CO2 equivalents of 1.8-4.1 kg CO2-eq. m(-2) yr(-1). Mixing regimes impacted CO2 and CH4 dynamics, as stratified periods were associated with more anoxia, greater accumulation of gases in the bottom waters, higher emissions of CH4, and lower fluxes of CO2. Ponds with stronger summer stratification also had increased CO2 and CH4 fluxes associated with fall turnover. Overall, the two ponds with the strongest stratification had higher annual fluxes (2.6, 4.1 kg CO2-eq. m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to the two ponds that more frequently mixed (1.8, 2.2 kg CO2-eq. m(-2) yr(-1)).					; Cotner, James/D-8799-2013	Rabaey, Joseph/0000-0002-9649-4855; Cotner, James/0000-0001-9792-467X													0168-2563	1573-515X				OCT	2024	167	10					1297	1314		10.1007/s10533-024-01167-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-024-01167-7		AUG 2024											WOS:001295749300001

Mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates, rotifers and microcrustaceans, and important ecological parameters were sampled during a 1-year study. The results showed a low biodiversity with only a few dominant species in every zooplankton group. Three mixotrophic ciliates Stentor araucanus, S. amethystinus and Ophtydium naumanni - were found. They peaked in summer and autumn with maximum values of 152-313 Ind L-1 (Stentor) and 1880 Ind L-1 (Ophrydium). Their contribution to the total ciliate abundance was 16 +/- 17% (annual average). Both Stentor species displayed a distinct vertical zonation during the stratification period with peak depth between 10 and 15 m (metalimnion). The contribution to total zooplankton biomass was 59.4% on an annual average (Stentor: 41%, O. naumanni: 18.4%) and 83% during the stratification period. Both abundance and biomass of mixotrophic ciliates correlated strongly with temperature and to a lesser degree with copepods, rotifers and small cladocerans. According to this study mixotrophic ciliates were by far the dominant zooplankton group in Lake Caburgua. We report for the first time the importance of O. naumanni in a deep Chilean North Patagonian lake. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The most probable number (MPN) for coliform bacteria varied from 0.59 .times. 105-3.61 .times. 105/100 ml, being highest in the monsoon season and lowest in spring. The water was alkaline. The concentrations of dissolved O2 showed high values near the surface and low ones in the bottom waters. BOD [biochemical O2 demand] values were 6.0 mg/l. The concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P varied from 0.100-0.750 mg/l and 0.018-0.153 mg/l, respectively. These concentrations caused blooming of certain phytoplankters on occasion. The values of NH3-N fluctuated from 0.033-0.422 mg/l, being highest in winter and lowest in the monsoon mo. Among the metallic ions, the values of Pb and Mn were higher than permissible limits. The bottom sediments of the lake also produced toxic gases such as CH4, H2S and NH3. Most carp, such as Cyprinus carpio specularis, Tor tor and Schizothorax spp., were infected with Saprolegnia or other fungi or with trematodes. Certain phytoplankters (Microcystis, Anabaena, etc.), zooplankters (Bursaria, Spirostomum, Philodina, etc.) and macrobenthos (Tubifex tubifex, Limnodrilus sp., Chironomus plumosus, etc.), were abundant. Macrobenthic species were absent from the profundal zone of the lake which showed all the important characteristics of pollution.

We used a carbon-based food web model of Lake Pavin (Massif Central, France) to investigate the effects of chytrids during the spring diatom bloom by developing models with and without chytrids. Linear inverse modelling procedures were employed to estimate undetermined flows in the lake. The Monte Carlo Markov chain linear inverse modelling procedure provided estimates of the ranges of model-derived fluxes. Model results support recent theories on the probable impact of parasites on food web function. In the lake, during spring, when 'inedible' algae (unexploited by planktonic herbivores) were the dominant primary producers, the epidemic growth of chytrids significantly reduced the sedimentation loss of algal carbon to the detritus pool through the production of grazer-exploitable zoospores. We also review some theories about the potential influence of parasites on ecological network properties and argue that parasitism contributes to longer carbon path lengths, higher levels of activity and specialization, and lower recycling. Considering the "structural asymmetry" hypothesis as a stabilizing pattern, chytrids should contribute to the stability of aquatic food webs.					; GRAMI, Boutheina/MBV-6366-2025; Niquil, Nathalie/N-2561-2013; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	GRAMI, Boutheina/0000-0001-5537-4817; Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Niquil, Nathalie/0000-0002-0772-754X; Rasconi, Serena/0000-0001-6667-8904; Saint-Beat, Blanche/0000-0002-2401-2052; 													1932-6203					AUG 22	2011	6	8							e23273	10.1371/journal.pone.0023273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023273								21887240					WOS:000294251800009

Real Time Observation of the Thermal Bar and Spring Stratification of Lake Michigan with the GLUCOS Coastal Observatory	OCEANS 2008, VOLS 1-4	OCEANS-IEEE				OCEANS 2008 Conference	SEP 15-18, 2008	Quebec City, CANADA	IEEE				During the spring of 2008 a subset of the WATER Institute's Great Lakes Urban Coastal Observing System (GLUCOS) was deployed to demonstrate the ability of the observatory to remotely monitor, in real time, the seasonal transition from a mixed state to a stratified state in coastal Lake Michigan. A prominent feature of this transition is the spring thermal front, also known as the thermal bar, a boundary of 4 degrees C water that extends from top to bottom and separates near-shore stratified water from colder, mixed water further off-shore. Three Pioneer II buoys were deployed in a west to east line at 20m, 40m and 60m depths and at distances of 2 km, 6 km and 12 km from shore respectively. Each buoy was equipped with a string of temperature sensors spaced one meter apart from the bottom to about 3 meters below the surface. The buoys communicated with a shore station using 900 MHz radio modems. An Internet connection was established between the WATER Institute and the buoys via the shore station permitting two-way communication for real-time data retrieval and control of the buoys. The spring thermal transition was remotely observed at the 20 in buoy along with its characteristic 4 degrees C thermal bar. This paper will present the data on the spring thermal evolution of the lake as measured by the GLUCOS observatory and will describe the design of the new Pioneer II buoy that made-up the buoy array for this experiment.																			0197-7385		978-1-4244-2619-5				2008							1338	1346																WOS:000265654501029

Mid-Holocene vegetation history of the central Mediterranean	HOLOCENE												This paper provides a synthesis of available palynological data from central Mediterranean lacustrine records, studying the causes of the important vegetation changes which occurred in the mid Holocene. They are illustrated by seven well-dated records, lakes Accesa, Mezzano, Vico, and Pergusa in Italy, Maliq, Voulkaria and Malo J. in the Balkans. A good tool for disentangling climate change and human impact is the combined interpretation of pollen percentage and concentration/influx data. Pollen concentration/influx drops are an indication of increased erosion in the catchment, mainly ascribable to forest reduction. There is no doubt that major synchronous changes could not have been caused by humans alone. Many southern European records show substantial differences between early- and late-Holocene vegetation, suggesting a general evolution from wetter to drier climatic conditions, in agreement with arid phases recognised by other, independent palaeoclimatic methods. Other pollen records show a different trend. The role of changing seasonality seems important for this region of the Mediterranean. Precipitation seasonality increased during the early to mid Holocene with winter precipitation attaining a maximum, and summer precipitation a minimum. At least three rapid climate events with changes in plant biomass are in evidence: an abrupt and short change around 8200 yr BP, another one centred around 6000 yr BP, and one soon after 3000 yr BP. From the beginning of the Bronze Age (c. 4400 yr BP in this region) human impact overlapped with a climate change, probably bipartite, towards dryness. Our results show that this aridification trend began around 8000 yr BP, and culminated around 4000 yr BP.

GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Analyses of the effects of extreme climate periods have been used as a tool to predict ecosystem functioning and processes in a warmer world. The winter half-year 2006/2007 (w06/07) has been extremely warm and was estimated to be a half-a-millennium event in central Europe. Here we analyse the consequences of w06/07 for the temperatures, mixing dynamics, phenologies and population developments of algae and daphnids (thereafter w06/07 limnology) in a deep central European lake and investigate to what extent analysis of w06/07 limnology can really be used as a predictive tool regarding future warming. Different approaches were used to put the observations during w06/07 into context: (1) a comparison of w06/07 limnology with long-term data, (2) a comparison of w06/07 limnology with that of the preceding year, and (3) modelling of temperature and mixing dynamics using numerical experiments. These analyses revealed that w06/07 limnology in Lake Constance was indeed very special as the lake did not mix below 60 m depth throughout winter. Because of this, anomalies of variables associated strongly with mixing behaviour, e.g., Schmidt stability and a measure for phosphorus upward mixing during winter exceeded several standard deviations the long-term mean of these variables. However, our modelling results suggest that this extreme hydrodynamical behaviour was only partially due to w06/07 meteorology per se, but depended also strongly on the large difference in air temperature to the previous cold winter which resulted in complete mixing and considerable cooling of the water column. Furthermore, modelling results demonstrated that with respect to absolute water temperatures, the model 'w06/07' most likely underestimates the increase in water temperature in a warmer world as one warm winter is not sufficient to rise water temperatures in a deep lake up to those expected under a future climate.

In Lake SHL, F-bSO(2) is positively correlated with the inflow of nutrient-rich groundwater. Since groundwater inflow is mainly fed by seepage of summer monsoon rainfall, F-bSiO(2) documents changes in summer monsoon strength. Summer monsoon rainfall was enhanced in the early Holocene around 9800 and 7800 cal. yr BR Groundwater inflow during these periods did not reach the high level of the Lateglacial warm period (c. 14 300-12 500 cal. yr BP) when the vicinity of he lake was less densely covered with woody vegetation than in the Holocene. Aeolian influx of siltsized debris was relatively higher during an overall drier period between 9500 and 8000 cal. yr BP. A mid-Holocene sedimentation interval with distinct century-scale variability in summer monsoon rainfall documents a positive correlation between rainfall and siliciclastic influx that reflects a more efficient removal of mineral aerosols for increased rainfall at an overall high dust concentration over the Asian continent. Summer monsoon rainfall reached minima around 6400, 4900, 3700 and 2200 cal. yr BP.

In this study, we examined virus-induced mortality of heterotrophic bacteria over a 10-month period and throughout the water column in two lakes of the French Massif Central, the oligomesotrophic Lake Pavin and the eutrophic Lake Aydat. Concurrently, we estimated nonviral mortality through heterotrophic nanoflagellate and ciliate bacterivory. Overall, viral infection parameters were much less variable than bacterial production. We found that the frequency of visibly infected cells (FVIC), estimated using transmission electron microscopy, peaked in both lakes at the end of spring ( May to June) and in early autumn (September to October). FVIC values were significantly higher in Lake Pavin (mean [M] = 1.6%) than in Lake Aydat (M = 1.1%), whereas the opposite trend was observed for burst sizes, which averaged 25.7 and 30.2 virus particles bacterium(-1), respectively. We detected no significant depth-related differences in FVIC or burst size. We found that in both lakes the removal of bacterial production by flagellate grazing (M-Pavin = 37.7%, M-Aydat = 18.5%) was nearly always more than the production removed by viral lysis (M-Pavin = 16.2%, M-Aydat = 19%) or ciliate grazing (M-Pavin = 2.7%, M-Aydat = 8.8%). However, at specific times and locations, viral lysis prevailed over protistan grazing, for example, in the anoxic hypolimnion of Lake Aydat. In addition, viral mortality represented a relatively constant mortality source in a bacterial community showing large variations in growth rate and subject to large variations in loss rates from grazers. Finally, although viruses did not represent the main agent of bacterial mortality, our data seem to show that their relative importance was higher in the less productive system.					; Dolan, John/A-4513-2009; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019; Bettarel, Yvan/L-2691-2017	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Dolan, John/0000-0002-9454-1355; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				MAY	2004	70	5					2941	2951		10.1128/AEM.70.5.2941-2951.2004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.5.2941-2951.2004								15128555					WOS:000221340400051

Migratory stopover in the long-distance migrant silver-haired bat, Lasionycteris noctivagans	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Some bat species make long-distance latitudinal migrations between summer and winter grounds, but because of their elusive nature, few aspects of their biology are well understood. The need for migratory stopover sites to rest and refuel, such as used by birds, has been repeatedly suggested, but not previously tested empirically in bats. 2. We studied migrating silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) at Long Point, ON, Canada. We used digital radio-transmitters to track 30 bats using an array of five towers that effectively covered the entire region (c. 20 x 40 km). We measured stopover duration and departure direction, and documented movement patterns, foraging activity and roost sites. We measured body composition on arrival using quantitative magnetic resonance and simulated long-distance migration using observed body composition to predict migration range and rate. 3. Migration occurred in two waves (late August and mid-September). Most bats stayed 1-2 days, although two remained >2 weeks. One third of the bats foraged while at the site, many foraging opportunistically on nights when rain precluded continued migration. Bats roosted in a variety of tree species and manmade structures in natural and developed areas. Half of the bats departed across Lake Erie (minimumcrossing distance c. 38 km) while half departed along the shoreline. 4. Simulations predicted a migration rate of c. 250-275 km per day and suggest that all but one of the bats in our study carried sufficient fuel stores to reach the putative wintering area (estimated distance 1500 km) without further refuelling. 5. Our results suggest that migrating bats stopover for sanctuary or short-term rest as opposed to extended rest and refuelling as in many songbirds. Daily torpor could reduce energy costs when not in flight, minimizing the need for extended stopovers and allowing bats to potentially complete their migration at a fraction of the time and energy cost of similar sized birds.

Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of bacterial communities employing next-generation sequencing analysis and multivariate statistical analyses from the Lancang River cascade reservoirs during summer and winter. We found that sediment bacterial composition has a significant seasonal turnover due to the modification of cascade reservoirs operation mode, and the spatial consistency of biogeographical models (including distance-decay relationship and covariation of community composition with geographical distance) also has subtle changes. The linear regression between the dissimilarity of bacterial communities in sediments, geographical and environmental distance showed that the synergistic effects of geographical and environmental factors explained the influence on bacterial communities. Furthermore, the environmental difference explained little variations (19.40%) in community structure, implying the homogeneity of environmental conditions across the cascade reservoirs of Lancang River. From the quantification of the ecological process, the homogeneous selection was recognized as the dominating factor of bacterial community assembly. The co-occurrence topological network analyses showed that the key genera were more important than the most connected genera. In general, the assembly of bacterial communities in sediment of cascade reservoirs was mediated by both deterministic and stochastic processes and is always dominated by homogeneous selection with the seasonal switching, but the effects of dispersal limitation and ecological drift cannot be ignored.																			0095-3628	1432-184X				FEB	2023	85	2					586	603		10.1007/s00248-022-01999-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-022-01999-6		MAR 2022						35338380					WOS:000773182600001

While initially rare, from 2004 onwards it was present in the plankton continuously, forming massive blooms in spring (2005, 2006, 2012) or in winter (2010), occasionally appearing in different morphological and life cycle forms. Mougeotia maintained its population under a wide range of water temperatures, nutrient concentrations, solar radiation, pH levels and stratification patterns, making it a highly versatile alga. In multiple regression, year and month as the only predictors explained 36% of the pattern of Mougeotia biomass. However, Mougeotia biomass could not be explained by any of the environmental parameters considered. Modeling the temporal dynamics of Mougeotia biomass using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA(1,0,0)) explained 56% of variability indicating that intraspecific factors (e.g., competition for nutrients or self-shading) may determine the dynamics of Mougeotia biomass. To explain the lack of relationships with the environmental parameters, we hypothesize that (1) Mougeotia possesses exceptional physiological plasticity and/or (2) Lake Kinneret may host two or more genetically distinct cryptic species of Mougeotia with different environmental niches. Both explanations may hinder any inference on Mougeotia-environment relationships and require confirmation by experimental work.					; Obertegger, Ulrike/A-8254-2010	Zohary, Tamar/0000-0002-9615-6469; Obertegger, Ulrike/0000-0002-4057-9366													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2019	831	1			SI		87	100		10.1007/s10750-018-3522-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3522-2													WOS:000458372800008
J	Gouramanis, C; De Deckker, P; Switzer, AD; Wilkins, D				Gouramanis, Chris; De Deckker, Patrick; Switzer, Adam D.; Wilkins, Daniel			Cross-continent comparison of high-resolution Holocene climate records from southern Australia - Deciphering the impacts of far-field teleconnections	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Several well-dated and high-resolution, multi-proxy Holocene palaeodimatic records have recently emerged that permit a cross-continent comparison of climatic changes in Australia. This synthesis seeks to compare these records with recently published records from southern Australia and investigate the role of far-field teleconnections that have played in the mid to late Holocene climatic history of the region. The modern climate of southeastern Australia (SEA) is influenced by the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Annular Mode (IOS-SAM), the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and contrasts with southwestern Australia (SWA), which is predominantly influenced by variations in the IOS-SAM. Both regions have undergone a period of increasing aridity through the second half of the Holocene in response to the southerly migration of the mean position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the southerly migration of the IOS-SAM. Comparison of the palaeorecords stemming from both SEA and SWA suggests that the SWA record differs from the climate recorded from SEA from approximately 5.6 ka. This difference is ascribed to an increased influence of large-scale climate drivers including the IOD and ENSO variability in SEA, which have negligible impact on the climate of SWA. Throughout the Holocene, the southerly migration of the ITCZ results in a weaker Asian summer monsoon. However, the rate of Asian summer monsoon weakening slowed during the middle Holocene and this coincides with a larger sea-surface temperature gradient across the equatorial Indian Ocean that resulted in a prolonged mode of positive IOD and a period of significantly increased evaporation in SEA. Those phenomena engendered a general decline in the lake levels in SEA, which is not seen in SWA as this region was not significantly affected by the IOD throughout the Holocene. This positive IOD period lasted until similar to 4.3 ka, before a return to the strengthening (weakening) of the Australian (Asian) summer monsoon conditions that resulted in a southward shift of the ITCZ during the austral winter. The southerly shift in the ITCZ was associated with a more southerly mean position of the IOS-SAM and drier conditions for SEA and SWA. The climate affecting SEA after 43 ka coincides with an increasing incidence and strengthening of the El Nino (non-El Nino or La Nina) mode coupled with positive (negative) modes of the IOD that resulted in a net deficit (excess) of water. The driest phase in SEA occurs at ca. 1.8 ka, when far-field palaeoclimate records indicate a peak in El Nino intensity, although the impact of the IOD cannot be discounted. Conversely, both the IOD and ENSO phenomena do not affect the climate of SWA, thus leading to significant differences in the climate across the southern margin of the Australian continent.

Endogenous origin of foams in lakes: a long-term analysis for Lake Maggiore (northern Italy)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The formation of foams on lakes is a complex phenomenon whose origin is often hardly identifiable. Recently (2007, 2008, and 2010) foam episodes started to occur in Lake Maggiore, northern Italy. The present work aimed to verify the hypothesis of an endogenous-natural origin of these foams, driven by trophic or climatic changes. To this purpose, a long-term (2000-2013) analysis of phytoplankton biovolumes, meteorological, and hydrological data has been performed together with the chemical characterization of foams. Foams resulted of endogenous origin and likely related to phytoplankton biomass degradation. Data analysis highlighted atypical warm temperature and residual lake stratification in winter in two of the three years of foam events, coupled with exceptional Bacyllariophyceae blooms in spring. Tabellaria flocculosa mostly contributed in terms of biomass in 2007 and 2008, but not in 2010; thus overall algal biomass seemed a better predictor of the risk of foam formation. Foam events occurred from July to December, driven by atypically windy conditions, and congruently with the time needed to degrade biomass into surface-active compounds. Aco-occurrence of different factors resulted essential to generate foams, and climate changes likely contribute to enhance their occurrence in Lake Maggiore.

The aims were to find factors that limit production of young and cause changes in density of breeding ducks of several species. We estimated numbers of ducks in spring, before nesting, numbers of ducklings produced, and numbers moulting. Chironomid and simuliid dipterans were monitored with window traps. In all duck species studied, production of young was correlated with food abundance. Reproductive performance determined subsequent changes in spring population density of Eurasian Wigeon, Tufted Duck, Greater Scaup, Common Scoter and Harlequin Duck. The spring population of Barrow's Goldeneye apparently did not respond to variation in reproductive success. Moulting numbers of male Tufted Duck were related to chironomid abundance, but not those of Scaup and Barrow's Goldeneye. Moulting numbers were not associated with previous reproductive output.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 1	1994	279						15	27		10.1007/BF00027837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027837													WOS:A1994NK39900003
J	DeMarco, K; Couvillion, B; Brown, S; La Peyre, M				DeMarco, Kristin; Couvillion, Brady; Brown, Stuart; La Peyre, Megan			Submerged aquatic vegetation mapping in coastal Louisiana through development of a spatial likelihood occurrence (SLOO) model	AQUATIC BOTANY												Determining the spatial distribution of coastal foundation species is essential to accurately determine restoration goals, predict the ecological effects of climate change, and develop habitat management strategies. Mapping the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) species assemblages, which provide important habitat resource and ecological services in Louisiana, has been difficult due to the dynamic nature of SAV occurrence and the limited water clarity across much of the coast. Species distribution models (SDMs) link ecological conditions species occurrence across landscapes, and can predict the distribution of species across un-sampled or hard to sample areas and support the development of habitat maps. To predict SAV distribution in coastal Louisiana, a SDM was developed and projected across the landscape to create a spatial likelihood of occurrence (SLOO) model describing the probability of SAV presence in aquatic habitats. SAV presence and absence data were examined from over 500 field observations in relation to physical and hydrologic variables, including exposure, turbidity, water level, and salinity. A binary logistic regression model (p < 0.0001) identified three significant predictors of SAV presence: mean winter salinity, exposure, and turbidity. As each of these variables increased, the probability of SAV presence in the summer growing season decreased. The spatial application of this SDM helps to predict the likelihood of occurrence across the coastal landscape, creating a valuable tool to describe unsampled SAV habitat and estimate future changes in habitat availability.

For this purpose, a total of 33 time series of water temperature representing lakes, vaucluse springs and streams were analysed using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The periodicity analysis were conducted with the Morlet wavelet on hourly sampled data covering a period of 5 years. The principal components analysis (PCA) has been applied to describe the relationships among variables and extract potential sources of water temperature variability. The results showed an extremely high heterogeneity in temporal patterns of water temperature fluctuations among streams when compared to lakes and vaucluse springs. Wavelet analysis of water temperature time series revealed the presence of seven different configurations of periodical patterns. The lowest variability was observed among vaucluse springs that are supplied by groundwaters. Temporal fluctuations of water temperature in lakes contained four different types of oscillations. Streams were among the most diversified in terms of water temperature patterns exhibiting low, medium and high frequency behaviour. The PCA analysis confirmed the dependence of water temperature on weather conditions, catchment characteristics and flow rate explaining 88.97% of the total variability in the data. The results obtained from this study emphasize the importance of continuous data collection for capturing the long-term dynamics and consistent temporal patterns in time series. The study also demonstrates that wavelet analysis is helpful to identify cyclical patterns in time series of water temperature, and therefore may be useful in the classification of thermal regimes in surface waters.

We discovered several underwater fresh to brackish water springs in the Dead Sea harboring dense microbial communities. We provide the first characterization of these communities, discuss their possible origin, hydrochemical environment, energetic resources and the putative biogeochemical pathways they are mediating. Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and community fingerprinting methods showed that the spring community originates from the Dead Sea sediments and not from the aquifer. Furthermore, it suggested that there is a dense Archaeal community in the shoreline pore water of the lake. Sequences of bacterial sulfate reducers, nitrifiers iron oxidizers and iron reducers were identified as well. Analysis of white and green biofilms suggested that sulfide oxidation through chemolitotrophy and phototrophy is highly significant. Hyperspectral analysis showed a tight association between abundant green sulfur bacteria and cyanobacteria in the green biofilms. Together, our findings show that the Dead Sea floor harbors diverse microbial communities, part of which is not known from other hypersaline environments. Analysis of the water's chemistry shows evidence of microbial activity along the path and suggests that the springs supply nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter to the microbial communities in the Dead Sea. The underwater springs are a newly recognized water source for the Dead Sea. Their input of microorganisms and nutrients needs to be considered in the assessment of possible impact of dilution events of the lake surface waters, such as those that will occur in the future due to the intended establishment of the Red Sea-Dead Sea water conduit.

APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The cyanobacterium Microeystis sp. frequently develops water blooms consisting of organisms with different genotypes that either produce or lack the hepatotoxin microcystin. In order to monitor the development of microcystin (mcy) genotypes during the seasonal cycle of the total population, mcy genotypes were quantified by means of real-time PCR in Lake Warmsee (Berlin, Germany) from June 1999 to October 2000. Standard curves were established by relating cell concentrations to the threshold cycle (the PCR cycle number at which the fluorescence passes a set threshold level) determined by the Taq nuclease assay (TNA) for two gene regions, the intergenic spacer region within the phycocyanin (PC) operon to quantify the total population and the mcyB gene, which is indicative of microcystin synthesis. In laboratory batch cultures, the cell numbers inferred from the standard curve by TNA correlated significantly with the microscopically determined cell numbers on a logarithmic scale. The TNA analysis of 10 strains revealed identical amplification efficiencies for both genes. In the field, the proportion of mcy genotypes made up the smaller part of the PC genotypes, ranging from 1 to 38%. The number of mcyB genotypes was one-to-one related to the number of PC genotypes, and parallel relationships between cell numbers estimated via the inverted microscope technique and TNA were found for both genes.

Sm. were studied using the litter bag method in the field. The organic weight loss during breakdown was described by means of 1 simple and 2 composite exponential models. The N, P and K concentrations of the remaining detritus were analyzed. The composite exponential models fitted the decay data better than the simple exponential function. It was difficult to interpret the individual estimates of the composite exponential models in terms of overall decay. The patterns of organic weight loss and nutrient dynamics of decomposing N. lutea depended on which part of the plant was being studied. The aboveground plant parts showed a faster organic weight loss and a faster nutrient release than the underground structures. The breakdown of N. lutea leaves was considerably faster in summer than in autumn. The organic weight loss and nutrient dynamics of the decomposing leaves were influenced by the trophic status of the system. Particularly in an acid moorland pool the breakdown of the leaves was relatively slow when compared to that of an eutrophicated system and an alkaline oxbow lake. The effect of the litter bag mesh size (0.27 and 0.78 mm) on the breakdown of the leaves was relatively small.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1985	21	1					1	22		10.1016/0304-3770(85)90091-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(85)90091-9													WOS:A1985ACK7800001
J	Pauer, JJ; Auer, MT				Pauer, JJ; Auer, MT			Nitrification in the water column and sediment of a hypereutrophic lake and adjoining river system	WATER RESEARCH												Nitrification in lakes and rivers is usually modeled using first-order water column kinetics. Over the years, a number of scientists have, however, recognized the importance of sediment nitrification, especially in shallow systems. The aim of this study is to determine the extent of nitrification in the water column and sediments of a eutrophic system and to propose simple kinetic equations to describe the process. An intensive experimental study was performed (summer and fall 1992, fall 1993) on Onondaga Lake and the adjoining Seneca River, a hypereutrophic system with high ammonia concentrations (2-10 mgN l(-1)). Water samples and sediment cores were collected and laboratory nitrification studies performed. The results clearly demonstrate that there is rapid nitrification in the sediments of both Onondaga Lake (0.37 gN m(-2) d(-1)) and the Seneca River (0.32 gN m(-2) d(-1)). In contrast, no apparent nitrification was observed in the water column of the lake or river, despite high ammonia concentrations. The findings of the Most Probable Number (MPN) test provide a likely reason for this phenomenon, showing that the lack of nitrification in the water column is probably due to low nitrifier densities (similar to 10(1) cells ml(-1)), whereas the rate is rapid in the sediments due to high nitrifier populations (similar to 10(5) cells ml(-1)). It is therefore believed that nitrification in this relatively deep system is localized to the sediments and simple zero order kinetics is proposed as a first approach to model the process. It also stimulates the question of whether nitrification in most freshwater systems is principally a sediment process and should be modeled accordingly. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Yang, SL; Dong, XX; Xiao, JL				Yang, Shiling; Dong, Xinxin; Xiao, Jule			The East Asian Monsoon since the Last Glacial Maximum: Evidence from geological records in northern China	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												The impact of global warming on the climate of northern China has been investigated intensively, and the behavior of the East Asian monsoon during previous intervals of climatic warming may provide insight into future changes. In this study, we use paleovegetation records from loess and lake sediments in the marginal zone of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) to reconstruct the EASM during the interval of warming from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Holocene. The results show that during the LGM, desert steppe or dry steppe dominated much of northern China; in addition, the southeastern margin of the deserts east of the Helan Mountains had a distribution similar to that of the present-day, or was located slightly further south, due to the cold and dry climate caused by a strengthened East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and weakened EASM. During the last deglaciation, with the strengthening of the EASM and concomitant weakening of the EAWM, northern China gradually became humid. However, this trend was interrupted by abrupt cooling during the Heinrich 1 (H1) and Younger Dryas (YD) events. The EASM intensified substantially during the Holocene, and the monsoon rain belt migrated at least 300 km northwestwards, which led to the substantial shrinking of the desert area in the central and eastern part of northern China, and to the large expansion of plants favored by warm and humid conditions. Paleoclimatic records from the marginal zone of the EASM all show that the EASM reached its peak in the mid-Holocene, and past global climatic warming significantly strengthened the EASM, thereby greatly improving the ecological environment in northern China. Thus, northern China is expected to become wetter as global warming continues. Finally, high resolution Holocene vegetation records are sparse compared with the numerous records on the orbital timescale, and there is a need for more studies of Holocene climatic variability on the centennial-to-decadal scale.

Yet, sporadic data are available on its life-history traits. This study assessed the fecundity, growth, and body condition of black bullhead in three oxbows in Hungary. Samples were collected in the resting (October) and pre-spawning (April) periods. Considerable negative allometric growth was observed (b slope ranged between 1.64 and 1.67). The Fulton's condition factor was lower than any previously reported data (mean = 1.01; SD = 0.09). The mean male : female ratio of the three populations was 1.18:1. Mean absolute fecundity was 3,319 eggs (SD = 1521; range = 1,111-12,727), and mean relative fecundity was 78.8 eggs g -1 (SD = 21.8; range = 34.8-146.0). The mean oocyte diameter was 0.39 mm in autumn and 0.41 mm in spring. Oocyte size positively correlated with body length. The mean standard length at age was 76.5-81.00 mm at 1 + , 126.23- 134.35 at 2 + , 153-154.5 mm at 3 +, and 180-181 mm at 4+. Our results confirmed the phenotypic plasticity of black bullhead out of its native range.																			2242-1300					JUN	2024	13	2					515	527		10.3391/bir.2024.13.2.16	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/bir.2024.13.2.16													WOS:001241986100016
J	Dumnicka, E; Galas, J				Dumnicka, E; Galas, J			Factors affecting the distribution of Oligochaeta in small high mountain ponds (Tatra Mts, Poland)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The Oligochaeta communities of six small high mountain ponds were examined. A total of only 17 taxa were found. In temporary ponds and in ponds that freeze to the bottom in winter the community consisted almost exclusively of Enchytraeidae, of which Cernosvitoviella tatrensis was the most numerous species. In other ponds the community composition was more diverse, and the dominant species were Spirosopernia ferox and Nais variabilis. In one of the studied ponds (the Siwy Wyzni) where the water level was stable, there were differences in species composition among various sampling locations. These differences persisted in successive years and the probable reason for that was the presence of springs which led to varying chemical and thermal conditions. The content of organic matter in the mud sediment of the studied ponds was high, varying from 10-30 % in most ponds and was high as 50 % in one dystrophic pond. Correlations between total Oligochaeta density, or density of the dominant species, and sediment organic matter content were not statistically significant. Among the oligochaete species living in the mountain ponds four ecological types were distinguished.																			0003-9136					DEC	2002	156	1					121	133		10.1127/0003-9136/2002/0156-0121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2002/0156-0121													WOS:000180181000008
J	García-Chicote, J; Armengol, X; Rojo, C				Garcia-Chicote, Jara; Armengol, Xavier; Rojo, Carmen			Zooplankton species as indicators of trophic state in reservoirs from Mediterranean river basins	INLAND WATERS												Zooplankton abundance and composition is sensitive to eutrophication, and its top-down effect in the planktonic food web can alter the classification of the trophic state of waterbodies based on the microscopic primary producers. However, this relevant group in aquatic ecosystems is overlooked when lakes and reservoirs are monitored to describe and improve water quality as required by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Fortunately, we have data on monitored zooplankton and the physical, chemical, and biological variables prescribed by the WFD in 20 Mediterranean reservoirs over a 4-year period (summer and winter sampled). We related zooplankton composition (90 species) with these limnological descriptors and found that zooplankton species assemblages are mainly driven by trophic gradients. Different compositions were found within the eutrophic range, suggesting alternative states when systems are more productive, but no composition was typical of oligotrophy. Based on these results, 10 species were selected based on their significant indicator value for trophic state; they are good indicators of mesotrophic, eutrophic, and hypertrophic states. Our results support the use of zooplankton as a metric to establish water quality and provide concrete data of the indicator value of some species in reservoirs in the Mediterranean basin.

Exploitation, Survival, Reproduction, and Habitat Use of Gravid Female Paddlefish in Ozark Lake, Arkansas River, Arkansas	PADDLEFISH MANAGEMENT, PROPAGATION, AND CONSERVATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY: BUILDING FROM 20 YEARS OF RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Paddlefish Conservation and Management	DEC 05, 2006	Omaha, NE	Amer Fisheries Soc				We assessed potential impacts of harvest and proposed channel modifications on the paddlefish Polyodon spathula fishery of Ozark Lake, Arkansas River, Arkansas. Ultrasonic telemetry was used to determine commercial and recreational exploitation rates, survival, spawning locations, and habitat use of gravid female paddlefish. Monthly searches were conducted for 40 tagged fish and we recorded 862 locations in Ozark Lake from January 2004 through December 2005. Adjacent reservoirs (i.e., Pool 13 and Lake Dardanelle) were tracked periodically, but interpool movement was not detected. Commercial fishing exploitation was determined at a mandatory check station and was estimated to be 30% during a 5-d special season. Annual recreational snag-fishing exploitation estimates were 8% (2004) and 3% (2005). Survival was different between years and was much lower the year (2004) with a commercial fishing season. Kaplan-Meier staggered-design survival estimates (+/-95% confidence interval [CI]) for 2004, 2005, and 2004 through 2005 were 0.60 +/- 0.19, 0.92 +/- 0.11, and 0.55 +/- 0.18, respectively. With commercial and recreational harvests omitted from the analysis, the estimated 2-year survival rate was 0.91 +/- 0.13 (+/- 95% CI), which corresponds to 5% annual natural mortality. Gravid females migrated a median distance of 33 and 32 km in the spring of 2004 and 2005 and likely spawned in the tailvvater of James W. Trimble Lock and Dam from late March to early April. Successful paddlefish reproduction was verified by capture of 23 prolarvae. Paddlefish selected tributary mouth habitat in all seasons (59% of locations). Tailwater and inundated creek channel habitats were selected in spring and summer, respectively. A navigation project to deepen the channel from 2.7 to 3.7 m will impact approximately 50% of the tailwater spawning habitat. Channel modifications (i.e., dredging and dike construction) near the mouth of the Mulberry River may disturb an important tributary mouth habitat for paddlefish where 55% of all locations were recorded. Our study identified biologically important habitats that need conservation and indicates that commercial harvest was the primary source of mortality for gravid female paddlefish in Ozark Lake.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-12-7				2009	66						123	+																WOS:000278471300008

Compared to rather detailed knowledge of the evolution of large and small lakes in Scandinavia and Canada, and large lakes in Eurasia, highly abundant small boreal lakes of northwest Russia have received very little attention, although they may become important centers of attraction of growing rural population in the near future. Here we present the results of a multidisciplinary, multi-annual study of a small boreal humic lake of NW Russia. A shallow ( 3 m) and a deep ( 16 m) site of this lake were regularly sampled for a range of chemical and biological parameters. Average multi-daily, summer-time values of the epilimnion ( upper oxygenated) layer of the lake provided indications of possible trends in temperature, nutrients, and bacterio-plankton concentration that revealed the local pollution impact in the shallow zone and overall environmental trend in the deep sampling point of the lake. Organic phosphorus, nitrate, and lead were found to be most efficient tracers of local anthropogenic pollution, especially visible in the surface layer of the shallow site of the lake. Cycling of trace elements between the epilimnion and hypolimnion is tightly linked to dissolved organic matter speciation and size fractionation due to the dominance of organic and organo-ferric colloids. The capacity of lake self-purification depends on the ratio of primary productivity to mineralization of organic matter. This ratio remained > 1 both during winter and summer periods, which suggests a high potential of lake recovery from the input of allochthonous dissolved organic matter and local anthropogenic pollution.					; Chupakova, Anna/A-8276-2014; Pokrovsky, Oleg/W-4934-2019; , Natalia/V-4986-2017; Vorobieva, Taisia/AAZ-2832-2020; Kokryatskaya, Natalia/V-4986-2017; Shorina, Natalia/AAJ-3286-2020; Moreva, Olga/A-8591-2014; Zabelina, Svetlana/A-8851-2014; Klimov, Sergey/B-2191-2014; Chupakov, Artem/A-9191-2014; Махнович, Наталья/AAI-2349-2021; sobko, elena/AAG-7668-2019	Zabelina, Svetlana/0000-0001-7160-0618; Vorob'eva, Taisia/0000-0002-3410-0240; Pokrovsky, Oleg/0000-0002-3155-7069; , Natalia/0000-0002-0619-7241; Moreva, Ol'ga/0000-0002-5114-8481; Chupakov, Artem/0000-0001-6424-5582; 														2073-4441				AUG	2016	8	8							316	10.3390/w8080316	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8080316													WOS:000380765200005

However, due to extreme hydrometeorological events and human activities, rising groundwater levels have been observed in many areas. The daily groundwater levels from 2018 to 2020 for the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB) in Jiangxi Province were recorded. The statistical characteristics of abnormal groundwater level rising (AGLR) events and the factors influencing the dynamic changes in groundwater level were analyzed using geostatistical methods and outlier identification methods. The groundwater level in the lower terrain of the PLB has increased significantly in recent years. AGLR events identified by the median absolute deviation and interquartile range methods showed that AGLR events mainly occurred in the spring and summer and were mainly distributed near the surface water bodies. Correlation analysis of the factors influencing the groundwater level revealed that the correlation between precipitation and groundwater level was related to topography. In contrast, the correlation between river stage and groundwater level was related to runoff volume.

Ammonium nitrate and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) are significant components of fine particles in many urban atmospheres. These components however, are not properly measured by current EPA accepted methods, such as the PM2.5 FRM, due to loss of semi-volatile material (SVM) from the filter during sampling. Continuous PM2.5 mass measurements are attempted using methods such as the R&P TEOM monitor. This method however, heats the sample to remove particle-bound water. This results in evaporation of significant amounts of semi-volatile material. Similarly, continuous carbonaceous material monitors are expected to lose semi-volatile organic material during sample collection. Continuous RAMS and collocated TEOM monitor data have been obtained at the EMPACT sampling site in Salt lake City, Utah during a 2-year period. Results obtained for the continuous determination of total PM2.5 mass with the RAMS have been validated by comparison with results obtained from collocated PC-BOSS diffusion denuder integrated samples at the EMPACT sampling site in Salt Lake City, Utah during three intensive sampling periods (winter 1999-2000, summer 2000, and winter 2000-2001). While the RAMS is shown to measure total PM2.5, including semi-volatile nitrate and organic material, commercially available semi-continuous TEOM and C monitors do not reliably measure these species.

Behavioral patterns were assessed by instantaneous scan sampling and focal sampling. No significant variation was found between the activity patterns of adult and first-winter swans, and thus the flock was treated as a single unit for subsequent analysis. Feeding and comfort activities accounted for 40% and 44% respectively of the total seasonal activity. The other major activities were vigilance and swimming. The main feeding strategies were upending and head and neck submerged whilst feeding on aquatic vegetation. Grazing on agricultural land was observed only once, and only in February. The diurnal feeding pattern varied over the study: sometimes there was a linear increase in the percentage of birds engaged in feeding as the day progressed, while on other occasions a pattern of bimodal peaks was observed.																			0791-7945					OCT	1994	94B	2					109	118																WOS:A1994QH96300002

Population dynamics of benthic and pelagic Microcystis colonies and single cells were investigated in Lake Taihu during recruitment from the sediment. Our results showed that the number of Microcystis single cells in both the water column and sediment was much higher than that of colonies during winter and early spring. In late May, cell density of single cells in the water column was greater than 1 x 10(5) cells ml(-1). This result also suggested that only a portion of the Microcystis single cells formed colonies during recruitment. Microcystis single cells formed colonies on the surface of the sediment where the temperature and light intensity were lower than in the water column. The temporal variation in morphology and colony size of Microcystis in both the water column and sediment demonstrated that a possible sequence of Microcystis colony formation is that colony-forming process begins with loose amorphous colonies formed from single cells in the sediment, then changing to firm amorphous colonies. Afterwards, firm amorphous colonies rise into the water column and some form typical M. ichthyoblabe colony morphology.

Essential fatty acids (EFA) are those that in a given animal cannot be synthesized or modified from precursors and must therefore be acquired via the diet. Because EFAs are often unevenly distributed in nature, this requirement may drive species to make behavioral or ecological adaptations to avoid malnutrition. This is especially true for fish like the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) of Upper Lake Constance (ULC), whose recent marine ancestors evolved with access to EFA-rich prey, but which found themselves in an EFA-deficient habitat. An unexpected and unprecedented ecological shift in the ULC stickleback population from the littoral to pelagic zones in 2012 might be linked to EFA availability, triggering ecological release and enabling them to build a hyperabundant population while displacing the former keystone species, the pelagic whitefish Coregonus wartmanni. To test this hypothesis, sticklebacks from the littoral and pelagic zones of ULC were sampled seasonally in two consecutive years, and their stomach contents and fatty acid profiles were analysed. Pelagic sticklebacks were found to possess significantly higher values of an important EFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), especially during autumn. Evaluation of the DHA supply suggests that sticklebacks feeding in the littoral zone during autumn could not meet their DHA requirement, whereas DHA availability in the pelagic zone was surplus to demand. During autumn, pelagic sticklebacks consumed large amounts of DHA-rich prey, that is, copepods, whereas littoral sticklebacks relied mainly mostly on cladocerans, which provide much lower quantities of DHA. Access to pelagic zooplankton in 2012 was possibly facilitated by low densities of previously dominant zooplanktivorous whitefish. The present study offers a convincing physiological explanation for the observed expansion of invasive sticklebacks from the littoral to the pelagic zones of Lake Constance, contributing to a phase shift with severe consequences for fisheries.					; Geist, Juergen/C-4933-2008	Baer, Jan/0000-0001-8388-6684; Geist, Juergen/0000-0001-7698-3443													0022-1112	1095-8649				MAR	2024	104	3					746	757		10.1111/jfb.15622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15622		DEC 2023						37984830					WOS:001185530400020
J	Choi, JW; Cha, Y; Kim, HD				Choi, Jae-Won; Cha, Yumi; Kim, Hae-Dong			South-north dipolar pattern around mid-1990s in Korean summer rainfall variability	DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS												From the time series of rainfall in summer (June, July and August) in South and North Koreas for recent 28 years (1981-2008), rainfall has significantly increased in South Korea while it has significantly decreased in North Korea since 1996. In particular, the decreasing trend of summer rainfall in North Korea was more conspicuous during the second Changma (late August - mid-September). This characteristic was also found in the south-north dipolar pattern based on 1996 by empirical orthogonal function analysis using summer rainfall observed in all weather observation stations in South and North Korea. The decreasing rainfall trend in North Korea was found to be associated with the weakening of convection by anomalous northeasterlies from anomalous anticyclone centered on around Baikal Lake during summer.

However, it experienced dramatic changes in lake inundation due to recent climate change and human activities, causing ecological and economic problems. Here, we applied a multiple-index water detection rule to integrated Landsat and MODIS products to reconstruct surface water series at 30-m and 8-day resolutions and quantified the spatiotemporal inundation dynamics in Poyang Lake over the past 20 years (2000-2019). Furthermore, their influences on habitat suitability for herbivorous birds were also assessed from the perspectives of hydroperiod and vegetation growth threshold. The significant declining trend (-26.66 km(2) yr(-1), p < 0.001) for the annual minimum water areas throughout the 20 years implied that Poyang Lake was undergoing a continuous shrinkage in the low-water season. On the monthly scale, inundation frequency (IF) decreases were more significant in September-January, most of which occurred in the alluvial delta zones near the lake center. The altered water regime after the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) might be the dominant contributor responsible for the continuous lake shrinkage during the recent low-water period. The sub-lakes suffered from spring drought rather than winter drought, triggering vegetation successions regarding the reversed trend of the well-documented xerophilization in Poyang Lake. The recent earlier and prolonged dry seasons caused an increase of suitable habitat for herbivorous birds (13.92 km(2) year(-1), p < 0.1), but triggered a potential risk of food quality degradation when the migratory waterbirds peaked in December. These results provide a clear reference for optimizing the hydrologic management and biodiversity conservation of Poyang Lake.

J	Johnson, JE; Hines, RT				Johnson, JE; Hines, RT			Effect of suspended sediment on vulnerability of young razorback suckers to predation	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The decline of native fishes in North America is principally a result of altered habitats. and the impact of mainstream dams has accounted for many of the habitat changes. Diminished turbidity, and introduced nonnative predators were investigated as possible reasons for the decline of endangered razorback suckers Xyrauchen texanus in the Colorado River. In laboratory tests, young razorback suckers selected clear water over two water samples with higher concentrations of suspended sediment. In clear water, however, young razorback suckers were extremely susceptible to predation: native Colorado squawfish Ptychocheilus lucius consumed 90% of test razorback suckers, and nonnative green sunfish Lepomis cyanellus consumed 99.6%. As turbidity increased, razorback sucker predator avoidance improved and differences in predator success disappeared. Winter-spring spawning by razorback suckers in Lake Mohave, along with the extreme susceptibility of larvae to predation in clear water, may account for total recruitment failure in that lake. However, in upper basin rivers, suspended sediments remain high enough to limit predation by fishes tested, suggesting that other impacts, including contaminants and lack of floodplain habitat, may be thwarting recruitment in those rivers.																			0002-8487					JUL	1999	128	4					648	655		10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0648:EOSSOV>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0648:EOSSOV>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000089183800009

The 3H profiles indicate that water inflow by rivers is concentrated at shallow depth. The deep water renewal rate by inflowing rivers during 1980-1981 deduced from 3H data is 10%, which corresponds to a water turnover time of 10 yr. The 3H-3He- age, i.e., the gas residence time in the deep water is around 5 yr. The deep water net O2 consumption rate, that is based on the 3H-3He-age, amounts 0.07 mg/l/mo. 3He gas exchange rates of 0.2 m/day during winter 1980-1981 and 0.02 m/day during summer 1981 are calculated from the data. From the Sep. 1981 profile a vertical eddy diffusion coefficient for 3H, 3He and temperature of 0.03 .+-. 0.01 cm2/s is derived for the depth range between 6 m and 21 m, i.e., directly below the thermocline.																			0003-9136						1985	102	4					409	414																WOS:A1985ADE2100001

Individual planktonic components as well as bulk plankton were isotopically lightest shortly after overturn in January and heaviest in May, after the peak of the annual bloom of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense. The range of deltaC-13 values observed over an annual cycle and the annual and seasonal means varied considerably between taxa. Within the primary producers, P. gatunense (range, - 23.2 to - 17.9 parts per thousand) was significantly C-13-enriched relative to concurrent nanoplankton (- 27.4 to - 19.0 parts per thousand). Zooplankton deltaC-13 showed indistinct taxon-specific differences but greater seasonal variation (- 33.8 to -19.8 parts per thousand) than any phytoplankton component examined. Adult fish exhibited smaller deltaC-13 variability than the planktonic components. End-member isotope compositions confirmed the linkages nanoplankton --> zooplankton --> Kinneret sardines, and Peridinium --> Sarotherodon galilaeus. Likely grazing of zooplankton on isotopically heavy Peridiniopsis spp. in spring and on a yet undetected light component in winter were implicated. The data demonstrate that the deltaC-13 of bulk particulate organic matter samples provides only a simplified view of a complex picture of deltaC-13 dynamics within the pelagic food web of a freshwater system.					; Berman-Frank, Ilana/NGR-4939-2025	Berman-Frank, Ilana/0000-0003-3497-1844; 													0024-3590					JUL	1994	39	5					1030	1043		10.4319/lo.1994.39.5.1030	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1994.39.5.1030													WOS:A1994PG52400005
J	Sobota, I				Sobota, Ireneusz			Changes in dynamics and runoff from the High Arctic glacial catchment of Waldemarbreen, Svalbard	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Since 1997, the runoff from the High Arctic catchment of Waldemarbreen has been recorded continuously at the gauging station located in northwest Spitsbergen, Svalbard. The analysis of the changes in dynamics and runoff from the glacial (polar) catchment of Waldemarbreen was made. One of the aims of this study was to try to determine how changes in the degree of the glaciation of the catchment influence the volume of the river discharge and runoff. This was found to be directly dependent on the percent glacier cover of the catchment and its changes. Changing the area and the volume of the glacier reduces the rate of the discharge, even when the intensity of melting does not change. Glaciological investigations of Waldemarbreen were taken between 1996 and 2009. The average ablation of Waldemarbreen varied from 64 to 137 cm w.e. during this time, while the average winter balance of this glacier was 50 cm w.e. During the summer season the mean discharge of the Waldemar River at the point which closed the glacier catchment in the years 1997-2009 was 1.0 m(3) s(-1) (541 mm). The average proportion of ablation within the runoff was 55%, and ranged from 30 to 77% during individual seasons. This study also examines selected elements which play some role in the dynamics of the glacial catchment of Waldemarbreen, for example icings or a moraine-dammed lake. It is the first such analysis for this region of Svalbard. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although management actions aimed at mitigating effects of habitat loss and predation have been largely effective, numbers continue to decline, which suggests that the population may be limited during the nonbreeding season. Between 2013 and 2015, we used light-level geolocators to track Common Terns nesting at 5 inland colonies-from Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada, to the eastern Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada-to identify migratory routes and stopover and wintering sites and to determine the strength of migratory connectivity among colonies. Within 46 recovered tracks, we found evidence of a longitudinal gradient in use of migration routes and stopover sites among colonies and identified major staging areas in the lower Great Lakes and at inland and coastal locations along the Atlantic coast, Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico. Low migratory connectivity across inland colonies illustrates high intermixing within wintering sites, with many birds spending the nonbreeding season in Peru (70%) and the remainder spread throughout the Gulf of Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America. While the large spatial spread and intermixing of individuals during the nonbreeding season may buffer local effects of climate change and human disturbance, the aggregation of individuals along the coast of Peru could make them vulnerable to events or changes within this region, such as increased frequency and intensity of storms in the Pacific, that are predicted to negatively influence breeding productivity and survival of Common Terns. Identifying sources of mortality during the nonbreeding season, quantifying winter site fidelity, and reinforcing the importance of continued management of inland breeding colonies are vital priorities for effective conservation and management of this vulnerable population.					; McKellar, Ann/JEF-2803-2023; Craig, Elizabeth/IQV-2584-2023; Lisovski, Simeon/AAD-4201-2019	McKellar, Ann/0000-0002-7032-3759; Craig, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8186-0077; Lisovski, Simeon/0000-0002-6399-0035; 														1938-4254				JUL	2018	135	3					385	399		10.1642/AUK-17-210.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-17-210.1													WOS:000436501100001

The influence of body size and season on the feeding ecology of three freshwater fishes with different diets in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Isotopic niche and length-isotope relationships were quantified across the body size of three similarly-sized fish species with different feeding strategies as adults (benthivore: freshwater drum, Aplodinotus grunniens; pisciyore: walleye, Sander vitreus; and omnivore: white perch, Morone americana) in Lake Erie's western basin using delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34. Stable isotopes demonstrated that resource utilization changed with body size for all three species and length-isotope relationships varied with season. Isotopic niche overlap was lower when modelled with three isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34) than with two (delta C-13 and delta N-15), providing greater resolution of feeding ecology among the species. Based on isotopic niches, there was significant overlap in resource use among species and size classes in spring, but overlap decreased in the fall for both. In this study, freshwater fish species with different adult feeding strategies partition resources through different mechanisms that vary through body size and season. Isotopes supported the generally identified feeding ecology of each species but demonstrated that each species underwent significant changes in feeding ecology with increasing body size. Changes in isotopes across season, and body size for each species demonstrate the need for a more thorough understanding of how resource use changes with body size and season in freshwater fish.

It has been inferred that the occurrence of such an event was attributed, on the one hand, to the stronger summer low pressure over the Plateau, which strengthened the attraction to the summer monsoon; on the other hand, to the vigorous evaporation of the tropic ocean surface, which promoted the moisture-rich southwest monsoon to flow over the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. The background responsible for the formation of the very strong summer monsoon was that the period of 30-40 kaBP was just in the strong insolation stage of the 20ka precessional cycle, when the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau received extraordinary strong solar radiation and thus enlarged the thermodynamical contrast between the Plateau and the midsouth part of the Indian Ocean.

J	Chorus, I; Spijkerman, E				Chorus, Ingrid; Spijkerman, Elly			What Colin Reynolds could tell us about nutrient limitation, N:P ratios and eutrophication control	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Colin Reynolds exquisitely consolidated our understanding of driving forces shaping phytoplankton communities and those setting the upper limit to biomass yield, with limitation typically shifting from light in winter to phosphorus in spring. Nonetheless, co-limitation is frequently postulated from enhanced growth responses to enrichments with both N and P or from N:P ranging around the Redfield ratio, concluding a need to reduce both N and P in order to mitigate eutrophication. Here, we review the current understanding of limitation through N and P and of co-limitation. We conclude that Reynolds is still correct: (i) Liebig's law of the minimum holds and reducing P is sufficient, provided concentrations achieved are low enough; (ii) analyses of nutrient limitation need to exclude evidently non-limiting situations, i.e. where soluble P exceeds 3-10 mu g/l, dissolved N exceeds 100-130 mu g/l and total P and N support high biomass levels with self-shading causing light limitation; (iii) additionally decreasing N to limiting concentrations may be useful in specific situations (e.g. shallow waterbodies with high internal P and pronounced denitrification); (iv) management decisions require local, situation-specific assessments. The value of research on stoichiometry and co-limitation lies in promoting our understanding of phytoplankton ecophysiology and community ecology.					; Spijkerman, Elly/MBH-6171-2025; Chorus, Ingrid/AAY-1326-2021	Chorus, Ingrid/0000-0001-6714-7865; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2021	848	1			SI		95	111		10.1007/s10750-020-04377-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04377-w		AUG 2020											WOS:000562657300002

The floodplain wetlands in the middle Yangtze region are biodiversity hotspots, particularly important for wintering migratory waterbirds. In recent years, extremely low winter water level events frequently occurred in the middle Yangtze River. The hydrological droughts greatly impacted the development and distribution of the wet meadows, one of the most important ecological components in the floodplains, which is vital for the survival of many migratory waterbirds wintering in the Yangtze region. To effectively manage the wet meadows, it is critical to pinpoint the drivers for their deterioration. In this study, we assessed the effects of hydrological connectivity on the ecological stability of wet meadow in Poyang Lake for the period of 2000 to 2016. We used the time series of MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) as a proxy for productivity to infer the ecological stability of wet meadows in terms of resistance and resilience. Our results showed that (1) the wet meadows developed in freely connected lakes had significantly higher resilience; (2) wet meadows colonizing controlled lakes had higher resistance to water level anomalies; (3) there was no difference in the resistance to rainfall anomaly between the two types of lakes; (4) the wet meadow in freely connected lakes might approach a tipping point and a regime shift might be imminent. Our findings suggest that adaptive management at regional-(i.e., operation of Three Gorges Dam) and site-scale (e.g., regulating sand mining) are needed to safeguard the long-term ecological stability of the system, which in term has strong implications for local, regional and global biodiversity conservation.

A multi-centennial record of past floods and earthquakes in Valle d'Aosta, Mediterranean Italian Alps	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Mediterranean Alpine populations are particularly exposed to natural hazards like floods and earthquakes because of both the close Mediterranean humidity source and the seismically active Alpine region. Knowledge of longterm variability in flood and earthquake occurrences is of high value since it can be useful to improve risk assessment and mitigation. In this context, we explore the potential of a lake-sediment sequence from Lago Inferiore de Laures in Valle d'Aosta (Northern Italy) as a long-term record of past floods and earthquakes. The high-resolution sedimentological study revealed 76 event layers over the last ca. 270 years; 8 are interpreted as most probably induced by earthquakes and 68 by flood events. Comparison to historical seismic data suggests that the recorded earthquakes are strong (epicentral Medvedev-Sponheuer-Karnik (MSK) intensity of VI-IX) and/or close to the lake (distance of 25-120 km). Compared to other lake-sediment sequences, Lago Inferiore de Laures sediments appear to be regionally the most sensitive to earthquake shaking, offering a great potential to reconstruct the past regional seismicity further back in time. Comparison to historical and palaeoflood records suggests that the flood signal reconstructed from Lago Inferiore de Laures sediments represents the regional and (multi-) decadal variability of summer-autumn floods well, in connection to Mediterranean mesoscale precipitation events. Overall, our results reveal the high potential of Lago Inferiore de Laures sediments to extend the regional earthquake and flood catalogues far back in time.					; Vogel, Hendrik/C-6148-2014	Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641; Vogel, Hendrik/0000-0002-9902-8120													1561-8633					MAY 8	2017	17	5					613	625		10.5194/nhess-17-613-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-17-613-2017													WOS:000400918300001

New evidence of Holocene atmospheric circulation dynamics based on lake sediments from southern Sweden: a link to the Siberian High	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon (delta C-13) isotope records of calcitic carbonate components (Chara sp. algal encrustations and Bithynia tentaculata gastropod opercula) from a lake-sediment succession on the Baltic Sea island of Gotland, south-eastern Sweden, have been obtained to investigate regional climate dynamics during the Holocene. The hydrological sensitivity of the small lake, particularly in terms of spring snowmelt contribution to the local water budget, provides a means of tracing past changes in the influence of snow-bearing easterly winds across the Baltic Sea Proper, which signifies the wintertime strength of the Siberian High. Repeated episodic depletions in O-18 at the centennial scale correlate with events of increased potassium concentration in the GISP2 ice-core record from Greenland, which indicates a coupling to large-scale fluctuations in atmospheric circulation patterns. A corresponding correlation with simultaneous depletions in C-13 suggests repeated responses of the local lake hydrology to snow-rich winters through decreasing water residence time, perhaps augmented by methanogenesis due to prolonged ice-cover seasons under the influence of an expanding Siberian High. Frequency analysis of the isotopic records reveals well-defined fluctuations at quasi-500-520-, 670-, 830- and 1430-yr periodicities, and a gradually stronger impact of Polar air outbreaks across the southern Baltic Sea region with time after ca 6000 cal.

Though the anomalous radioactivity has been known for almost half a century, the source of the radioactive anomalies has been a subject of conjecture. Radiometric analysis of a rock core drilled through Mt. Arbel, situated to the west of the lake, reveals that the oil shale sequence of the Senonian En Zetim and Ghareb formations is strikingly deficient in radium. Mt. Arbel has been cut by Rift Valley related faults that serve as conduits for ascending brines. The organic matter enriched sequence is encountered in the subsurface at elevations lower than the water level of the nearby radioactive enriched hot springs. It is thus concluded that hot ascending brines underlying the lake flush through the organic matter enriched sequence and remove a substantial percentage of Ra-226 from the uranium enriched organic material, before draining to the outlets of the springs.																			0265-931X						2006	85	1					137	146		10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.07.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.07.003								16118029					WOS:000233841100010
J	Charbonneau, P; Hare, L				Charbonneau, P; Hare, L			Burrowing behavior and biogenic structures of mud-dwelling insects	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Little is known about the burrows of sediment-dwelling insects because these structures are concealed by the sediment in which the animals live. We used X-ray images to reveal and compare the burrowing behavior in the laboratory of aquatic insects from several orders (Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Megaloptera, Trichoptera). Most of the taxa studied constructed U-shaped burrows. Exceptionally, individual caddisfly larvae (Polycentropus sp.) varied greatly in the type of burrow they constructed, i.e., I-, J- and U-shaped burrows were observed. Most taxa begin new burrows from preexisting ones under the sediment surface, obviating the need for the animals to leave the sediment and thereby minimizing their exposure to potential predators. Nymphs of the mayfly Hexagenia limbata exceeded all of the other taxa studied in terms of the depth and length of their burrows and their burrowing rate. Our data suggest that nymphs of H, limbata could be responsible for 98% of the volume of sediment disturbed by littoral insects in our study lake. Observations on 3 species of Chironomus suggest that the rate of burrow construction can differ among congeners. Individuals of H. limbata and Sialis velata burrowed to greater depth in the autumn than in the spring. Our study illustrates the potential of radiographs to study the behavior of burrowing animals, and the range of variability in burrowing behaviors among genera and species of insects.																			0887-3593					JUN	1998	17	2					239	249		10.2307/1467965	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467965													WOS:000075262700008
J	Marra, MJ				Marra, MJ			Last interglacial beetle fauna from new Zealand	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Fossil beetles from two last interglacial lake deposits from southern Wairarapa, central New Zealand are provisionally ascribed to marine oxygen isotope stages (MIS) 5a-e. Both assemblages represent ecological successions from lake margins to forest. The lower sample (MIS 5e) is characterized by species found today in northern New Zealand. These species, including Lorelus crassicornis, 'Dasytes' laticeps, Cryptobius nitidius, 'Stenontaliurn' sulcithorax, Psilocnaeia nana, and Microbrontes lineatus, represent a southward displacement from modern distributions by up to 700 km. Climate reconstruction indicates that temperatures at the time of deposition were 1.6-2.5degreesC warmer in the summer (January) and 2.3-3.2degreesC warmer in the winter (July) than at present. These results match local and regional pollen and phytolith findings of warmer, wetter conditions at the thermal maximum of the last interglaciation. In contrast, the upper sample is characterized by species that have widespread modern-day distributions. This indicates that modern conditions were attained later in MIS5, after the MIS 5e thermal maximum. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Desert Springs: Deep Phylogeographic Structure in an Ancient Endemic Crustacean (Phreatomerus latipes)	PLOS ONE												Desert mound springs of the Great Artesian Basin in central Australia maintain an endemic fauna that have historically been considered ubiquitous throughout all of the springs. Recent studies, however, have shown that several endemic invertebrate species are genetically highly structured and contain previously unrecognised species, suggesting that individuals may be geographically 'stranded in desert islands'. Here we further tested the generality of this hypothesis by conducting genetic analyses of the obligate aquatic phreatoicid isopod Phreatomerus latipes. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships amongst P. latipes individuals were examined using a multilocus approach comprising allozymes and mtDNA sequence data. From the Lake Eyre region in South Australia we collected data for 476 individuals from 69 springs for the mtDNA gene COI; in addition, allozyme electrophoresis was conducted on 331 individuals from 19 sites for 25 putative loci. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses showed three major clades in both allozyme and mtDNA data, with a further nine mtDNA sub-clades, largely supported by the allozymes. Generally, each of these sub-clades was concordant with a traditional geographic grouping known as spring complexes. We observed a coalescent time between similar to 2-15 million years ago for haplotypes within each of the nine mtDNA sub-clades, whilst an older total time to coalescence (>15 mya) was observed for the three major clades. Overall we observed that multiple layers of phylogeographic history are exemplified by Phreatomerus, suggesting that major climate events and their impact on the landscape have shaped the observed high levels of diversity and endemism. Our results show that this genus reflects a diverse fauna that existed during the early Miocene and appears to have been regionally restricted. Subsequent aridification events have led to substantial contraction of the original habitat, possibly over repeated Pleistocene ice age cycles, with P. latipes populations becoming restricted in the distribution to desert springs.

This work aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of Chl-a values in six Araucanian lakes in Central-South Chile. Here we combined in-situ Chl-a measurements and thirteen Landsat 8 satellite images to build a set of the linear and non-linear models to estimate Chl-a values in the lakes. Through the Taylor diagram, r Pearson, standard deviation, and other statistical indicators (R2, RMSE, IA, and MBE) the Chl-a models were validated. A qualitative/quantitative analysis to identify the species of microalgae present in the lacustrine systems was used. Next, Chl-a estimation maps were created to understand the spatial and seasonal behavior of this variable in each aquatic ecosystem. We observed that during the Summer months the Chl-a values are higher than in the Spring months for all lakes, except in Pirehueico lake. Moreover, the Chl-a models created predict with high accuracy, the results of statistical indicators are R2 0.94, IA > 0.80, RMSE <0.214 mu g/L, and MBE <-0.123 mu g/L. In the lake systems were found two invasive species, C. hirundinella, and Didymosphenia geminata, species recognized as bloom-forming in other aquatic systems. Finally, the Chl-a maps provided information on the monitoring of areas sensitive to Chl-a changes. This study is very important to conserve the water quality and early alert to forming phenomena like algal blooms which contributes to providing useful data for managers and policy-makers in Chilean lakes.					; Duran Llacer, Iongel/AAE-4362-2021; González Rodríguez, Lisdelys/JYQ-0867-2024	Rodriguez Lopez, Lien/0000-0002-0550-0253; Gonzalez Rodriguez, Lisdelys/0000-0002-7892-4604; Duran Llacer, Iongel/0000-0003-3290-4947													1574-9541	1878-0512				NOV	2021	65								101431	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101431	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101431		SEP 2021											WOS:000704529300004

Temporal variation in total phosphorus concentrations revealed from a multidecadal monitoring program on Big Platte Lake, Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Effective water quality management depends on enactment of appropriately designed monitoring programs to reveal current and forecasted conditions. Because water quality conditions are influenced by numerous factors, commonly measured attributes such as total phosphorus (TP) can be highly temporally varying. For highly varying processes, monitoring programs should be long-term and periodic quantitative analyses are needed so that temporal trends can be distinguished from stochastic variation, which can yield insights into potential modifications to the program. Using generalized additive mixed modeling, we assessed temporal (yearly and monthly) trends and quantified other sources of variation (daily and subsampling) in TP concentrations from a multidecadal depth-specific monitoring program on Big Platte Lake, Michigan. Yearly TP concentrations decreased from the late 1980s to late 1990s before rebounding through the early 2000s. At depths of 2.29 to 13.72 m, TP concentrations have cycled around stationary points since the early 2000s, while at the surface and depths 18.29 concentrations have continued declining. Summer and fall peaks in TP concentrations were observed at most depths, with the fall peak at deeper depths occurring 1 month earlier than shallower depths. Daily sampling variation (i.e., variation within a given month and year) was greatest at shallowest and deepest depths. Variation in subsamples collected from depth-specific water samples constituted a small fraction of total variation. Based on model results, cost-saving measures to consider for the monitoring program include reducing subsampling of depth-specific concentrations and reducing the number of sampling depths given observed consistencies across the program period.

J	Brown, SJ; Maceina, MJ				Brown, SJ; Maceina, MJ			The influence of disparate levels of submersed aquatic vegetation on largemouth bass population characteristics in a Georgia reservoir	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Population characteristics of largemouth bass (Micropterous salmoides L.) including growth, body condition (relative weight), size structure, survival, and fecundity were examined in relation to abundance of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) coverage (primarily hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata L.f. Royle) in three major embayments of Lake Seminole, Georgia. Relative weight, fecundity, and growth of large-mouth bass in the Spring Creek embayment (76% areal SAV coverage) was considerably less than measured in the Chattahoochee and Flint river arms that contained lower SAV coverages (26% and 32%). It took fish 1.8 years longer to reach 406 mm in Spring Creek compared to the Chattahoochee-Flint arms. Consequently, fish were smaller in Spring Creek than in the Chattahoochee-Flint arms. In addition, due to slower growth rates and lower fecundity-to-body weight relation, we predicted a 47% reduction in total potential ova production in Spring Creek compared to the other two reservoir embayments. The annual survival rate of 3 to 10 year old largemouth bass was higher in Spring Creek (84%) than in the Chattahoochee-Flint arms (72%) and suggested either lower harvest and/or lower accessibility of particularly larger fish to angling in dense vegetation. Contrary to our expectaions, the fit between number-at-age and age in a catch-curve regression was weaker for fish collected in Spring Creek and suggested greater recruitment variability has occurred over time in this highly vegetated embayment. In Lake Seminole, spatial differences in largemouth bass population characterstics were associated with disparate levels of SAV. Our data suggest that a reduction in hydrilla, but maintenance of an intermediate level of SAV in Spring Creek, should improve largermouth bass population in this arm of the reservoir.																			0146-6623					JAN	2002	40						28	35																WOS:000176617200006
J	Yang, G; Blackburn, J; She, YT; Zhang, WM				Yang, Ge; Blackburn, Julia; She, Yuntong; Zhang, Wenming			Winter water quality modelling under ice-affected conditions in rivers and lakes: A comprehensive review	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Numerical models are important tools for studying and predicting water quality in aquatic environments. Although there are many water quality models that are available (both freely and commercially), very few have capabilities to consider the effects of an ice cover in the simulation of water quality conditions in winter. This paper provides a comprehensive review of water quality models used to study winter water quality in rivers and lakes, focusing on their capabilities to simulate ice and how the ice interacts with the aquatic environment. Seven models are reviewed: CE-QUAL-W2, WASP, EFDC/EFDC+, MIKE HYDRO River, TELEMAC-MASCARET, ELCOMCAEDYM/AEM3D, and HEC-RAS. The paper also reviews the modelling studies on seasonally ice-affected water bodies worldwide based on some of these models, coupled models, and other study-specific models. This review highlights the challenges associated with water quality modelling in ice-affected rivers and lakes, due to both model limitations and a scarcity of winter water quality data. The review also underscores the need for the collection of water quality data with equal emphasis on winter data, as this is not only necessary for accurate calibration of models during ice-affected periods, but also for developing a better understanding of how ice affects water quality and vice versa. This will allow important interactions between water quality and ice to be identified and integrated into models.

J	Jantunen, LM; Bidleman, TF				Jantunen, LM; Bidleman, TF			Air-water gas exchange of toxaphene in Lake Superior	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Parallel air and water samples were collected in Lake Superior during August 1996 and May 1997, to determine the levels and air-water exchange direction of toxaphene. Concentration of toxaphene in water did not vary across Lake Superior or between seasons (averaging 918 +/- 218 pg/L) but atmospheric levels were lower in May (12 +/- 4.6 pg/m(3)) than in August (28 10 pg/m(3)). Two recalcitrant congeners. Parlar 26 and 50, also were determined. These congeners were enriched in the air samples, compared to a standard of technical toxaphene, but not in the water. Water-air fugacity ratios varied from 1.4 to 2.6 in August and 1.3 to 4.7 in May, implying volatilization of toxaphene from the lake. Estimated net fluxes ranged from 5.4 to 13 and 1.8 to 6.4 ng/m(2)d, respectively. The temperature dependence of toxaphene partial pressure (P) in air was log P/Pa = -3,291/T-a + 1.67, where T-a is air temperature. By using this relationship, the atmospheric levels of toxaphene, fugacity ratios, and net fluxes were estimated for the entire year. Fugacity ratios were highest in the winter and lowest in the summer; thus toxaphene was predicted to undergo net volatilization from the lake during all months. A net removal of approximately 220 kg/year by gas exchange was estimated.					; Bidleman, Terry/F-6287-2011	Jantunen, Liisa/0000-0003-0261-9539; Bidleman, Terry/0000-0001-7469-0532													0730-7268					JUN	2003	22	6					1229	1237											12785578					WOS:000185639100007

Use of a weather generator for simulating climate change effects on ecosystems: A case study on Lake Constance	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												We present a new vector-autoregressive weather generator developed to generate meteorological time series for climate impact studies on ecosystems. As an example, the weather generator was applied in combination with a hydrodynamic-ecological lake model (DYRESM-CAEDYM). The effects of a warmer and more variable climate on hydrodynamics and phytoplankton in large monomictic lakes were analysed. The weather generator reproduced dependency structures of measured meteorological data. Variability was altered at a time scale similar to lengths of synoptic disturbances, resulting in longer than day-to-day fluctuation changes. Sensitivity of spring bloom development towards a warmer climate, increased climate variability and a combination of both was addressed. For this purpose, 500 meteorological time series per scenario were generated as input for the lake model. We found that onset and maximum of phytoplankton spring bloom are sensitive towards spring weather conditions and that an increase in variability favours early as well as late blooms.

M.; Datta, Rajashree Tri			Contrasting regional variability of buried meltwater extent over 2 years across the Greenland Ice Sheet	CRYOSPHERE												The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) rapid mass loss is primarily driven by an increase in meltwater runoff, which highlights the importance of understanding the formation, evolution, and impact of meltwater features on the ice sheet. Buried lakes are meltwater features that contain liquid water and exist under layers of snow, firn, and/or ice. These lakes are invisible in optical imagery, challenging the analysis of their evolution and implication for larger GrIS dynamics and mass change. Here, we present a method that uses a convolutional neural network, a deep learning method, to automatically detect buried lakes across the GrIS. For the years 2018 and 2019 (which represent low- and high-melt years, respectively), we compare total areal extent of both buried and surface lakes across six regions, and we use a regional climate model to explain the spatial and temporal differences. We find that the total buried lake extent after the 2019 melt season is 56 % larger than after the 2018 melt season across the entire ice sheet. Northern Greenland has the largest increase in buried lake extent after the 2019 melt season, which we attribute to late-summer surface melt and high autumn temperatures. We also provide evidence that different processes are responsible for buried lake formation in different regions of the ice sheet. For example, in southwest Greenland, buried lakes often appear on the surface during the previous melt season, indicating that these meltwater features form when surface lakes partially freeze and become insulated as snowfall buries them. Conversely, in southeast Greenland, most buried lakes never appear on the surface, indicating that these features may form due to downward percolation of meltwater and/or subsurface penetration of shortwave radiation. We provide support for these processes via the use of a physics-based snow model. This study provides additional perspective on the potential role of meltwater on GrIS dynamics and mass loss.

It is necessary to develop a scientifically defensible and empirically testable relationship between changes in WLF and the corresponding ecological responses on a regional scale. We utilized correlation analyses, curve-fitting methods, and the classification and regression tree model to quantify both the linear continuum responses and the discontinuous threshold responses of the distribution of spring sedges in the Poyang Lake wetland in relation to different indicators of WLF. Our results suggest that: (1) the sedges exposed to a rapidly fluctuating water regime adjust their distribution pattern approximately every 30 days in an attempt to adapt to the new and ever changing environment; (2) the continual presence of high water levels lasting up to 20 days during the spring or extremely low water levels during the previous retreating season could trigger substantial changes in the distribution of spring sedges. Results of this study will help water resource managers to make informed decisions about how to regulate water conservation projects and protect the degrading wetland ecosystems.

Frisian lake district, with emphasis on total phosphorus (TP) and chloride (Cl-). The main objectives of the project were: to quantify the phosphorus flows, to gain insight in the process of eutrophication, and to simulate management scenarios. The seasonal variability in the lakes is due mainly to the man-made hydrology: reception of humic-rich polder water in wet periods (winter) and inlet of chloride-rich lJsselmeer water in dry periods (summer). The yearly means of TP concentrations in the lakes (Tjeukemeer, Groote Brekken and Slotermeer) ranged from 0.23 to 0.29 mg l-1. However, much higher concentrations (0.9 mg l-1) were found in periods with high inflow of polder water. The simulations with a mass balance showed an acceptable similarity between measured and simulated concentrations of TP as well as of Cl-. Chloride was modelled to verify the accuracy of a hydrodynamic model. A sensitivity analysis of the apparent settling rate in the P model showed that sensitivity was lowest in simulations of Groote Brekken and highest in simulations of Slotermeer, the difference being attributable to the influence of the water residence time. The model was found to be appropriate for simulating management scenarios.																			0018-8158					MAY 15	1992	233	1-3					259	270		10.1007/BF00016114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016114													WOS:A1992JD64800026

In order to determine whether patterns of enzymatic hydrolysis vary among shallow lakes of different trophic status, we investigated the hydrolysis of six specific organic macromolecules (polysaccharides) in the spring and late summer in four adjacent shallow lakes of eutrophic, oligotrophic, and dystrophic status in coastal North Carolina, USA. The spectrum of enzyme activities detected differed strongly between lakes, with all six polysaccharides hydrolyzed in West Mattamuskeet in May, while only two substrates were hydrolyzed in Lake Phelps in August/September. Differences in the spectrum of enzyme activities, and therefore the capabilities of heterotrophic microbial communities, were likely driven by variations among lakes in primary productivity patterns, sediment-water interactions, and/or water chemistry. Our data represent a first step towards a better understanding of carbon substrate availability and differences in carbon cycling pathways in shallow lakes of different trophic status.

Trends in the Minimum Winter River Flow on the Territory of the Basin of Lake Sevan	ARID ECOSYSTEMS												This work is devoted to assessing the features of the distribution of spatiotemporal changes in the characteristics of the minimum 30-day winter flow of rivers in the basin of Lake Sevan. The problem of spatiotemporal changes in the minimum river flow is especially relevant for regions with insufficient and unstable moisture, like the basin of Lake Sevan, most of which is located within the steppe zone. The purpose of this work is to summarize modern ideas about the impact of climate change on the characteristics of the minimum 30-day winter river flow based on the authors' own research, to analyze and evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of long-term fluctuations, and to identify nonstationarity in the series of minimum winter flow. The characteristics of the minimum flow have been determined, their spatiotemporal changes have been studied, and the dates of violations of homogeneity in the series of long-term runoff observations have been discovered. Using statistical parameters and difference integral curves, we assessed the representativeness of time series of minimum 30-day winter water flows at 12 sites during the period of instrumental observations. Nonstationarity in the series of minimum winter runoff in the basin of Lake Sevan has been revealed, and the dates for changes in stationary regimes have been determined. For most of the watersheds analyzed, the changes are statistically significant. Maps of the date of violation of the stationarity of the series under consideration based on information up to 2021 are presented, including a map of the distribution of the module of the minimum 30-day runoff for the winter period and maps on the nature of changes in the minimum 30-day winter flow. It is shown that changes in the minimum 30-day winter flow have a multidirectional nature, but mainly for the minimum 30-day winter flow, on average, over the territory of the lake basin. In recent decades, Lake Sevan has shown an increasing trend associated with rising air and soil surface temperatures. For some of the watersheds analyzed, the changes are statistically insignificant. On the territory of the Vardenis, Lichk, and Bakhtak river basins, on average, the minimum 30-day winter flow decreases by 20-30%, which will lead to an increase in environmental risk, requiring the adoption of appropriate measures. The obtained statistical materials will serve as the basis for scientific generalizations of research on the territory under consideration and can also be used for practical purposes in hydraulic engineering design and assessment of natural hazards and in making appropriate preventive decisions.					; Gaidukova, Ekaterina/K-1683-2013; Varduhi, Margaryan/AAT-7859-2020	Margaryan, Varduhi/0000-0003-3498-0564; 													2079-0961	2079-0988				SEP	2024	14	3					269	279		10.1134/S2079096124700215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S2079096124700215													WOS:001300028800012

Summer thermal structure and anticyclonic circulation of Lake Erie	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In most thermally stratified lakes, the summer thermocline has the shape of a "dome", with a shallower depth offshore than nearshore. This configuration is accompanied by a lake-wide cyclonic circulation. Lake-wide observations of subsurface temperature in central Lake Erie revealed an atypical "depressed" or "bowl-shaped" thermocline in late summer, with a deeper thermocline in the middle of the lake and a shallower thermocline nearshore. Currents measured in the central basin when the bowl-shaped thermocline was observed were anticyclonic, forming a single basin-wide gyre. It is suggested that the unusual bowl-shaped thermocline is the result of Ekman pumping driven by anticyclonic vorticity in surface winds. The bowl-shaped thermocline can lead to greater hypoxia in bottom waters and negative effects on biota by reducing the hypolimnetic volume. Citation: Beletsky, D., N. Hawley, Y. R. Rao, H. A.

J	McGloin, R; McGowan, H; McJannet, D				McGloin, Ryan; McGowan, Hamish; McJannet, David			Effects of diurnal, intra-seasonal and seasonal climate variability on the energy balance of a small subtropical reservoir	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												In order to gain a full understanding of the importance of interactions between the atmosphere and inland water bodies, there is a need to analyse these exchanges in different regions throughout the world and under a wide range of weather and climate conditions. A 2-year time series of energy balance measurements was made at a small reservoir situated in southeast Queensland, Australia. Measurements were used to establish diurnal, intra-seasonal and seasonal cycles of evaporation, while synoptic weather maps and local weather station data were used to relate variations in water surface-atmosphere energy exchanges to synoptic and mesoscale weather phenomena. Consistent diurnal peaks in latent heat flux during the afternoon were observed throughout this study as a result of strong dry winds coinciding with peak water surface temperatures. Occasional intra-seasonal pulses in latent heat flux (i.e. evaporation) in winter and spring were associated with the passage of cold fronts over southern Queensland, which brought strong dry westerly winds. The average annual evaporative water loss from the reservoir during the 2-year measurement campaign was 991mm year(-1). It is thought that differences between the annual evaporation totals for the 2 years of this study may have been related to differences in the frequency of overcast conditions as a result of a change in the phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.

J	Khan, Q; Parveen, S				Khan, Qasim; Parveen, Saltanat			Zooplankton composition, abundance and diversity in Sagartaal, Budaun district, Uttar Pradesh, India	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Sagartaal is located in Budaun with geographical coordinates 28.0512 degrees N and 79.1305 degrees E in Nawada region, Uttar Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, India. Understanding the composition, diversity, and abundance of the zooplankton is vital for better utilization of such waterbodies. The present study was carried out from October 2022 to September 2023. A total of 24 species belonging to 16 species of Rotifera, 4 species of Cladocera, 2 species of Copepoda, and 2 species of Ostracoda were recorded. The prominent species were Brachionus forficula, B. calyciflourus, Keratella cochlearis, Simocephalus sp., Cyclops sp., and Mesocyclops sp. Zooplankton showed seasonal variations in their species composition, abundance, and diversity concerning water temperature, pH, total alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, and hardness. The zooplankton density was recorded as maximum in winter and minimum in monsoon. Statistically, zooplankton shows significant correlations as Rotifera with EC, BOD (r =- 0.50; - 0.58, respectively); while with total hardness (r = 0.75); Cladocera with DO (r = 0.53), alkalinity (r = 0.57), nitrate (r = 0.56), and phosphate (r = - 0.49). The highest Shannon index (2.83) was obtained for summer, due to the lowest value of the dominance index (0.07) for this season. More studies are warranted on Monitoring such ecosystems as Sagartaal to understand the effects of anthropogenic pressure on zooplankton's community structure, can help in identifying the indicator species to formulate effective conservation planning.

Budget calculations show that on an annual basis, 71-88% of total nitrogen, 73-89% of total phosphorus and 72-101% of BOD, inflowing to the estuary are exported to the Baltic Sea. Among the inorganic nutrient species, nitrates exhibit the highest net transformation rate into organically bound forms (over 60%). The transformation could have been equally high or even higher in the case of ammonia and phosphates but these processes may have been compensated by intensive mineralization. The mechanisms responsible far the nutrient transformation patterns, as well as their net effect on the annual loads delivered into the Baltic Sea, are discussed in the paper. Phosphorus seemed to play a limiting role in phytoplankton production in the estuary in spring, while nitrogen did the same in summer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Prediction of inflows into Lake Kariba using a combination of physical and empirical models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Seasonal climate forecasts are operationally produced at various climate prediction centres around the world. However, these forecasts may not necessarily be appropriately integrated into application models in order to help with decision-making processes. This study investigates the use of a combination of physical and empirical models to predict seasonal inflows into Lake Kariba in southern Africa. Two predictions systems are considered. The first uses antecedent seasonal rainfall totals over the upper Zambezi catchment as predictor in a statistical model for estimating seasonal inflows into Lake Kariba. The second and more sophisticated method uses predicted low-level atmospheric circulation of a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (CGCM) downscaled to the inflows. Forecast verification results are presented for five run-on 3-month seasons; from September to June over an independent hindcast period of 14 years (1995/1996 to 2008/2009). Verification is conducted using the relative operating characteristic (ROC) and the reliability diagram. In addition to the presented verification statistics, the hindcasts are also evaluated in terms of their economic value as a usefulness indicator of forecast quality for bureaucrats and to the general public. The models in general perform best during the austral mid-summer season of DJF (seasonal onset of inflows) and the autumn season of MAM (main inflow season). Moreover, the prediction system that uses the output of the CGCM is superior to the simple statistical approach. An additional forecast of a recent flooding event (2010/2011), which lies outside of the 14-year verification window, is presented to demonstrate the forecast system's operational capability further during a season of high inflows that caused societal and infrastructure problems over the region.					; Landman, Willem/JVN-5114-2024	Landman, Willem/0000-0002-9475-6655; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				MAY	2016	36	6					2570	2581		10.1002/joc.4513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.4513													WOS:000375604000013
J	Clair, TA; Ehrman, JM; Higuchi, K				Clair, TA; Ehrman, JM; Higuchi, K			Changes in freshwater carbon exports from Canadian terrestrial basins to lakes and estuaries under a 2xCO2 atmospheric scenario	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Rain water running through soils and wetlands will leach decomposing plant organic matter into streams and lakes in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In streams, lakes and eventually estuaries, DOC can be mineralized to CO2, precipitated to sediments or taken up in biological matter, and is thus an important part of many aquatic ecosystems. Using hydrological, climatological and geographical data from 32 sites located in Canada, we developed a neural network model which allowed us to estimate DOC export from the Canadian land mass. We reapplied the model to the 32 sites plus a further 43 basins to estimate area normalized exports for various regions of the country. We estimated that 14.3x10(6) t of DOC are currently exported from Canadian terrestrial ecosystems. We then modified climatological inputs to the model to reflect the predicted temperature and precipitation conditions under a doubled atmospheric CO2 regime. Our model suggests that DOC exports will increase by approximately 14% under a doubled CO2 atmosphere, mostly owing to increases in runoff, Our analysis also shows that DOC export is greatest in the spring in southern Canada and summer in the north.																			0886-6236					DEC	1999	13	4					1091	1097		10.1029/1999GB900055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1999GB900055													WOS:000084557700019

Mallards are an important waterfowl species in this region, where an estimated 60-80% of the mallard harvest is composed of locally banded birds. Extensive population monitoring datasets are available for mallards, presenting an opportunity to address complex questions such as estimating productivity at large spatial and temporal scales, identifying the effects of harvest on mallard demography, quantifying mechanisms for harvest compensation, and integrating multiple datasets to quantify the demographic drivers of population change. Our objective was to simultaneously examine factors affecting demographic parameters and their relative contribution to Great Lakes mallard population dynamics. We used 32 years of banding, band recovery, and aerial survey data collected for mallards from Michigan and Wisconsin to develop an integrated population model (IPM). We used age ratios at banding to estimate productivity, band recoveries from hunter-harvested birds to estimate annual survival and cause-specific mortality (i.e., harvest or non-hunting), and modeled abundance using aerial survey and demographic parameter estimates from 1991-2022. The IPM results indicated the decline in Great Lakes mallard abundance was caused by increased non-hunting mortality and a decline in productivity. Productivity varied spatially but temporally declined with the loss of Conservation Reserve Program area. Moreover, our productivity assessment provided evidence of density dependence in reproduction. Non-hunting mortality was 3.5-6.7 times and 1.3-4.2 times greater than harvest mortality for adult and juvenile female mallards, respectively, indicating environmental factors during spring and summer, not harvest, most greatly influenced annual mortality for female mallards. Our IPM reduced uncertainty in the factors affecting Great Lakes mallard population dynamics and indicated management actions that address non-hunting mortality and productivity would be most effective in increasing Great Lakes mallard abundance.

From spring 2015 to fall 2017, we quantified adult abundance and survival and the total annual spawning run. Abundance and survival were estimated with mark-recapture using PIT tags, and the annual spawning run was estimated with PIT tag detections and counts of spawners. Adult abundance fluctuated from 830 (95% CI 559-1248) to 1085 (95% CI 747-1614), with no overall temporal trend, as a decrease in male abundance was generally offset by an equal increase in female abundance. Estimated mean adult survival was 0.51 (95% CI 0.44-0.58). The spawning run increased from 645 (2015) to 868 (2016), but then decreased slightly to 824 (2017, mean = 789 +/- 118). Female spawners increased in 2016 but decreased slightly in 2017, whereas male spawners decreased each year. In addition, the proportion of adults that spawned each year increased overall. Our study suggests that the adult population remained stable although most of the study period included the recent, severe regional drought in the western United States (2012-2016).					; Shoemaker, Kevin/IZD-8166-2023; Campbell, Teresa/W-3935-2019; Jerde, Christopher/AAJ-4385-2020	Chandra, Sudeep/0000-0003-1724-5154; Campbell, Teresa/0000-0002-8916-6837; Jerde, Christopher/0000-0002-8074-3466; Shoemaker, Kevin/0000-0002-3789-3856; Simmons, James/0000-0001-8283-3601													2045-2322					JUN 8	2020	10	1							9184	10.1038/s41598-020-65992-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-65992-0								32513963					WOS:000560458600003

Herein, the annual variations in the isotopic compositions of total gaseous Hg (TGM), with 5-22 days of sampling duration for each sample, were presented for the first time to provide isotopic evidence of the sources and environmental processes of gaseous Hg around the Chinese Great Wall Station (GWS) in the western Antarctic. Different from the Arctic tundra and lower latitude areas in the northern hemisphere, positive delta Hg-202 (0.58 +/- 0.21 parts per thousand, mean +/- 1SD) and negative Delta Hg-199 (-0.30 +/- 0.10 parts per thousand, mean +/- 1SD) in TGM at the GWS indicated little impact from the vegetation-air exchange in the Antarctic. Correlations among TGM Delta Hg-199, air temperature, and ozone concentrations suggested that enhanced katabatic wind that transported inland air masses to the continental margin elevated TGM Delta Hg-199 in the austral winter, while the surrounding marine surface emissions controlled by sea-ice dynamics lowered TGM Delta Hg-199 in the austral summer. The oxidation of Hg(0) might elevate Delta Hg-199 in TGM during atmospheric Hg depletion events but have little impact on the seasonal variations of atmospheric Hg isotopes. The presented atmospheric Hg isotopes were essential to identify the transport and transformation of atmospheric Hg and further understand Hg cycling in the Antarctic.

Meteorological influences on algal bloom potential in a nutrient-rich blackwater river	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The effect of variability in rainfall on the potential for algal blooms was examined for the St Johns River in northeast Florida. Water chemistry and phytoplankton data were collected at selected sites monthly from 1993 through 2003. Information on rainfall and estimates of water turnover rates were used in the analyses of trends in phytoplankton biomass. 2. Major trends in rainfall and runoff within the lower St Johns River catchment over the 10-year study period were marked by both significant drought and flood periods. Autumn and winter rainfall patterns were strongly correlated with the range of Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies associated with El Nino events and La Nina periods. The effect of these major shifts in rainfall was evident in the strong relationship to replacement rates for water within the lower St Johns River. 3. The eutrophic status of the river was reflected in the high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus observed at all sampling sites, with total nitrogen concentrations up to 3100 mu g L-1 and total phosphorus concentrations up to 180 mu g L-1. 4. While it is clear that the high phytoplankton biomass and frequent blooms that characterize the freshwater portions of the lower St Johns River are fundamentally based on nutrient status, the expression of that potential was strongly correlated to water replacement rates, as revealed by the inverse relationship between phytoplankton biovolume increase and water turnover rate, with an R-2 of 0.80 for the major bloom season. The sensitivity of algal blooms to rainfall patterns over the 10-year study period suggest that longer-term temporal and spatial shifts in rainfall, such as multi-decadal cycles and the global-warming phenomenon, will also influence the frequency and intensity of algal blooms.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2007	52	11					2141	2155		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01844.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01844.x													WOS:000250145600007

Use of a Vertical Receiving Array for Geoacoustic Inversion in a Shallow-Water Waveguide with an Ice Cover	DOKLADY PHYSICS												A method for solving an inverse problem, which consists in the simultaneous assessment of the bottom topography and lake bed effective acoustic parameters for a shallow-water area covered with ice, is developed. This area is a plane waveguide of variable cross section. The method is based on the reception and processing of broadband (pulse) signals excited by a single sound source and recorded by a remote vertical chain of hydrophones (array). The bottom topography measurements are carried out by comparing the propagation times of signals reflected from the lower boundary of the waveguide and arriving at different array hydrophones. The effective parameters (sound speed, density, attenuation coefficient of acoustic waves) are determined by analyzing the angular dependence of the reflection coefficient, calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of the pulse reflected from the bottom to the amplitude of the direct signal, taking into account the spherical spreading of the wave front. Experiments to test the proposed approach were carried out in the coastal zone of Lake Baikal in the winter-spring period.

Paleoenvironmental Context of Archaeological Sites, Implications for Subsistence Strategies under Holocene Climate Change, Northern Kenya	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												The Holocene was time of dramatic climate change in East Africa, shifting from wetter climate in the Early-Mid Holocene (similar to 10-5 ka) to drier climates in the Late Holocene, followed by a slight reversal at <1 ka. The Holocene was a time of cultural change from hunter-gatherer and fishing to pastoralism. Recent excavations along the eastern shores of Lake Turkana, Kenya (4 degrees N) provide new archaeological materials, a high-resolution stratigraphic and c data set, OSL dates, and cultural records in the context of documented environmental change (falling lake levels). Archaeological site FwJj25 (4.20 +/- 0.28 ka), on the northeastern margin of Lake Turkana, provides one of the earliest records of pastoralism in the region. The palimpsest record of FwJj5 (0.90 +/- 0.06 ka) was in a small valley containing a groundwater seep located 5 km from the lake. FwJj5 reflects occupation by people who may have covered great distances in accessing resources, but were likely drawn to an environmental refugia of freshwater springs during times of regional aridity.

In order to study the seasonal dynamic of floating reed islands (such as absolute and relative movement) the only opportunity which provides high-tech methods based on space remote sensing was used. Sensors by suitable parameters for data registration for this type of unsystematic landscape units were used. SAR data (Synthetic Aperture) are powerful high-tech tool for monitoring from the ground objects. SAR data images are privileged to register data at any time of the day or night and in adverse weather conditions, which are the main limiting factor in optical images. Seasonal monitoring of floating reed islands using SAR data was performed - winter - when the water in the lake is frozen, then a relative movement of these islands was observed, spring - melting snow cover and rising water level in the Danube River and Srebarna Lake was observed, when the water level is raised. Obtained results give a quantitative assessment of the ecological dynamics of these types of specific habitats in Srebarna Lake. They show the movement of the islands through the seasons in the period of six mounts, the changes in their shape and size. Regular seasonal monitoring of the floating reed islands dynamic is very important for their preservation as a specific habitat.

Diverse subaerial and sublacustrine hot spring settings of the Cerro Negro epithermal system (Jurassic, Deseado Massif), Patagonia, Argentina	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Late Jurassic (similar to 150 Ma) Cerro Negro volcanic-epithermal-geothermal system (similar to 15 km(2) area), Deseado Massif, Patagonia, Argentina, includes two inferred volcanic emission centers characterized by rhyolitic domes linked along NW-SE regional faults that are associated with deeper level Au/Ag mineralization to the NW, and with shallow epithermal quartz veins and mainly travertine surface hot spring manifestations to the SE. Some travertines are silica-replaced, and siliceous and mixed silica-carbonate geothermal deposits also are found. Five hot spring-related facies associations were mapped in detail, which show morphological and textural similarities to Pleistocene-Recent geothermal deposits at Yellowstone National Park (USA), the Kenya Rift Valley, and elsewhere. They are interpreted to represent subaerial travertine fissure ridge/mound deposits (low-flow spring discharge) and apron terraces (high-flow spring discharge), as well as mixed silica-carbonate lake margin and shallow lake terrace vent-conduit tubes, stromatolitic mounds, and volcano-shaped cones. The nearly 200 mapped fossil vent-associated deposits at Cerro Negro are on a geographical and numerical scale comparable with subaerial and sublacustrine hydrothermal vents at Mammoth Hot Springs, and affiliated with Yellowstone Lake, respectively. Overall, the Cerro Negro geothermal system yields paleoenvironmentally significant textural details of variable quality, owing to both the differential preservation potential of particular subaerial versus subaqueous facies, as well as to the timing and extent of carbonate diagenesis and silica replacement of some deposits. For example, the western fault associated with the Eureka epithermal quartz vein facilitated early silicification of the travertine deposits in the SE volcanic emission center, thereby preserving high-quality, microbial macro- and micro-textures of this silica-replaced "pseudosinter." Cerro Negro provides an opportunity to reconstruct paleogeographic, paleohydrologic and paleoenvironmental associations in a well-exposed, extensive and diverse fossil geothermal system. This Late Jurassic hydrothermal deposit will likely contribute to a better understanding of the impact of depositional and post-depositional history on the development and long-term preservation potential of Lagerstatte in epithermal settings and, more generally, in extreme environments of the geological record.

These data show that there is very little horizontal variation in the albedo of the tundra in the summer, when lakes are free of ice, and in the winter, when they are frozen and the region is snow covered. Large horizontal variations of albedo occur in the tundra when lakes are frozen but there is no snow, and in the boreal forest region when the lakes are frozen and snow covered. The albedo values obtained over the tundra region were used to estimate the change in the heat balance for the land surface for the period of rapid snow disappearance in June 1963. This estimate indicates that the sensible heat transfer to the atmosphere was sufficient to heat the lower 1000 meters of air at a rate of 1.6[degree]C per day for this period, a value that agrees quite well with actual observations.																			0148-0227						1967	72	4					1135	+		10.1029/JZ072i004p01135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/JZ072i004p01135													WOS:A19679030300001

While abundant evidence from loess, lake and speleothem records in arid Central Asia (ACA) and East Asia has revealed the interplay between the mid-latitude westerlies and the EAM on orbital and millennial scales, most of these records only cover the period since the last glacial maximum. Thus, the trade-off relationship between the mid-latitude westerlies and the EAM on glacial- interglacial to millennial timescale since the last interglacial period remains unclear. In this study, we present 150 ka-long grain-size and organic carbon records from two loess sections in the western Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) and Yili Basin to assess the wind intensity and moisture variability between East Asia and ACA at glacial- interglacial to millennial timescales. Our results indicate that the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and westerly wind exhibit synchronous glacial-interglacial and precession-scale fluctuations. However, the moisture exhibits consistent variations between East Asia and ACA on glacial-interglacial timescale, whereas inconsistent pattern at precessional timescale. The moisture variations in ACA lagged those in the East Asia by 2 kyr during marine isotope stages (MIS)5. Millennial-scale wind and moisture variability in East Asia and ACA are broadly correlated with cooling events in the North Atlantic. Based on the modeling results of the TraCE-21 ka, we suggest that the wind and moisture variations in East Asia and ACA are controlled by the combined effects of ice sheets, insolation, and meltwater flux from orbital to millennial timescales. Therefore, our study provides new insights into the complex interplay between the EAM and mid-latitude westerlies, which can contribute to a better understanding of Asian climate dynamics.					fan, huimin/HTP-2816-2023; Liu, Yuming/HZJ-3995-2023; Sun, Youbin/K-8357-2012; Kang, Shugang/B-5955-2011; Shi, Zhengguo/F-3106-2011; Lan, Jianghu/AAJ-2140-2021; Guo, Fei/LSL-4869-2024; Vandenberghe, Jef/H-5846-2019; Liu, Xingxing/ABF-9303-2021; Song, yougui/I-8813-2014; CHENG, PENG/HNP-4206-2023	Vandenberghe, Jef/0000-0001-9910-1319; Sun, Youbin/0000-0002-6696-6620; Wu, Jie/0009-0007-9584-8344; Liu, Yuming/0000-0001-6936-4046; Lan, Jianghu/0000-0002-5618-2363													0277-3791	1873-457X				OCT 1	2023	317								108281	10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108281		AUG 2023											WOS:001067853700001

These fluxes can be measured in situ using eddy covariance techniques and are regularly included as a component of lake-atmosphere models. To help ensure accurate projections of lake temperature, circulation, and regional meteorology, we validated the output of five algorithms used in three popular models to calculate surface heat fluxes: the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM, with three different options for heat flux algorithm), the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and the Large Lake Thermodynamic Model. These models are used in research and operational environments and concentrate on different aspects of the Great Lakes' physical system. We isolated only the code for the heat flux algorithms from each model and drove them using meteorological data from four over-lake stations within the Great Lakes Evaporation Network (GLEN), where eddy covariance measurements were also made, enabling colocated comparison. All algorithms reasonably reproduced the seasonal cycle of the turbulent heat fluxes, but all of the algorithms except for the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) algorithm showed notable overestimation of the fluxes in fall and winter. Overall, COARE had the best agreement with eddy covariance measurements. The four algorithms other than COARE were altered by updating the parameterization of roughness length scales for air temperature and humidity to match those used in COARE, yielding improved agreement between modeled and observed sensible and latent heat fluxes.					; Xiao, Chuliang/D-3612-2013; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021	BLANKEN, PETER/0000-0002-7405-2220; Fitzpatrick, Lindsay/0000-0002-7570-6142; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; Lenters, John/0000-0002-6895-7592; Xiao, Chuliang/0000-0002-8466-9398; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				OCT 26	2018	22	10					5559	5578		10.5194/hess-22-5559-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5559-2018													WOS:000448399200001

Management activities that decrease soil porosity and remove organic matter can reduce productivity. We determined effects of three levels of organic matter removal (OMR) and soil compaction on aspen regeneration and growth following winter harvest of aspen-dominated stands in northern Minnesota, western Upper Michigan, and northern lower Michigan. The OMR treatments were merchantable bole harvest (MBH), total tree harvest (TTH), and total woody vegetation harvest plus forest floor removal (FFR). Compaction treatments were applied to increase surface soil bulk density by either 0, 15, or 30%. Sucker density increased with level of OMR on all three sites. On the sand site, mean diameter, height, and biomass were greatest with MBH and decreased with increasing OMR, indicating a potential decline in productivity with repeated total tree harvesting on sand soils. Soil compaction tended to increase mean sucker diameter and height on the sand, and decrease them on the fine-textured soils. Compaction greatly reduced sucker density and growth on the most productive silt-loam site, partially due to late spring treatment. These results apply to planning of operational harvest of aspen-dominated stands on similar soils throughout the northern Great Lakes region.																									2001		18					47	59																WOS:000171432000006

In this study, we explored the chemodiversity of DOM in water samples collected from two geothermal hot springs from the Kenyan East African Rift Valley, a region extremely rich in fumaroles, geysers, and spouting springs, located in close proximity to volcanic lakes. The DOM characterization included in-depth assessments performed by negative electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Reduced, saturated and little aromatic DOM compounds were dominant in the hot spring waters collected from either the Ol Njorowa gorge (ON) or the south shore of the soda-saline Lake Elementaita (ELM). Oxygen-poor and sulfur-bearing DOM molecules prevailed in ON, probably reflecting abiotic sulfurization from sulfide-rich geofluids. Nitrogen-bearing aliphatic and protein-like molecules were abundant in ELM, possibly perfusing through the organic-rich sediments of the adjacent Lake Elementaita. Notably, the heat-altered DOM of ancient autochthonous derivation could represent an overlooked source of aliphatic organic carbon for connected lentic environments, with a potential direct impact on nutrient cycling in lakes that receive geothermal water inputs.

Evaluation of a Simple Method to Classify the Thermal Characteristics of Streams Using a Nomogram of Daily Maximum Air and Water Temperatures	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												This study assessed the applicability of an existing methodology to classify different stream sites into coldwater, coolwater, or warmwater areas based on their maximum air and water temperatures in summer. Using this methodology, single measurements of daily maximum air temperatures (>= 24.5 degrees C) and water temperatures at 1600 hours between July 1 and September 7 can be plotted on a nomogram to approximate the thermal classification of a site. Data from 122 sites throughout the Great Lakes basin, Ontario, indicated that the existing methodology should be revised to include sampling days from July 1 to August 31 instead of July 1 to September 7 and daily sampling periods between 1600 and 1800 hours as opposed to 1600 hours to capture the warmest temperatures at the sites. Data from 80 of the 122 sites consistently fell into the coldwater, coolwater, or warmwater categories. Data from 5 sites overlapped the coldwater and coolwater categories, whereas data from 37 sites overlapped the coolwater and warmwater categories. Water temperatures at 11 of the coolwater-warmwater sites decreased as air temperatures increased. These sites had more groundwater discharge potential than either the coolwater and warmwater sites. This suggests that a higher proportion of groundwater (as opposed to surface runoff) in the summer caused the water temperatures to cool as air temperatures increased. A revised nomogram was developed that included five (cold, cold-cool, cool, cool-warm, and warm) rather than three (cold, cool, and warm) thermal classifications for sites in Ontario streams. We recommend the use of the revised nomogram to determine the thermal classification of stream sites, as the revised categories also correspond to the thermal preferences of 72 stream fish species commonly found in the Great Lakes basin.

J	Lin, YC; Fujisaki-Manome, A; Wang, J				Lin, Yu-Chun; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi; Wang, Jia			Recently Amplified Interannual Variability of the Great Lakes Ice Cover in Response to Changing Teleconnections	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The interannual variability of the annual maximum ice cover (AMIC) of the Great Lakes is strongly influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulations that drive regional weather patterns. Based on statistical analyses from 1980 to 2020, we identify a reduced number of accumulated freezing degree days across the winter months in recent decades, a step-change decrease of AMIC after the winter of 1997/98, and an increased interannual variability of AMIC since 1993. Our analysis shows that AMIC is significantly correlated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA) before the winter of 1997/98. After that, the AMIC is significantly correlated with the tropical-Northern Hemisphere pattern (TNH) and eastern Pacific oscillation (EPO). Singular value decomposition of the 500-hPa geopotential height and surface air temperature shows a dipole pattern over the northeast Pacific and North America, demonstrating the ridge-trough system. This dipole pattern shifts northward to the northern Rocky Mountains, placing the Great Lakes region in the trough after 1997/98. This shift coincides with the increased interannual variability of the EPO index, as well as the change in the sea surface temperature (SST) over the northeast Pacific, where the second mode of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) on SST shows a warm blob-like feature manifested over the Gulf of Alaska. The regression of wave activity flux onto the SST EOF shows that the source of upward and eastward propagation of a stationary Rossby wave shifts to the west coast of North America, likely moving the ridge-trough system eastward after the winter of 1997/98. Significance StatementWe found that the Great Lakes annual maximum ice cover decreased after one of the strongest El Nino-Southern Oscillation events in 1997/98 and that its year-to-year fluctuations increased in the recent 20 years. After the winter of 1997/98, the Great Lakes annual maximum ice cover started to correlate with the warm sea surface temperature anomaly in the northeast Pacific, which appears to disrupt the polar vortex far up in the stratosphere, and the polar vortex ultimately shifts eastward the ridge-trough system over North America. When the shifted system develops enough, it can encase the Great Lakes region in the Arctic air and thereby cause larger year-to-year fluctuations. This connection was found to be characteristic in the recent few decades, after the winter of 1997/98.					; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021	Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; 													0894-8755	1520-0442				OCT 1	2022	35	19					2683	2700		10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0448.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0448.1													WOS:000860956000004

Much effort has been made to explain the variability of summer season mineral dust load, for example, by relating dust variability to teleconnection indices such as ENSO and the NAO. However, only weak relationships between such climate indices and the abundance of mineral dust have been found. In this work, we demonstrate the role of the near-surface convergence zone over West Africa in controlling dust load and transport of mineral dust. We apply the 'Center of Action' approach to obtain indices that quantify the movement and strength of the convergence zone using NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data. The latitudinal position of the convergence zone is significantly correlated with the quantity of mineral dust at Barbados over the period 1965-2003 (r = -0.47). A southward displacement of the convergence zone is associated with both increased near-surface flow and decreased precipitation over the dust source regions of the southern Saharan desert, Sahel and Lake Chad. This in turn reduces soil moisture and vegetation, furthering the potential for dust emission. In contrast, the intensity of the convergence zone is not correlated with dust concentration at Barbados. We conclude that the coupling of changes in near-surface winds with changes in precipitation in source regions driven by a southward movement of the convergence zone most directly influence dust load at Barbados and over the tropical North Atlantic during summer.

A microbial source tracking (MST) study was conducted to determine the fecal contamination sources at public beach of the lake, so that effective pollution control strategies can be developed. Water samples were collected over an eight-month period at ten locations along the lake in 2016 and 2017. E. coli and Enterococcus were detected in 90.6% (culture) and 97.5% (qPCR), 95.8% (culture) and 91.8% (qPCR) of water samples from all sampling sites, respectively. Significant positive relationship between E. coli and Enterococcus results was observed for both qPCR and culture methods. HF183 marker was detected in 94.3% water samples (149 of 158), with concentrations ranging from 29.0 to 6073.5 GC/100 ml and from 129.8 to 38,465.6 GC/100 ml in summer and winter, respectively. The results also indicate that significant rainfall events have the potential to supply considerable loads of fecal bacteria to lake waters.

Not the case for wintering herbivorous Lesser White-fronted Geese in China	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Geese often forage on mid-winter foods that fail to satisfy daily energy needs, but they may do so to acquire other nutrients, such as nitrogen. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating nitrogen budgets, namely the balance of nitrogen income against expenditure, of wintering Lesser White-fronted Geese Anser erythropus feeding at two sites within East Dongting Lake, China, where they could and could not balance daily energy budgets. Geese could balance nitrogen budgets in energy-rich habitats but were less able to do so in habitats where they failed to balance energy budgets. This study presents the first full nitrogen budget for a wintering goose species, and suggests that, rather than acting as a source of nitrogen, use of energy-poor but undisturbed habitats may represent a refuge from human disturbance at other habitats.					; Liu, Xiaoyang/JUV-8314-2023	Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; 													2193-7192	2193-7206				JUL	2014	155	3					707	712		10.1007/s10336-014-1056-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-014-1056-6													WOS:000337792500015

YCS of peled Coregonus peled (Gmelin) was related to winter drawdown most probably via egg desiccation. In the relatively shallow Lokka dissolved oxygen deficiency in late winter also had a negative impact on survival of eggs and year-class strength. In contrast to peled, whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) indicated no significant relationship with winter drawdown or dissolved oxygen level. The obvious reason for the pattern is that peled spawn on the reservoir bottom, but whitefish spawn in the ascending rivers, which are mainly unaffected by reservoir regulation.																			0018-8158					OCT	2002	485	1-3					213	221		10.1023/A:1021322025688	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021322025688													WOS:000179640500020

As phosphorus (P) limits primary production in most lakes, protective and remediation efforts often seek to reduce P input. However, lower P concentrations do not always lead to lower O(2 )consumption rates. This study used a large hydrochemical dataset to show that hypolimnetic O-2 consumption rates in seasonally stratified European lakes remain consistently elevated within a narrow range (1.06 +/- 0.08 g O-2 m(-2)d(-1)) as long as areal P supply (APS) exceeded 0.54 +/- 0.06 g P m(-2) during the productive season. APS consists of the sum of total P present in the productive top 15 m of the water column after winter mixing plus the load of total dissolved P imported during the stratified season, normalized to the lake area. Only when APS sank below this threshold, the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate (AHM) decreased in proportion to APS. Sediment trap material showed increasing carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratios in settling particulate matter when APS declined. This suggests that a decreasing P load results in lower P concentration but not necessarily in lower AHM rates because the phytoplankton community is able to maintain maximum biomass production by counteracting the decreasing P supply by a more efficient P utilization. In other words, in-lake organic matter production depends only on APS if the latter falls below the threshold of 0.54g P m(-2) and correspondingly, the atomic C:P ratio of the settling material exceeds similar to 155.					; Muller, Beat/J-8887-2016; Müller, Beat/J-8887-2016	Schwefel, Robert/0000-0003-1610-4181; Muller, Beat/0000-0003-3696-9035; STURM, MICHAEL/0000-0003-2414-7894; 													2045-2322					DEC 2	2019	9								18054	10.1038/s41598-019-54486-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-54486-3								31792251					WOS:000500564500001

For this study, the eco-hydrological characteristics, threats, and protection status of 112 selected KGDEs around the Mediterranean Sea, including caves, springs, rivers and wetlands, were evaluated, based on local expert knowledge and scientific literature. Results dem-onstrate that KGDEs contribute considerably to regional biodiversity. The diversity of karst landscapes, combined with the groundwater emergence at springs, leads to exceptional habitat diversity, particularly in arid climates, where KGDEs serve as a refuge for species that could not thrive in the surrounding environment. The most common threats identified among the selected sites are direct human disturbances, such as mass tourism or overfishing, water-quality deterioration and water shortage from aquifer overdraft and/or climate change. Although most of the selected sites are under protection, conserva-tion measures are frequently insufficient. Such shortcomings are often caused by poor data availability, little knowledge on conservation needs of invertebrate species, and conflicts of interest with the local population. For this purpose, it is necessary to raise environmental awareness and promote interdisciplinary research, in order to monitor water quality and quantity in addition to the status of the biocenoses.

Overwinter Mortality of Gizzard Shad: Evaluation of Starvation and Cold Temperature Stress	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Overwinter mortality of gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum has been attributed to starvation, cold stress, and predation; however, the interactions among these factors are not well understood and can change across winter. We evaluated possible causes for overwinter mortality of age-0 gizzard shad through a combination of experiments and field sampling during the winters of 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. In the first experiment, gizzard shad were placed into cages in Oneida Lake, New York, during three time periods prior to ice formation. The fish exhibited low mortality at temperatures above 8 degrees C but high mortality (>75%) in all cages as temperature dropped below 8 degrees C. We observed no consistent patterns of length-dependent mortality or changes in total percent dry weight (DW). However, the viscerosomatic index (VSI) decreased during all time periods, indicating disproportionate use of visceral tissues. In the second experiment, gizzard shad were exposed to temperature treatments of 1, 2, and 4 degrees C in experimental cold rooms. Little mortality occurred as temperature dropped from 8 degrees C to 4 degrees C, but mortality increased after temperature reached 4 degrees C and was highest in the two coldest treatments. Within a temperature treatment, small fish died faster, and mortality exhibited a weak negative correlation with VSI and percent DW. Average size of fish in field collections increased through the winter, indicating higher mortality of smaller individuals and proportional changes in somatic DW and visceral DW. Results from both experiments and the field collections suggest that cold stress and an inability to acclimate-rather than starvation-are driving gizzard shad mortality at low temperatures.

Increasing rate of 21st century volume loss of the Patagonian Icefields measured from proglacial river discharge	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The Northern and Southern Patagonian Icefields are rapidly losing volume, with current volume loss rates greater than 20 km(3) a(-1). However, details of the spatial and temporal distribution of their volume loss remain uncertain. We evaluate the rate of 21st-century glacier volume loss using the hydrological balance of four glacierised Patagonian river basins. We isolate the streamflow contribution from changes in ice volume and evaluate whether the rate of volume loss has decreased, increased, or remained constant. Out of 11 glacierised sub-basins, seven exhibit significant increases in the rate of ice volume loss, with a 2006-2019 time integrated anomaly in the rate of glacier volume loss of 135 +/- 50 km(3). This anomaly in the rate of glacier-volume-loss is spatially heterogeneous, varying from a 7.06 +/- 1.69 m a(-1) increase in ice loss to a 3.18 +/- 1.48 m a(-1) decrease in ice loss. Greatest increases in the rate of ice loss are found in the early spring and late summer, suggesting a prolonging of the melt season. Our results highlight increasing, and in some cases accelerating, rates of volume loss of Patagonia's lake-terminating glaciers, with a 2006-2019 anomaly in the rate of glacier volume loss contributing an additional 0.027 +/- 0.01 mm a(-1) of global mean sea-level rise.					; Wickert, Andrew/C-2021-2014; Wickert, Andy/C-2021-2014	VAN WYK DE VRIES, MAXIMILLIAN/0000-0001-7752-8813; Romero, Matias/0000-0002-5840-7845; Penprase, Shanti/0000-0002-8870-9377; Wickert, Andy/0000-0002-9545-3365													0022-1430	1727-5652				OCT	2023	69	277					1187	1202	PII S0022143023000096	10.1017/jog.2023.9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2023.9		MAR 2023											WOS:000949686200001
J	Peng, J; Loew, A; Chen, XL; Ma, YM; Su, ZB				Peng, Jian; Loew, Alexander; Chen, Xuelong; Ma, Yaoming; Su, Zhongbo			Comparison of satellite-based evapotranspiration estimates over the Tibetan Plateau	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a major role in regional and global climate. The understanding of latent heat (LE) flux can help to better describe the complex mechanisms and interactions between land and atmosphere. Despite its importance, accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) over the TP remains challenging. Satellite observations allow for ET estimation at high temporal and spatial scales. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed cross-comparison of existing ET products over the TP. Six available ET products based on different approaches are included for comparison. Results show that all products capture the seasonal variability well with minimum ET in the winter and maximum ET in the summer. Regarding the spatial pattern, the High resOlution Land Atmosphere surface Parameters from Space (HOLAPS) ET demonstrator dataset is very similar to the LandFlux-EVAL dataset (a benchmark ET product from the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment), with decreasing ET from the south-east to northwest over the TP. Further comparison against the LandFlux-EVAL over different sub-regions that are decided by different intervals of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation, and elevation reveals that HOLAPS agrees best with LandFlux-EVAL having the highest correlation coefficient (R) and the lowest root mean square difference (RMSD). These results indicate the potential for the application of the HOLAPS demonstrator dataset in understanding the land-atmosphere-biosphere interactions over the TP. In order to provide more accurate ET over the TP, model calibration, high accuracy forcing dataset, appropriate in situ measurements as well as other hydrological data such as runoff measurements are still needed.					; Su, Z./D-4383-2009; Peng, Jian/IQT-8432-2023; Chen, Xuelong/C-2748-2014	Peng, Jian/0000-0002-4071-0512; ma, yao ming/0000-0001-8387-8721; /0000-0003-3948-1924; Su, Zhongbo/0000-0003-2096-1733; Chen, Xuelong/0000-0003-3892-5298													1027-5606	1607-7938				AUG 8	2016	20	8					3167	3182		10.5194/hess-20-3167-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-3167-2016													WOS:000383135900001

Land application of GNF is an accepted legislated management response to mitigate the impact of such nutrient loads. To assess the potential environmental impacts of this management practice, field infiltration experiments were conducted at four different greenhouse operations near Leamington, Ontario. Over a three-year study, GNF was applied on agricultural land adjacent to the greenhouse operations in the fall during the first year, and along with a bromide tracer in the summer and fall in Years 2 and 3, respectively. The GNF was applied at the maximum allowable rates as defined in legislation. Chemical constituents (nutrients, metals and the conservative tracer bromide) were monitored within the soil profile matrix and pore water above the water table. The results showed that, even with the GNF being applied at the highest permissible rates, the species of interest remained within the unsaturated soil zone at low concentrations over three to six months sampling intervals. The bromide tracer test demonstrated that highly mobile species could move through permeable soils to the water table depth in a potential worst-case application scenario. However, considering the low initial concentrations, long vadose zone residence time and the low mass flux, it would appear that land application of GNF, when applied in accordance with Ontario's Regulations, is a feasible and environmentally reasonable treatment option for managing GNF.

Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) is a common indicator that represent the trophic status in lakes. Spatial and temporal variations of Chl-a concentration are analyzed on the basis of sample data at 21 sites during the period of 2001 to 2005. Data at the sites located in the Meiliang Bay, Zhushan and Wulihu show greater fluctuations than that at other sites. A general trend showing that high values in northern part and low values in southern part of the Tai Lake is observed in seasonal mean values of Chl-a concentration for four seasons. Most high Chl-a concentrations occurred in summer (June to August) and autumn (September to November). Quantitative relationships between Chl-a and other water quality factors are investigated at all sites. Relative good relationships are obtained between Chl-a concentration and other water quality factors during 2001 to 2004 by using partial least squared regression. Prediction of Chl-a concentration in 2005 with above models produce worse results, which may be due to the occurrence of some extreme high values of Chl-a concentration in that year. Even though, acceptable predictions are obtained at several sites. Since the water quality in the lake is affected greatly by the inflow of nutrients from rivers, these relationships will be helpful for monitoring Chl-a variation with the combination of hydrological models that is able to simulate the inflow of nutrients.

Oxygen kinetics and tolerance to anoxia of the ammonia-oxidizing communities from these habitats were determined, The apparent K-m values for oxygen of the ammonia-oxidizing community in the lake sediment were in the range of 5 to 15 mu M, which was substantially lower than the range of K-m values for oxygen of the ammonia-oxidizing community from a permanently oxic dune location, Upon anoxic incubation, the ammonia-oxidizing communities of dune, chalk grassland, and calcareous grassland soils lost 99, 95, and 92% of their initial nitrifying capacity, respectively, In contrast, the ammonia-oxidizing community in the lake sediment started to nitrify within 1 h upon exposure to oxygen at the level of the initial capacity, It is argued that the conservation of the nitrifying capacity during anoxic periods and the ability to react instantaneously to the presence of oxygen are important traits of nitrifiers in fluctuating oxic-anoxic environments such as the root zone of aerenchymatous plant species.

J	ROMO, S; MIRACLE, MR				ROMO, S; MIRACLE, MR			DIVERSITY OF THE PHYTOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES OF A POLYMICTIC HYPERTROPHIC LAKE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Diversity of phytoplankton assemblages from the shallow hypertrophic lake, the Albufera of Valencia (Spain), was studied for the period 1980-1988. The lake serves as a reservoir for the surrounding rice cultivation, with two seasonal periods of water retention to keep ricefields flooded. The seasonal hydrological cycle seems to be the primary factor driving phytoplankton community changes, compounding the disturbances due to water mixing. The lake is dominated throughout by filamentous cyanophytes. A Shannon-Weaver function was used to measure phytoplankton diversity. Phytoplankton steady-states, defined as the periods when more than 80% of total phytoplankton biomass was shared by only 1-3 species, were assumed for comparative purposes. Phytoplankton diversity and the assemblages showed a high degree of interannual regularity during the study period. Phytoplankton was mainly limited by light and water flushing from November to April, and more by nitrogen and phosphorus during summer. Low diversities were related to stable community states, while higher diversities corresponded to non-steady state periods, the former lasting longer. Four annual phytoplankton associations were found, both steady and non-steady states being characterized by two different algal communities. Diversity reached a steady-state, lasting from November to June. From January to March, water flushing high nutrient levels and oligophotic conditions selected in favour of large unicellular phytoplankton species. The onset of spring quiescence resulted in the lowest values of diversity and species richness, due to the overwhelming dominance of vernal crops of Planktothrix agardhii, whose selfshading populations would have excluded many less well-adapted species. By June, nutrient decrease and increasing temperatures and irradiance, moved phytoplankton towards an intermediate assemblage dominated by smaller and faster growing species. Thereafter, long-summer water stabilization and nutrient depletion interacted to enhance diversity and the onset of a non-steady state, characterized by an immature summer assemblage of large colonies, potentially motile (e.g. Microcystis) and with high nutrient storage capacity. During the autumnal period when the ricefields are drained for harvest, diversities reached maximal levels, including species from the surrounding habitats (ricefields and drainage ditches). Lake reisolation by November-December led to another phytoplankton steady-state, when the phytoplankton reverted toward a composition similar to that of June. Storms increased diversity and the presence of small-sized species, contributing to a more rapid species replacement or arresting the establishment of an steady-state, depending upon their intensity frequency and occurrence. Stagnation always selected in favour of cyanophytes, while flushing rates enhanced the presence of other algal groups, mainly diatoms. The annual flushing cycle of the lake is regarded as a potential tool for the future lake restoration. Our results confirm the view of regarding the phytoplankton of polymictic Oscillatoria-dominated lakes, as sub-climatic communities mainly limited by light, and agree with some postulates based on the IDH-diversity theory.

In this study, we combined high-resolution (5 mm) sampling using diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and equilibrium dialysis sampling (HR-Peeper), sequential extraction (BCR), fluorescence signatures, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs)-parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to explore the complex mechanisms of As migration in a typical artificially polluted lake, Lake Yangzong (YZ). The study results showed that a high proportion of the reactive As fractions in sediments can resupply pore water in soluble forms during the change from the dry season (winter, oxidizing period) to the rainy season (summer, reductive period). In dry season, the copresence of Fe oxide-As and organic matter (OM)-As complexes was related to the high dissolved As concentration in pore water and limited exchange between the pore water and overlying water. In the rainy season, with the change in redox conditions, the reduction of Fe-Mn oxides and OM degradation by microorganisms resulted in As deposition and exchange with the overlying water. Partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM) indicated that OM affected the redox and As migration processes through degradation. Based on comprehensive analyses of the As, Fe, Mn, S and OM levels at the SWI, we suggest that the complexation and desorption of dissolved organic matter and Fe oxides play an important role in As cycling. Our findings shed new light on the cascading drivers of As migration and OM features in seasonal lakes and constitute a valuable reference for scenarios with similar conditions.

Muller, 1846) (Hirudinida: Glossiphoniidae) and mud turtle Emys orbicularis	BIOLOGIA												Emys orbicularis is receding from Europe, mainly due to anthropogenic habitat changes. Its parasite, Placobdella costata, is widely distributed within both the former and the present distribution range of the host. Though closely associated with the mud turtle, it may have other hosts (birds, amphibians, reptiles). Its reproductive period coincides with that of its host's migration to the breeding grounds, thus facilitating dispersal of the parasite. Based on literature data we have analyzed the geographic spread of P. costata and mud turtle to observe the possible overlap of their habitats. Observations on the population of mud turtle and the associated leech species (P. costata) were carried out in eastern Poland - Podlasie Lowland. The studies were conducted in spring and summer in 1986-1993. The leeches were collected from the turtles caught in the water and on land. Observations showed that most leeches were found on turtles inhabiting the lake or moving to a breeding area. The greatest intensity of invasion was observed in June and July and that most leeches were observed in female E. orbicularis characterized by greater length of the carapace and weight, compared with males and juvenile individuals.

J	Smith, RJ; Hamas, MJ; Ewert, DN; Dallman, ME				Smith, RJ; Hamas, MJ; Ewert, DN; Dallman, ME			Spatial foraging differences in American redstarts along the shoreline of northern Lake Huron during spring migration	WILSON BULLETIN												Lowland coniferous forests adjacent to northern Lake Huron provide important stopover habitat for landbirds during spring migration. Large numbers of aquatic insects emerging from nearshore waters of northern Lake Huron appear to be an important food source. In this study we compared the foraging behavior of a long-distance landbird migrant, the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), in areas with high densities of emergent aquatic insects to areas with few or no emergent aquatic insects to assess the significance of these arthropods as an early spring food source. Redstarts foraged differently in shoreline habitats relative to inland habitats of similar vegetation composition. Both males and females gleaned significantly more in shoreline habitats as compared to inland areas of similar vegetation composition, and inland birds performed more sally strikes than birds at the shoreline. Both sexes also varied the use of tree species in which they foraged. Redstarts used northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) more at shoreline than inland, while inland redstarts foraged in deciduous trees more than at the shoreline. We suggest that differences in foraging between shoreline and inland locations were responses to differences in prey types and abundance, most notably the presence of emergent aquatic insects (Diptera: Chironomidae) in shoreline habitat. Our results complement those of previous work, suggesting that midges provide a critical early season resource for landbirds migrating through Michigan's eastern Upper Peninsula during spring.																			0043-5643					MAR	2004	116	1					48	55		10.1676/03-091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/03-091													WOS:000223235900006

Hydrochemical simulation using topographically based models would benefit in particular from the linkage of groundwater residence times to topographic indices, such as the ln(a/tanbeta) index of Beven and Kirkby. Hypothesized associations between this index and groundwater characteristics were tested during the spring 2000 snowmelt in two sub-basins in the Turkey Lakes Watershed near Sault Ste Marie, ON. One sub-basin is in mature hardwood forest, and the other was clearcut in the fall of 1997. Piezometric surface elevations were monitored in each sub-basin throughout the melt, and the topographic index value for each piezometer was determined. The delta(18)O signatures of input water and groundwater were also measured. Mean groundwater residence times were obtained using the exponential system response function, which generally produced good fits to the observed groundwater delta(18)O time series in both sub-basins. There were significant contrasts in groundwater conditions between the sub-basins. The forested sub-basin exhibited higher and more temporally variable piezometric surface elevations and a greater contrast between 8180 signatures and water residence times in shallow versus deeper groundwater relative to the harvested sub-basin. Patterns of groundwater residence times in the sub-basins were supported by pre-harvest groundwater chemistry; however, data from the two sub-basins largely failed to support the hypothesized relationships between groundwater conditions and topographic index values. Methodological limitations that may have precluded a more rigorous test of the hypotheses are reviewed, and the potential for using groundwater residence times to evaluate the impacts of forest harvesting on basin hydrochemistry is briefly discussed.

Anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria from microbial communities of Goryachinsk thermal spring (Baikal Area, Russia)	MICROBIOLOGY												Species composition of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria in microbial mats of the Goryachinsk thermal spring was investigated along the temperature gradient. The spring belonging to nitrogenous alkaline hydrotherms is located at the shore of Lake Baikal 188 km north-east from Ulan-Ude. The water is of the sulfate-sodium type, contains trace amounts of sulfide, and salinity does not exceed 0.64 g/L, pH 9.5. The temperature at the outlet of the spring may reach 54A degrees C. The cultures of filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, nonsulfur and sulfur purple bacteria, and aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria were identified using the pufLM molecular marker. The fmoA marker was used for identification of green sulfur bacteria. Filamentous cyanobacteria predominated in the mats, with anoxygenic phototrophs comprising a minor component of the phototrophic communities. Thermophilic bacteria Chloroflexus aurantiacus were detected in the samples from both the thermophilic and mesophilic mats. Cultures of nonsulfur purple bacteria similar to Blastochloris sulfoviridis and Rhodomicrobium vannielii were isolated from the mats developed at high (50.6-49.4A degrees C) and low temperatures (45-20A degrees C). Purple sulfur bacteria Allochromatium sp. and Thiocapsa sp., as well as green sulfur bacteria Chlorobium sp., were revealed in low-temperature mats.

Phylogenetic bracket analysis shows that non-avian dinosaurs were primitively insulated, enabling them to access rich deciduous and evergreen Arctic vegetation, even under freezing winter conditions. Transient but intense volcanic winters associated with massive eruptions and lowered light levels led to the end-Triassic mass extinction (201.6 Ma) on land, decimating all medium- to large-sized nondinosaurian, noninsulated continental reptiles. In contrast, insulated dinosaurs were already well adapted to cold temperatures, and not only survived but also underwent a rapid adaptive radiation and ecological expansion in the Jurassic, taking over regions formerly dominated by large noninsulated reptiles.					; Vajda, Vivi/N-7693-2018	Chang, Clara/0000-0001-7310-639X; Kinney, Sean/0000-0003-4936-772X; Schaller, Morgan/0000-0003-2742-2126; Sha, Jingeng/0000-0002-9307-0627; Vajda, Vivi/0000-0003-2987-5559; Whiteside, Jessica/0000-0001-9403-4516; Sues, Hans-Dieter/0000-0002-9911-7254; Olsen, Paul/0000-0002-5852-6326; Kent, Dennis/0000-0002-7677-2993													2375-2548					JUL 1	2022	8	26							eabo6342	10.1126/sciadv.abo6342	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abo6342								35776799					WOS:000823432200015
J	Liu, JB; Chen, ZT; Chen, SQ				Liu, Jianbao; Chen, Zhitong; Chen, Shengqian			Southward shift of the westerly jet intensified late Holocene dust storms on the Tibetan Plateau	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The climate change on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) exhibits a north-south dipole trend during the Holocene. However, it is unclear whether regional differences exist in the variations and driving mechanisms of dust storm activities across the entire TP, and whether these mechanisms align with those found in monsoonal northern China. Here, we present a high-resolution Holocene record of dust storms from an undisturbed lake in the research gap area of the TP, and compile previously published records from other TP regions. Our findings indicate that the dust storm activity increased from the early Holocene to the late Holocene, peaking after 5 cal ka BP. Importantly, our comparison with other dust storm records reveals a unified intensification of dust storm activity across the entire TP during the late Holocene, a pattern distinctly different from the north-south dipole trend of precipitation variation. Moreover, this unified pattern of dust storm intensification across the TP cannot be explained by the decreasing intensity of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) during the Holocene. The observations suggested a limited role for precipitation and EAWM in modulating TP dust storms on the millennial timescale during this period. By contrast, the increases in dust storms on the TP after 5 cal ka BP correlates well to the southward shift of the westerly jet driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). As the NAO transitioned to a negative phase during the late Holocene, a meandering westerly jet shifted southward to the interior of the TP, intensifying wind intensity and leading to dust storm outbreaks.

However, the causes of fine-grained sediment deposition remain controversial. In this study, we examine the cause of fine-grained sedimentation in the Neogene saline lacustrine Qaidam Basin, and propose a new insight into the sedimentary process for fine-grained sediments. Various sedimentary structures identified from the fine-grained sediments such as erosional structures with lag deposits, hummocky cross-stratification (HCS)-like structures, asymmetrical ripples, or sandy ball-and-pillow structures, are generated by winter storms. These winter storms are related to the winter winds that cause eolian sedimentation in Asia. Abundant detrital material may be rapidly transported into lakes by winter storms, favoring extensive terrigenous detrital deposition in the lacustrine basin, hardly controlled by the division of sedimentary facies and topographical differentiation. The genetic features and shallow-water origin with wind and fluvial-lacustrine source-to-sink processes, may be the main reason for the poor hydrocarbon potential of the Neogene fine-grained sediments in the Qaidam Basin.

Distinguishing between P fractions in sediment can aid in understanding its eutrophication risk. Although streams and rivers are important parts of the P cycle in agricultural catchments, streambed sediment and especially fluvial suspended sediment (FSS) and its P fractions are less studied. To address this knowledge gap, seasonal variations in FSS P fractions and their relation to water quality and streambed sediment were examined in three Swedish agricultural headwater catchments over 2 yr. Sequential fractionation was used to characterize P fractions in both streambed sediment and FSS. All catchments had similar annual P losses (0.4-0.8 kg ha(-1)), suspended solids (124-183 mg L-1), and FSS total P concentrations (1.15-1.19 mg g(-1)). However, distribution of P fractions and the dominant P fractions in FSS differed among catchments (p < .05), which was most likely dependent on differences in catchment geology, clay content, external P sources, and flow conditions. The most prominent seasonal pattern in all catchments was found for iron-bound P, with high concentrations during low summer flows and low concentrations during winter high flows. Streambed sediment P fractions were in the same concentration ranges as in FSS, and the distribution of the fractions differed between catchments. This study highlights the need to quantify P fractions, not just total P in FSS, to obtain a more complete understanding of the eutrophication risk posed by agricultural sediment losses.					; Futter, Martyn/G-6238-2011; Gill, Laurence/D-2592-2014; Djodjic, Faruk/I-9944-2016	E.

J	Tsunematsu, N; Kai, K				Tsunematsu, N; Kai, K			Time variation of cloud distribution near surface wind convergence zone in the Nobi Plain during daytime on summer sunny days	JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN												The present study investigates the relationship between surface wind convergence and clouds by performing statistical analyses of time variations in surface wind field, its horizontal divergence, cloud distribution, and appearance frequency of radar echoes in the Nobi Plain in the daytime on summer sunny days using various observation data from 1990 to 1999. The 99 summer sunny days when general wind was weak were selected objectively in advance of the analyses. The results of analyses show that a westerly wind from the Biwa Lake direction and a sea breeze from Ise Bay converge in the north of Nagoya after 1300 JST on summer sunny days. In addition, clouds (cumulus) tend to be formed all over the Nobi Plain from late in the morning to about noon by thermal convections, and the formation of clouds continues near strong surface wind convergence zones until around 1500 JST on summer sunny days, although clouds are hardly formed in the afternoon in almost all parts of the plain due to the decline of the thermal convections. The continuation of the cloud formation is especially remarkable at the northeast of Nagoya. Thus, in the Nobi Plain on summer sunny days, the conditions where clouds are easily formed continue at the northeast of Nagoya until around 1500 JST, because of a strong surface wind convergence between a westerly wind from the Biwa Lake direction and a sea breeze from Ise Bay. The analysis of radar echoes observed around 1500 JST shows that the echoes occasionally appear near the northeast of Nagoya on summer sunny days. These results indicate that the strong surface wind convergence plays an important role in the formation of clouds, after thermal convection has weakened, on summer sunny days.					; Tsunematsu, Nobumitsu/AAE-1489-2019	Tsunematsu, Nobumitsu/0000-0003-1105-2546; 													0026-1165					DEC	2004	82	6					1505	1520		10.2151/jmsj.82.1505	http://dx.doi.org/10.2151/jmsj.82.1505													WOS:000226628500002

Today there are six hatcheries at Upper L.C. which all use refrigerated water to delay hatching. They stock around 350 million recently hatched and 3-5 million prefed whitefish larvae annually. Despite this long history of artificial incubation at L.C., it remains unknown whether stocking indeed fulfils its aims, to dampen yearly yield fluctuations and/or to increase yields. We used a newly developed method to label the otoliths of whitefish embryos during incubation with Alizarin Red S (ARS) to evaluate the contribution of unfed hatchery larvae to cohort size. In winter 2003, 600 L of whitefish eggs were treated with ARS and by early April around 40 million larvae were released. In autumn 2003, the otoliths of age-0 whitefish sampled from the lake were examined. We found that 18 out of a total of 290 fish originated from the marking experiment. Since only 10% of stocked larvae had been marked, the contribution of hatchery-reared fish to the cohort 2003 was estimated as 62% with binomial confidence intervals of 42 and 79%. It should, however, not be concluded that stocking is necessary to maintain the current level of commercial yields, since it still remains unknown whether hatchery fish are added to the naturally recruited stock leading to stronger cohorts, or whether stocking only increases intraspecific competition without enhancing cohort size.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47062-4				2007	60						361	+																WOS:000249090200029

ECOLOGY AND ANNUAL CYCLE OF MYXAS GLUTINOSA (OF MULLER) (GASTROPODA: LYMNAEIDAE) IN LLYN TEGID, NORTH WALES	JOURNAL OF CONCHOLOGY												Myxas glutinosa was feared extinct at all of its British sites for several years before it was rediscovered in Llyn Tegid (North Wales) in 1998. Results of a study of this population over eleven years are described in this paper. At Llyn Tegid it is restricted to the littoral zone, occurring exclusively beneath boulders and other large stones in silt-free areas. Unlike some populations in Ireland where it does not hide under rocks, the snails occur at low densities, and compared to these and many of the extinct British populations they are small when mature (shell height rarely reaching 10 mm). Repeated sampling of populations for biometrical study suggested that M. glutinosa has an annual life cycle in the lake, with snails reaching full size and reproductive maturity in late winter or spring, shortly before their death. The possible significance of sudden changes in the water-level of Llyn Tegid and its toxic algal 'blooms' for the conservation of M. glutinosa are discussed.																			0022-0019					DEC	2014	41		6				673	683																WOS:000367278900002

A total of 76 zooplankton species were identified in the lake, including 17 protozoa, 36 rotifera, 12 cladocera and 11 copepods species, respectively. Zooplankton species richness changed slightly in the four seasons but varied a lot in different positions. Protozoa was absolutely dominated in zooplankton abundance and its mean value ranged from 2710.2 ind./L in winter to 4259.5 ind./L in spring. Annual average biomasses of protozoa, rotifera, cladocera and copepods were 0.13 mg/L, 0.11 mg/L, 0.63 mg/L and 0.34 mg/L, respectively. The lowest values of zooplankton species richness, abundance and biomass appeared at the site which provides the maximum concentrations of nutrients. Zooplankton communities were more correlated to phytoplankton community biomass than environmental factors. Results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that water temperature, Secchi disk depth (SD), total phosphorus and phytoplankton biomass were the most significant factors that influenced zooplankton. Strong correlations between SD and Brachionus leydigi, Chrysophyta and Diaphanosoma leuchtenbergianum, Cryptophyta and Theopilium, Ascomorpha ovalis, Hexarthra mira were observed during the CCA. These zooplankton species may be used as indicators of relevant variables. Results in this research are very useful in guaranteeing ecological security in Lake Nansihu.

The present study, focused on Mg-carbonates from a well-characterized alkaline and ephemeral lake, gives new insight into the behavior of the stable isotopes during the seasonal precipitation of a variety of carbonates. Dolomite and Mg-calcite precipitate intracellularly within Spirogyra during spring and show lighter isotopic signatures (d(13)C aver. -4.10 parts per thousand and d(18)O aver. -0.75 parts per thousand, VPDB) than a second association of carbonates, such as hydromagnesite, northupite and traces of magnesite among other sodium-bearing carbonates (d(13)C aver., -1.34 parts per thousand and d(18)O aver. 4.52 parts per thousand, VPDB). The latter precipitate in association with degraded microbial mats as the lake desiccates during summer. Covariant trends between carbonate d(13)C and d(18)O reflect isotope enrichment related to evapoconcentration. The seasonal cycling of inorganic carbon among carbonate minerals, microbial biomass, lake water and pore water was also analyzed, revealing variations of d(13)C within a range of -12.40 parts per thousand to -0.43 parts per thousand. The more depleted C-13 derives from the decay of the microbial mats. The less negative values are distinctive of the bulk carbonates forming crusts in summer. Intracellular calcite and dolomite have d(13)C and d(18)O values (VPDB) ranging, from -5.45 parts per thousand to -3.07 parts per thousand and -2.48 parts per thousand to 1.58 parts per thousand, respectively, that are intermediate between those two endmembers. These intracellular carbonates are enriched in C-13 by 5 parts per thousand with respect to dissolved inorganic carbon (d(13)C in the range of -11.79 parts per thousand to -6.87 parts per thousand, VPDB) due to the vital effect of photosynthesis. The crust of carbonates deposited as the lake desiccates dissolve interannually. Alternatively, dolomite and Mg-calcite as well as their isotopic compositions persist during synsedimentary diagenesis, confirming that carbonate biominerals provide isotopic signatures related to the environmental conditions of formation with potential of preservation in the rock record.

Groundwater contributions to eutrophication of Florida's surface waters are a more recent focus. Florida's naturally oligotrophic springs, streams, and lakes are experiencing significant anthropogenic nutrient contamination resulting from groundwater discharges with elevated nitrate. Sources of nitrate contamination to these surface-water ecosystems include sewage effluent, industrial animal waste (concentrated animal feedlot operations) and inorganic fertilizers. In this study, stable nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) analysis of freshwater macrophytes was combined with basic knowledge of watershed and springshed land use and aquifer characteristics to provide evidence of nitrogen contamination sources and groundwater flowpaths. Selected naturally oligotrophic ecosystems included springs and a spring-run stream within the Ocala National Forest (ONF) and springs, a blackwater stream, and a sinkhole lake on or adjacent to state lands. Elevated delta N-15 values (similar to+ 8 to 1270,,) in ONF macrophytes indicated nitrogen contamination from sewage effluent. Underground injections of effluent and other wastes at ONF's Alexander and Juniper Springs Recreation Areas are the sole source of contaminants flowing through the sandy, surficial aquifer at those study areas. Samples from springs on state lands indicated nitrogen contamination from various sources via regional groundwater flowpaths. At Lake Placid's state lands, a dairy-waste lagoon was the groundwater source of nitrogen contamination via the sandy, surficial aquifer. Bulow Creek delta N-15 macrophyte values (similar to+ 5 to 8 parts per thousand) suggested contamination from both cattle and septic tank leachate. Results indicated that uptake of anthropogenic nitrogen occurred in invasive alien and nuisance native macrophytes in the four freshwater ecosystem types evaluated.																			1078-7275	1558-9161				NOV	2005	11	4					347	369		10.2113/11.4.347	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/11.4.347													WOS:000233721300007

Anatoxin-a (ATX-a) is a highly toxic cyanobacterial neurotoxin synthesized by numerous species (e.g., Aphanizomenon, Anabaena and Oscillatoria) that has received much public attention. In this study, we used molecular methods (PCR and qPCR) to track the presence and dynamics of ATX-a-producing cyanobacteria, Aphanizomenon and Anabaena in Lake Dianchi, China based on the anaC and cpcBA-IGS genes over a 23-month period (from June 2010 to April 2012). Results revealed that Aphanizomenon was the major potential ATX-a producer in Lake Dianchi and that they were most abundant in early spring and least abundant in summer, coinciding with observed Aphanizomenon blooms. It was found that the proportion of ATX-a toxigenic cells was lower in the northern part of the lake (2.1%) than the middle (16.7%) and southern parts (19.2%). The information on the spatio-temporal distributions of ATX-a-producing cyanobacteria obtained in this study will help to build management strategies to improve water quality for public health.

Lakes provide long-lived, high-resolution terrestrial archives of past hydrologic change, and their sediments contain a variety of proxies. This study presents geochemical and sedimentological data from Zaca Lake, CA (Santa Barbara County) used to reconstruct a 3000 year history of winter season moisture source (delta D-wax) and catchment run-off (125-2000 mu m sand) at decadal resolution. Here we show that winter season moisture source and run-off are highly variable over the past 3000 years; superimposed are regime shifts between wetter or drier conditions that persist on average over multiple centuries. Moisture source and run-off do not consistently covary indicating multiple atmospheric circulation modes where wetter/drier conditions prevail. Grain-size analysis reveals two intervals of multi-century drought with less run-off that pre-date the "epic droughts" as identified by Cook et al. (2004). A well-defined wet period with more run-off is identified during the Little Ice Age. Notably, the grain size data show strong coherence with western North American percent drought area indices for the past 1000 years. As a result, our data extend the history of drought and pluvials back to 3000 calendar years BP in the CSWUS. Comparison to tropical Pacific proxies confirms the long-term relationship between El Nino and enhanced run-off in the CSWUS. Our results demonstrate the long-term importance of the tropical Pacific to the CSWUS winter season hydroclimate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A complete mixing duration is quite short under natural mixing conditions, whereas artificial destratification systems can artificially induce an earlier occurrence of complete mixing, thereby prolonging the span of the naturally complete mixing period by several months. Based on multi-year in situ water quality measurements and meteorological data during natural and artificial mixing periods, this study evaluates the effects of water-lifting aerators (WLAs) and climatic factors on convective mixing processes and their duration. WLA-supplied turbulent kinetic energy (IKE) and WIA-induced hypolimnion warming significantly decrease the water stability and extend the naturally complete mixing period for 2.6-fold. The results indicate that an optimal WLA implementation should immediately achieve complete mixing when surface mixing occurs in autumn. By evaluating the influence of WLAs and other factors on convective mixing, this study provides insights for successful destratification system operations ( i.e., WLAs) to replenish oxygen concentrations across the water column and minimize operating costs by taking advantage of climatic conditions. Although our study focuses on WLA-induced mixing, these observations can be applicable to other destratification systems in most of the stratified reservoirs and lakes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Distribution and ecology of the generalist lactic acid bacterium Carnobacterium maltaromaticum in different freshwater habitats: Metabolic and antagonistic abilities	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												We explored the distribution, metabolic and antagonistic activities of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, isolated from freshwater locations in Denmark during winter or early spring. This species was widely distributed in such habitats although it was relatively rare in low pH locations. Isolates possessed a diverse metabolism, potentially enabling functional capacities independent of habitat. The intraspecies competition showed a relatively high degree of mostly low-intensity interactions, which overall were not correlated with phylogeny or location. Only a few isolates exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition activity, targeting species from other genera and families, including one isolate that exhibited a broad inhibitory activity due to H2O2 production. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that the frequency of bacteriocinogenic systems was low, and only one unmodified bacteriocin, piscicolin 126, correlated with phenotypic antagonistic activity. Furthermore, most potential bacteriocin gene complexes were not complete. Overall, this study showed C. maltaromaticum to be a generalist (nomadic) species with a constant presence in freshwater habitats, especially those with pH values >5. General metabolic properties did not suggest a strong degree of adaptation to the freshwater environment, and bacteriocin-mediated antagonistic activities appeared to play a minimal ecological role.					; Martinenghi, Laura/JKI-2861-2023; Leisner, Jørgen/L-7835-2018; Hounmanou, Yaovi Mahuton Gildas/AAB-4032-2019; Hounmanou, Yaovi/AAB-4032-2019	, Laura/0000-0002-3834-8446; Hounmanou, Yaovi Mahuton Gildas/0000-0003-3991-0864; Leisner, Jorgen/0000-0002-3536-5136; Tang, Taya/0000-0002-5414-4355; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				DEC	2023	25	12					3556	3576		10.1111/1462-2920.16508	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16508		SEP 2023						37750577					WOS:001071693900001
J	Arslan, S; Avsar, Ö				Arslan, Sebnem; Avsar, Ozgur			Assessment of heavy metal pollution in Koycegiz-Dalyan coastal lagoon watershed (Mugla) SW Turkey	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												This study is carried out to assess the water pollution in Koycegiz-Dalyan Coastal Lagoon Watershed located near the Mediterranean Sea in Mugla province, SW Turkey, by using heavy metal pollution index (HPI). A total of 30 samples were collected from the lakes, streams, groundwaters, the subaqueous hot and cold springs, and on-land hot springs, and Cr, Fe, As, Sb, and Pb concentrations were determined. Elevated concentrations of Fe, As, and Pb were detected in most of the samples; the sources of which are either the natural or anthropogenic discharge of the geothermal springs and seawater mixing. As and Pb concentrations in some locations are found to exceed both acute and chronic exposure criteria for aquatic life, posing a threat to the species hosted by these environments. To determine the magnitude of pollution, HPI calculations were carried out. The average and maximum HPI values for the cold waters are 297.1 and 1162.9, respectively, both of which are higher than the critical pollution index value. The highest HPI values are observed in samples taken from the Dalyan Channel and Alagol Lake. In general, pollution levels increase from north to south, reaching the maximum value at the outlet point, due to the increased contribution from thermal water discharge and mixing with seawater.

Dissolved and sediment-bound Hg was measured regularly in the Zackenberg River throughout the periods with running water (June-October) and coupled to water discharge measurements. Also, a few samples of snow, soil, and permafrost were analysed for Hg. Mean concentrations of dissolved and sediment-bound Hg in the river water (+/- SD) were 039 +/- 0.13 and 5.5 +/- 1.4 ng L-1, respectively, and mean concentrations of Hg in the river sediment were 0.033 +/- 0.025 mg kg(-1). Temporal variations in river Hg were mainly associated with snowmelt, sudden erosion events, and outburst floods from a glacier-dammed lake in the upper part of the ZRB. Annual Hg exports from the 514 km(2) ZRB varied from 0.71 to >1.57 kg and the majority (86-96%) was associated with sediment-bound Hg. Hg yields from the ZRB varied from 1.4-3.1 g Hg km(-2) yr(-1) and were among the highest yields reported from Arctic river basins. River exports of Hg from ZRB were found to be largely controlled by the frequency, magnitude and timing of the glacial lake outburst floods, which occurred in four of the five years in July-August. Floods accounted for 5 to >10% of the annual water discharge, and up to >31% of the annual Hg export. Also, the winter snowfall and the summer temperatures were found to be important indirect controls on the annual Hg export. The occurrence and timing of glacial lake outburst floods in the ZRB in late summer at the time of maximum soil thaw depth, the location of the glacier in the upper ZRB, and increased thawing of the permafrost in Zackenberg in recent years leading to destabilisation of river banks are considered central factors explaining the high fraction of flood-controlled Hg export in this area.

Coupled Lake-Atmosphere-Land Physics Uncertainties in a Great Lakes Regional Climate Model	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												This study develops a surrogate-based method to assess the uncertainty within a convective permitting integrated modeling system of the Great Lakes region, arising from interacting physics parameterizations across the lake, atmosphere, and land surface. Perturbed physics ensembles of the model during the 2018 summer are used to train a neural network surrogate model to predict lake surface temperature (LST) and near-surface air temperature (T2m). Average physics uncertainties are determined to be 1.5 degrees ${}<^>{\circ}$C for LST and T2m over land, and 1.9 degrees ${}<^>{\circ}$C for T2m over lake, but these have significant spatiotemporal variations. We find that atmospheric physics parameterizations alone are the dominant sources of uncertainty (45%-53%), while lake and land parameterizations account for 33% and 38% of the uncertainty of LST and T2m over land respectively. Interactions of atmosphere physics parameterizations with those of the land and lake contribute to an additional 13%-17% of the total variance. LST and T2m over the lake are more uncertain in the deeper northern lakes, particularly during the rapid warming phase that occurs in late spring/early summer. The LST uncertainty increases with sensitivity to the lake model's surface wind stress scheme. T2m over land is more uncertain over forested areas in the north, where it is most sensitive to the land surface model, than the more agricultural land in the south, where it is most sensitive to the atmospheric planetary boundary and surface layer scheme. Uncertainty also increases in the southwest during multiday temperature declines with higher sensitivity to the land surface model.

J	Catsadorakis, G				Catsadorakis, G			The importance of Prespa National Park for breeding and wintering birds	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The breeding avifauna of Prespa National Park is of national and international importance both due to its high richness and the internationally important populations of rare species. The latter include the Dalmatian (Pelecanus crispus) and Great White (Pelecanus onocrotalus) pelicans and the Pygmy Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmaeus). Populations of national interest include Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), Greylag Goose (Anser anser), Goosander (Mergus merganser), Great White Egret (Egretta alba) and six other species of ardeids. Among the 261 bird species observed in the area of ca 250 km(2) since the late 60s, 164 breed and 41 are very rarely observed. Passage migrants and winter visitors include 91 species. Twelve breeding species became extinct in the National Park during the last 25 years and others are endangered. Raptors and aquatic birds suffered more due to habitat and land use alterations brought about by the construction of an irrigation scheme. Eighty-one species observed in the area are listed as in need of special protection in Annex I of the 79/409 EEC Directive and 32 of them breed. Lake Mikri Prespa is of virtually no importance for wintering waterfowl since it is frozen every winter, but the Greek part of Lake Megali Prespa, which never freezes, concentrates among other species the 20% and 35% respectively of the Great Crested Grebes and Tufted Ducks wintering in Greece.																			0018-8158					AUG 22	1997	351						157	174		10.1023/A:1003085013561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003085013561													WOS:A1997YG80000013
J	PACE, ML; MCMANUS, GB; FINDLAY, SEG				PACE, ML; MCMANUS, GB; FINDLAY, SEG			PLANKTONIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE DETERMINES THE FATE OF BACTERIAL PRODUCTION IN A TEMPERATE LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined the fate of planktonic bacterial production and the balance between bacterial growth and grazing mortality in the surface waters of Upton Lake, New York [USA]. Growth rates were measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. Grazing rates on bacteria were determined with small cells produced by a mutant strain of Escherichia coli and made either fluorescent or radioactive to monitor feeding. Bacterial community turnover times calculated from either growth or grazing rates ranged from 1.5 to 16 d. On the basis of these data and results from 29 other studies, most bacterial communities appear to have turnover times substantially > 1 d. Our measurements of feeding rates on bacteria frequently exceeded estimates of growth. Limitations of precision and doubts about the accuracy of methods make attempts to balance measurements of bacterial growth and grazing with current techniques unrealistic. The fate of bacterial production depends on planktonic community structure. Flagellates were the primary consumers of bacteria in winter and fall. At other times, Daphnia galeata consumed most of the bacterial production. Ciliates and rotifers were never important bacterial grazers. In Upton Lake large populations of Daphnia effectively "break" the microbial loop and funnel bacterial production to higher consumer.					; McManus, George/AAW-9055-2020	McManus, George/0000-0002-2768-1286; Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	1990	35	4					795	808		10.4319/lo.1990.35.4.0795	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1990.35.4.0795													WOS:A1990EB16800002

The History of Highly-Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Israel (H5-subtypes): from 2006 to 2023	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE												Avian Influenza (AI) has become the largest animal epidemic in the world. So far hundreds of millions birds have died or been culled due to the disease. A novel highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 virus, which emerged in 1996 in domestic geese in China, passed from wild waterfowl as a low-pathogenic (LP) virus, and in the domestic birds was modified to a High Pathogenic (HP) virus due to mutational addition of basic amino acids to the cleavage site of the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein. This "A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996" virus killed poultry but also infected at least 18 people of whom 6 died. In 2003-6 the virus spread to Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Mass mortality of migratory birds at the Salt Qinghai Lake in West China in 2005 was a turning point in the understanding of the virus co-circulation between poultry and wild birds. Israel is situated on migratory routes for over a billion birds each year in the autumn migration from Europe to Africa and in the northwards spring migration, thus the potential for virus transmission is high. The 1996's parental virus emerged in Israel in 2006, following the Qinghai Lake event, and included meat turkeys, heavy breeders and broilers. Since then, several focal outbreaks occurred in Israel every 1-3 years. In 2012, the same AIV-H5N1 was detected in meat turkeys and found also in alley cats following consumption of the bird carcasses, with 100% identity of the HA gene. A second multi-focal outbreak of AIV-H5N1 appeared in 2015 following the worldwide wave in 2014-15. This outbreak included meat turkeys, heavy breeders and egg layers. These viruses belonged phylogenetically to clade 2.2.1.2, emerged from previous clades 2.2 and 2.2.1.1. Reassortment of viral segments of a descendant-H5 AIV of the Chinese parental virus with AIV-N8 viruses created novel H5N8 viruses, first detected in China in 2010. An 2016's variant of this virus (group-B Gochang-like, clade 2.3.4.4), was discovered in May-June 2016 in wild swans at Lake Ubsu-Nur on the Russian-Mongolian border, and reached Central Asia, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Israel. The Ubsu-Nur 2016's AIV-H5N8 was genetically identical to an AIV-H5N8 that emerged in Israel six months later during the autumn migration. This was the first H5N8 outbreak in Israel, which included meat and breeder turkeys, heavy and light breeders, layers, breeder ducks and backyard poultry, but also many wild birds, not seen in the previous H5N1 outbreaks, of at least 16 species mostly waterfowl and raptors. The cleavage site of HA gene showed similarity between poultry and wild birds, as well as to grp B-2.3.4.4 European-Asian H5N8 viruses. Since October 2020, new H5 reassortants with LPAI viruses from wild birds contributed the Neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein, have appeared in Europe and created new H5 strains. A second global outbreak of a new H5 variant occurred in 2020-21 in Russia and the Palearctic region. Following this global outbreak, a second AIV-H5N8 outbreak appeared in Israel in 2020 during the autumn migration. The outbreak included meat and breeder turkeys, heavy breeders, broilers, game birds mainly black swans (Cygnus atratus), and wild birds. The 2021-22's AIV-H5N1 epidemic season was the largest so far in Europe and Eurasia, with about 2500 outbreaks in poultry and culling of 50 million birds, and about 3600 detections in wild birds. That outbreak followed the 2020's wave of the new AIV-H5N8. Following this epidemic, a third multi-focal outbreak of AIV-H5N1 occurred in Israel in 2021, in meat and breeder turkeys, heavy breeders, organic egg layers and meat ducks. The 2021's outbreak was characterized also by affecting many wild birds, not seen before in H5N1's outbreaks in Israel, while the largest affected population was Common cranes (Grus grus) on their migration routes from Russia and Scandinavia to Ethiopia and Sudan through Israel, undergoing mass mortality of almost 10,000 birds. Other threatened species like Marbled teal (Marmaronetta angustirostris) have died also due to this virus, as well as hundreds of Great white pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus), and several species of waterfowl and raptors. Classification of the viruses by whole genome sequencing (WGS) revealed the same group B-2.3.4.4 clade as in the H5N8 events and similarity between poultry and wild birds. This virus probably came from Russia in the autumn migration. A new outbreak of AIV-H5N1 began emerging in Israel from November 2022, in meat turkeys, heavy and light breeders, broilers. Unlike the 2021's outbreak, this virus affected only a few wild birds. HA gene sequencing revealed the virus belonged to the same group B-2.3.4.4 clade as in previous outbreaks. In conclusion, all avian influenza subtype H5 outbreaks in Israel followed the European-Eurasian outbreaks. The virus origin was from South East Asia, reaching Israel through spillover with migrating birds via Eurasia and Europe.

Investigation of the influence of wind stress in autumn leading to unstable stratification in a meromictic lake using three-dimensional numerical modeling	INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES IN MATERIAL SCIENCE, MECHANICAL AND AUTOMATION ENGINEERING - MIP: ENGINEERING - 2019	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				International Workshop on Advanced Technologies in Material Science, Mechanical and Automation Engineering (MIP) - Engineering	APR 04-06, 2019	Krasnoyarsk, RUSSIA	JSC Verder Sci				Currents in lakes affect the distribution of hydrophysical and hydrobiological characteristics. Three-dimensional model study is an important step toward an improved understanding and reliable prediction of the distribution of hydrophysical fields. Salt stratified lake Shira refers to meromictic reservoirs. The depth of the upper mixed layer depends on many factors (even a few isolated, fairly rare facts of its complete mixing are known). The study of the influence of each of them separately is the task of mathematical modeling. The model results indicate that strong wind stress in the autumn can result in unstable density stratification, leading to intense vertical circulation.																			1757-8981						2019	537								062072	10.1088/1757-899X/537/6/062072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/537/6/062072													WOS:000561105300386

The in situ abundance, biomass and mean cell volume of Actinophrys sol (Sarcodina: Heliozoa), the top predator in an extremely acidic German mining lake (Lake 111; pH 2.65), were determined over three consecutive years (spring to autumn, 2001-03). 2. Actinophrys sol exhibited pronounced temporal and vertical patterns in abundance, biomass and mean cell volume. Increasing from very low spring densities, maxima in abundance and biomass were observed in late June/early July and September. The highest mean abundance recorded during the study was 7 x 10(3) Heliozoa L-1. Heliozoan abundance and biomass were higher in the epilimnion than in the hypolimnion. Actinophrys sol cells from this acidic lake were smaller than individuals of the same species found in other aquatic systems. 3. We determined the growth rate of A. sol using all potential prey items available in, and isolated and cultured from, Lake 111. Prey items included: single-celled and filamentous bacteria of unknown taxonomic affinity, the mixotrophic flagellates Chlamydomonas acidophila and Ochromonas sp., the ciliate Oxytricha sp. and the rotifers Elosa worallii and Cephalodella hoodi. Actinophrys sol fed over a wide-size spectrum from bacteria to metazoans. Positive growth was not supported by all naturally available prey. Actinophrys sol neither increased in cell number (k) nor biomass (k(b)) when starved, with low concentrations of single-celled bacteria or with the alga Ochromonas sp. Positive growth was achieved with single-celled bacteria (k = 0.22 +/- 0.02 d(-1); k(b) = -0.06 +/- 0.02 d(-1)) and filamentous bacteria (k = 0.52 +/- < 0.01 d(-1); k(b) = 0.66 d(-1)) at concentrations greater than observed in situ, and the alga C. acidophila (up to k = 0.43 +/- 0.03 d(-1); k(b) = 0.44 +/- 0.04 d(-1)), the ciliate Oxytricha sp. (k = 0.34 +/- 0.01 d(-1)) and in mixed cultures containing rotifers and C. acidophila (k = 0.23 +/- 0.02-0.32 +/- 0.02 d(-1); maximum k(b) = 0.42 +/- 0.05 d(-1)). The individual- and biomass-based growth of A. sol was highest when filamentous bacteria were provided. 4. Existing quantitative carbon flux models for the Lake 111 food web can be updated in light of our results. Actinophrys sol are omnivorous predators supported by a mixed diet of filamentous bacteria and C. acidophila in the epilimnion.

The comparative recoveries of the 2 size-groups of trout planted were assessed by creel census and/or intensive gill netting. Recoveries of planted yearling brook trout were greater from lakes supporting few or no resident fish species (15.9-35.9%) and less in lakes supporting suckers, minnows and sticklebacks (5.9-14.8%). Experience was similar with fall fingerlings planted in the same set of lakes though comparative recoveries were less. Lakes with few fish competitors yielded 3.5-4.8 kg of trout for each kilogram of fall fingerlings planted compared with 2.9-3.0 kg for each kilogram of yearlings planted. The returns of trout from lakes also supporting resident species were only 0.3-0.8 kg for each kilogram of yearlings or fall fingerlings planted.																									1978	35	4					391	396		10.1139/f78-069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f78-069													WOS:A1978ET15200002

Commonly, these programs involve stocking hatchery reared juveniles into streams and thus, quantifying the in situ habitat use of stocked fish can help support these efforts. To examine habitat use, we stocked young-of-the-year (YOY) Atlantic salmon into 14 reaches of the Boquet River in the Lake Champlain Basin. The habitat used by YOY Atlantic salmon, measured from microhabitats that were used versus not used, differed between early and late summer for water depth. In early summer, YOY Atlantic salmon used a more narrow range of habitats compared to late summer. However, in both early and late summer, YOY most often used intermediate values in habitat variables except for water velocity in early summer. In early summer, YOY Atlantic salmon had the highest probability of using a water depth of 26 cm, a water velocity of 1 cm/sec, and a pebble substrate. In late summer, the probability of use was highest at a water depth of 61 cm, a water velocity of 11 cm/sec, and a pebble substrate. Our results show that stocked landlocked YOY Atlantic salmon use similar habitats to anadromous populations and may help managers when determining stocking locations or habitat alterations.

Based on a series of long-term quality-controlled data collected at the Wudaogou Hydrological Experiment Station in the Huaibei Plain, Anhui, China, the variation trends of the evaporation rate of phreatic water from bare soil were studied through the Mann-Kendall trend test and the linear regression trend test, followed by the study on the responses of evaporation to climate change. Results indicated that in the Huaibei Plain during 1991-2008, evaporation of phreatic water from bare soil tended to increase at a rate of 5% on monthly scale in March, June and July while in other months the increase was minor. On the seasonal basis, the evaporation saw significant increase in spring and summer. In addition, annual evaporation tended to grow evidently over time. When air temperature rises by 1 degrees C, the annual evaporation rate increases by 7.24-14.21%, while when the vapor pressure deficit rises by 10%, it changes from -0.09 to 5.40%. The study also provides references for further understanding of the trends and responses of regional evapotranspiration to climate change.

Cold stress defense in the freshwater sponge Lubomirskia baicalensis	FEBS JOURNAL												The endemic freshwater sponge Lubomirskia baicalensis lives in Lake Baikal in winter (samples from March have been studied) under complete ice cover at near 0 degrees C, and in summer in open water at 17 degrees C (September). In March, specimens show high metabolic activity as reflected by the production of gametes. L. baicalensis lives in symbiosis with green dinoflagellates, which are related to Gymnodinium sanguineum. Here we show that these dinoflagellates produce the toxin okadaic acid (OA), which is present as a free molecule as well as in a protein-bound state. In metazoans OA inhibits both protein phosphatase-2A and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). Only cDNA corresponding to PP1 could be identified in L. baicalensis and subsequently isolated from a L. baicalensis cDNA library. The deduced polypeptide has a molecular mass of 36 802 Da and shares the characteristic domains known from other protein phosphatases. As determined by western blot analysis, the relative amount of PP1 is almost the same in March (under ice) and September (summer). PP1 is not inhibited by low OA concentrations (100 nM); concentrations above 300 nM are required for inhibition. A sponge cell culture system (primmorphs) was used to show that at low temperatures (4 degrees C) expression of hsp70 is strongly induced and hsp70 synthesis is augmented after incubation with 100 nM OA to levels measured at 17 degrees C. In the enriched extract, PP1 activity at 4 degrees C is close to that measured at 17 degrees C. Immunoabsorption experiments revealed that hsp70 contributes to the high protein phosphatase activity at 4 degrees C. From these data we conclude that the toxin OA is required for the expression of hsp70 at low temperature, and therefore contributes to the cold resistance of the sponge.

J	Tananaev, N				Tananaev, Nikita			Late Summer Water Sources in Rivers and Lakes of the Upper Yana River Basin, Northern Eurasia, Inferred from Hydrological Tracer Data	HYDROLOGY												Major ions, stable isotopes, and trace elements, including rare earth elements (REEs), are used as natural tracers in the qualitative assessment of potential water sources in lakes and rivers of the upper Yana River basin, between Verkhoyansk and Chersky Ranges, during the late summer period. Three distinct regions were sampled, and a dominant water source in each region was qualitatively inferred from water chemistry data. The REE distribution pattern was found to be highly regional and controlled by pH and carbonate contents. Mountain headwater stream at the Verkhoyansk Range north slope, the Dulgalakh River, shows an input from a mixture of shallow groundwater and icing meltwater, with a depleted isotopic signature (delta O-18 below -21 parts per thousand), d-excess (d(ex) = delta 2H - 8 center dot delta 18O) above 18, enrichment in Mg and Sr, and depletion in heavy REEs. The Derbeke Depression lakes and streams are fed by rainfall having ultra-low total dissolved solids (TDS) content, below 25 mg/L, and a convex-up REE pattern. In a medium mountainous river at the Chersky Range flank, the Dogdo River, leaching through fissured Jurassic carbonates is a dominant runoff pathway. Riverine water is heavily depleted in light REEs, but enriched in Mo, Rb, Sb, W and U. In the Dulgalakh River water, high positive Sm and Gd anomalies were observed, attributed either to local geology (greenshists), historical mining legacy, or contemporary winter road operations.

We collected 201 water samples from rivers and lakes in Scotland across different sampling years and seasons. Relationships among the hydrophobic (HPO) fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM), specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)), and dissolved metals (Al and Fe) were examined to better understand their co-transportation in Scottish waters. The average DOM, HPO fraction, Fe, and Al concentrations for all the samples co-varied and were lower during winter than during summer. There was a strong positive correlation between DOM and HPO fraction concentrations (R-2=0.99, p<0.0001). A significant positive correlation was also found between the HPO fraction and Fe and Al concentrations. The regression slope indicating the overall relationships between the HPO fraction and Fe concentrations differed by as much as 12 times depending on both the sampling period and the river. These slope differences were not significantly determined by the chemical structures of DOM, SUVA(254), or Al and Cu concentrations. These results suggest that the Fe transport capacities vary among the Scottish rivers because of other factors such as seasonal effects (temperature and the level of water table) and a suspended solid concentration in the water column.					; Kida, Morimaru/GLU-9029-2022	Fujitake, Nobuhide/0000-0002-4089-1579; Kida, Morimaru/0000-0002-9908-2012; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2019	20	2					215	224		10.1007/s10201-018-0569-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-018-0569-8													WOS:000462932600009
J	Laudon, H; Bishop, KH				Laudon, H; Bishop, KH			Quantifying sources of acid neutralisation capacity depression during spring flood episodes in Northern Sweden	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Quantitatively separating the anthropogenic and natural contributions to acid neutralisation capacity (ANC) depression during spring flood is complicated by the many factors which contribute to this depression. Besides anthropogenic sulphate and nitrate, there are natural influences which include dilution, organic acids, sea salts, as well as strong mineral acid anions from bedrock and/or sediment. This paper presents a model for separating and quantifying the effects of dilution, organic acids and strong mineral acids on the ANC for five streams in Northern Sweden during the spring floods of 1994 and 1995. The basis of the model is that the baseflow prior to and following the event is essentially unaffected by acid deposition and hence can act as the chemical baseline for the episode. The relative contribution of different factors to the spring flood ANC depression are calculated with reference to the dilution of a conservative hydrological tracer. The most important contributor to the ANC decline was found to be dilution of baseflow and organic acids in this remote region of Europe with relatively low acid deposition levels.

The Postglacial development of the basins and regional palaeoclimatic pattern in the Holocene implied a specific succession of biota communities passing through lakes' subsequent stages in the water level, trophic state and habitat availability. The Great Serteya Palaeolake Basin is the largest palaeolake within the Serteyka lake-river system, which has been functioning since the Late Weichselian (Vistulian). Presented below is a multi-proxy study on the sequence from the paleolake within the present-day valley. During the Late Weichselian, it formed an astatic, and later a permanent, water body of Postglacial origin. The associated melting, flooding and aeolian processes acted as sources of various Late Weichselian sediments. Summer mean air temperature drove the lake ecosystem development. The Holocene Thermal Optimum in 8.5-7.7 kyr cal BP was followed by subsequent lower temperature. There is weak evidence of coole oscillations at 8.2 kyr cal BP, 7.0-6.8 kyr cal BP and 5.8-5.9 kyr cal BP and the Little Ice Age (480-395 yr cal BP), until modern time (-65 yr cal BP). Five stages of lake ecosystem development were identified based on the biota: 1) an initial stage during the Late Weichselian with glaciolacustrine and later lacustrine accumulation of inorganic deposits, 2) the stage with Cladocera as a leading indicators of mesotrophic water body with a well-developed pelagic zone supplied by early spring floods of the Serteyka River, carrying melting snow and ice floes to the lake basin, 3) the stage dominated by Chironomidae and diatoms typical to high trophic states reflecting widespread open bottom sediment and macrophyte habitats 4) a stage with distinct Neolithic community impact reflected by macrofossils remain after pile-dwelling					Syrykh, Liudmila/K-8331-2018; Gruszczyńska, Agnieszka/AGX-6093-2022; Płóciennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018; Szmańda, Jacek/AAX-5006-2020; Krapiec, Marek/MZS-2008-2025; Rzodkiewicz (nee Lutyńska), Monika/KBD-2533-2024; Plociennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018; Nazarova, Larisa/C-8926-2014; Kurzawska, Aldona/GYQ-5208-2022; Pawlowski, Dominik/KCZ-1312-2024; Kittel, Piotr/F-5586-2013	Rzodkiewicz (Lutynska), Monika/0000-0002-6672-2183; Kurzawska, Aldona/0000-0003-0215-046X; Plociennik, Mateusz/0000-0003-1487-6698; Gruszczynska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-3534-7843; Nazarova, Larisa/0000-0003-4145-9689; Pawlowski, Dominik/0000-0003-4616-6666; Kittel, Piotr/0000-0001-6987-7968; Krapiec, Marek/0000-0003-4270-1668; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688													0341-8162	1872-6887				JUL	2022	214								106206	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106206		MAY 2022											WOS:000797997800001

The beginning of peat-tufa deposition took place in a Boreal phase, after a significant cool fluctuation of climate occurring ca. 9.4 ka cal. BP. We suggest that climate was the most important factor conditioning the development of the spring-fed fen. Permafrost degradation, and then wet periods, intensified the activity of ascending springs. The impact of humans was possible since the Neolithic period and increased during the Middle Ages: therefore, the anthropogenic influence could have partially overlapped with the regional tendencies of climate changes. Autogenic development of deposit succession in the studied fen was definitely conditioned by hydrological changes induced by climate. Based on the multi-proxy data, 12 cold events of different ranks were identified. They are also recorded in other Polish and European sites. A record of distinct variability of depositional conditions at ca. 9.4, 8.2, 5.9, 4.6, 2.8, 1.4 and 0.55 ka cal. BP corresponds to quasi-periodical global climate changes in the Holocene named the Bond events. The majority of the cold events recorded in delta C-13 and delta O-18 of carbonates can be correlated to the Greenland oxygen isotope curve.

The falling Lake Victoria water level: GRACE, TRIMM and CHAMP satellite analysis of the lake basin	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												In the last 5 years, Lake Victoria water level has seen a dramatic fall that has caused alarm to water resource managers. Since the lake basin contributes about 20% of the lakes water in form of discharge, with 80% coming from direct rainfall, this study undertook a satellite analysis of the entire lake basin in an attempt to establish the cause of the decline. Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellites were employed in the analysis. Using 45 months of data spanning a period of 4 years (2002 - 2006), GRACE satellite data are used to analyse the variation of the geoid (equipotential surface approximating the mean sea level) triggered by variation in the stored waters within the lake basin. TRMM Level 3 monthly data for the same period of time are used to compute mean rainfall for a spatial coverage of .25 degrees x.25 degrees (25 x 25 km) and the rainfall trend over the same period analyzed. To assess the effect of evaporation, 59 CHAMP satellite's occultation for the period 2001 to 2006 are analyzed for tropopause warming. GRACE results indicate an annual fall in the geoid by 1.574 mm/year during the study period 2002 - 2006. This fall clearly demonstrates the basin losing water over these period. TRMM results on the other hand indicate the rainfall over the basin (and directly over the lake) to have been stable during this period. The CHAMP satellite results indicate the tropopause temperature to have fallen in 2002 by about 3.9 K and increased by 2.2 K in 2003 and remained above the 189.5 K value of 2002. The tropopause heights have shown a steady increase from a height of 16.72 m in 2001 and has remained above this value reaching a maximum of 17.59 km in 2005, an increase in height by 0.87 m. Though the basin discharge contributes only 20%, its decline has contributed to the fall in the lake waters. Since rainfall over the period remained stable, and temperatures did not increase drastically to cause massive evaporation, the remaining major contributor is the discharge from the expanded Owen Falls dam.

Species included walleye Stizostedion vitreum, yellow perch Perca flavescens, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus and white bass Morone chrysops. Thirty taxa were identified in diets. including 12 species of fish. We found dramatic differences in diets among species, among age-classes within species and over time. Walleye, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and white bass were piscivorous at age 0. Black crappie began piscivory at age 1. Yellow perch also began piscivory at age 1, but fish were a very small fraction of age-1 diets. The primary temporal pattern, seen in several species and age-classes, was an increase in piscivory from spring to fall. This pattern was due to the lack of small, age-0 prey fish in spring. Although some patterns were evident, the taxonomic composition of the diets of all species was highly variable over time, making generalizations difficult, A surprising result was the absence of yellow perch in the diet of age-0 walleye, despite their abundance in Spirit Lake and prominence in diets of age-1 walleye and other age 1-piscivores. Age-0 yellow perch were consistently too large to be eaten by age-0 piscivores, which preyed primarily on invertebrates and smaller fish such as johnny darters Etheostoma nigrum and age 0 bluegill Lepomis macrochirus. This finding suggests that predator-prey interactions and resulting population dynamics may be quite different in Spirit Lake than in other systems dominated by walleye and yellow perch.																			0906-6691					DEC	2001	10	4					198	211		10.1034/j.1600-0633.2001.100402.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0633.2001.100402.x													WOS:000173979100002
J	HANSON, MA; BUTLER, MG				HANSON, MA; BUTLER, MG			RESPONSES OF PLANKTON, TURBIDITY, AND MACROPHYTES TO BIOMANIPULATION IN A SHALLOW PRAIRIE LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We evaluated effects of complete fish kill in a large, shallow, eutrophic lake in Minnesota. Low densities of Bosmina and Chydorus (<100.L-1) were replaced in the early spring/early summer by high densities of larger Daphnia galeata and D. pulex (>100.L-1) during the first year after the fish kill (1988). During peak daphnid abundance (May-June), chlorophyll a concentrations and edible phytoplankton were reduced, water transparency increased, and submerged macrophytes expanded. Orthophosphate and ammonia were detectable during clear-water phases, indicating that phytoplankton were not severely nutrient limited. Increased water transparency in subsequent years (1989-90) apparently was related to decreased sediment resuspension and lower algal biomass owing to the expansion of submerged plants. The fish kill invoked a strong initial response that transmitted to the phytoplankton level and increased water clarity. Higher transparency persisted during subsequent years because submerged macrophytes both responded to improved water clarity and subsequently prolonged it. These results support the contention that removal of fish from shallow lakes may invoke 'cascading impacts' that enhance water clarity, stimulate macrophytes, and establish a, new steady state.																			0706-652X					MAY	1994	51	5					1180	1188		10.1139/f94-117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-117													WOS:A1994PA36700019

Application of an extreme winter storm scenario to identify vulnerabilities, mitigation options, and science needs in the Sierra Nevada mountains, USA	NATURAL HAZARDS												In the Sierra Nevada mountains (USA), and geographically similar areas across the globe where human development is expanding, extreme winter storm and flood risks are expected to increase with changing climate, heightening the need for communities to assess risks and better prepare for such events. In this case study, we demonstrate a novel approach to examining extreme winter storm and flood risks. We incorporated high-resolution atmospheric-hydrologic modeling of the ARkStorm extreme winter storm scenario with multiple modes of engagement with practitioners, including a series of facilitated discussions and a tabletop emergency management exercise, to develop a regional assessment of extreme storm vulnerabilities, mitigation options, and science needs in the greater Lake Tahoe region of Northern Nevada and California, USA. Through this process, practitioners discussed issues of concern across all phases of the emergency management life cycle, including preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation. Interruption of transportation, communications, and interagency coordination were among the most pressing concerns, and specific approaches for addressing these issues were identified, including prepositioning resources, diversifying communications systems, and improving coordination among state, tribal, and public utility practitioners. Science needs included expanding real-time monitoring capabilities to improve the precision of meteorological models and enhance situational awareness, assessing vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure, and conducting cost-benefit analyses to assess opportunities to improve both natural and human-made infrastructure to better withstand extreme storms. Our approach and results can be used to support both land use and emergency planning activities aimed toward increasing community resilience to extreme winter storm hazards in mountainous regions.					; Dettinger, Michael/JAC-9558-2023	Dettinger, Michael/0000-0002-7509-7332; 													0921-030X	1573-0840				JAN	2016	80	2					879	900		10.1007/s11069-015-2003-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-015-2003-4													WOS:000367305200011

Testing for synchrony in recruitment among four Lake Michigan fish species	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In the Great Lakes region, multiple fish species display intraspecific spatial synchrony in recruitment success, with interannual climate variation hypothesized as the most likely driver. In Lake Michigan, we evaluated whether climatic or other physical variables could also induce spatial synchrony across multiple species, including bloater (Coregonus hoyi), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). The residuals from stock-recruitment relationships revealed yellow perch recruitment to be correlated with recruitment of both rainbow smelt (r = 0.37) and alewife (r = 0.36). Across all four species, higher than expected recruitment occurred in 5 years between 1978 and 1987 and then switched to lower than expected recruitment in 5 years between 1996 and 2004. Generalized additive models revealed warmer spring and summer water temperatures and lower wind speeds corresponded to higher than expected recruitment for the nearshorespawning species, and overall variance explained ranged from 14% (yellow perch) to 61% (alewife). For all species but rainbow smelt, higher recruitment also occurred in extremely high or low years of the North Atlantic Oscillation index. Future development of indices that describe the physical Great Lakes environment could improve understanding of how climate can synchronize fish populations within and across species.

Wind-Driven subinertial Circulation inside a Semienclosed Bay in the Gulf of California	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												Moored current and pressure observations were obtained at Bahia Concepcion, a semienclosed bay located on the eastern side of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico, to describe the wind-driven subinertial circulation. In winter and early spring, the bay is well mixed and forced by persistent winds toward the southeast, aligned with the central axis. The authors' observations show that the sea surface rises downwind in response to wind stress and that there exists a crosswind drift at the surface that is consistent with Ekman dynamics. This feature is typical of a bay that is deeper than one Ekman depth and hence affected by the rotation of the earth. There is a persistent along-bay circulation toward the end of the bay along its western side with return flow on the opposite side. Drifters released near the surface across a transect move westward and downwind toward the closed end, where they recirculate cyclonically. Wind-driven linear theoretical models successfully predict the observed cross-bay circulation but fail to predict the along-bay flow pattern. The role of spatial inhomogeneities of wind stress (suggested by synoptic observations of the wind) and nonlinearities related to advection of momentum is investigated with theoretical and numerical modeling. Both mechanisms can contribute to the observed pattern of along-bay circulation. Even though the observations discussed were taken during the relatively well-mixed season, density fluctuations are shown to play, at times, an active role dynamically.

J	Lemly, AD				Lemly, AD			Ecosystem recovery following selenium contamination in a freshwater reservoir	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Belews Lake, North Carolina, was contaminated by selenium in wastewater released from a coal-fired electric generating facility during 1974-1985, Selenium bioaccumulated in aquatic food chains and caused severe reproductive failure and teratogenic deformities in fish, Beginning in 1986, the electric utility company changed its ash disposal practices and selenium-laden wastewater no longer entered the lake, A survey of selenium present in the water, sediments, benthic invertebrates, fish, and aquatic birds was conducted in 1996, Concentrations were compared to pre-1986 levels to determine how much change occurred during the decade since selenium inputs stopped, The data were also examined using a hazard assessment protocol to determine if ecosystem-level hazards to fish and aquatic birds had changed as well, Results reveal that waterborne selenium fell from a peak of 20 mu g/liter before 1986, to <1 mu g/liter in 1996; concentrations in biota were 85-95% lower in 1996, Hazard ratings indicate that high hazard existed prior to 1986 and that moderate hazard is still present, primarily due to selenium in the sediment-detrital food pathway, Concentrations of selenium in sediments have fallen by about 65-75%, but remain sufficiently elevated (1-4 mu g/g) to contaminate benthic food organisms of fish and aquatic birds, Field evidence confirmed the validity of the hazard ratings, Developmental abnormalities in young fish indicate that selenium-induced teratogenesis and reproductive impairment are occurring, Moreover, the concentrations of selenium in benthic food organisms are sufficient to cause mortality in young bluegill and other centrarchids because of Winter Stress Syndrome, At the ecosystem level, recovery has been slow, Toxic effects are still evident 10 years after selenium inputs were stopped, The sediment-associated selenium will likely continue to be a significant hazard to fish and aquatic birds for years.

J	Gurung, TB; Urabe, J				Gurung, TB; Urabe, J			Temporal and vertical difference in factors limiting growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria in Lake Biwa	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Dilution bioassays were performed to examine the seasonal and vertical difference in the relative importance of factors limiting growth of heterotrophic bacteria in Lake Biwa. The lake water diluted by 0.2 mu m lake filtrate (1:6.6) was enriched either with glucose (C), inorganic phosphorus (P), ammonium nitrogen (N), amino acids (AA), or a combination of these, and incubated for 2 days at the depths where lake water was collected (2.5, 20 and 30 m depths). Experiments showed that at 2.5 m, P was the most deficient resource for bacterial growth, but the magnitude of P limitation depended on water temperature. Among others, amino acids showed a slight but significant stimulation of bacterial growth rates during the fall. At 20 and 30 m, however, growth stimulation by resource addition was rarely detected. Vertically reciprocal translocation experiments revealed that the growth rate was limited by low temperature rather than resource supply at the greater depths. The results support a simple view that bacterial growth rate is basically regulated by water temperature, but high growth rate is not realized in summer because of resource depletion. The present study suggests that both temperature and P supply play a crucial role in biogeochemical cycling of organic matter in Lake Biwa through the bacterial growth rate.

Testing seasonal and long-term controls of streamwater DOC using empirical and process-based models	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					5th International Symposium on Ecosystem Behavior	JUN 25-30, 2006	Univ Calf Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA		Univ Calf Santa Cruz			Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface waters are increasing across Europe and parts of North America. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these increases including reductions in acid deposition, change in frequency of winter storms and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. We used two modelling approaches to identify the mechanisms responsible for changing surface water DOC concentrations. Empirical regression analysis and INCA-C, a process-based model of stream-water DOC, were used to simulate long-term (1986-2003) patterns in stream water DOC concentrations in a small boreal stream. Both modelling approaches successfully simulated seasonal and inter-annual patterns in DOC concentration. In both models, seasonal patterns of DOC concentration were controlled by hydrology and inter-annual patterns were explained by climatic variation. There was a non-linear relationship between warmer summer temperatures and INCA-C predicted DOC. Only the empirical model was able to satisfactorily simulate the observed long-term increase in DOC. The observed long-term trends in DOC are likely to be driven by in-soil processes controlled by SO42- and Cl- deposition, and to a lesser extent by temperature-controlled processes. Given the projected changes in climate and deposition, future modelling and experimental research should focus on the possible effects of soil temperature and moisture on organic carbon production, sorption and desorption rates, and chemical controls on organic matter solubility.

Puye grande (Galaxias platei) is an endemic freshwater fish of Patagonia with little known about its life history traits. To bridge this information gap, comprehensive studies under controlled conditions could expand our basal understanding of puye grande's life history. We conducted a long-term experimental study using one cohort of puye grande throughout its lifespan. We collected 423 postlarvae individuals from the Ri & ntilde;ihue Lake (southern Chile) and reared them for 11 years under captivity. We documented the maximum longevity of this species as 11 years, with a survival rate of 0.47% for the entire study period. Hatchery-reared individuals showed isometric growth (b = 2.75). Parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth model were asymptotic total length L-infinity = 20.80 cm, growth coefficient K = 0.75 yr(-1), and theoretical age at-length zero t(0) = 0.45 yr, including both sexes. Puye grande showed an iteroparous life history, with the first spawning event occurring at age 2+ and consecutive spawning events occurring mainly in fall and winter. Females had a mean (standard deviation) total fecundity of up to 58 500 (23 331) eggs individual(-1) and a mean relative fecundity in fall of 621 (109) eggs g(-1) wet mass; males had a mean spermatic density of 28.41 (4.18) x 10(9) spermatozoa mL(-1). The embryonic development until eclosion occurred 432 h post fertilization (hpf) at 12 degrees C. Our valuable baseline findings about the life history of puye grande can contribute to future strategies for managing and conserving galaxiids under global environmental change in Patagonia.					; Arismendi, Ivan/B-3144-2010	Figueroa, Guillermo/0000-0001-7446-9934; Arismendi, Ivan/0000-0002-8774-9350													2044-2041	2044-205X				OCT 2	2023	13	4					514	525		10.1080/20442041.2023.2286174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2023.2286174		MAR 2024											WOS:001190775800001
J	AHO, J				AHO, J			WINTER OXYGEN-CONTENT IN RELATION TO WATER TEMPERATURE AND DURATION OF ICE COVER IN SOUTHERN FINLAND	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												The rate of O2 depletion during the winter and its dependence on water temperature and length of ice cover were studied in 2 different lake ecosystems in the Lake District of southern Finland during the winters of 1962-1977. In the non-polluted lake the O2 concentration in late winter depends primarily on water temperature, and on how long the lake remains ice-bound whereas in the system heavily loaded with waste waters the winter loss of dissolved O2 is dependent primarily on the duration of the ice cover. The reason for the difference is discussed. The results have a practical application to the date of hydrographic measurements. In a non-polluted lake measurements can be made at a fixed date each year. In a polluted lake, however, the yearly hydrographic analyses should preferably be made at a fixed interval after the lake ices over, in attempts to estimate the changes due to the waste water load.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1978	15	1					1	7																WOS:A1978EV96500001

To determine temporal dynamics and precipitation effects on micro-eukaryotic assemblages, we monitored upstream (SJ) and downstream (MG) sites of the Nakdonggang River, monthly or bimonthly, from March 2019 to April 2021 using an eDNA metabarcoding technique. We observed 775 unique operational taxonomic units during the entire sampling period using the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene as a marker. In the cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis based on the relative abundance ratio of the micro-eukaryotic assemblages at the SJ and MG sites, respectively, both regions were classified by four seasons, with dominant taxa for each season being different. Whereas Chlorophyta was relatively abundant in the MG site during summer, diatoms were most abundant at the SJ site during winter. Further, metazoan taxa were relatively abundant at the MG site. Total detection of metazoa, protozoa, and microalgae taxa significantly increased with heavy rainfall. In addition, the indicator taxa representative for heavy rainfall and tolerance ranges of the amount of precipitation were predicted at both sites. As the frequency of drought and heavy rain is expected to increase owing to climate change, efforts to standardize the relation between precipitation and eDNA analysis are required.

Major and trace elements in suspended matter of western Siberian rivers: First assessment across permafrost zones and landscape parameters of watersheds	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												In contrast to good understanding of chemical composition of the river suspended matter (RSM) of large rivers, small rivers remain strongly understudied, despite the fact that they can provide valuable information on mechanisms of RSM generation and transport depending on key environmental parameters of the watershed. This is especially true for permafrost-affected boreal and subarctic territories, subjected to strong modification due to permafrost thaw and landscape changes under climate warming. We selected Earth's largest frozen peatland zone, the western Siberia Lowland (WSL) in order to test an impact of climate warming, permafrost thaw and landscape zone changes on riverine transport of particulate material from mainland to the Arctic Ocean. We sampled 33 small and medium size WSL rivers during spring flood, summer baseflow and autumn flood over a 1700 km gradient of climate and permafrost. Major and trace elements in particulate (>0.45 mu m) and dissolved (<0.45 mu m) fraction were analyzed. We hypothesize that future increase in active layer thickness and the change of dominant landscape from bogs and lakes to forest can be predicted via analyzing the actual pattern of RSM chemical composition across various permafrost zones and landscape parameters of WSL river watershed. We observed a minimum concentration of Li, Mg, Na, K, Rb, V, Cr, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni, Al, Ga, Y, REEs, Nb, W, Ti, Zr, Hf, Th and U in RSM collected from isolated and sporadic permafrost zones. Considering all seasons together, the presence of forest in the permafrost-bearing zone increased particulate concentrations of all alkalis and alkaline-earth elements, B, As, Nb, Mn, Co, Al, Ga, REEs, Ti, Zr, Hf, Th. This is consistent with element mobilization from mineral horizons that become available for interacting with soil fluids under forested regions. Lakes retained particulate alkaline-earths, Fe, Mn, Co, trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates (TE3+, TE4+). The concentration of lithogenic low-soluble elements (TE3+, TE4+) in the RSM strongly increased with the river size (watershed area). Compared to the world RSM average, the WSL rivers exhibited lower concentrations of all elements except Mn and P and a low share of suspended elements relative to total (suspended + dissolved) forms of trace metals and of low-mobility (lithogenic) elements. Likely reasons for these features are: (i) low runoff and low RSM concentration as there is no rock and mineral substrate exposed to physical weathering in WSL peatland; (ii) organic, rather than mineral, nature of surrounding "solid" substrates and as a result, organic rather than silicate nature of RSM, and (iii) high DOC and Fe concentration leading to high concentrations of typically low-solubilty elements in the dissolved (<0.45 mu m) fraction due to colloids. From a climate warming perspective, the increase in active layer thickness and involvement of mineral horizons into soil fluid migration in discontinuous to continuous permafrost zone will likely increase the share of particulate fraction in total element transport for many soluble (labile) elements and also lithogenic elements in WSL rivers. At the same time, permafrost boundary shift northward may decrease particulate concentrations of most major and TE in rivers of discontinuous permafrost zone. The lake drainage and forest colonization of tundra and bogs in the permafrost-affected part of WSL may increase the concentration of alkali and alkaline-earth elements, divalent metals and trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates. As a result, export of particulate metal micronutrients and toxicants from the WSL territory to the Arctic Ocean may increase. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The suitability of diverse grass species in binary mixtures with birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) in rotational stocking systems has not been extensively studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate binary mixtures of five cool-season grasses with the birdsfoot trefoil cultivar Norcen for herbage mass, botanical composition, and cattle (Bos taurus) grazing preference under a rotational stocking. Experiments were established at Lake City and Chatham, MI, in 1994. Binary mixtures were grazed for 2 yr with beef or dairy cows three times yearly at predetermined periods from spring to fall. Total herbage dry mass production ranged from 3 to 10 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over two years and locations. The grass fraction in binary mixtures was 327 to 946 g kg(-1) in swards over two years and locations. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) failed to persist at Lake City, probably due to less consistent snow cover. Birdsfoot trefoil fraction was highest in binary mixtures with smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss) and timothy (Phleum pratense L.). Binary mixtures with orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) produced the highest herbage biomass but were less preferred by grazing animals while binary mixtures with timothy and smooth bromegrass were associated with the highest apparent herbage utilization at both locations (84-100%).																			0002-1962					NOV-DEC	2002	94	6					1257	1262		10.2134/agronj2002.1257	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2002.1257													WOS:000182260900005

Water ecosystems are mainly subjected to the abiotic influences of higher temperature and increased mixing. This study presents the thermal and oxygen conditions in a lake used for cooling water as well as the chemical changes occurring in it. There is a spatial differentiation in the temperature of the water surface over time periods ( in summer and winter). The vertical water temperature changes were definitely different from those of natural, unaffected lakes. Apart from a higher average water temperature, typical mixing and stratification periods were not observed. This apparently affected the dissolved oxygen conditions. The observed absence of a dissolved oxygen deficit resulted from the lack of a thermocline, which positively affected water quality. As a result, the two anthropogenic factors, i.e., the discharge of warm water and increased mixing, have flattened the negative effects on the lake. A new characteristic equilibrium for this lake was established. Single factors have been compensated for by this equilibrium. A relationship between temperature and biomass concentration was observed. The trophic state index (TSI) values permit classifying Rybnik Reservoir as a eutrophic lake.

These complex interplays between "natural" and anthropogenic forcings hinder the identification of fire-climate linkages on the long time scale. In this paper, we focused on the Last Glacial-Holocene transition, which is the last time Europe experienced rapid warming of similar magnitude and rate of change as predicted for the future, and with minimal human impact (no agricultural activities). We derived fire activity from two neighbouring lacustrine macrocharcoal records, Ech paleolake and Lake Lourdes, located 3 km apart. To understand the effect of external forcings, we reconstructed summer TA degrees changes and vegetation dynamics from two independent proxies. We then compared both paleofire records with chironomid-inferred summer air temperature reconstruction from Ech paleolake. We discuss the role of vegetation type, structure and biomass availability using pollen analysis from Ech paleolake and Lourdes. Fire activity is strongly modulated by summer TA degrees oscillations as shown by the highly contrasted responses between the Oldest Dryas/Interstadial and Younger Dryas/Holocene transitions. However, vegetation type and biomass availability act as limiting factors: the slight increase in fire activity at the onset of the Interstadial is triggered by a 7 A degrees C summer TA degrees increase but remains limited by low availability of woody biomass in a steppe environment. On the contrary, the onset of the Holocene is characterised by a 2 A degrees C summer TA degrees increase and an unprecedented increase in fire activity, conditioned by the establishment of dense deciduous forests.					; Millet, Laurent/F-8730-2014; Vannière, Boris/E-4002-2010; Vanniere, Boris/E-4002-2010	Rius, Damien/0000-0002-5793-9292; Vanniere, Boris/0000-0002-6779-6053; Millet, Laurent/0000-0003-2050-206X													0939-6314	1617-6278				NOV	2014	23	6					729	742		10.1007/s00334-013-0422-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-013-0422-2													WOS:000342486400007
J	Zhang, ZQ; Wang, GP; Liu, XH; Jia, HJ				Zhang, Zhenqing; Wang, Guoping; Liu, Xiaohui; Jia, Hongjuan			Holocene controls on wetland carbon accumulation in the Sanjiang Plain, China	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Understanding the response of carbon (C) accumulation to past climate changes can provide useful insights for predicting the fate of C in a future, warmer world. Here, we present data from three well-dated peat cores that reveal the history of wetland C accumulation in the Sanjiang Plain (China), and its links to Holocene climate and environmental changes. Regional C accumulation was largely governed by monsoon-driven depositional conditions. Before similar to 4400 cal year BP, the strong summer monsoon favored development of lakes with relatively slow and stable C accumulation rates, similar to 20 g C m(-2) year(-1). Thereafter, with the sharp decline in summer monsoon precipitation, peatlands began to form at the expense of the paleolakes, leading to a roughly sixfold increase in the C accumulation rate. This was a consequence of the higher primary production in peatlands compared to lakes. During the interval from 4400 to 500 cal year BP, the gradually increasing C accumulation rate responded to the decreasing strength of the summer monsoon. The decline in C accumulation rate over the past 500 years is attributed to both the strengthened summer monsoon and intensified human influences.

The long-running Adopt-a-Beach (TM) (MB) program, administered by the Alliance for the Great Lakes, has directed volunteer litter collection on Great Lakes beaches since 2003. We analyzed all AAB records for 5 Lake Michigan beaches that span a population gradient to quantify total AL density, infer primary sources of AL, characterize seasonal patterns, and compare data to marine beaches. Human population density was positively related to AL density across the 5 sites, and >72% of AL was smoking and food-related. Results indicated that most AL originated from activities occurring on or near the beaches, while other potential sources were minor (i.e., fishing, illicit dumping, sewage, or waterway activities). At all sites, AL was more abundant in the fall, which suggested that municipal beach cleaning might be effective at reducing abundance in summer. Finally, AL density was low relative to marine beaches, which we attributed to lack of AL from offshore, removal via beach cleaning, and the methodological artifacts and inherent variation within the large, citizen science data set. Future studies of AL dynamics on Great Lakes beaches will benefit from quantifying AL removal via cleaning, AL movement and decomposition, its effects on beach organisms, and additional comparisons to well-studied habitats worldwide.

Leaves, ovuliferous squama, seed cones, seeds, fruits, logs and underground storage organs with diverse conservation states are analyzed. The archaeobotanical record was compared with a reference collection and diagnostic characteristics were identified with a binocular loupe. Diagnostic histological cuts of the wood were made and observed using an optical microscope. In addition, a chemical study of anthocyanin extraction was performed on the colored desiccated logs. The taxa identified were Asutrocedrus chilensis, Maytenus sp., cf. Maytenus boaria, Nothofagus dombeyi, Podocarpus nubigenus and one species of the family cf. Podocarpaceae. These results contribute to understanding hunter-gatherer practices in the Andean Patagonian forest. Due to the scarce preservation in this type of environment, the recorded macroremains are relevant, suggesting at least the spring through summer use of the Los Cipreses rock shelter and the gathering of local plants.																			1850-373X					JAN-JUN	2025	26	1					127	144		10.37176/iea.26.1.2025.926	http://dx.doi.org/10.37176/iea.26.1.2025.926													WOS:001464578800001

Recruitment contributions and natal fidelity in tributary rivers of the Grand Lake, Oklahoma, Paddlefish stock	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Microchemistry of sectioned dentary (lower jaw) bones was used to determine natal river (Neosho, Spring or Elk River) of paddlefish Polyodon spathula (Walbaum) in the economically important snag fishery in Grand Lake, northeastern Oklahoma, and to assess the relative importance of the tributary rivers as sources of recruits to the fishery. Geological differences between the Neosho River and Spring River watersheds resulted in large differences in water strontium:calcium (Sr:Ca) ratios reflected in dentary Sr:Ca for paddlefish from each river. Dentary core Sr:Ca signatures were used to infer natal river for paddlefish harvested over the period 2008-2018. Most harvested fish (87%) were identified as Neosho River origin, and 7% were within the predicted range for Spring River origin (6% undetermined). Relative frequencies of Neosho River and Spring River-origin fish (the latter, all <= 10%) differed among cohorts but did not differ among years, locations or sexes. Results corroborate a sonar survey of spawning substrates that concluded that the Neosho River has higher potential value for paddlefish spawning and recruitment than the Spring River. No evidence of natal river fidelity was found. Results highlight the importance of maintaining habitat conditions and inform harvest management regulations required for paddlefish spawning, recruitment and sustainability.

Morphological and geochemical variations of Cyprideis (Ostracoda) from modern waters of the northern Neotropics	LIMNOLOGY												The variability of modern Cyprideis salebrosa and Cyprideis americana (Ostracoda) from the northern Neotropics were investigated in order to understand site specific influences on the isotopic composition of their valves (delta O-18, delta C-13) in comparison to their host water and to connect this to morphological features of their valves (valve size, nodosity). C. salebrosa was found in a stream (Shell Creek, Florida) and a slightly brackish lake (Laguna del Rincon, Dominican Republic; salinity < 0.7 psu) while C. americana occurred in a coastal lake with polyhaline waters (Parrotee Pond, Jamaica; salinity: > 20 psu). Valve size and position of nodes differed between the two species. A reverse temperature dependency have been considered to influence Shell length (seasonally in Shell Creek, summer: 1076 mu m; winter: 1092 mu m, supposedly permanently in Laguna del Rincon, 1035 mu m). But, regarding the small dataset other factors could not be excluded to influence ostracod valve size. A decline of node frequency of C. salebrosa is mainly related to an increase in salinity. Isotopic values of ostracod valves reflect the trend in stable isotopes of their host water. Variations in Cyprideis salebrosa delta O-18 and delta C-13 values signify differences in their host water. Offsets of ostracod valves to a theoretical calcite precipitated in their host water with an uncertain time lag (+0.015 to +2.63 parts per thousand) needs to be clarified. This study presents a contribution to the understanding of environmental influences on modern ostracod shell characters as basis for paleontological applications.

J	Riboust, P; Brissette, F				Riboust, Philippe; Brissette, Francois			Analysis of Lake Champlain/Richelieu River's historical 2011 flood	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Lake Champlain and its natural outlet, the Richelieu River, underwent an historical flooding event in 2011, exceeding by a wide margin all other extreme events in over 100 years of monitoring records. In Quebec, hundreds of homes were flooded for up to 2 months, requiring waves of evacuation and military involvement to support the effort. This paper examines the causes of this exceptional flood, performs a statistical analysis of important variables and compares the 2011 event to three other large floods. The results show that the return period of the 2011 spring flood exceeded 700 years and was caused by the combination of extreme precipitation over the spring season (500 years recurrence) and an important snowpack (15 years recurrence). Hydrological modeling of past extreme events over the Lake Champlain watershed indicates that liquid precipitation during snowmelt is the key factor in triggering large spring floods. The combination of the 2011 April and May precipitation with the large 2008 snowpack in a hypothetical meteorological scenario shows simulated discharges and lake levels much higher than the ones seen in 2011.

Stability and Charging Characteristics of the Comma Head Region of Continental Winter Cyclones	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												This paper presents analyses of the finescale structure of convection in the comma head of two continental winter cyclones and a 16-storm climatology analyzing the distribution of lightning within the comma head. A case study of a deep cyclone is presented illustrating how upper-tropospheric dry air associated with the dry slot can intrude over moist Gulf air, creating two zones of precipitation within the comma head: a northern zone characterized by deep stratiform clouds topped by generating cells and a southern zone marked by elevated convection. Lightning, when it occurred, originated from the elevated convection. A second case study of a cutoff low is presented to examine the relationship between lightning flashes and wintertime convection. Updrafts within convective cells in both storms approached 6-8 m s(-1), and convective available potential energy in the cell environment reached approximately 50-250 J kg(-1). Radar measurements obtained in convective updraft regions showed enhanced spectral width within the temperature range from -10 degrees to -20 degrees C, while microphysical measurements showed the simultaneous presence of graupel, ice particles, and supercooled water at the same temperatures, together supporting noninductive charging as an important charging mechanism in these storms. A climatology of lightning flashes across the comma head of 16 winter cyclones shows that lightning flashes commonly occur on the southern side of the comma head where dry-slot air is more likely to overrun lower-level moist air. Over 90% of the cloud-to-ground flashes had negative polarity, suggesting the cells were not strongly sheared aloft. About 55% of the flashes were associated with cloud-to-ground flashes while 45% were in-cloud flashes.					; Market, Patrick/AGO-5184-2022; McFarquhar, Greg/R-9154-2018	Market, Patrick/0000-0002-5574-319X; Rauber, Robert/0000-0003-2880-6148; Keeler, Jason/0000-0001-7812-882X; Plummer, David/0000-0002-2329-0552; McFarquhar, Greg/0000-0003-0950-0135													0022-4928	1520-0469				MAY	2014	71	5					1559	1582		10.1175/JAS-D-13-0253.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-13-0253.1													WOS:000334991500003

Alewives in mesothermal (2-27.degree. C) Claytor Lake are shorter-lived (3 yr) but grow faster, mature earlier (age 1), and have higher relative and absolute fecundities than have been reported for populations in colder northern waters. The 1979 spawning period extended from early May to early Aug., beginning at least 1 mo. earlier and lasting 4-9 wk longer than in northern lakes. Changes in ovary condition during the spawning period suggest that alewives may be fractional spawners. Evidence of spawning was found in littoral areas throughout the lower 15 km of the reservoir. Growth in length of age-0 Claytor Lake alewives was linear through Sept. and terminated in late autumn. Total 1st-yr growth was reduced in 1979 (maximum of 130 mm total length, TL) from previous years (average of 160 mm TL), although it was substantially greater than recorded in the Great Lakes and the northeastern USA. The longer growing season, rather than accelerated in-season growth, appears to account for larger size achieved in Claytor Lake. High annual growth limits predation by Claytor Lake game fish on early spawned age-0 alewives by late summer. As elsewhere, larval and juvenile alewives (6-70 mm TL) fed primarily on copepods and cladocerans. Age-0 alewives > 35 mm TL demonstrated positive size-selection for cyclopoid copepods comparable to that shown by adults. Self-sustaining alewife populations can be established in many inland waters, but there are concerns regarding their forage value and community impacts.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1982	111	5					559	569		10.1577/1548-8659(1982)111<559:RAEAOL>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1982)111<559:RAEAOL>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1982PJ46900003
J	Jones, B				Jones, Brian			Review of aragonite and calcite crystal morphogenesis in thermal spring systems	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Aragonite and calcite crystals are the fundamental building blocks of calcareous thermal spring deposits. The diverse array of crystal morphologies found in these deposits, which includes monocrystals, mesocrystals, skeletal crystals, dendrites, and spherulites, are commonly precipitated under far-from-equilibrium conditions. Such crystals form through both abiotic and biotic processes. Many crystals develop through non-classical crystal growth models that involve the arrangement of nanocrystals in a precisely controlled crystallographic register. Calcite crystal morphogenesis has commonly been linked to a "driving force", which is a conceptual measure of the distance of the growth conditions from equilibrium conditions. Essentially, this scheme indicates that increasing levels of supersaturation and various other parameters that produce a progressive change from mono crystals and mesocrystals to skeletal crystals to crystallographic and non-crystallographic dendrites, to dumbbells, to spherulites. Despite the vast amount of information available from laboratory experiments and natural spring systems, the precise factors that control the driving force are open to debate. The fact that calcite crystal morphogenesis is still poorly understood is largely a reflection of the complexity of the factors that influence aragonite and calcite precipitation. Available information indicates that variations in calcite crystal morphogenesis can be attributed to physical and chemical parameters of the parent water, the presence of impurities, the addition of organic or inorganic additives to the water, the rate of crystal growth, and/or the presence of microbes and their associated biofilms. The problems in trying to relate crystal morphogenesis to specific environmental parameters arise because it is generally impossible to disentangle the controlling factor(s) from the vast array of potential parameters that may act alone or in unison with each other.

David A.; Li, Qiyuan; Liu, Zhao; Yang, Huan			Transition from a warm and dry to a cold and wet climate in NE China across the Holocene	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Northeast (NE) China lies in the northernmost part of the East Asian Summer monsoon (EASM) region. Although a series of Holocene climatic records have been obtained from lakes and peats in this region, the Holocene hydrological history and its controls remain unclear. More specifically, it is currently debated whether NE China experienced a dry or wet climate during the early Holocene. Here we reconstruct changes in mean annual air temperature and peat soil moisture across the last similar to 13,000 year BP using samples from the Gushantun and Hani peat, located in NE China. Our approach is based on the distribution of bacterial branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) and the abundance of the archaeal isoprenoidal (iso)GDGT crenarchaeol. Using the recently developed peat-specific MAAT(p)(eat) temperature calibration we find that NE China experienced a relatively warm early Holocene (similar to 5-7 degrees C warmer than today), followed by a cooling trend towards modern-day values during the mid- and late Holocene. Moreover, crenarchaeol concentrations, brGDGT-based pH values, and the distribution of 6-methyl brGDGTs, all indicate an increase in soil moisture content from the early to late Holocene in both peats, which is largely consistent with other data from NE China. This trend towards increasing soil moisture/wetter conditions across the Holocene in NE China records contrasts with the trends observed in other parts of the EASM region, which exhibit an early and/or mid-Holocene moisture/precipitation maximum. However, the Holocene soil moisture variations and temperature-moisture relationships (warm-dry and cold-wet) observed in NE China are similar to those observed in the core area of arid central Asia which is dominated by the westerlies. We therefore propose that an increase in the intensity of the westerlies across the Holocene, driven by increasing winter insolation, expanding Arctic sea ice extent and the enhanced Okhotsk High, caused an increase in moisture during the late Holocene in NE China.

In the last few decades, however, many drinking waters sources in the world, including in China, have undergone serious eutrophication and consequently water quality deterioration due to anthropogenic induced stressors such as elevated external nutrient inputs. In this study, we used the state-of-the-art complex, dynamic, mechanistic model GOTM-FABM-PCLake (a coupled one-dimensional hydrodynamic-lake ecosystem model) to quantitatively assess the impacts of external nutrient loading on the temperate Jihongtan reservoir in Shandong Province, China. Simulated values of all variables targeted in calibration (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a) agreed well with observations throughout the entire calibration and validation period and generally mimicked seasonal dynamics and inter-annual variations as found in the monitoring data. A series of scenarios, representing changed external nutrient loadings (both increasing and decreasing compared to the current nutrient load), were set up to quantify the effects on the reservoir water quality. Changes relative to the current external nutrient load had a significant effect on the simulated TN and TP concentrations in the reservoir. Our impact assessment indicate that TN will meet the Chinese water quality requirements of the water source (Class III) when the external nitrogen load is reduced by 70%, whereas TP will meet the requirements even if the external phosphorus load is increased by 100% relative to current loads. The model predicts progressively higher summer and autumn phytoplankton biomasses in the scenarios with increasing external phosphorus loading and potential toxic cyanobacteria will become more dominant at the expense of diatoms and other algae. Strict control of the external nutrient loading is therefore needed to maintain good drinking water quality in the reservoir.					; Andersen, Tobias/JPA-4200-2023; chen, weiyu/M-5972-2018; Trolle, Dennis/B-5465-2008; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012	Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100; Hu, Fenjuan Rose Schmidt/0000-0002-4429-3066; Trolle, Dennis/0000-0001-7568-2411; Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann/0000-0003-1257-2201; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X														2296-665X				MAR 8	2021	9								632778	10.3389/fenvs.2021.632778	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.632778													WOS:000631168200001

Characterization of the Regional Climate and Large-Scale Atmospheric Circulation in the Caspian Sea Region During the Last Glacial Maximum	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Caspian Sea is the largest inland water body on Earth. Still, this region is often not considered in paleoclimate model analyses. In this study, we examine the climate of the Caspian Sea region during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and its driving large-scale atmospheric circulation using data from two global climate models (AWI-ESM-1-1LR and MPI-ESM1.2-LR) within the PMIP4 framework. We validate the simulation output against proxy data, including information derived from pollen, lake sediments, and loess deposits. Our results demonstrate that the global climate simulations align more closely with proxy data within the Caspian Sea region (mostly within one standard deviation) than the Mediterranean and Western Europe and can thus be further exploited. The subtropical jet stream is dominant in winter exhibiting higher wind speeds than in summer, where the jet stream undergoes a transition from a zonal structure under preindustrial conditions to a wave-like pattern during the LGM. Furthermore, there is an increase in extratropical cyclone activity during the LGM. The analysis of the near-surface circulation reveals the dominance of an anticyclonic flow in summer, which becomes even more frequent during the LGM (increase by up to 20%). The general characteristics of the rotational circulation weather types change toward an intensification during the LGM. Overall, the models demonstrate greater agreement at larger scales. However, to enable a more direct comparison with local proxy data, especially in the topographically complex region along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, we suggest a follow-up study employing high-resolution climate simulations.

Specifically, few studies have focused on the in situ regeneration of zeolite. A 2-year field experiment using an ecological ditch-zeolite barrier system was conducted in a paddy field of summer rice-winter wheat rotation in the Taihu Lake area. The system consisted of two zeolite barriers positioned at one third and two thirds of the length of the ditch. This study focused on the effect of the system on in situ nitrogen removal during the rice-growing season. Simultaneous laboratory kinetics experiments with natural zeolite and a series of adsorbed zeolites taken from the ditch at different time were also conducted. The concentration removal efficiencies of total nitrogen are averaged 24.66% in 2014 and 30.39% in 2015. Meanwhile, the cumulative adsorption quantity of ammonia nitrogen by the two barriers accounted for 49.27% of the ammonia nitrogen removed in 2014 and 54.35% of that in 2015. The amount of nitrogen adsorbed by plants was larger than that adsorbed by zeolite. The breakthrough curves of the zeolite and the characteristics of the zeolite surface structures from different periods all demonstrated that the zeolite can be regenerated in situ in the case of unsaturated zeolite within the ecological ditch. It can be concluded that an ecological ditch-zeolite barrier system is a realistic option for removing nitrogen from agricultural rainfall runoff in the Taihu Lake area.

Information on movements, general behavior, and feeding habits was obtained by tracking coyotes for 827 miles in snow, and by examining 92 scats collected along their trails. White-tailed deer (Odocolieus virginianus) carrion constituted the coyote''s primary winter food in both areas. Coyotes actually killed few deer, and usually brought down only the smallest and weakest animals. Although certain other abundant prey species were available, coyotes were relatively unsuccessful in capturing them. The influence of this predator in controlling game populations in winter appears to be negligible.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1966	30	4					809	+		10.2307/3798288	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3798288													WOS:A19668527300018

The applied PCR-DGGE methods were highly specific to cyanobacteria and green algae. A total of 11 different plankton taxa were identified that were related to several distant taxonomic groups. PPP were represented by a simple community and consisted of two major genotypes, one from the green algal species Picochlorum oklahomense and the other related to marine Synechococcus isolates (Cyanobacteria). These marine PPP species were recorded for the first time in inland saline lakes from Europe. Besides picoplankton, several additional marine taxa (e.g. cryptophytes and haptophytes) were detected among the nanoplankton species. The presence of the identified marine and hypersaline species could be explained by wind, precipitation or waterfowl transfer; however, this latter could have smaller importance.

J	Soranno, PA; Carpenter, SR; Lathrop, RC				Soranno, PA; Carpenter, SR; Lathrop, RC			Internal phosphorus loading in Lake Mendota: response to external loads and weather	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We quantified summer internal phosphorus (P) loads and all the major P fluxes in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, a deep stratified eutrophic lake, during two summers of contrasting external loads to determine (i) whether internal loading by entrainment (mixing at the thermocline) is a significant part of the epilimnetic P budget and (ii) what factors lead to interannual variability in internal loading. We estimated variables for the P budget weekly (standing stock, sedimentation) or daily (outflow, inflow, and entrainment) during a summer of average runoff (1992) and one of higher than average runoff (1993). Entrainment, estimated by calculating the amount of P transported into the epilimnion after the thermocline deepened following storms, was about 10 times higher than external loading during 1992, but was about equal to external loading during 1993. When entrainment was included, the epilimnetic P budget balanced. Interannual variability in internal loading appears to be due to a combination of water column stability, weather, and the P levels accumulated in the metalimnion. External loads to the epilimnion during summer 1993 were much higher than in 1992 (7.0 and 0.9 mg P.m(-2).day(-1), respectively); however, total loads (internal + external) were more similar (12.5 and 7.8 mg P.m(-2).day(-1) in 1993 and 1992, respectively). Although summer chlorophyll concentrations were similar in the two summers, blue-green algal biomass in 1993 was about double that in 1992.					; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020	Soranno, Patricia/0000-0003-1668-9271; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1997	54	8					1883	1893		10.1139/f97-095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f97-095													WOS:A1997YC67500020

The deterioration of water quality due to excess algal biomass in lakes has been well documented (e.g., water clarity, hypoxic conditions), but health risks associated with cyanotoxins remain largely unexplored in the absence of toxin information. This study is the first to document the presence of dissolved microcystin, anatoxin-a, cylindrospermopsin, and -N-methylamino-l-alanine in Jordan Lake, a major drinking water reservoir in North Carolina. Saxitoxin presence was not confirmed. Multiple toxins were detected at 86% of the tested sites and during 44% of the sampling events between 2014 and 2016. Although concentrations were low, continued exposure of organisms to multiple toxins raises some concerns. A combination of discrete sampling and in-situ tracking (Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking [SPATT]) revealed that microcystin and anatoxin were the most pervasive year-round. Between 2011 and 2016, summer and fall blooms were dominated by the same cyanobacterial genera, all of which are suggested producers of single or multiple cyanotoxins. The study's findings provide further evidence of the ubiquitous nature of cyanotoxins, and the challenges involved in linking CyanoHAB dynamics to specific environmental forcing factors are discussed.

Strontium Isotope Analysis, the Neonatal Line, and Archaeological Caribou Herd Identity in Northwest Alaska	ARCTIC												. Rangifer tarandus is a keystone species in the Arctic and has shaped human land use in this region for tens of thousands of years. The migratory ecotype requires large landscapes and long migrations between summer and winter ranges to meet their nutritional needs. The extent to which these ranges have remained the same has been controversial and uncertain. Archaeological caribou herd identity is usually ascribed based on modern caribou herd distribution. However, no study has assessed the validity of the implicit assumption of multi-thousand years of range stasis. Given that a caribou herd's distribution and landscape use may change in response to ecological or climatic changes, it is important to assess whether past and present calving ground locations may have shifted. In this study, we applied strontium isotope analysis to identify calving grounds of archaeological caribou from the pre-contact/historic Lake Kaiyak site (MIS-00032) near the calving grounds of the modern Western Arctic caribou herd (WAH). We found that the 87Sr/86Sr values of the molars were consistent with those predicted for WAH ranges. The dental enamel from the neonatal line (NNL), a pathological marker of birth, was consistent with the modern WAH calving grounds and early summer range. These results suggest that the archaeological specimens were WAH animals. Broadly, this supports the use of strontium isotope analysis of permanent molars with an emphasis on the NNL to determine the herd identity of ungulates in the archaeological record, which has important implications for archaeology and modern wild ungulate herd management.					; Tomco, Patrick/LRU-3036-2024	Tomco, Patrick/0000-0001-9139-7266; 													0004-0843	1923-1245				SEP	2023	76	3					311	335		10.14430/arctic78403	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic78403													WOS:001158430400013
J	Vodyanitskii, YN				Vodyanitskii, Yu. N.			Iron Compounds and Oil Biodegradation in Overmoistened Contaminated Soils: A Review of Publications	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												In Russia, the areas of oil pollution gradually shift toward the north into the zone of increased moistening with widespread hydromorphic soils. In this zone, the role of the rapid aerobic degradation of hydrocarbons decreases, while that of slow anaerobic degradation increases. The biological reduction of Fe(III) only proceeds at the expense of the energy of oxidation of organic substances, including oil hydrocarbons, in the oil-polluted soils. This favors the development of technogenic gleying. In contrast to the uncontaminated background soils, in which gleying is correctly considered a degradation process, the same process in the oil-contaminated mineral soils plays a positive role, because it is accompanied by the oxidation of organic pollutants, which otherwise penetrate into rivers and lakes with water flows. The role of Fe(III) reduction may be significant: at one of the oil-spill sites, one-third of the organic pollutants degraded within twelve years after an accident in the anaerobic zone due to Fe(III) reduction. Both iron hydroxides and clay minerals enriched in Fe(III) participate in the reduction processes. In the anaerobic zone, the destruction of organic pollutants begins several years after the relevant natural microorganisms become active. The reduction of Fe(III) reaches its maximum faster than the process of methanogenesis. Upon the soil's cooling in the winter, the reduction of Fe(III) is replaced by the spontaneous formation of iron oxides (oxidogenesis). Thus, alternating reduction <-> oxidation reactions proceed in the soils with a contrasting temperature regime. Iron oxides formed in the winter are reduced to Fe(II) in the summer and, thus, resume the associated oxidation of organic pollutants upon the stagnant moisture regime. Therefore, upon monitoring of hydromorphic oil-contaminated soils, special attention should be paid to the forms of iron compounds.																			1064-2293	1556-195X				NOV	2011	44	11					1250	1259		10.1134/S1064229311090171	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1064229311090171													WOS:000297626900010

Vacuolar myelinopathy: waterbird risk on a southeastern impoundment co-infested with Hydrilla verticillata and Aetokthonos hydrillicola	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasive aquatic plants such as hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) are spreading through North America, impeding navigation and hydropower facilities, reducing macrophyte biodiversity, and affecting wildlife health. Managing invasive plants is challenging, especially when the scope of effects to aquatic ecosystems is not fully understood. Hydrilla supports a novel epiphytic cyanobacterium (Aetokthonos hydrillicola) which is implicated in vacuolar myelinopathy (VM) disease. Ingestion of aquatic plants with A. hydrillicola causes often fatal neurological impairment to waterbirds and is transferred from herbivore to predator. We investigated potential VM risk to wildlife species using hydrilla infested sites at a southeastern reservoir and developed a qualitative risk assessment for waterbird species that inhabited the reservoir during fall and early winter. We found that all avian species we observed on the reservoir used hydrilla beds to forage. Seasonal diets of these species exposed them to A. hydrillicola toxin either directly through herbivory, or indirectly through prey with dietary links to hydrilla and the cyanobacteria. Avian and mammalian scavengers are also exposed to the toxin through waterbird carcasses. We present evidence that the current list of species affected by VM is not complete, and further studies are needed to determine the full scope of species vulnerable to VM in lakes and reservoirs with hydrilla and A. hydrillicola.

As an important region abundant in water resources in China, the balance of water resources in the middle and lower Yangtze River Basin (MLY) is crucial for region sustainable development. However, to date, few studies have quantitatively analysed the lake area during heat waves in the MLY. To fill this gap, this study selected the summer of 2022, which encountered unprecedented heat waves, to analyse the changes of lake area in the MLY. Specifically, Sentinel-1 images were used as data sources, and the Random Forest (RF) model was applied to extract the monthly area of 62 lakes (area >10 km2) in the MLY from 2019 to 2022. The results showed that: (1) Compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and the Otsu method, the RF model had the highest accuracy, with its accuracy and Kappa coefficient in the testing samples of 97.14% and 0.94, respectively. During the period from June to September in 2022, the total area of 62 lakes decreased by 3475.50 km(2). (2) Compared to the same period in the summer of 2019-2021, 23 lakes (37.10%) were observed to experience shrinkage. Among them, the area of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake decreased to the level of the previous winter dry seasons in August 2022. (3) Temperature was the most important meteorological factor that caused changes in the lake area in the MLY, compared to precipitation, evaporation, and runoff. This research can help understand the impact of climate change on lakes and provide references for decision-making in the MLY to formulate the strategies of water resource management under the changing climate.					; Ji, Jianwan/F-8590-2019	Jianwan, Ji/0000-0002-1996-6281; 													0143-1161	1366-5901				SEP 16	2024	45	18					6138	6156		10.1080/01431161.2024.2387132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2024.2387132													WOS:001296889400001

Artificial mixing in the hypertrophic Lake Nieuwe Meer was successful in preventing blooms of the cyanobacterium Microcystis. During the 2 years of artificial, deep mixing the number of colonies of Microcystis per litre and also per m(2) was lower than in the two preceding control years. Hardly any nuisance scums of Microcystis occurred in the lake. 2. The phytoplankton shifted from a cyanobacteria-dominated community in summer to a mixed community of flagellates, green algae and diatoms. Reduced sedimentation losses in the mixed lake, probably in combination with a lower pH, favoured nonbuoyant algae, while the entrainment of cyanobacteria in the turbulent flow nullified their advantage of buoyancy. 3. The chlorophyll concentrations were much lower in the mixed lake, but the euphotic depth did not show clear differences between the years. The chlorophyll content integrated through depth (m(-2)) increased in the artificially mixed lake. 4. The deep lake normally stratified in summer, but artificial mixing of the lake in 1993 resulted in a homogeneous temperature and oxygen distribution with depth. In spring 1994, the mixing was applied intermittently with a reduction of 75% of the energy costs, while the mixing was still sufficient to prevent stratification. 5. Determination of the buoyancy state of the colonies on a sunny and calm day showed that the buoyancy loss was low close to the bubble plumes, and high at some distance from these plumes. This suggests that Microcystis could escape the mixing at some distance from the plumes, and could synthesize more carbohydrates during its stay in the upper illuminated layer of the lake than the deep mixed colonies close to the bubble plumes. Determination of the buoyancy state appeared to be a good and simple method to investigate the extent of entrainment of colonies in the turbulent flow.

The adult populations of a summer are the juveniles of the previous year. The adult physas die off early in the summer before the swimming season so are not usually involved in outbreaks of schistosome dermatitis, but certain of the lymnaeids do not die out until the end of the summer. Varieties of the beach snail Stagnicola emarginata are principally concerned in swimmer''s itch since they inhabit clean, sandy areas suitable for recreational bathing. Epidemiological and meager exptl. evidence indicates that Cercaria physellae may be the larval stage of Pseudobilharziella querquedulae of blue-winged teal; that a schistosome in the pied-billed grebe may develop from a cercaria in Gyraulus parvus (either C. elongata or C. gyrauli); and that C. elvae may develop in a bird that is present in Wisconsin and vicinity all summer, but is not uniformly distributed and is probably not a gull.																			0096-5294					JUL-NOV	1940	32	1/3	D				85	104		10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a118685	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a118685													WOS:000202535000008

Snowmelt-Driven Seasonal Infiltration and Flow in the Upper Critical Zone, Niwot Ridge (Colorado), USA	WATER												The hydrology of alpine and subalpine areas in the Colorado Front Range (USA) is evolving, driven by warming and by the alteration of precipitation patterns, the timing of snowmelt, and other components of the hydrologic budget. Field measurements of soil hydraulic conductivity and moisture along 30-m transects (n = 13) of representative soils developed in surficial deposits and falling head slug tests of shallow groundwater in till demonstrate that hydraulic conductivity in the soil is comparable to hydraulic conductivity values in the shallow aquifer. Soil hydraulic conductivity values were variable (medians ranged from 5.6 x 10(-7) to 4.96 x 10(-5) m s(-1)) and increased in alpine areas underlain by periglacial deposits. Hydraulic conductivities measured by a modified Hvorslev technique in test wells ranged from 4.86 x 10(-7) to 1.77 x 10(-4) m s(-1) in subalpine till. The results suggest a gradient from higher hydraulic conductivity in alpine zones, where short travel paths through periglacial deposits support ephemeral streams and wetlands, to lower hydraulic conductivity in the till-mantled subalpine zone. In drier downstream areas, streambed infiltration contributes substantially to near-channel groundwater. As summer temperatures and evapotranspiration (ET) increase and snowmelt occur earlier, alpine soils are likely to become more vulnerable to drought, and groundwater levels in the critical zone may lower, affecting the connectivity between late-melting snow, meltwater streams, and the areas they affect downstream.

J	Fischer, LA; Gates, CC				Fischer, LA; Gates, CC			Competition potential between sympatric woodland caribou and wood bison in southwestern Yukon, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Wood bison (Bison bison athabascae Rhoads, 1898) were reintroduced to the Aishihik Lake area in the southwestern Yukon, where a population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) existed. These species co-occurred in nearby Beringia over several hundred thousand years and in the study area throughout most of the Holocene. We hypothesized that resource-selection patterns should differ widely between species at all scales because co-evolution should have resulted in strong patterns of resource partitioning. We compared winter utilization distributions of both species based on aerial survey data and assessed differential resource selection at the scales of landscape and distributional overlap. We also assessed differential resource use within feeding sites and compared late-winter diets of the two species. We found 41% overlap in 95% utilization distributions but only 6% overlap in 50% utilization distributions. Strong differences were measured for use of space and terrain, including elevation, slope, and distance from permanent water bodies. Bison strongly selected for or used graminoids, while caribou selected for or used lichens at each scale. Overlap in winter diet between the two species was 10%. At current densities, exploitative competition in winter between these species is unlikely.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				SEP	2005	83	9					1162	1173		10.1139/Z05-117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z05-117													WOS:000233303800003

Baybarry was the major food resource during periods of inclement weather. Though numbers fluctuated greatly in the study areas, the warblers remained on the peninsula throughout the winter.

In this region south of Lake Okeechobee, encompassing NWS Climate Divisions 5, 6, and 7, modern movement of surface waters are managed by the South Florida Water Management District and the US Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, water supply, and Everglades restoration within the constraints of the climatic variability of precipitation and evaporation. Despite relatively narrow, low-relief, but multi-purposed land separating the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico, South Florida has patterns of precipitation and temperature that vary substantially on spatial scales of 10(1)-10(2) km. Here we explore statistically significant linkages to precipitation and temperature that vary seasonally and over small spatial scales with El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Over the period from 1952 to 2005, ENSO teleconnections exhibited the strongest influence on seasonal precipitation. The Multivariate ENSO Index was positively correlated with winter (dry season) precipitation and explained up to 34 % of dry season precipitation variability along the southwest Florida coast. The AMO was the most influential of these teleconnections during the summer (wet season), with significant positive correlations to South Florida precipitation. These relationships with modern climate parameters have implications for paleoclimatological and paleoecological reconstructions, and future climate predictions from the Greater Everglades system.

Detection among individual locations differed with respect to the precipitation event analyzed, and strains isolated were highly variable with respect to serovars. These results demonstrate that rainwater associated effects, most likely surface runoff, provide an avenue for short-term pollution of aquatic systems with Salmonellae that do not, however, appear to establish for the long-term in water nor sediments.																			1477-8920					MAR	2009	7	1					115	121		10.2166/wh.2009.138	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2009.138								18957780					WOS:000264052900011

Assessments are based on June to October monitoring of dissolved CH4 in the water column and ebullitive gas collected above the sediments. Reductions in overall CH4 flux were first observed in ebullition, which decreased abruptly from 6 mmol m(-2) d(-1) before 1992 to 1 mmol m(-2) d(-1) thereafter. The contribution of ebullition to total CH4 flux decreased from 35 to 9 % over the same period. Substantial reductions in dissolved CH4 flux were first observed approximately two years after the major reductions in ebullition. Sediment release of dissolved CH4 decreased 38 %, from an average rate of 11.7 mmol m-2 d-1 for the 1989 to 1991 interval, to 7.3 mmol m(-2) d-1 for the 2002 to 2004 interval. The decrease in CH4 flux was driven by an abrupt decrease in the deposition of particulate organic carbon into the hypolimnion starting in 1987. The magnitude of the decrease in CH4 flux is consistent with previously documented decreases in primary production, organic carbon deposition, and the areal hypolimnetic oxygen deficit. The time course of the decrease in CH4 flux reflects sediment diagenesis processes. Oxidation of large (3.3 - 8.2 x 106 mol) hypolimnetic accumulations of CH4 during the fall mixing period contributed significantly to oxygen depletion observed annually in the lake's upper waters. Decreases in CH4 flux from the sediments resulted in smaller hypolimnetic CH4 Pools in late summer and contributed to improved dissolved oxygen resources in fall.																			0003-9136					AUG	2005	163	4					435	462		10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0163-0435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0163-0435													WOS:000231910100002

Our results show that paleo-Ngangla Ring Tso exceeded modern lake level (4727 m asp continuously between similar to 12.8 and 2.3 ka. The lake was at its highstand 135 m (4862 m asl) above the modem lake from 103 ka to 8.6 ka. This is similar to other closed-basin lakes in western Tibet, and coincides with peak Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and peak Indian Summer Monsoon intensity. The lake experienced a series of millennial-scale oscillations centered on 11.5, 10.8, 83, 5.9 and 3.6 ka, consistent with weak monsoon events in proxy records of the Indian Summer Monsoon. It is unclear whether these events were forced by North Atlantic or Indian Ocean conditions, but based on the abrupt lake-level regressions recorded for Ngangla Ring Tso, they resulted in significant periodic reductions in rainfall over the western Tibetan Plateau throughout the Holocene.

However, the mechanisms driving variability in dust are less well constrained. Here, we present records of the Nd-Sr isotope and major element composition of sediments from Lake Tuofengling, a crater lake located in northeastern China, over the past similar to 25 thousand years. The results indicate that the lithogenic fractions of the sediments are a mixture between aeolian dust and local volcanic detritus. Our provenance data suggest that the aeolian dust component is predominantly from the Mongolia Plateau, likely carried by the East Asian Winter Monsoon. Our isotope and calculated dust flux records exhibit similar changing patterns to proxies of global ice volume and the strength of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, potentially implicating ice sheets and ocean circulation as the dominant drivers of the East Asian Winter Monsoon over this time interval.

During April-May the algal biomass is controlled by climatic conditions. From the end of May, when Daphnia has established large populations grazing is the controlling factor. Despite its high fecundity, the population of Daphnia cannot grow before the end of May because it is controlled by the carnivorous Cyclops vicinus. Cyclops indirectly supports the development of the spring bloom consisting exclusively of small algae. The pattern seems to be the result of long term adaptations of life cycle strategies.																			0003-9136						1978	82	1-4					364	386																WOS:A1978EN32500023

In this study, 70 water samples were collected from rivers, a lake, and pumping wells. The surface water was considered to have a lower salinity than the groundwater in the region of study. The regression equations for delta D and delta O-18 for the surface water and the groundwater are similar to those for precipitation, indicating meteoric origins. The delta D and delta O-18 levels in the groundwater ranged from -60%; to -25%; and -8.6%; to -2.5%, respectively, and were lower than the stable isotope levels from the winter and spring precipitation. The groundwater in the southern area was classified as the Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3--type, whereas the groundwater in the northern area included three types (Na+-Cl--type, Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3--type, and Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl--type), indicating rapid and frequent water-rock exchange in the region. A reasonable conclusion is that the groundwater chemistry is dominated by rock weathering and rainwater of local origin, which are influenced by seawater carried by the Asian monsoon.

J	Evans, DJ; Johnes, PJ; Lawrence, DS				Evans, DJ; Johnes, PJ; Lawrence, DS			Physico-chemical controls on phosphorus cycling in two lowland streams. Part 2 - The sediment phase	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This article investigates the temporal and spatial controls on sediment-phosphorus (P) dynamics in two contrasting sub-catchments of the River Kennel, England. Suspended sediment (collected under representative flow conditions) and size-fractionated bedload (collected weekly for one year) from the Rivers Lambourn and Enborne was analysed for a range of physico-chemical determinands. Total P concentrations were highest in the most mobile fractions of sediment: suspended sediment, fine silt and clay and organic matter (mean concentrations of 1758, 1548 and 1440 mug P g(-1) dry sediment, respectively). Correlation analysis showed significant relationships between total P and total iron (n = 110), total manganese (n = 110), organic matter (n = 110) and specific surface area (n = 28) in the Lambourn (r(2) 0.71, 0.68, 0.62 and 0.52, respectively) and between total P and total iron (n = 110), total manganese (n = 110) and organic matter (n = 110) in the Enborne (r(2) 0.74, 0.85 and 0.68, respectively). These data highlight the importance of metal oxyhydroxide adsorption of P on fine particulates and organic matter. However, high total P concentrations in the granule gravel and coarse sand size fraction during the summer period (mean concentration 228 mug P g(-1) dry sediment) also highlight the role of calcite co-precipitation on P dynamics in the Lambourn. P to cation ratios in Lambourn sediment indicated that fine silt and clay and granule gravel and coarse sand size fractions were potential sources of P release to the water column during specific periods of the summer and autumn. In the Enborne, however, only the granule gravel and coarse sand size fraction had high ratios and a slow, constant release of P was observed. In addition, scanning electron microscopy work confirmed the association of P with calcite in the Lambourn and P with iron on clay particles in the Enborne. The study highlighted the importance of the chemical and physical properties of the sediment in influencing the mechanisms controlling P storage and release within river channels.

Salmonid fish are particularly vulnerable to environmental degradation since egg development takes place on or in the bottom substrate. Dissolved oxygen concentration on the spawning site is commonly considered the main factor limiting egg development. In order to assess the relationship between trophic state, hypolimnetic oxygen concentration, and salmonid egg development, whitefish (Coregonus sp.) eggs were sampled just prior to hatching in late winter. Eggs were collected in 13 Swiss lakes of different trophic state, using a sled-dredge. The proportion of viable eggs among the total number of eggs found was taken as a measure of reproductive success. The results indicate that successful in situ embryogenesis is not primarily governed by hypolimnetic oxygen concentration which tends to be high anyway during egg incubation, but by trophic state in terms of total phosphorus concentration in spring. The findings are explained by the production-related oxygen uptake of the sediment, creating an oxygen gradient of varying steepness in the diffusive boundary layer. Implications for the restoration of lacustrine ecosystems are discussed.																			0018-8158					OCT 2	1992	243						261	268		10.1007/BF00007041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007041													WOS:A1992JZ96300027

Influence of land use and watershed characteristics on protozoa contamination in a potential drinking water resources reservoir	WATER RESEARCH												Relative changes in the microbial quality of Lake Texoma, on the border of Texas and Oklahoma, were investigated by monitoring protozoan pathogens, fecal indicators, and factors influencing the intensity of the microbiological contamination of surface water reservoirs. The watershed serves rural agricultural communities active in cattle ranching, recreation, and is a potential drinking water source. A total of 193 surface water samples were tested over a 27-month period to determine levels of parasite contamination. The overall occurrence of Cryptosporidium oocysts was higher in both frequency and concentration than Giardia cysts. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in 99% and Giardia cysts in 87% of the samples. Although Cryptosporidium and Giardia occurrence were significantly but not strongly correlated, all other correlation coefficients including turbidity and total dissolved solids were non-significant. Statistically supportable seasonal variations were found suggesting that Cryptosporidium and Giardia were higher in summer and fall than in other seasons of the year. While Cryptosporidium levels were correlated with rainfall, this was not the case with Giardia. The maximum numbers for both protozoan parasites were detected from a site impacted by cattle ranching during calving season. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used for confirmation of Cryptosporidium in surface waters influenced by agricultural discharges. As we had expected, oocysts were of the bovine type indicating that the Cryptosporidium parvum detected in surface waters perhaps came from cattle living in the watershed.

Pollen and other palaeoenvironmental records document several stages of vegetation history and climate change. The warmest and wettest climate in the Xingyun Lake catchment occurred before 5500 cal a BP, and subsequently the climate became gradually drier. After 2000 cal a BP the regional environmental conditions became unstable, and a wet Medieval Warm Period is probably recorded. Our reconstruction of the ISM is similar to that portrayed by Holocene speleothem O-18 records from southern China, but is distinctly different from the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) evolution, which features a mid-Holocene maximum. Our results support the hypothesis that the ISM and EASM evolved asynchronously during the Holocene, and imply that the Chinese speleothem O-18 records from southern China may principally reflect changes in moisture source from the Indian monsoon domain, and thus record the history of the ISM rather than the EASM.					; Chen, Xuemei/KCL-6714-2024; Zhou, Aifeng/C-5881-2013; Zhang, Xiaojian/M-7184-2015; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Chen, Jianhui/A-5340-2011	Zhou, Aifeng/0000-0001-8349-8585; Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; Huang, Xiaozhong/0000-0002-2127-0451; Zhang, Xiaojian/0000-0001-9757-3101; Chen, Jianhui/0000-0002-6768-1619													0267-8179	1099-1417				OCT	2014	29	7					661	674		10.1002/jqs.2735	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.2735													WOS:000344003500006

BC1307 brought to light through community analysis, comparative genomics and in vitro photophysiology	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Cyanobacteria are important photoautotrophs in extreme environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Terrestrial Antarctic cyanobacteria experience constant darkness during the winter and constant light during the summer which influences the ability of these organisms to fix carbon over the course of an annual cycle. Here, we present a unique approach combining community structure, genomic and photophysiological analyses to understand adaptation to Antarctic light regimes in the cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya sp. BC1307. We show that Leptolyngbya sp. BC1307 belongs to a clade of cyanobacteria that inhabits near-surface environments in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Genomic analyses reveal that, unlike close relatives, Leptolyngbya sp. BC1307 lacks the genes necessary for production of the pigment phycoerythrin and is incapable of complimentary chromatic acclimation, while containing several genes responsible for known photoprotective pigments. Photophysiology experiments confirmed Leptolyngbya sp. BC1307 to be tolerant of short-term exposure to high levels of photosynthetically active radiation, while sustained exposure reduced its capacity for photoprotection. As such, Leptolyngbya sp. BC1307 likely exploits low-light microenvironments within cyanobacterial mats in the McMurdo Dry Valleys.					; Sanchez-Baracaldo, Patricia/A-5309-2017; Anesio, Alexandre/A-7597-2008; , Marian/JSL-4087-2023	Williamson, Christopher/0000-0002-8239-7368; Sanchez-Baracaldo, Patricia/0000-0002-5216-2664; Chrismas, Nathan/0000-0002-2165-3102; Anesio, Alexandre/0000-0003-2990-4014; 													0962-1083	1365-294X				DEC	2018	27	24					5279	5293		10.1111/mec.14953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.14953								30565777					WOS:000454600500023

As ground-based monitoring of river-ice regimes in high northern latitudes is expensive and restricted to a few locations due to limited accessibility to most places along rivers from shorelines, remote sensing techniques are a suitable approach for monitoring. This study developed a RADARSAT-2 based method to monitor the spatio-temporal variation of ice covers, as well as ice types during the freeze-up period, along the main channel of the Slave River Delta in the Northwest Territories of Canada. The spatio-temporal variation of ice covers along the river was analyzed using the backscatter-based coefficient of variation (CV) in the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 winters. As a consequence of weather and flow conditions, the ice cover in the 2013-2014 winter had the higher variation than the 2014-2015 winter, particularly in the potential areas of flooded/cracked ice covers. The river sections near active channels (e.g., Middle Channel and Nagle Channel), Big Eddy, and Great Slave Lake also yielded higher intra-annual variation of ice cover characteristics during the winters. With the inclusion of backscatter and texture analysis from RADARSAT-2 data, four water and ice cover classes consisting of open water, thermal ice, juxtaposed ice, and consolidated ice, were discriminated in the images acquired between November and March in both the studied winters. In addition to river geomorphology and climatic conditions such as river width, sinuosity or air temperature, the fluctuation of water flows during the winter has a significant impact on the variation of ice cover as well as the formation of different ice types in the Slave River. The RADARSAT-2 based monitoring algorithm can also be applied to other river systems in high latitude ecosystems to annually monitor their river-ice variation and formation during the freeze-up and ice cover progression period.

The Importance of Coastal Hauling Grounds in the Life of the Baikal Seal (Pusa sibirica Gmelin 1788, Pinnipedia): 3. Utilization of Coastal Hauling Grounds by the Baikal Seal on Tonkii Island (Tonkii Ushkan Islet), Ushkan Islands, Lake Baikal, Based on Video Observations	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Based on an analysis of unique video materials recorded over four seasons in 2012, 2014, 2018, and 2019 on one of the main hauling grounds of the Baikal seal Pusa sibirica on Tonkii Ushkan Islet (Lake Baikal), original information is reported on its utilization patterns in summer and fall. The seal is shown to use the shore intensively for 5-6 months annually from May to October, sometimes staying until early November. This paper describes the daily and seasonal dynamics of utilization of the hauling grounds and estimates their ecological carrying capacity (approximately 300 individuals). Staying ashore is a vital necessity to a large part of the population, as each season thousands individuals of both sexes and different ages appear to pass through the hauling ground areas. The main purpose of the hauling grounds along with relaxation is the need to complete molting, since molting individuals account for 40-60% of the animals on the hauling grounds. This is due to climate change in the region; in particular, the altered ice regime, which prevents the animals from completing molting on floating ice. Numerous animals in haul-outs display pathological conditions (scars, sores, and recent injuries), mostly on the skin and hair cover. The main factor of animal fright is human disturbance, due to which the Baikal seal leaves the shore daily.

Biotic and abiotic drivers of aquatic plant communities in shallow pools and wallows on the sub-Antarctic Iles Kerguelen	POLAR BIOLOGY												In the sub-Antarctic region, climate change is particularly rapid, while their freshwater ecosystems, such as ponds, host plant species with limited spatial distributions. These particular systems and their plant communities remain however poorly known and the context of their changing habitat calls for deeper insights into these systems. We performed an extensive survey of 45 ponds over three locations of the Iles Kerguelen during the winter and summer seasons of two years, which included the measurement of 12 abiotic parameters and the assessment of the plant community composition. Overall, our results showed that Iles Kerguelen ponds are shallow freshwater ecosystems harbouring species-poor plant communities with high evenness, of which structure did not vary among the sampled locations. Three different habitats were identified among ponds in relation with nutrient supply by marine animals, which ultimately influenced plant community structure and cover. We highlight that these habitats are mostly determined by water depth, nutrients, and temperature (mean and variance). Present plant community composition was more strongly correlated with plant community composition in the previous year than with abiotic conditions. Overall, this study provides new knowledge on the aquatic plant communities and the functioning of Iles Kerguelen freshwater ecosystems, which can serve as a basis for future studies dealing with the impact of climate change in the sub-Antarctic region.

Seasonal thermal ecology of adult walleye (Sander vitreus) in Lake Huron and Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												The purpose of this study was to characterize thermal patterns and generate occupancy models for adult walleye from lakes Erie and Huron with internally implanted biologgers coupled with a telemetry study to assess the effects of sex, fish size, diel periods, and lake. Sex, size, and diel periods had no effect on thermal occupancy of adult walleye in either lake. Thermal occupancy differed between lakes and seasons. Walleye from Lake Erie generally experienced higher temperatures throughout the spring and summer months than did walleye in Lake Huron, due to limnological differences between the lakes. Tagged walleye that remained in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron (i.e., adjacent to the release location), as opposed to those migrating to the main basin of Lake Huron, experienced higher temperatures, and thus accumulated more thermal units (the amount of temperature units amassed over time) throughout the year. Walleye that migrated toward the southern end of Lake Huron occupied higher temperatures than those that moved toward the north. Consequently, walleye that emigrated from Saginaw Bay experienced thermal environments that were more favorable for growth as they spent more time within their thermal optimas than those that remained in Saginaw Bay.

New remote sensing approaches need to be developed for in situ study of Microcystis bloom development. The aims of our work were to display the advantages of hydroacoustic techniques for in situ studying the gas-containing cyanobacterium Microcystis sp. and to examine the role of physical factors in Microcystis bloom and surface scum formation. We found that gas-containing Microcystis colonies are strong acoustic backscatterers at ultrasound frequencies. This allowed developing a novel approach for in situ quantification and of Microcystis populations. Dynamics of the echo-reflecting layer monitored with a bottom-mounted 500 kHz ADCP showed distinct near-diurnal vertical fluctuations caused by vertical dispersion of the cyanobacterium in response to development or fading of daily thermocline in late winter-early spring. During the Microcystis bloom season the volume backscattering strength in the water column was also quantified with a 120 kHz echosounder EY60, which was calibrated versus particle volume concentrations acquired with a Submersible Particle Size Analyzer LISST-100x and fluorometrically measured chl-a concentrations (a proxy of Microcystis biomass during the bloom development). Our study of the formation of Microcystis surface scum in relation to physical forces and water motions suggest that creation of surface scum plays an important role in the fast increase of Microcystis biomass in Lake Kinneret (Israel). Hydroacoustic methods can be widely used for in situ investigations of the spatiotemporal variability of gas-containing cyanobacteria.

Here we map the slush limit, a proxy for the extent of surface runoff, using daily MODIS data for the years 2000-2021. We develop an automated algorithm capable of detecting daily slush limits, provided sufficient image quality. The algorithm is applied to the ice sheet's western flank (61.7 degrees N to 76.5 degrees N). We find significant increasing trends in maximum slush limits until the year 2012, but not thereafter. We show that the slush limit typically rises quickly early in the ablation season but stabilizes before melting ceases. The data provide evidence that upward migration of surface runoff in summer 2012 stopped early at the upper margin of the ice slabs. These thick and continuous ice layers are located close to the surface, in the firn, and impede percolation of melt into deeper pore space. Had the ice slabs extended higher, the summer 2012 provided sufficient energy to raise the slush limit by another similar to 300 m in elevation.

Comparison of adult steelhead migrations in the mid-Columbia hydrosystem and in large naturally flowing British Columbia rivers	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The migration of 1,263 adult radio-tagged steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss was assessed in the Nass, Skeena, Bella Coola, Fraser, and mid-Columbia rivers from 1993 to 2001. Of the summer-run steelhead tagged in the mid-Columbia River, 80-87% eventually continued their upstream migration after being tagged, and 87-90% of those were detected in spawning areas. Similar results were seen for summer-run steelhead tracked on the Nass and Skeena rivers. Mid-Columbia summer-run steelhead stocks that passed five dams en route to their spawning destinations (Methow and Okanogan rivers) traveled at a median rate of 20 km/d, which exceeded the median rates for summer-run steelhead tracked on the Nass (3.8 km/d) and Skeena rivers (12-16 km/d). The upstream migration rates were best explained by river gradient and distance of the study area from the ocean. When the effects of river gradient and reach location were taken into account. impoundment was still a significant factor increasing the upstream migration speeds of summer-run steelhead. Kelting speeds varied widely among rivers and did not appear to be a function of gradient.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2006	135	3					739	754		10.1577/T05-043.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-043.1													WOS:000238676600016
J	Gebre, S; Timalsina, N; Alfredsen, K				Gebre, Solomon; Timalsina, Netra; Alfredsen, Knut			Some Aspects of Ice-Hydropower Interaction in a Changing Climate	ENERGIES												Ice formation and related processes in rivers and lakes/reservoirs influence the operation of hydropower plants in cold regions. It is a matter of interest to the scientific community and hydropower operators alike how existing ice effects and problems will manifest themselves in a future changed climate. In this paper, we use different modeling results to investigate future freshwater ice conditions. The modeling approaches include using temperature derived winter indices, using one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic and ice cover model on three case study reservoirs, and using a 1D river hydrodynamic and ice cover model for a river reach. The analysis shows that changes in river and reservoir ice regimes due to climate change scenarios may have both positive and negative consequences for hydropower operation. Positive consequences emerge from reduction in ice season and reduced static ice loads. Negative consequences or challenges are attributed to unstable winters that may lead to increased frequency of freeze-thaw episodes with a shortened winter season. These aspects are discussed in more detail in the paper.

Furthermore, wetlands dominated by reeds (Phragmites australis) have various CH4 emission pathways, some of which are challenging to quantify (e.g., ebullition) or require additional research (e.g., plant-mediated transport). Plant-mediated transport is often not considered in greenhouse gas balance models for wetlands, nor is the correct mode of gas transport in reeds (pressurized flow). Therefore, further field studies on CH4 emissions in wetlands, especially reed wetlands, are needed to reduce uncertainties in the global CH4 budget and to improve the parametrization and implementation of emission pathways in greenhouse gas balance models of wetlands. This field study investigates all assessable CH4 emission pathways and interfaces (diffusion, ebullition, plant-mediated transport) with various chamber types over four seasons and over the entire diel cycle (24 h) in the subsaline and dynamic reed wetland of Lake Neusiedl in Austria. The pathways of CH4 formation (methanogenesis) were examined in each season by determining delta 13C source signatures and over the course of 1 year by investigating specific microbial groups (methanogens, methanotrophs, and sulfate reducers) in the sediments. The highest CH4 emissions were observed in summer, regardless of the emission pathway, with the highest emissions in all seasons occurring via the plant-mediated transport. Significant differences in CH4 fluxes were observed between the plant-mediated transport and diffusion pathway in each season. However, a distinct diel cycle of CH4 flux was exclusively observed via plant-mediated transport during summer. The source signatures delta 13C-CH4 exhibit seasonal variation, with the highest 13C depletion occurring in fall. Despite the different seasonal source signatures, the dominant methanogenic pathway remains acetoclastic throughout all seasons. Desiccation of the reed ecosystem resulted in a reduction in methanogenic microbial diversity in the sediments over the course of 1 year. Concurrently, the drought resulted in an increase and dominance of oxygen-tolerant Methanomicrobiales.					罗, 振豪/GSD-3786-2022														1726-4170	1726-4189				SEP 10	2025	22	17					4467	4490		10.5194/bg-22-4467-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-22-4467-2025													WOS:001567002400001

Macro- to fine-scale spatial and temporal distributions and dynamics of phytoplankton and their environmental driving forces in a small montane lake in southern California, USA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A wireless network of buoys, two autonomous robotic boats, and an autonomous tethered vertical profiling system were used to characterize phytoplankton dynamics and spatiotemporal changes in chemical and physical forcing factors in a small montane lake (Lake Fulmor, Idyllwild, California). Three deployments each year were conducted in 2005 and 2006 to examine seasonal changes in the structure of the lake and phytoplankton assemblage, as well as fine-scale temporal and spatial variations. The buoys yielded fine-scale temporal patterns of in situ fluorescence and temperature, while the vertical profiling system yielded two-dimensional, cross-sectional profiles of several parameters. The autonomous vehicles provided information on fluorescence and corresponding temperature patterns across the surface of the lake. Average, lake-wide chlorophyll concentrations increased 10-fold seasonally, and strong anoxia developed in the hypolimnion during the summer. The latter process dramatically affected vertical chemical gradients in the 5 m water column of the lake. Small-scale spatial (<1 m) and temporal (minutes) heterogeneity in fluorescence were surprisingly large. These variations were due predominantly to vertical mixing of the phytoplankton assemblage and to phytoplankton vertical migratory behavior. Large peaks in fluorescence at 0.5-m occurred at very short time intervals (minutes) during all deployments, and appeared to be due to upward mixing of deeper dwelling eukaryotic phytoplankton during early-mid-summer, or downward mixing of surface-associated cyanobacteria during late summer.

It is native to the cantons of Berne, Waadt and Wallis, where the American species Orconectes limosus also occurs. The first record of O. limosus is from 1979 in Lake Biel. Since then it expanded its range continuously, and early in 1998 it was found in the River Aare 90 km downstream of Lake Biel. Because of its resistance to the crayfish plague (Aphanomyces astaci) it is a potential threat to Austropotamobius pallipes. This paper assesses an actual or potential threat of O. limosus to A. pallipes. In summer and fall of 1997 a total of 63 streams were surveyed. O. limosus was found in 17 out of 43 streams draining either into Lake Biel or the River Aare. O. limosus was restricted to the immediate surroundings of the stream outlets. A. pallipes was found only in 5 out of 20 streams where the species had been recorded since 1990 by local authorities. No sites with both species were found.																					3-8289-3403-X				1998							796	800																WOS:000168192200070

Usually they remain hidden under the ground, and only high flow rates of the flowing underground water reveal them. An example is one of the largest karst springs in Bulgaria - Glava Panega in the village of Zlatna Panega. There are two hydraulically connected lakes close to the spring head. The purpose of the present study is to establish this relationship, as well as to provide a more accurate information of groundwater discharge zones in the lake near the source of groundwater. The methods used include analyzing specific information from speleological studies, combined with conducted on field geophysical studies. Profiling was carried out using the method of the self potential, as well as research with the determination of the values of the natural electromagnetic field. The obtained results support the understanding of the behavior of the karst system in the area of the Glava Panega spring.																			0007-3938	1314-8680					2023	84		3				275	278		10.52215/rev.bgs.2023.84.3.275	http://dx.doi.org/10.52215/rev.bgs.2023.84.3.275													WOS:001150188600020
J	Molla, DD; Haile, FA; Lohani, TK				Molla, Dagnachew Daniel; Haile, Fitsum Aschnaki; Lohani, Tarun Kumar			Integrated litho-structural, hydro-geochemical, and numerical modeling analysis to characterize the 40 springs discharge system, Arba Minch, Ethiopia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES												The 40-spring discharge system (40SDS) in Arba Minch, Ethiopia, is significantly influenced by the complex geomorphology and tectonic activities of the Ethiopian Rift Valley. These springs are the major source of water supply for drinking, domestic use, and tourism, with historical discharge rates between 130 and 250 L per second (l/s). The study aimed to characterize the 40SDS through an integrated approach using litho-structural, hydrogeochemical, and numerical modeling techniques to understand the dynamics and continuing decline rate. The results showed that faults channelize groundwater from the western plateau through the escarpment to the rift floor, discharging into Lakes Abaya and Chamo. Hydro-geochemical analysis identified magnesium (Mg2*), calcium (Ca2*), and bicarbonate as dominant ions, reflecting interactions with silicate minerals, with concentrations increasing downstream due to water-rock contact. Numerical modeling indicated that the aquifer is highly sensitive to hydraulic conductivity, with 99.8% of groundwater outflow occurring through constant head boundaries. Recharge estimates from WetSpass ranged from 0 to 331.8 mm/year, with an average of 64.7 mm/ year. A lag in rainfall-discharge correlation was noted, with a 1-month lag during wet seasons and a 2-month lag during dry seasons, linking recharge to western highland precipitation. Long-term data (1981-2015) indicates a continuous decline in mean annual flow due to reduced recharge and anthropogenic pressures. The springs exhibit a Ca-Na-HCO3 water type, contrasting with nearby Mg-Na-HCO3-Cl surface and groundwater. This decline threatens Arba Minch's socioeconomic stability, as these springs are the primary source of water for the community. Effective management strategies are crucial for the sustainable use of this essential resource.

Twenty-first century snowfall projections within the eastern Great Lakes region: detecting the presence of a lake-induced snowfall signal in GCMs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												In this study, an analysis of model-derived snowfall from 2006 to 2100 is conducted, investigating the presence of a lake-induced (LI) snowfall signal to the lee of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Output from seven fully coupled global climate models is used from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Snowfall trends over the entire study area, and in the defined LI snowbelt, are examined seasonally for two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. The term lake-induced is used to encompass both lake effect processes, along with lake-enhanced snow. In addition to snowfall, physical mechanisms associated with these trends, such as surface temperatures and snow to total precipitation ratios, are examined. The models perform well when compared to snowfall observations despite model difficulties in resolving small-scale orographic and lake effect processes. Modelled snowfall declines by 20-45% over the entire region by 2100, with snowfall increasing in the LI belt during the first quarter century before declining rapidly in RCP 8.5. An additional statistically significant 1.8-1.97 cm signal of LI snow water equivalent is detected within the ensemble mean of the defined snowbelt to the lee of Lakes Erie and Ontario that is not seen in the grid cells outside of the lake belt. This LI signal is also projected to decline more quickly than the non-lake-induced signal. Surface 2-m temperature is found to have a significant impact on snowfall changes in the region, with impacts not only on total precipitation but also on the percentage of precipitation falling as snow.

Spring origin of Eocene carbonate mounds in the Green River Formation, Northern Bridger Basin, Wyoming, USA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Modern and ancient lacustrine carbonate build-ups provide uniquely sensitive sedimentary and geochemical records for understanding the interaction between tectonics, past climates, and local and regional scale basin hydrology. Large (metre to decametre), well-developed carbonate mounds in the Green River Formation have long been recognized along the margins of an Eocene lake, known as Lake Gosiute. However, their mode of origin and significance with respect to palaeohydrology remain controversial. Here, new sedimentological, Sr isotope data and structural evidence show that significant spring discharge led to the formation of a decametre size complex of shoreline carbonate mounds in the upper Wilkins Peak Member of the Green River Formation at Little Mesa and adjacent areas in the Bridger Basin, Wyoming, USA. Sedimentological evidence indicates that spring discharge was predominantly subaqueous but was, at times, also subaerial, which produced tufa cascades and micro-rimstone dam structures. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios measured from these subaerial spring deposits are less radiogenic (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.71040 to 0.71101) than contemporaneous palaeolake carbonates (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.71195 to 0.71561) because their parent groundwaters likely interacted with less-radiogenic Palaeozoic carbonate. Calcite-cemented sandstone cones and spires (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.71037 to 0.71057) in the Wasatch Formation directly below the spring deposits suggest that groundwaters derived from Palaeozoic carbonates preferentially flowed along thrust faults. These results imply that high spring discharge coincided with lake high stands of the upper Wilkins Peak Member, suggesting that recharge at the north-west margin of the Bridger Basin contributed to Lake Gosiute's water budget and lowered the salinity of an underfilled, evaporative lake basin. The findings of this study provide criteria for the recognition of groundwater discharge in palaeolake systems which may lead to the discovery of palaeospring systems in other ancient lake deposits.

To explore the influence of restoration measures on migratory waterbird communities in Xianghai Reserve, we conducted a waterbird survey in the spring and autumn during waterbird migration from 2010 to 2020. The composition and spatial and temporal changes in waterbird communities were identified in the reserve and the diversity changes in waterbird communities were analyzed. The results showed that (1) the number of waterbirds increased significantly since restoration measures in 2012. Restoration measures has clearly promoted an improvement in the species and number of waterbirds. The number of waterbirds was approximately seven-times higher than that before restoration measures. (2) The number of rare waterbirds increased in the reserve, and the number of Anseriform waterbirds on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species rapidly increased. (3) The diversity of the waterbird community has shown some recovery in the reserve, but the variation in water level during some periods led to a regular fluctuation in waterbird diversity. Restoration measures directly changed the water surface area and the water depth in the reserve, which are important variables that influence waterbird selection of wetlands as habitats. To effectively protect and manage important stopover sites on the migratory routes of waterbirds, we suggest to rationally regulate the supplementary water level of wetlands, optimize the hydrological pattern of wetlands, and strengthen the regulation of wetland water levels.

Our research is the first to study the composition and distribution of MPs in Bosten Lake's sediment. In May, the average abundance of MPs was 0.95 +/- 0.72 particles per 10 gs, and in October, it was 0.90 +/- 0.61 particles per 10 gs. Bohu Town had the highest MP abundance, with 1.75 +/- 0.35 particles per 10 gs in spring and 2 +/- 0 particles per 10 gs in autumn. In May, 53 % of the MPs were transparent, while in October, black MPs constituted 58 %. The predominant morphology was fibrous, accounting for 61 % of the total. MPs in the size range of 0.2-1 mm made up 91 % and 66 % of the total in May and October, respectively. The most common types of MPs in May were polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at 40 % and polyethylene (PE) at 26 %. In October, PET was the most prevalent at 71 %, followed by poly(ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK) at 11 %. Certain microbial taxa, such as Actinobacteriota, Pseudomonas, and Vicinamibacteraceae, associated with MP degradation or complex carbon chain breakdown, were notably enriched in sediment areas with high MP concentrations. A significant positive correlation was observed between the abundance of MPs in sediments and Actinobacteriota. Additionally, the abundance of Thiobacillus, Ca.competibacter, and other bacteria involved in soil element cycling showed a significant positive correlation with the organic matter content in the sediments. Anaerobic bacteria like Thermoanaerobacterium displayed a significant positive correlation with water depth. Our study reveals the presence, composition, and distribution of MPs in Bosten Lake's sediments, shedding light on their potential ecological impact.

In arid and semi-arid regions such as Iran, importance of wetlands is more obvious. Providing new information of changes in wetlands during several decades help us finding the reasons of alteration and making programs and policies. One of the most effective techniques in this field is remote sensing. Choghakhor international wetland, one of the most important wetlands in Iran. In this study, satellite images of MSS, TM, ETM +, and OLI were used during 1976-2017 to identify changes within the wetland. Also, the distribution of aquatic plants has been evaluated with NDVI index as an environmental indicator due to their key role on these aquatic ecosystems. After mapping the changes in wetland patterns over times, a cellular automata model (CA) was used to simulate changes up to the 2030s. The results of the time processing map data of the maps show the gradual decrease of the area (water body) of the wetland in the spring and more in the autumn season, which is more evident in recent years. However, the aquatic plants of the wetland in recent years has been. In general, three life periods for the Choghakhor wetland could be defined: "natural period", "developmental period" and "dehydration period". According to the CA model, the water body of the wetland shows a decreasing trend by 2030. On the other hand, aquatic plants growing in the wetland and its surroundings, which could be due to the high nutrient and organic load in future. Therefore, having an integrated strategy and program to improve the status of this unique ecosystem is necessary more than ever.					; Zefrehei, Ahmad/ABI-1449-2020	Pirali Zefrehei, Ahmad Reza/0000-0003-4877-1237; 													1995-4255	1995-4263				SEP	2020	13	5					545	555		10.1134/S1995425520050091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995425520050091													WOS:000579818400009

Assessing year-round habitat use by migratory sea ducks in a multi-species context reveals seasonal variation in habitat selection and partitioning	ECOGRAPHY												Long-distance migration presents complex conservation challenges, and migratory species often experience shortfalls in conservation due to the difficulty of identifying important locations and resources throughout the annual cycle. In order to prioritize habitats for conservation of migratory wildlife, it is necessary to understand how habitat needs change throughout the annual cycle, as well as to identify key habitat sites and features that concentrate large numbers of individuals and species. Among long-distance migrants, sea ducks have particularly complex migratory patterns, which often include distinct post-breeding molt sites as well as breeding, staging and wintering locations. Using a large set of individual tracking data (n = 476 individuals) from five species of sea ducks in eastern North America, we evaluated multi-species habitat suitability and partitioning across the breeding, post-breeding migration and molt, wintering and pre-breeding migration seasons. During breeding, species generally occupied distinct habitat areas, with the highest levels of multi-species overlap occurring in the Barrenlands west of Hudson Bay. Species generally preferred flatter areas closer to lakes with lower maximum temperatures relative to average conditions, but varied in distance to shore, elevation and precipitation. During non-breeding, species overlapped extensively during winter but diverged during migration. All species preferred shallow-water, nearshore habitats with high productivity, but varied in their relationships to salinity, temperature and bottom slope. Sea ducks selected most strongly for preferred habitats during post-breeding migration, with high partitioning among species; however, both selection and partitioning were weaker during pre-breeding migration. The addition of tidal current velocity, aquatic vegetation presence and bottom substrate improved non-breeding habitat models where available. Our results highlight the utility of multi-species, annual-cycle habitat assessments in identifying key habitat features and periods of vulnerability in order to optimize conservation strategies for migratory wildlife.

The average size of bloaters increased considerably during the period. The percentage longer than 8.9 in. increased from 45% in 1959 to 99% in 1965. Calculated lengths were without exception higher in 1962-65 than in 1951 to 1964. The species composition of chubs has apparently changed considerably over the past 40 years. The bloater has replaced the shortjaw Cisco (C. zenithicus) as the principal species in commercial landings of chubs in Wisconsin. Annulus formation of bloaters extended from mid-May to Aug. Growth was slow during the spring and early summer but increased sharply in Aug. Age-group VI was dominant in the samples. Fluctuations in year-class strength were slight Females outnumbered males in all age groups above HI. The sex composition varied according to season of capture. Some bloaters matured at age II and all fish older than III were mature. The shortest length of mature bloaters was 6.0 in. for males and 7.0 in. for females; all fish longer than 8.4 in. were mature. Apostle islands bloaters spawn principally in Feb. and March. The average number of eggs produced by 20 females, 8.4 to 11.7 in. long, was 6533. Crustaceans were the most common food.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1968	97	2					146	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1968)97[146:GCOTBC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1968)97[146:GCOTBC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1968B031500007

Constance) - III. The impact of water column stability on spring algal development	MANAGEMENT OF LAKES AND RESERVOIRS DURING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE	NATO ADVANCED SCIENCE INSTITUTES SERIES, SUB-SER 2, ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY				NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Management of Lakes and Reservoirs During Global Climate Change	NOV, 1995	PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC	NATO, Sci Comm				Under non-stratified conditions in deep lakes such as Lake Constance, algal growth is regarded as being primarily light limited. This is mostly a result of the large mixing depth in relation to the euphotic zone. Consequently, the beginning of spring algal development is expected to depend largely on water column stability. The temporal development of water column stability in spring was estimated for six years of investigation, using elaborate hydrodynamical models, and expressed as two vertical exchange rates: (1) between the uppermost water layer (0-8 m) and the intermediate layer (8-20 m), and (2) between the uppermost and deep layers (20-100 m) (Ollinger & Bauerle, II in this volume, pp. 57-70). The rates ate compared with phytoplankton dynamics. Pronounced spring algal blooms developed in some years despite strong mixing between the uppermost and intermediate water layers. In contrast, the exchange rate between the uppermost and deep water layers proved to be a reliable predictor for the onset of spring algal growth. Substantial increases in algal standing stock never occurred before the algae were largely safe from being mixed below 20 m. In contrast, low exchange rates were invariably associated with enhanced growth rates even when they occurred as early as February, i.e, the reduction of the mixing depth to less than 20 m is a necessary and sufficient prerequisite for vernal blooms in Lake Constance. The predictability of vertical exchange rates from meteorological conditions, by the hydrodynamical models, and the close relationship between vertical exchange rates and algal growth, enable rough predictions to be made about the response of phytoplankton dynamics to changes of weather conditions. Our results suggest that, for example, an increase in air temperature by 2 degrees C at the beginning of the year, or the absence of strong winds for a few days, has significant effects on the timing of the vernal algal bloom.																					0-7923-5055-3				1998	42						71	84																WOS:000076501300005

An individual ordination for each data set can then be derived from the common ordination by adjusting the axis lengths so as to maximize the correlations between observed proximities and individual ordination distances. The importance of the various axes for each data set and the mutual similarities and goodness of fit for the individual data sets are described by weight plots. As an example, 46 soft-water lakes in eastern Finland are ordinated on two dimensions according to 3 chemical data sets (water in summer and autumn, sediment) and 4 biological sets (major phytoplankton groups, phytoplankton, surface sediment diatom and cladoceran assemblages). The method seems to be effective as a means of ordination for obtaining the common ordination for the data sets. The major taxonomic groups gave the ordination which differed most clearly from the ordinations of the other data sets. Phytoplankton was most poorly ordinated in all the analyses. The other data sets were fairly coherent. When only biological data sets were ordinated, the diatoms and cladocerans showed rather different patterns. It seems that the cladocerans are best correlated with water chemistry, both according to weights in the joint analysis, and according to correlation between the axes from the biological data sets and the chemical variables.

Verifying the source of the possible contaminant exposure is critical to addressing the AOC designation. We used telemetry tracking (n = 49 fish) to test the hypothesis that adult bullheads captured within the bay during spawning season do not exit the bay during the post-spawning summer and fall months. We analyzed genetic variation at 15 microsatellite loci for 112 adult fish from 5 locations, 4 inside the bay and I outside, in order to test for possible differences. Data from fixed-station receivers suggested fish did not leave Presque Isle Bay during the study period. Predicted locations outside Presque Isle Bay were only 0.1% of all predicted locations and were below the 0.2% error rate based on known manual relocations. However, there was evidence for movement within Presque Isle Bay. Most movement was between Misery Bay or Lagoons and the open bay area. Whereas telemetry results showed tendency for adult site fidelity, genetic results showed no differences among locations, indicating that there is a single panmictic population. Our telemetry data suggest that brown bullheads are likely a useful indicator species for environmental conditions in Presque Isle Bay, since adults likely are retained in the system.

Future Riverine Inorganic Nitrogen Load to the Baltic Sea From Sweden: An Ensemble Approach to Assessing Climate Change Effects	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												The dramatic increase of bioreactive nitrogen entering the Earth's ecosystems continues to attract growing attention. Increasingly large quantities of inorganic nitrogen are flushed from land to water, accelerating freshwater, and marine eutrophication. Multiple, interacting, and potentially countervailing drivers control the future hydrologic export of inorganic nitrogen. In this paper, we attempt to resolve these land-water interactions across boreal/hemiboreal Sweden in the face of a changing climate with help of a versatile modeling framework to maximize the information value of existing measurement time series. We combined 6,962 spatially distributed water chemistry observations spread over 31years with daily streamflow and air temperature records. An ensemble of climate model projections, hydrological simulations, and several parameter parsimonious regression models was employed to project future riverine inorganic nitrogen dynamics across Sweden. The median predicted increase in total inorganic nitrogen export from Sweden (2061-2090) due to climate change was 14% (interquartile range 0-29%), based on the ensemble of 7,500 different predictions for each study site. The overall export as well as the seasonal pattern of inorganic nitrogen loads in a future climate are mostly influenced by longer growing seasons and more winter flow, which offset the expected decline in spring flood. The predicted increase in inorganic nitrogen loading due to climate change means that the political efforts for reducing anthropogenic nitrogen inputs need to be increased if ambitions for reducing the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea are to be achieved.

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The interpretation of environmental effect on phytoplankton growth is not straightforward, especially in ecosystems with high variation in hydrological conditions due to confounding variables. Lake Poyang is characterized by high fluctuation of water level (WL) due to its free connection to the Yangtze River. High frequency (weekly) and long-term (2009-2018) samplings were conducted in Lake Poyang resulting in 170 samples. Our study aimed to illustrate that whether the key factors determining phytoplankton growth change with WL. Furthermore, the impact of WL on phytoplankton was also detected. Six periods were classified in our study, i.e., dry season, raising period (I and II), wet season, and falling period (I and II) based on WL variation. Environmental characteristics were significantly (P < 0.01) different among these periods with the exception of orthophosphate. Based on the whole data set, water temperature (WT) was the critical parameter affecting phytoplankton growth. However, according to time series analysis, the key factors varied in different periods. Underwater light condition, which was represented by Secchi depth (SD), was the most critical factor controlling phytoplankton growth, especially in the periods with relatively high WL and WT (i.e., raising period II, wet season, and falling period I). The role of water temperature on phytoplankton was more evident in falling periods. In dry season with the lowest WL, total phosphorus limited phytoplankton growth. Regarding WL, its impact on phytoplankton was mainly through change in environmental parameters, such as water flow velocity, water transparency, and nutrients. Furthermore, time series analysis well simulated phytoplankton chlorophyll a in Lake Poyang, with larger R-adj(2) (except raising period II and falling period II) and lower model error in all 6 periods. Our results revealed that the critical factors controlling phytoplankton growth were various with WL. Additionally, time series analysis will benefit local water resource management.					; Jiacong, Huang/F-9875-2013; Wu, Zhaoshi/ABG-7886-2021; 陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023	Cai, Yongjiu/0000-0002-3560-3798; Huang, Jiacong/0000-0003-4296-5823													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2019	107								105675	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105675													WOS:000490757500114

Although the dataset is highly inhomogeneous and year-to-year variability is also quite large, there is a statistically significant indication that the end of the ice season (as defined by the time at which ice departs from the observer stations in spring) has come increasingly early at a number of locations. The earlier ice departure is reflected in a somewhat earlier spring runoff through the St. Lawrence River over the same time period and correlates with increases in springtime temperatures at stations in the region. This example of a trend toward warmer, earlier springs in the upper Midwest is consistent with results from a number of other regional datasets. Because the ice observations began in the mid-1950s, other analyses, including comparisons with modern satellite datasets, could provide a useful tool for monitoring future climate change.																			0003-0007					MAY	1992	73	5					577	584		10.1175/1520-0477(1992)073<0577:RGLIT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477(1992)073<0577:RGLIT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1992HU54500001

Genetic Pedigree Reconstruction Detects Bias in Largemouth Bass Nest Sampling Procedures	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Fish recruitment can be influenced by the direct effects of and interactions among biological, environmental, and anthropogenic factors. However, interpretation of data that quantify associations between recruitment during early ontogenetic stages and potential underlying causal factors at whole-population scales can be confounded by the uncertainties associated with data collection. For nest-building species, biases may result from observational methods used to locate nests and determine nest-specific offspring survival. Such biases may hinder efforts to associate estimates of individual reproductive success or failure with recruitment variation at the population level. During spring 2010, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides nests in a 24-ha Michigan lake were surveyed using established observational methods, and genetic data and pedigree reconstruction were used to assess the reliability of those methods. We georeferenced observed nests, visually assessed whether eggs from nests survived to the swim-up fry stage, and collected offspring from each observed nest for multilocus genotyping to characterize nest-specific pedigrees. In late summer, we captured age-0 Largemouth Bass for genotyping and used pedigree reconstruction to determine their nests of origin. Comparisons of genetic pedigree and observational data revealed that genetic methods offered a novel, powerful way of evaluating nest observation procedures. We estimated that 50% of the nests that contributed age-0 recruits were not observed by field crews; 40% of observed nests that produced late-summer age-0 Largemouth Bass (as determined based on genetic data) were not observed to produce swim-up fry during the nesting period (i.e., were misclassified as having failed). Our analyses suggest that nesting observations underestimate nest abundance and incorrectly classify some nests as having failed to produce swim-up fry, thus potentially creating a biased representation of nest-specific contributions to recruitment.

However, it only proliferates recurrently in some localities. The North Lake of Tunis is one of the affected areas in the southwestern part of the Mediterranean Sea. This site is one of the most productive aquatic Tunisian areas (Recreational Fisheries and shellfish collecting). In the south part of this area of study, recurrent C. monotis proliferation (5 x10(5) cells per liter) took place in late spring and early summer of 2006. During this proliferation, the spatial distribution of C. monotis species, phytoplankton community, and abiotic factors were studied. The composition of the phytoplankton community exhibited a clear dominance of dinoflagellates over other genera. We suggest that proliferation development of C. monotis was linked to climatic conditions, water temperature (r = 0.24, p < 0.05) and high concentrations of nitrogenous nutrients, essentially NH4 (+) (r = 0.18, p < 0.05) and NO3 (-aEuro parts per thousand) (r = 0.21, p < 0.05).																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2010	164	1-4					423	433		10.1007/s10661-009-0903-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0903-z								19404758					WOS:000276655700035

Physical Circulation in the Coastal Zone of a Large Lake Controls the Benthic Biological Distribution	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Gradients of conductivity and major ions in the coastal zone of the eastern Georgian Bay of Lake Huron appear to limit the spatial distribution of invasive dreissenid mussels. Rivers flowing into Georgian Bay from the Canadian Shield have relatively low conductivity compared to the main body of Lake Huron, which creates a gradient of solutes near the river mouths. Field observations show a strong positive correlation between conductivity and calcium concentration. Thus, we use conductivity to infer the calcium concentrations required for the successful growth of dreissenid mussels. Most dreissenid mussels were observed in regions where specific conductivities were greater than 140 mu S/cm. Field observations were used to examine how the calcium poor river water mixes within the coastal zone, resulting in solute gradients that determine mussel distribution. When river flows are low in late summer, there is only a weak solute gradient across the coastal zone, implying an intrusion of open bay waters into the shallow embayments, that favor the growth of dreissenid mussels. In contrast, during spring when river flows are as much as 10 times higher, there is a strong solute gradient that extends further into the lake, and the low calcium appears to limit the growth of dreissenid mussels. Thus, the seasonal character of solute gradients helps describe the spatial distribution of dreissenid mussels and explains the localized absence of a species that is otherwise prevalent in much of the Laurentian Great Lakes.

FALSE SPRING IN THE SOUTHEASTERN EUROPEAN RUSSIA AND ANOMALIES OF THE PHENOLOGY OF SPAWING MIGRATIONS OF THE PALLAS' SPADEFOOT TOAD Pelobates vespertinus (PELOBATIDAE, AMPHIBIA)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												In March 2020, an anomalously early start of the spawning migrations of Pelobates vespertinus was established in the Medveditsa River valley. Males of this species, emerging from a state of hibernation, were observed in the shallow waters of the lake Troynoye on March 13, one month ahead of the long-term mean date over the past 30 years and almost two weeks before the earliest recorded date. From 1892 to 1990 the phenological scenario of a false spring was realized six times only, while seven times - over the past 30 years (1991 - 2020). A second fea-ture of the development of spring processes by the type of false spring in 1990 - 2020 is repeated recurrence of re-turn cooling. The emergence of discreteness (discontinuity) of the spawning migration period against the back-ground of early development of spring processes and repeated periods of return cold is a relatively new feature of the phenology of anuran amphibians. The cumulative proportion of P. vespertinus males arriving at their spawning biotopes from the first to the fifth day from the date of the start of spawning migrations of the species increases on mean (median) from 4 to 38% of the total number of mature males. In 2014, an abrupt change in the proportion of males who came to spawning biotopes during the first five days was found: in 2009 - 2013 is was less than a quar-ter of the total number of males (15 - 23%), and in 2014 - 2017 it was half or more (43 - 70%). Consequences of such phenological abnormalities can become an additional factor in reducing the reproductive success of P. vespertinus and degradation of their local populations. In addition, the abnormal development of spring processes requires correction of census technique and analysis of the sex structure of P. vespertinus populations.

Two different geothermal waters, both of Na-HCO3 type have been recognized. The first, discharged by the boiling springs located along the western shores of the lake, comes from a shallow steam-heated thermal aquifer. Its temperature is close to 100-degrees-C, as indicated by chalcedony solubility, while the chloride content of these waters is slightly higher than 200 mg L-1. The second, recognizable in the southernmost boiling springs, is representative of a deeper and hotter geothermal reservoir. The occurrence of mixing and boiling processes complicates the interpretation of geochemical data. Nevertheless, a chloride content of about 660 mg L-1, an equilibrium temperature close to 170-degrees-C and a high carbon dioxide partial pressure, at least 10-20 bar, have been estimated for the deep geothermal reservoir.																			0377-0273					APR 30	1992	50	3					231	246		10.1016/0377-0273(92)90095-U	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(92)90095-U													WOS:A1992HY65900002

Moored observations of turbulent mixing events in deep Lake Garda, Italy	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Deep water circulation and mixing processes are responsible for the transport of matter, nutrients and pollutants in deep lakes. Nevertheless, detailed continuous observations are rarely available. To overcome some of these deficiencies and with the aim of improving our understanding of deep mixing processes, a dedicated yearlong mooring comprising 100 high-resolution temperature sensors and a single current meter were located in the deeper half of the 344 m deepest point of the subalpine Lake Garda, Italy. The observations show peaks and calms of turbulent exchange, besides ubiquitous internal wave activity. In late winter, northerly winds activate episodic deep convective overturning, the dense water being subsequently advected along the lake-floor. Besides deep convection, such winds also set-up seiches and inertial waves that are associated with about 100 times larger turbulence dissipation rates than that by semidiurnal internal wave breaking observed in summer. In the lower 60 m above the lake-floor, however, the average turbulence dissipation rate is approximately constant in value year-around, being about 10 times larger than open-ocean values, except during deep convection episodes.					; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/AAJ-7627-2021; Toffolon, Marco/D-4845-2011; Dijkstra, Henk/H-2559-2016; Amadori, Marina/HZI-1527-2023	Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/0000-0003-1796-7624; Amadori, Marina/0000-0001-8810-8478; Toffolon, Marco/0000-0001-6825-7070; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2021	80	1							1983	10.4081/jlimnol.2020.1983	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2020.1983													WOS:000649429800006

Spring coherence in dissolved organic carbon export dominates total coherence in Boreal Shield forested catchments	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The wide range of forested landscapes in boreal environments store and cycle substantial amounts of carbon, although the capacity of these systems to act as either a carbon sink or source is uncertain under a changing climate. While there are clear reports of regional-scale increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in streams and lakes, there remains substantial watershed-scale variability in these patterns. Coherence is a framework for examining if variables of interest within adjacent spatial units change synchronously or asynchronously through time and has been widely applied in the context of lentic hydrochemistry, and which can shed light on the relative importance of regional- vs. local-scale controls. The objective of this research was to quantify coherence in discharge, DOC concentrations, and DOC loads in forested boreal watersheds, and to what extent coherence varied by season. Coherence was assessed using data from three long-term ecological research sites spanning boreal forest environments (IISD-Experimental Lakes Area, Turkey Lakes Watershed Study, and Dorset Environmental Science Centre) that included 29 829 DOC measurements across 739 stream-years, examining correlation between stream-pairs within each site, but not between sites. Seasonal coherence in DOC export was consistent across the three sites; coherence was significantly greater in spring than all other seasons, and was strongly related to discharge coherence. Currently, the season with the greatest loads (spring) is also the most coherent season, suggesting that annual between-stream coherence may be reduced if spring becomes proportionally less important in hydrologic budgets under a changing climate. This research aids in determining which factors contribute to synchronous watershed behaviour, and which factors may contribute to the timing and extent of individual watershed-scale deviations from landscape-level patterns.					; Casson, Nora/P-1915-2018; Higgins, Scott/F-5700-2016	Emilson, Erik/0000-0002-1516-9728; 													1748-9326					JAN 1	2022	17	1							014048	10.1088/1748-9326/ac462f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac462f													WOS:000740837700001

The diverse faunal assemblages include the horse as the dominant species, which yielded 70 and 90 % of the weight of acquired animals, respectively. Due to their behavioural adaptation as animals with long fleeing distances, horses cannot be hunted close to an actively occupied site. Horse hunts must therefore have taken place at a relatively long distance from base camps and, in addition, could be carried out only from some kind of ambush or hunting hide. Since the weight of a horse precludes transport as a whole, and the skeletal representation indicates that entire horses were present on the site, the most plausible conclusion is that camps were relocated to a successful horse-hunting site. While consuming the horses and possibly preparing them for later use, other activities were performed, including the hunting of other, smaller species. After a mean duration of from one to a few weeks, the camp was relocated to a subsequent horse-hunting site, at a distance of some kilometres. The number of burning cycles in the hearths as well as the amount and types of lithic material corroborate these conclusions. Since horse-hunting sites need to meet specific, strategic characteristics, the number of reoccupations of the main horizons (6 for Champreveyres, 20 for Monruz) is easily explicable.																			0249-7638	1760-7361					2006	103	4					741	752		10.3406/bspf.2006.13503	http://dx.doi.org/10.3406/bspf.2006.13503													WOS:000455168200007

Length variation over a one-year period in specimens of the golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Mytilidae) from Veludo Beach, Guaiba Lake, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ZOOLOGIA												The individual size of Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker,1857) was evaluated twice a month, for a year, based on samples from Veludo Beach (30 degrees 12'35"S, 51 degrees 11'68"W) in Guaiba Lake, southern Porto Alegre, Brazil. Physical and chemical data on water quality, such as temperature, transparency, depth, pH, dissolved oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen, chlorophyll "a", and conductivity were also recorded. Adult samples were collected from underwater "sarandi" branches, Cephalanthus glabratus (Spreng) K. Schum (Rubiaceae), an aquatic macrophyte available at each site. Adults placed on artificial substrates were also checked every six months. Data were analyzed by applying multivariate statistics techniques related to the physical and chemical variables of the water and the density of individuals to estimate the patterns of the individual growth over the year. The adults were separated into three groups according to length classes: G1, G2 and G3 (groups I through 3). These three groups are related to the differences in behavior, namely, the ability of locomotion and fixation capacity. Individuals from Group I (5 to 7 mm in length) were the most abundant and were present in all the sampled months. Adults from artificial substrates were shown to display significant differences in seasonal growth and faster growth during spring and summer months.																			0101-8175					SEP	2008	25	3					389	396																WOS:000260040800003
J	Zhang, YL; Qin, BQ				Zhang, Yun L.; Qin, Bo Q.			Variations in spectral slope in lake taihu, a large subtropical shallow lake in China	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Spectral slope (S), describing the exponential decrease of the absorption spectrum over a Given wavelength range, is an important parameter in the study of of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) d dynamics, and also an essential input parameter in remote sensing models. Furthermore, S is often used as a proxy for CDOM composition, including the ratio of fulvic to humic acids and molecular weight. The relative broad range in S values reported in the literature can be explained by the different spectral ranges and fitting methods used. A single exponential model is used to fit the S values for 17 investigations involving 458 samples in Lake Taihu from January to October in 2004. The average S value was 15.18 +/- 1.39 mu m(-1) for the range of 280-500 nm, which fell within the range reported in the literature. The frequency distribution of S value basically obeyed a normal distribution. Significant differences in S values between summer and other seasons showed that phytoplankton degradation was one of the important sources of CDOM in summer, whereas CDOM mainly came from the river input in other seasons. Furthermore, the estimated S value decreased with increasing wavelength range used in regression. The maxinum and minimum values derived from the regression were 17.89 +/- 1.25 mu m(-1) and 13.62 +/- 2.11 mu m(-1) for the wavelength ranges of 280-380 nm and 400-500 nm, respectively, a decrease of 23.9%. S values significantly decreased with the increase of CDOM absorption coefficients. CDOM absorption coefficients could be more appropriately estimated from exponential model introducing the variation of S with absorption coefficients, making them useful for a remote sensing bio-optical model of Lake Taihu. DOC-specific absorption coefficient a*(lambda) and the parameter M describing molecular size of the humic molecules could also be used as a proxy for the sources and types of CDOM. A general relationship was found between S and a*(lambda), and M values. S increased with the decrease of DOC-specific absorption coefficient and the increase of Al corresponding to the decrease of molecular weight.

The origins of the Qarhan brines, whether from migration of Qaidam mega-paleolakes, paleoriver capture, or mixing of modern river water and Ca-Cl spring water, are controversial. Details about the origin (hydrothermal, diagenetic or both) of the Ca-Cl inflow waters entering QSL in the QB are unclear. Here we show from the strontium (Sr) isotope ratios of river waters, intercrystalline brines, spring waters, halite, gypsum, and Corbicula shells from Qarhan playa, that Sr-87/Sr-86 increases from Bieletan (western QSL) to Huobuxun (eastern QSL). This trend verifies that river water-spring water mixing has been operating at QSL for the past 50,000 years. Contributions of Ca-Cl inflow waters to the QB have profoundly influenced the brine evolution and mineralogy of salt deposits. Mixing between low Sr2+ concentration, low Sr-87/Sr-86 value of river waters and high Sr2+ concentration, high Sr-87/Sr-86 value of Ca-Cl spring inflow waters has produced various intercrystalline brines and salt deposits at QSL. Ca-Cl inflow waters and brines are enriched in Sr2+ and Ca2+ and depleted in Mg2+ and SO42-. These characteristics suggest brine-sedimentary rock (silicate) interactions at burial diagenetic or hydrothermal conditions. Ca-Cl inflow waters and brines have a similar Sr isotopic range as oilfield brines and celestite deposits in the QB, which also suggests a diagenetic-hydrothermal origin. Ca-Cl brines discharge as springs or seeps along fault zones in the QB. They are interpreted to reach the surface of the northern margin of Qarhan playa by topographically driven circulation.					; Qin, Zhanjie/AAE-3093-2019	qin, zhan jie/0000-0001-8136-8066; 													0009-2541	1878-5999				OCT 10	2018	497						128	145		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.09.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.09.001													WOS:000445186400011

Part 2: European part of the Russian breeding range	POLAR BIOLOGY												Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) breed around lakes in tundra vegetation and spend their winter at sea. Their most important wintering site in Europe is the Baltic Sea, and most of the birds wintering there breed in northern Russia. In light of recent population declines, particularly of the Baltic Sea wintering population, it is important to gather all available information for this species to better understand their life history, and to pinpoint the primary threats leading to their decline. Because non-English literature is often neglected, we compiled a review of the information collected in 101 Russian scientific articles published between 1895 and 2017 relevant to Long-tailed Ducks inhabiting the European part of Russia (from Pskov Lake to Yugor Peninsula). We focused on their distribution, breeding densities as well as breeding and feeding biology. The data overall show a similar breeding biology and timing compared to the Asian part of the breeding range. However, due to limitations of the geographical and temporal scope of the reviewed studies, recent trends cannot be detected. Therefore, comprehensive studies are required to understand the contribution of changes in the breeding grounds to population declines observed in the wintering grounds. The data summarized here can provide a basis for such studies, including repeat surveys that will help to understand population trends.					; Quillfeldt, Petra/A-9549-2009; Glazov, Petr/AAE-4780-2019; Pollet, Ingrid/O-5031-2019; Loshchagina, Julia/P-7648-2015	Glazov, Petr/0000-0003-3462-7031; Quillfeldt, Petra/0000-0002-4450-8688; Vardeh, Sandra/0000-0003-1444-6030; Loshchagina, Julia/0000-0002-8662-0723; Pollet, Ingrid/0000-0001-7207-8294													0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	2019	42	12					2277	2297		10.1007/s00300-019-02595-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-019-02595-0		NOV 2019											WOS:000495335800001

Co-occurrence Networks Among Bacteria and Microbial Eukaryotes of Lake Baikal During a Spring Phytoplankton Bloom	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The pelagic zone of Lake Baikal is an ecological niche where phytoplankton bloom causes increasing microbial abundance in spring which plays a key role in carbon turnover in the freshwater lake. Co-occurrence patterns revealed among different microbes can be applied to predict interactions between the microbes and environmental conditions in the ecosystem. We used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes to study bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities and their co-occurrence patterns at the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal during a spring phytoplankton bloom. We found that microbes within one domain mostly correlated positively with each other and are highly interconnected. The highly connected taxa in co-occurrence networks were operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, and autotrophic and unclassified Eukaryota which might be analogous to microbial keystone taxa.

J	CHROST, RJ				CHROST, RJ			CHARACTERIZATION AND SIGNIFICANCE OF BETA-GLUCOSIDASE ACTIVITY IN LAKE WATER	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Kinetics of .beta.-glucosidase activity (.beta.GlcA) and bacterial activity (glucose uptake, thymidine incorporation) and cell numbers were measured in the euphotic zone and in the water column of Plu.beta.see during spring phytoplankton bloom development and after its breakdown. Heterotrophic bacteria were the major producers of the enzyme. Activity of free .beta.-glucosidase, unassociated with microbial cells, was negligible. .beta.GlcA displayed a distinct temporal and spatial distribution pattern in lake water. .beta.ClcA was low when algal populations grew actively, but during the algal bloom breakdown .beta.GlcA increased rapidly. The increase in .beta.GlcA was proportional to the abundance of bacteria and to their heterotrophic uptake of glucose, as well as to bacterial production, measured by the thymidine incorporation method. In contrast with its response to pH, .beta.-glucosidase exhibited no obvious adaptation to ambient temperature of lake water. .beta.GlcA produced by aquatic bacteria was under control of a repression-induction mechanism, and synthesis was derepressed when the level of directly assimilable hexoses (glucose or galactose) fell below a critical level. The tight relationship between the rates of .beta.GlcA and glucose uptake indicated the existence of a specific, coupled hydrolysis-uptake system in lacustrine bacteria.

Seasonal periodicity of growth and composition in valves of Diplodon chilensis patagonicus (d'Orbigny, 1835)	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES												Freshwater mussels of the genus Diplodon (Unionida) are common inhabitants of lakes and rivers in South America, and have slow growth and long life spans. We established the annual periodicity of incremental shell growth in Diplodon chilensis patagonicus (d'Orbigny, 1835) and calculated growth rates at different ages, using internal ring counting supported by dyeing methods and delta O-18 isotope analyses, in two Patagonian populations (Lago Steffen and its effluent Rio Manso Inferior, Argentina). Longevities of ca. 90 years (Lago Steffen) significantly extend the life spans reported in the past. Growth rates for old individuals (> 30 years) from both lake and river populations average 0.16 mm per year along the axis of minimal growth. We evaluated the seasonal periodicity of minor and trace elements (Mn, Mg, Sr, Ba, Na, S) in situ by Laser Ablation ICP-MS and Electron Probe Microanalyser analyses. Line-scans in a valve from Lago Steffen show that Mn, Sr and Ba are preferentially accumulated during the summer, while higher concentrations of Mg are found in the winter bands. Metal/Ca ratios may serve as long-term archives of environmental variables, e.g. metal concentrations in water, water temperature and primary productivity. Diplodon chilensis patagonicus valves exhibit excellent characteristics to construct an accurate chronological archive with time windows of up to around a century, resolving the environmental signal annually and even seasonally.

Occurrence and distribution of neonicotinoids and fiproles within groundwater in Minnesota: Effects of lithology, land use and geography	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Due to the widespread use of insecticides in agriculture and for urban pest control, there is the potential for contamination of groundwater systems. Five neonicotinoids, fipronil, and nine transformation products (desnitro-imidacloprid, imidacloprid olefin, imidacloprid urea, acetamiprid-n-desmethyl, n-desmethyl, thiacloprid amide, 6-chloronicotinic acid, fipronil desulfinyl, fipronil sulfide, and fipronil sulfone) were studied in samples from 15 springs and 75 unique wells from 13 counties over four years (2019-2022) in Minnesota. Up to 13 neonicotinoids and fiproles were identified in groundwater samples from springs and 10 from wells. Springs were particularly susceptible to contamination, with clothianidin found in 41 % of springs (maximum concentration: 200 ng/L) followed by thiamethoxam (31 %), imidacloprid (22 %), thiacloprid (19 %), and acetamiprid (12 %). Clothianidin was the most common analyte in well samples (13 %), followed by thiamethoxam (12 %), acetamiprid (14 %), imidacloprid (10 %), and thiacloprid (2 %). Hydrostratigraphy was an important factor in neonicotinoid detection with frequencies of detection highest in sandy or karst aquifers. Regional land use, especially the fraction of agricultural land, and imperviousness influenced observed concentrations within springsheds and well catchment areas. There were several significant correlations between neonicotinoid detections with geochemistry indicators including tritium/groundwater age, dissolved oxygen (DO), and total nitrate plus nitrite (total oxidized nitrogen).

J	Devetter, M; Seda, J				Devetter, M; Seda, J			Regulation of rotifer community by predation of Cyclops vicinus (Copepoda) in the Rimov Reservoir in spring	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The structuring role and predation im using in situ enclosure experiments in Rimov Reservoir during the spring of 2000. Seasonal changes in abundance and birth rates of the rotifer species Synchaeta lakowitziana, Polyarthra spp., Keratella cochlearis and Kellicottia longispina were related to predation pressure, i.e. selectivity and cropping rates of C. vicinus. All four rotifer species were found to be consumed by C. vicinus whose predation rates showed a marked succession through the spring period and corresponded to changes in the relative abundance of the pelagic species. The highest predation rates exhibited by C. vicinus were oil Synchaeta lakowitziana and Polyarthra spp., being 11.3 and 6.4 ind Cyclops(-1) day(-1) respectively. The activity of the predator switched among three types of preferred food during the spring period. The most preferred, Synchaeta, was replaced by Polyarthra after Synchaeta became extinct and these species were replaced by Keratella when both soft-bodied forms were not available in sufficient quantities. Loricated species (K. cochlearis and K. longispina) were consumed at a slower rate. We calculated the proportion of rotifer production cropped day(-1) in order to estimate the predation impact of C. vicinus, which ranged from 11.6 to more than 100% over time and rotifer species. This shows that relative predation impact can be high not only oil species most strongly selected, but also on species which are not selected.

(Chlamydomonadales, Chlorophyta) from the Cascade Mountains, USA	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Chlainomonas (Chlamydomonadales, Chlorophyta) is one of the four genera of snow algae known to produce annual pink or red blooms in alpine snow. No Chlainomonas species have been successfully cultured in the laboratory, but diverse cell types have been observed from many field-collected samples, from multiple species. The diversity of morphologies suggests these algae have complex life cycles with changes in ploidy. Over 7 years (2017-2023), we observed seasonal blooms dominated by a Chlainomonas species from late spring through the summer months on a snow-on-lake habitat in an alpine basin in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington, USA. The Bagley Lake Chlainomonas is distinct from previously reported species based on morphology and sequence data. We observed a similar collection of cell types observed in other Chlainomonas species, with the addition of swarming biflagellate cells that emerged from sporangia. We present a life cycle hypothesis for this species that links cell morphologies observed in the field to seasonally available habitat. The progression of cell types suggests cells are undergoing both meiosis and fertilization in the life cycle. Since the life cycle is the most fundamental biological feature of an organism, with direct consequences for evolutionary processes, it is critical to understand how snow algal life cycles will influence their responses to changes in their habitat driven by climate warming. For microbial taxa that live in extreme environments and are difficult to culture, temporal field studies, such as we report here, may be key to creating testable hypotheses for life cycles.					; Krueger-Hadfield, Stacy/AAT-4112-2021	Hamilton, Trinity/0000-0002-2282-4655; Krueger-Hadfield, Stacy/0000-0002-7324-7448; 													0022-3646	1529-8817				JUN	2024	60	3					724	740		10.1111/jpy.13454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.13454		MAY 2024						38698553					WOS:001216013500001

However, the biogeographic patterns of bacterioplankton communities in lakeshore zones and the mechanisms that driving them are poorly understood. We analyzed the 16 S rRNA gene sequences of particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) bacterioplankton communities in the lakeshore zones of 14 alpine lakes in two seasons on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to investigate the bacterial diversity, composition and assembly processes. Our results revealed that PA and FL bacterioplankton communities were driven by both seasonality and salinity in the lakeshores on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Compared to FL bacterioplankton, PA bacterioplankton communities were more susceptible to seasonality than spatial salinity. FL bacterioplankton communities were more salinity con-strained than the PA counterpart. Besides, the Stegen null model analyses have validated a quantitative bias on stochastic processes at different spatial scales. At a regional scale, stochasticity was the predominant assembly process in both PA and FL bacterioplankton. While at a subregional scale, dispersal limitation was the main contributor of stochastic processes for PA bacterioplankton in summer and heterogeneous selection was the dominant deterministic processes in winter, whereas the community assembly of FL bacterioplankton was more stochastic processes (i.e., dispersal limitation) dominated in the freshwater type but deterministic process (i.e., heterogeneous selection) increased with increasing salinity. Our study provides new insights into both significant spatiotemporal patterns and distinct assembly processes of PA and FL bacterioplankton in alpine lakeshores on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.					; Zhang, Weizhen/S-6558-2019	Zhang, Jia/0000-0001-8768-5281; Zhang, Weizhen/0000-0001-6432-5582													0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV	2022	214		1						113717	10.1016/j.envres.2022.113717	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.113717		JUL 2022						35760113					WOS:000838026400001
J	Kostecki, M				Kostecki, Maciej			A new antrhropogenic lake Kuznica Warezynska - thermal and oxygen conditions after 14 years of exploitation in terms of protection and restoration	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												The results of the first limnological studies of the Kuznica Warezynska anthropogenic reservoir, by flooding the sand mine excavation, in 2005, are presented. Measurements of water temperature and the concentration of oxygen dissolved in water were made every month, from April to December, every 1 meter deep from the surface to the bottom (22 m). Kuznica Warezynska anthropogenic lake was classified according to Olszewski and Patalas as dimictic, eumictic, stratified, stable, and extremely limnic. In terms of the share of the littoral zone in the total area, the reservoir is classified as grade II according to Dolgoff, where the pelagic zone is similar to the littoral zone. After 14 years of the reservoir's existence, during the summer stagnation period, the oxygen in the hypolimnion is completely depleted, from the 10th meter deep to the bottom, 22 m. The analysis of the vertical distribution of the regression coefficient for the relationship between water temperature and the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water indicates the influence of the oxygen-free groundwater supplying the reservoir as a factor that may, in addition to the decomposition of organic matter, initiate anaerobic processes in the bottom water layer of the reservoir. When circulation ceases, the bottom eruption of oxygen-depleted groundwater is, during the summer and winter stagnation, a factor that shapes the anaerobic environment in the bottom layers of water early, initiating the internal enrichment process. Hydrological conditions, moiphometiy and thermal-oxygen relations of the Kuznica Warezynska reservoir are favorable for undertaking technical measures - changing the method of draining water from the surface to the bottom - to protect the quality of water resources.

J	Lu, XD; Nicol, GW; Neufeld, JD				Lu, Xinda; Nicol, Graeme W.; Neufeld, Josh D.			Differential responses of soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria to temperature and depth under two different land uses	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Although soil nitrification has been studied intensively, with an effort to elucidate the relative contributions of both ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), their relative contributions to N2O production remain unclear. Understanding the temperature- and depth-dependent activities of AOA and AOB, as well as production of N2O, is of great importance for predicting their responses to climate change. This work applied the recently discovered AOB inhibitor, octyne, to soil microcosms incubated at different temperatures (20, 30, 40 degrees C) in order to differentiate ammonia-oxidation potential and N2O production by AOA and AOB, in soils from different land uses and depth. Our results showed that surface soils (0-15 cm) possessed significantly greater ammonia oxidation potential than subsurface soils (30-45 cm) at all temperatures tested, and that AOA-associated nitrification potential dominated at higher temperatures for both summer and autumn soils. The accumulation of N2O was only detected in surface agricultural soil at 30 degrees C and positively correlated with nitrite accumulation within the incubation period. The detected N2O production, along with most nitrification potential activity, were attributed to AOB, implicating AOB as major producers of this greenhouse gas in the tested agricultural soil. Higher ammonia-oxidation activity and N2O production within surface agricultural soil reinforces the importance of agricultural surface soils as sources of nitrification and N2O production, with potential implications for land management practices and responses to climate change.					; Lu, Xinda/AAB-7955-2019	Nicol, Graeme/0000-0002-3876-022X; Lu, Xinda/0000-0003-4914-6003; 													0038-0717					MAY	2018	120						272	282		10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.02.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.02.017													WOS:000430031900027
J	Keleher, MJ; Rader, RB				Keleher, Mary Jane; Rader, Russell B.			Dispersal limitations and history explain community composition of metaphyton in desert springs of the Bonneville Basin, Utah: A multiscale analysis	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined patterns of metaphyton community composition from 150 sites in spring wetlands of the Bonneville Basin across three spatial scales: valleys, wetlands nested in valleys, and habitat types nested in wetlands (springs, channels, and marshes) to determine which scale(s) accounted for the greatest variation in metaphyton community composition. We expected local processes at the habitat scale, especially physicochemical differences between springs and marshes, to account for the majority of variation in local community composition but found that the valley scale accounted for 6.3 times more variation than the habitat scale. We suggest the importance of factors that operate at the valley scale, such as historical events (i. e., the draining of ancient Lake Bonneville) and island effects (dispersal limitations) in determining metaphyton community composition. We emphasize that dispersal limitations among valleys may have an important effect on metaphyton community composition despite the prevailing opinion that algae have exceptional powers of dispersal attributed to the worldwide distribution of some species. We base this assertion on three observations: first, the absence of species in isolated springs compared to springs associated with large complexes; second, 67% of the taxa in the Bonneville Basin occurred in only three or fewer sites; and third, the average Bray-Curtis similarity between all sites based on all taxa (242) was only 14.1%, which is an unlikely low value if metaphyton taxa can freely disperse between sites. Future studies should incorporate the potential importance of history and dispersal limitations as researchers continue to explore patterns of algal community composition across multiple scales.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2008	53	4					1604	1613		10.4319/lo.2008.53.4.1604	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2008.53.4.1604													WOS:000257773700036

'Chardonnay' and 'Riesling'	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												In recent years, new vineyards have been established in southwestern Ontario. The open water of Lake Erie provides some winter protection for Vitis hybrids and winter-hardy Vitis vinifera L. cultivars in this area. However, winter damage is possible when vines are grown distant from the open water or when lakes are frozen. To better understand the risks to winter survival, the dormancy and chilling phenology were studied over three winters from 2013 -2016. Ten dormant canes of two V. vinifera cultivars, 'Chardonnay' and 'Riesling', were collected weekly from 1 September until 30 March from the mature vines in a commercial vineyard located at St. Williams (Ontario). The canes defoliated in early October, and the endodormancy was completed by the end of December. The cumulative chilling hours (0 -7.2 degrees C) from defoliation until the completion of endodormancy were averaged 606 hours for 'Chardonnay' and 665 hours for 'Riesling'. 'Chardonnay' buds were slightly less hardy than 'Riesling' to cold temperatures, with a threshold of about -24 degrees C for 'Chardonnay' and -25 degrees C for 'Riesling'. Most primary buds of both cultivars died after 16 February 2015, and more than half died after 12 February 2014, due to severe low temperatures of -33.1 and -26 degrees C, respectively.																			0008-4220	1918-1833				DEC	2021	101	6			SI		871	885		10.1139/cjps-2020-0332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2020-0332													WOS:000727699400006

Understanding the long-term vulnerability of Mediterranean vegetation to climate change is crucial for conservation and management purposes. Studies on past changes of forest communities in response to climate change at ecologically meaningful resolutions (i.e., decadal time scales) are therefore essential, but still very rare. The Holocene thermal maximum (HTM; ca. 10,000-5,000 cal years before the present (BP)) may be used to study species and community responses to warmer conditions than during recent decades. We performed highresolution multiproxy palaeoecological analyses on sediments from crater Lake Mezzano in central Italy to reconstruct vegetation, diversity, and fire dynamics between 8,450 and 7,050 cal years BP. Ordination, crosscorrelation, and species-response analyses were used to investigate the response of Mediterranean forest communities to HTM climate warming, human impact, and fire. Vegetational changes prior to 7,450 cal years BP were driven by climate. Fagus sylvatica spread into mixed deciduous oak forests during the Early Holocene in response to declining seasonality (cooler summers and warmer winters). Subsequently, Fagus sylvatica declined and evergreen Quercus ilex expanded after 8,200 cal years BP when the climate became warmer. Although reduced, Fagus sylvatica remained important together with deciduous oaks. The co-existence of Fagus sylvatica and evergreen Quercus forests is extremely rare today. Human impact significantly affected forest vegetation after 7,450 cal years BP, when Neolithic agricultural activities became important, ultimately extirpating these special communities but fostering the overall biodiversity. However, their past occurrence in several central Italian calderas during the HTM suggests that these environments provided habitats that permitted the thriving of cooltemperate forests of Fagus sylvatica under mesomediterranean conditions, with summers ca. 1-2 degrees C warmer than today. Cool and moist calderas may thus become increasingly important for maintaining Mediterranean mesophilous forest species under global warming conditions.
